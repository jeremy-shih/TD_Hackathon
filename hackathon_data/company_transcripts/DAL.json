My name is Jay, and I will be your coordinator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn this call over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Jay. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our March quarter call. Here in Atlanta today are Richard Anderson, Delta's CEO; our President, Ed Bastian; and our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Jacobson. We also have the entire leadership team here in the room for the Q&A session. Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and cash flow. [Operator Instructions]","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted, and you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at delta.com.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Richard.","Richard H. Anderson","Thanks, Jill. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us. We are pleased this morning to report a March quarter profit of $85 million. This is Delta's first March quarter profit since 2000 and tangible proof that we are successfully changing the global airline business model at Delta.","Our earnings increased by $124 million over last year, and we had 1.4 points of margin expansion. We earned $0.10 per share, beating consensus of $0.06 per share. Our operational performance and customer service are outstanding. We know how important a first-rate operation is to our customers, and Delta runs the best all-around customer service operation in the global industry by a wide margin. We have been doing so for 2 years, and we will continue to do so because it is an important strategic advantage.","We ran a domestic on-time arrival rate of 86.2%, showed a 2% improvement in DOT baggage performance, a 99% completion factor with a lot of tough weather and reduced DOT customer complaints by 12%. In fact, February had the lowest number of DOT complaints in Delta's history going back to 1997 when the DOT first started collecting the data. I'd like to thank the Delta people worldwide for all their work that went into achieving this great performance.","Our results include $20 million in profit sharing expense for the quarter, and this marks the first time we have ever accrued profit sharing in the March quarter. We have consistently articulated our financial and operating strategy to our shareholders. It is important to note that Delta has also delivered year in, year out on our strategic commitments to make Delta the airline of choice for our shareholders.","Our financial and operating results this quarter confirmed that success. It is really important that as we look forward, you understand that Delta has significant and important opportunities ahead to continue producing expanding margins and growing cash flows. We have a great franchise and a great brand at Delta. Delta has a full plate of new initiatives and opportunities ahead to continue widening our competitive advantage and operating margins, whether it's through running the most reliable long-time operation with the best employees in the industry, delivering top-notch customer service, building our presence in New York with a profitable LaGuardia expansion, the Virgin Atlantic investment or our new JFK Terminal 4 which will open on May 24.","You should expect that we will continue gaining operating strength as we further improve the customer experience, go through a massive up-gauge of our domestic fleet, deploy a variety of new technologies and operate our Pacific franchise with full lie-flat seats in business class this summer.","Now let's move to the specifics of the quarter and our outlook. Looking ahead, I know the top-of-mind issue for many of you is the demand environment. After a strong January and February, we did see a drop in close-end bookings, as well as some softness in leisure demand midway through March. We approached the quarter with a yield bias at Delta, which, coupled with sequester tax increases and other global economic factors, affected demand. Against this backdrop, we currently expect unit revenues in the second quarter to be flat to down slightly, on system capacity, which will be flat to up 1%.","To address any capacity issues -- to address these issues in the short term, we have recalibrated our revenue management approach and are reviewing off peak capacity levels by day of week in our summer schedule. As you know, from our history, Delta is quick to manage capacity. We'll continue to watch the revenue environment as we move through the summer, and we are prepared to make necessary changes to our fall capacity levels in response to market conditions.","But it is quite important to point out that the dynamic between fuel and revenue has shifted over the past few years with capacity as the fulcrum. As the industry has consolidated, we have experienced a much tighter correlation between revenue and fuel. For the past few years, this has manifested itself in strong revenue growth to cover rising fuel costs. This is an important correlation to our investors and is a significant change in the industry fundamentals. The same economic factors which cause passenger revenue softness also pushed down oil prices. The recent drop in Brent crude from $113 to $99 per barrel represents roughly a $1.3 billion annual cost reduction for Delta. We anticipate the lower fuel costs, combined with prudent capacity management, will more than offset any revenue softness. At Delta, we are focused on margin expansion.","Turning to the specifics. Our unit revenues in 1Q grew 4% on a 2.5% decrease in capacity. The investments we've made in operations, product and service, combined with our capacity discipline, have built a strong permanent revenue-producing foundation for Delta with the eighth consecutive quarter of a year-on-year revenue premium versus the industry's. On the cost side, we faced some pressures in the quarter which resulted in a 5% increase in our nonfuel unit cost, but this is substantially below our earlier guidance of a projected 6% to 8% increase. The significant improvement is the result of our structural cost initiatives taking hold as our operations and finance teams worked quite successfully to limit nonfuel unit cost growth in the quarter. With the domestic re-fleeting accelerating in the fall and other structural initiatives continuing to gain traction, we expect our nonfuel CASM growth to be 1% to 3% for the back half of the year.","On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter just under $11 billion; in adjusted net debt, a $6 billion reduction in 3 years, and we will hit our adjusted net debt target of $10 billion later this year. These debt reduction efforts lowered interest expense for the quarter by $50 million. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. With our growing cash flow and earnings, coupled with an improved balance sheet, we are preparing to move into the next phase of our capital deployment strategy. Our Board of Directors is guiding our long-term capital deployment strategy, and we expect to make an announcement in the month of May on our overall capital deployment strategy going forward in how we will return cash to shareholders. Please stay tuned.","We have a solid financial foundation, and combined with the momentum we've built from our initiatives and the favorable fuel and revenue dynamic, we are well positioned to generate improved earnings and margins for the June quarter, where we expect an operating margin of 9% to 11%. Given the strong March quarter actual performance and our June quarter operating margin forecast, we expect strong year-over-year profitability improvement for Delta in the full year of 2013.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.","Edward H. Bastian","Thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Earlier today, we announced a March quarter profit of $85 million, which was a $124 million improvement over the prior year, excluding special items. Our earnings-per-share of $0.10 is $0.04 per share better than consensus and represents our first March quarter profit in over a decade.","During the quarter, we had a net $78 million charge from special items, which included $24 million of mark-to-market gains in fuel hedges, offset by $102 million in facilities, fleet and other charges. I'd also like to thank the entire Delta team for their contributions towards generating a profitable March quarter, which was an important milepost in the improvements we're making to our business model. It's their dedication to this company and to our customers that makes these results possible.","Turning to the revenue line. During the March quarter, our topline revenues grew $87 million, a 1 point increase despite 2.5% decrease in capacity. We had strong demand in January and February with unit revenue growth above 5%. However, in mid-March, we did see a drop in close-end bookings, coupled with some softness in leisure demand. A number of factors are weighing on the economy to produce this result, not only the sequester, but also the increased payroll tax and continued economic sluggishness in some of our major markets. And because of the strong demand that we had seen at the start of the year, our revenue management systems were biased towards pushing for yield, which exacerbated this impact.","Now while the month did not play out as we had anticipated, we moved quickly to address the changing demand environment, and the impacts from our yield strategy should be largely isolated in March and April. We will keep a watchful eye on the revenue environment and capacity levels, but I would make a couple of important points for context. First, even with the lower-than-expected revenue, we posted the most profitable March month in Delta's history, generating a net profit of $300 million, a great result by any measure and an indication of the core strength of our business.","Second, while the revenue environment has shifted a bit from expectations, fuel prices, as Richard mentioned, have also been dropping for the last 60 days. And in our internal outlook for the June quarter, the change in fuel is more than offsetting the change in the revenue environment.","And lastly, as we look forward, it's important to remember we will face some tough comps as we have now completed 2 straight years of double-digit unit revenue growth, outperforming the industry by some large amounts during that period. Our forward-looking goal is to maintain those premiums we earned and seek to grow them.","Despite the softer close, our overall unit revenue performance for the quarter was strong. Passenger unit revenues grew 4.1% against a tough base period, with yield up 2% and load factor up 1.6 points from the prior year. We generated a revenue premium to the industry, our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement versus the A4A average. Our revenue outperformance was driven in large part by corporate revenues which increased 6% from the prior year, and we continue to grow our corporate revenue share.","Breaking revenue out by region, we had solid performance in our domestic markets, with unit revenues up 2.9% on a 1-point decrease in capacity. New York performed well, with JFK unit revenues up 7% on a 5% yield improvement. We are excited to open up our new Terminal 4 in JFK next month, which will give our customers in New York a world-class facility and further improve our competitiveness in the New York international and transcon markets. And we are also quite pleased with our expanded platform in LaGuardia, which produced a profit for the month of March and generated a 2-point unit revenue improvement for the quarter despite a 36% increase in capacity.","Capacity discipline in cooperation with our joint venture partners drove transatlantic unit revenues up 8% over the prior year despite continued economic uncertainty in the Eurozone. Our JFK to Europe unit revenues improved 16% with 7 markets gaining more than 20% due to improved corporate share. Our London unit revenues improved more than 20% as we continue to strengthen our competitive position. Our momentum in this market should continue to expand when we begin codesharing with Virgin Atlantic later this year, the first step in deepening our new partnership.","Turning to LatAm, our unit revenues improved 3% against a 2% growth in capacity driven by a 5-point increase in load factor. Capacity rationalization in Mexico and Central America drove unit revenue improvements in the high-single digits, while our Caribbean and South American markets experienced unit revenue expansion on par with the entity average against increased capacity.","And finally, in the Pacific, we were impacted by the weakened yen. While our overall net yen earnings were minimally affected as we are hedged at JPY 80 per $1, it did impact revenues with cost also benefiting and reduced the quarter's RASM by 60 basis points. Our yen hedged book runs through 2015 and is currently valued at $240 million. While this will offset the majority of the underlying exchange rate weakness, the yen weakness has also impacted demand in our Japan point of sale, particularly on the beach markets. The total impact of the yen devaluation on the quarter, both the exchange rate impact and demand driven, was about 1 point against system RASM. And as the yen has continued to devalue into April, we are looking at an overall system impact of up to 2 points for April and the rest of the second quarter. As a result, we are reviewing our Pacific capacity, particularly in the off peak periods and in the beach markets to determine possible reductions.","In summary, while we are seeing some pockets of weakness, such as the yen devaluation and the impact of the sequester, our summer bookings are in line with expectations and appear quite solid. Corporate demand continues to be strong, and we're making the necessary calibrations to our revenue management systems to address the current revenue environment. Due to the factors mentioned earlier, we expect unit revenues to be down 2% to 3% with the softness largely in the domestic and Japanese entities and then expect unit revenues to show modest year-over-year improvement in May and in June. And while our expectations per unit revenue performance are flat for the June quarter, we see our consolidated unit cost coming in over 1 point better than last year, leading to a solid June quarter operating margin of 9% to 11%, continuing the path of margin expansion from the March quarter. On capacity, we expect our June quarter system capacity to be flat to up 1 point, with domestic up 1% to 2% and our international capacity flat to down 1% versus the prior year.","Now I'll turn the call over to Paul.","Paul A. Jacobson","Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everybody. As you've heard in Richard and Ed's remarks this morning, we've been on a steady path of margin expansion at Delta. This has required some targeted investments on the cost and capital side to improve our operations and our product, but it has produced strong results.","As we mentioned at Investor Day, we're now at the point where we have a good line of sight on lower cost growth than we've seen over the past several years. Combined with the revenue-producing foundation we've built, this will be the driver for further margin expansion.","For the March quarter, our nonfuel unit costs increased 5% as the impact of wage increases and investments in operations and service were partially offset by benefits of our structural cost initiatives. This performance is better than what we had originally expected going into the quarter. While there was an element of timing that will impact the June quarter, we also saw better-than-expected underlying cost trends.","As we move into the June quarter, we expect these trends to continue, and we are forecasting our nonfuel CASM to increase 4.5% to 5.5%, which is better than prior expectations despite some of the timing shift from the March quarter. We continue to rally the organization around better cost control, and we are starting to see the results. Our cost growth should moderate substantially in the back half of the year, and we expect nonfuel CASM growth of 1% to 3% over that time. This puts our nonfuel CASM growth for the full year at 3% to 5%, a full point lower than our original guidance. We will see more substantial savings from our structural cost initiatives starting in the fall as the pace of our domestic re-fleeting accelerates.","We will begin taking delivery of 8 to 10 aircraft per month starting in September, which will allow us to retire nearly 40 older mainline aircraft, primarily 757s and the remaining DC-9s and over a 50-seat regional -- over 40 50-seat regional jets by the end of the year. These retirements will produce meaningful maintenance and fuel savings later this year. To the extent that we make changes to our fall capacity levels, we would have the opportunity to retire even more aircraft. We are also beginning to see the benefits of our maintenance redesign, which is allowing us to reduce our component and engine expense by pursuing market part-out opportunities. And we are on track to achieve $600 million in cumulative savings from our structural initiatives in 2013.","Turning now to fuel. Our fuel expense declined $78 million on lower fuel price and fuel consumption. Our all-in price per gallon was $3.24, which include $0.06 per gallon in settled hedge gains. We have structured our hedged books so that we have had almost full participation in the recent drop in fuel prices. As of Friday's forward curve, we are forecasting a June quarter fuel price of $2.95 to $3 per gallon, including hedge and refinery impact. The refinery produced a $22 million loss for the March quarter, which was slightly below our expectations. While operations have since recovered from the impact of unexpected supply disruptions in an outage in a gasoline production unit that slowed output during the quarter, we have since stabilized operations and expect a modest June quarter profit for China. We have also entered into agreements to begin receiving a regular supply of Bakken crude oil in the second half of the year, which will lower our crude input cost.","Shifting to cash flow, our strong cash generation over the past few years has allowed us to make the necessary investments in our business, while outflow is significantly improving our balance sheet. For the March quarter, as Richard mentioned, we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow and $457 million of free cash flow. Operating cash flow included $150 million of regularly scheduled pension funding. However, just after quarter end, we contributed $500 million to the pension plans, and we have now completed our required funding for 2013.","Capital expenditures for the March quarter were $650 million, which included $500 million in fleet investments and $47 million for 2 pairs of Heathrow slots. The aircraft CapEx includes 21 aircraft purchased off-lease during the quarter for approximately $120 million as part of our continuing debt reduction efforts. We ended the quarter with $11 billion of adjusted net debt, a $6 billion reduction over the last 3 years. In addition to reducing our balance sheet risk, our debt reduction efforts are producing significant P&L benefits. Our interest expense for the March quarter was $50 million lower than last year and nearly $100 million lower than the same period in 2010. We should again have strong cash generation in the June quarter and expect to produce $300 million to $400 million of free cash flow.","To conclude, this quarter's performance is evidence of the momentum that we've built at Delta, momentum that we expect will continue to drive profitability and margin improvements through 2013 and beyond. Let me echo Richard and Ed in congratulating our employees on a great quarter and thanking them for their dedication and determination as we build a better airline for our employees, customers and shareholders. We couldn't do it without them.","Jill?","Jill Greer","Thanks, Richard, Ed and Paul. Jay, we are now ready for questions from the analysts, so if you could review the process for asking a question. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions. Ed, you went through the impact of the yen weakness and the impact that it had on revenue. I realize it's early, but what's -- you have a sort of an early feel on the impact of sequestration and when I think about that, I sort of think about it in 2 parts, one is just the reduced amount of travel from government employees as they look to meet budget on one hand, and then maybe the impact of the delays that we started to see over the past couple days. Any thoughts on that?","Richard H. Anderson","Take the revenue. You can take the...","Edward H. Bastian","On the revenue front, Mike, there's no question we saw some impact from the sequester on our quarter and we're seeing some of it, obviously, in April as well. To put some parameters around it, the defense business within our corporate revenue base that which we have captured represents about 3% of our corporate revenues. And that for the month of -- the ticketed revenues over the last 4 weeks are down about 15% to 20% in that space. So it is having some impact on the revenue demand equation to the extent it has broader implications on corporate travel and high-yield travel in general. That's more difficult to quantify, but there's no doubt it's having some impact. On the operational side, Richard, do you want to take that?","Richard H. Anderson","Yes. On the operational front, Michael, the way we see that playing out is the real impact will be on regional operations. So, so far, our operations, we've been able to minimize the effect on our mainline operations. And if you think about how the air traffic control system works, the first flights that end up being thinned or delayed or canceled are going to be 50-seaters, 34-seaters and 44-seaters, and most all of that revenue is recaptured. I think Steve Gorman has the specifics from our operations so for -- so far. So Steve, you want to update?","Stephen E. Gorman","Sure, Richard. The first day -- a couple days in. First day, there was little to no impact. Yesterday, as Richard noted, in the Northeast, we did some thinning to avoid long delays, and we did thinning of the regional connection flights in the small airplanes, had about 90 cancellations proactively, and 99% of those customers were rebooked within a couple hours on the mainline flights. And we have experienced delays, particularly in the Northeast yesterday, mainly in the 60- to 90-minute range that we can manage and still keep the connections. And it did affect the Northeast by -- overall, the Northeast was impacted enough that the system, which normally would be around 85%, 86% on time, was more in the 77%, 78% on time.","Richard H. Anderson","But overall...","Stephen E. Gorman","But no cancellations mainline yesterday. We ran 100% completion factor yesterday.","Richard H. Anderson","Yes. So we think that in terms of the mainline operation, we'll be able to manage a bit -- just fine for our customers on the mainline. And the extent to which there will be some impact on ATC capacity, the impact will really be in the smaller airplanes, and that will all be re-accommodated on the mainline or our larger RJs.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, good. And then -- that's helpful. And then just my second question is, I guess, this is to Paul, just on the operating expense line. Two areas, the aircraft maintenance was down a decent amount to $70 million. I know you'd talked about the maintenance redesign and a part-out program, so presumably, that's driving a lot of that. But the contract carrier piece, that was up a little bit, and I know that there's some meaningful change going on with the contract carriers and the amount of shells that will be in that program. Is that number going to start trending down, maybe we see it in the second half of the year? When do we start seeing that?","Paul A. Jacobson","Well, I think the -- Mike, the first question, I think for maintenance expense, a lot of the year-over-year benefit or reduction in maintenance expense was driven by the MRO. As we've talked about, we have been focusing our MRO on improved margin expansion. That's resulted in less volume year-over-year. On the contract carrier line, that's really the effect of Comair. As we pull aircraft out of Comair and reallocate them to other carriers, they flow through that contract carrier line.","Edward H. Bastian","On the -- this is Ed, Mike. Just to add to Paul's comments on the contract carrier line, we also had some engine volume events in the current quarter. There's just timing issues or 26 more events which drove about $40 million of higher cost on the contract line on a year-over-year basis. So that's also impacting that line comparison. That's a timing issue. That's not indicative of a trend, though.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then that line will trend down through the year, is that right?","Richard H. Anderson","Yes, Mike, this is Richard. Yes, it will trend down through the year.","Operator","We'll go next to David Fintzen with Barclays Capital.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So a question on sort of capacity versus sort of fuel and the revenue correlation. I mean, I think, Richard, in your comments, you said capacity is the fulcrum. I'm curious sort of how -- the correlation of revenue and fuel kind of keeps staying higher or going higher and the lag time between sort of fuel moves and revenue moves starts to shorten, how does that sort of play into how you're tactically using capacity? I mean, does that start to let you reassess quicker in the sense if you start to get some disappointments in May in revenue where you can start to address the summer, does that start to sort of feed into how you're thinking about using capacity if that relationship between revenue and fuel is getting tighter?","Richard H. Anderson","The short answer is yes. The goal is to keep the correlation between revenue and fuel tight because that's really, as we said in our prepared remarks, both Ed and I, that's the real sea change in the industry. And we're able to adjust our capacity very quickly. And I think one of the keys in that is -- and this is another important innovation, I think, at Delta, is our pricing function, when we make pricing decisions across the airline, we have data in front of us on what the cost of goods sold is. And so we run our flight profitability system on a flat fuel book, and we're always tuning the revenue to be certain that we're capturing the fuel price. If we get to that point where we aren't, we can adjust very rapidly. That's the beauty of having a large number of owned airplanes that have no fixed costs, that are perfectly variable. And given the bid periods or 30 days on our crews, we have the ability to adjust capacity very quickly.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Are there day of op adjustments you can make in terms of moving sort of bigger shells around or taking advantage of some fleet flexibility to try to tweak the schedule as you're seeing sort of revenue in fuel play out in real time? Or does it really require sort of getting into the schedules a few months down the road?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, we actually do adjust day of departure. And actually, every day, we probably have somewhere around 30 to 40 adjustments up or down, which where we're actually matching capacity at the moment to demand. And we'll continue to invest in the systems and the knowhow we need to be able to do that. Most typically where that happens is in up-gauge. So we see that loads are up in a given market with close-in demand from where we were 30 or 45 days out on a schedule. And we're able, for instance, to take a 757 and up-gauge it to a 767 in a market. So we do that, but the most important lever is the 30- to 45-day-out lever where the real opportunity comes to be certain that we keep the correlation between revenue and fuel close.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Great. And just one quick one for Paul. Just in the cost guidance, is it fair to say there's no real sort of sequester operational impact baked into cost, I mean, you just sort of need to wait and see?","Paul A. Jacobson","That's right.","Operator","We'll go next to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First one for Glen. If I'd been in a, I guess, in a coma for the last 7 years and I woke up to find America West, Northwest and Continental to no longer be part of the landscape, I'd expect a truly firm pricing environment. Or put differently, Glen, if I had told you in 2005 that we'd see this much consolidation, I expect you would've been beaming in terms of what it implied for pricing. But we just don't seem to be seeing it. And other sectors that have witnessed this much consolidation have, but the airline industry just doesn't seem to be getting any better in extracting more revenue from the economy than it has in the past. Same as it ever was, same as it ever was. I can't get that song out of my head. Is there something fundamentally different about airlines as opposed to other areas of travel spend that explain why pricing isn't more inspiring?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Jamie, that was an asked and answered question it seems. I don't know. Are you a lawyer? Is that a leading question that you [indiscernible]? I think you may have just come out of a coma. Jamie, I think -- not to be the eternal optimist here, but I think all those things that you just mentioned, we have a lot of consolidation that has been announced but really hasn't happened yet. And so you still have quite a few pricing departments, you still have airlines looking to figure out what they're new combined network strategy is. And I think that's all frictional cost as we move through the actual consolidations, not the announcements of the consolidations but actually getting through the consolidations. And if you think about, for example, since we sit here in Atlanta and we look out at what air trend does a lot, that consolidation is taking a lot of time, and they're doing it very slowly and deliberately. But the big benefits that we see are still probably in the pipeline for us on that. And similarly, with American and US Air, that's another year, 1.5 years away. And lastly, United, still trying to get their act together after a very difficult merger. So I think all the pieces are in play, and I think we will see a much more robust environment in the future. But all of this dislocation, all of this rearrangement and all of the realignment of capacity and all of the -- that hasn't all taken place yet. We're in process there.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And the second, maybe for Richard, you can obviously manage around sequestration in the short run. It certainly helps when it's sunny out. But yours is an industry that's predicated on selling speed. And if you can't do that or can't do it as well as you once did, it is going to hurt demand longer term. So aside from just cutting 50-seaters and trying to up-gauge and I get all that, but are you looking at anything that would improve the overall speed proposition of air travel if sequestration and AT staffing are just sort of a new normal from here?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, I think we've shown a real operating strength at Delta. We operate, generally -- if you look at the global industry average, we generally operate about 8 points ahead of where the industry is in terms of performance, on-time performance and our completion factor is much higher. You should expect that we will continue to make those kinds of operating decisions to maintain that advantage versus the industry, both domestically and globally.","Operator","We'll go next to Glenn Engel with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Questions on the cost side, one, Paul mentioned that some of the first quarter costs will shift into the second. Can you talk of the categories and the amounts? Two, on the maintenance side, are we going to see a more flat pattern over the year and the past facilities have been front-end loaded? And three, the fuel cost assumption for the second quarter seems high given where spot is. Can you walk us through that number?","Paul A. Jacobson","Sure, Glenn. On the cost front, I would say that the benefits were probably split about half and half between timing and permanent structural costs. I think that better weather was a result, part of it that you see through the operational lines, and there were some maintenance events slipping. So I think you'll see some of that come back in the second quarter, but we're going to be working to keep those costs down as much as we can. On the fuel question, that's based off of Friday's forward curve where we pulled those numbers from. Obviously, as we look at jet differentials throughout the country, they're changing pretty rapidly. So I think we'll continue to see that number move. But we feel pretty good about where we are in a hedged book. We have only minor hedge losses in the quarter, and we do expect a modest profit at Trainer. And your third question, if you could restate it, please?","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the maintenance pattern, it's been typically very front-end loaded. Is it going to be much more even throughout the year this time?","Paul A. Jacobson","Yes, I would expect it to be flattish for the rest of the year, year-on-year.","Operator","We'll go next to Savanthi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Could you share what your current run rate is on the structural cost initiatives and perhaps where you've achieved some of the savings today and what is yet left to do?","Paul A. Jacobson","Sure, Savi. This is Paul. We're probably at a run rate of a little over $200 million right now. Primarily, as we said at Investor Day with the savings from the retiree medical program, the voluntary reductions that we had, we've seen a little bit of traction in maintenance, I think. We're trying to figure out right now how much of it is accelerated realization where we got the savings faster than we had anticipated and how much of it might be accretive to our guidance for the full year. But we're still sitting about $600 million for the year.","Richard H. Anderson","The savings really start to accelerate the latter part of the year as we start to take in the 717s and exit the 50-seaters in a much more accelerated fashion, Savi.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then just a follow-up, on the Trainer, how much of your fuel needs will be met with the Bakken fuel?","Paul A. Jacobson","We expect that -- the agreements that we have right now are roughly about 10% of the total crude diode of the plant. Long term, we're looking to settle out somewhere in the 75,000 to 100,000 barrels a day to build that delivery stream.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan McKenzie with Buckingham.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","With respect to the cost guidance, to what extent are the operational inefficiencies resulting from the sequestration impacting the outlook for the quarter?","Paul A. Jacobson","Dan, this is Paul. As we just mentioned, there are no sequestration impacts assumed in those numbers.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then with respect to China, China Southern and China Eastern, both in the SkyTeam alliance, growing aggressively from China. Korean Air appears to be expanding into China as well. However, slots at key times have been an industry-wide issue that have sort of stunted growth for the U.S. airlines. And with respect to the market, I guess I'm just wondering what, if anything, Delta can do to eliminate operating constraints to participate in some of the growth to that market.","Richard H. Anderson","Yes, this is Richard. We have been effective with our partners at China Southern, Chairman Si; and Chairman Liu at China Eastern, in adjusting our slot portfolios at Beijing and Shanghai to provide for good connecting times to and from the U.S. And we're beginning to grow our connectivity to both China Eastern in Shanghai and China Southern in Beijing quite effectively. So the overflight part of our Asia-Pacific franchise is positioned well, and we expect to have a strong summer.","Operator","We'll go next to Helane Becker with Cowen Securities.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Two questions. One is -- or was there any impact of avian flu in the Asian markets that you might have noticed, either in connecting traffic from your SkyTeam partners or in your own business? And two, when does the acquisition of Pinnacle close? And do you just swap out Comair for Pinnacle in contracted revenues going forward?","Richard H. Anderson","On the first question, we've seen absolutely no impact from the avian flu. Second, we close on Pinnacle May 1, and it will not replace Comair but will become the most efficient, best-run regional carrier. We actually have -- no, we actually -- it's really important to note this because this is...","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","I'm sorry.","Richard H. Anderson","Well, this is a big strategic advantage for Delta that I don't think people quite understand. We have fixed kind of the scale and cost issues that have plagued the regional carrier industry. So Pinnacle will probably, as a wholly-owned subsidiary, we have a cap scale and a flow-up agreement now. So we probably will end up having a 20% to 25% all-in once we get it all fully up and running and the 50-seaters out and the 70- and 76-seaters in. We'll have a very significant competitive advantage on the regional industry. And number two, we'll have the ability to really control the product and make it same as the mainline. So very important strategic initiative that we have because the whole up-gauge -- the whole up-gauging strategy is a really massive change in this industry because all those 50-seater airplanes were bought when fuel was $20 a barrel. And when you take the original purchase assumptions and now overlay them on what fuel is today and what the scales were 15 years ago for pilots and flight attendants and overlay where they are today at the independent regionals, that's a very tough equation. And we've actually solved through that equation, and we're going to take our regional carrier fleet down from probably a peak of around 700 -- 600, 700 airplanes down to the low 400s, and we're going to have the best cost structure and the best operations.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","That's huge. And as we think about that then, how many years should we allow for that? I know it's in the pilot contract, right? It's like 2 to 3 years?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, no, we should be -- we should really, I think in 24 -- well, it's a 7-year pilot contract, Mike Campbell reminds me. But in terms of getting the shift done, it's really in the next 18 to 24 months. And that's where you see a big improvement in our regional carrier line. And we have a big ASM pickup because we're going to be able to operate the airline, the total Delta airline with probably a couple hundred fewer airplanes and still have the same ability to produce ASMs. So there's so much operating leverage in this move that we're excited about closing on the Pinnacle transaction.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Awesome. Could I just sneak in one question, point of clarification? I thought the sequestration issue was that the FAA let you know kind of in the morning about what flights might be affected. It was kind of like real time rather than giving you time to make adjustments. Is that -- is my understanding incorrect then?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, no, you have time to make adjustments. They issue -- the National Air Traffic Control Center in Herndon issues different ground delay programs and ground stop programs. And then we have a tactical team in our OCC that operates 24\/7, making adjustments to the operation. So we intend on continuing to operate a mainline completion factor domestically of 100%.","Operator","We'll go next to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore Partners.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just want to check, regarding the decline in close-end bookings and softer leisure revenue in March which you talked about, have you seen a stabilization in those trends? And specifically, if we look at March versus April, how much of this is just a holiday shift? Or would you say demand has weakened further in April?","Paul A. Jacobson","Duane, I'd say a couple things. First of all, the shift, the holiday shift, did have some impact. I don't have that quantified. I think as we look forward, the holidays probably are not driving as much of the change for us than they historically had in the past. So there's a little bit of that between March and April. Sequestration continues, obviously, to have an impact into April. I'd say the bigger impact between March and April, why April is a bit worse than March, is really the yen. And the changes that we've been able to make real time to some of the revenue management systems that are starting to improve, the April demand certainly should pick up with some stronger demand profiles for May and June.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that -- the May and June, I just want to ask or probe a little bit there, is that a function of math, of the comparisons? Or is that something that you're seeing -- is that something that your business is telling you today?","Paul A. Jacobson","That's what we see in the outlook. Our bookings for this summer look quite solid.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then just on the Bakken crude, can you tell us at this point what you're seeing in terms of transport cost per barrel?","Paul A. Jacobson","I'd rather not get into the details of the transaction. It really represents significant savings over the transatlantic barrels that are going to the East Coast.","Operator","We'll go next to John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Richard, Ed, when we look at other airlines that have sort of figured out the secret sauce to creating sustainable value in the airlines business, after getting their the margin situation under control, then they're able to compound earnings growth by growing capacity. At what point do your margins or returns grow to a level where margin expansion alone just isn't enough to drive earnings growth and it's time to turn the capacity growth to sustain earnings growth going forward?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, I think we need to get -- we've always said that our goal is pretax margins in the high-single digits. And I think that we're cautious about growth. We've been able to consistently sustain nice RASM improvement at Delta through a series of different network, product and yield management strategies. And we'll continue to do that. I don't think we can make a prediction about growth at this point given all the information we provided you on this call. But suffice to say that we have enough flexibility in our fleet to be able to manage capacity when the economics are right. But in the meantime, we still have plenty of opportunity for margin expansion with really modest changes in capacity this year.","Edward H. Bastian","John, this is Ed. One of the things we obviously -- also factors in that equation is what's the state of the global economies, and that's going to be as much a dictator on what our capacity outlook is than the pure airline economics. And we have a strong philosophy here that we need to keep our capacity below the GDP growth rates going forward that will allow us to maintain the discipline we're talking about and occasionally, growth, but it would probably be modestly into the future.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And just to clarify, pretax margin in the high-single digits are pretty far from current levels. When you look out at the sort of situation assuming constant macro and what we know about M&A going forward, the next few years, is that an environment that kind of gets you to your goal, as far as you can see?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, I think we should reserve that kind of conversation for the conversation we're going to have with our investors in early May about our long-term capital deployment strategy.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And just a follow-up on the concept of value creation, when I think about some of the concepts that I guess were under consideration years ago when Delta and Northwest first merged, I think one of the things that came up a lot was the potential for unlocking value by spinning out frequent flier plans. You executed some pretty creative deals in 2012. As the core operations improve, is that something worth considering again?","Paul A. Jacobson","No, it's not.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And can you just offer -- can you elaborate on that?","Richard H. Anderson","I think the difficulty in doing that is that's too core to the business. And in essence, it is a revenue generator where your -- it is a form of selling seats. And when you think about the core of what we do well at Delta, we need to have that lever, that revenue lever and that cost lever on our side of the equation. It drives our Infinity Card relationships. It drives our loyalty relationships with our most important customers, and we can derive far more value for our shareowners than constantly quarreling with a third party over what our pricing is going to be for a seat.","Jill Greer","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","And we'll take that question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So if you believe that fares and fuel are really correlated, why don't you give us EBIT margin guidance for the full year instead of just for the next quarter because I think that would send a huge signal of confidence about the sustainability of that relationship, and I would probably think it would discourage a lot of the short-term trading in your stock?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, I don't know that it would, candidly, change the view of short-term trading. I do think one of the ideas that you had in your recent writings is a better idea, which is let's not use EBITDAR.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yes, well, agree with that. But I've also talked about not hedging fuel, and that doesn't seem to take either. But in terms -- I mean look at Copa, I mean they give us full year 2012 EBIT margin and guidance -- 2013, I mean, 5 months ago, and the stock just does not move. And granted they don't give PRASM, but the stock just does not move on month-to-month data points because people know they're going to catch it up. Whether it's oil-driven or pricing-driven or what, it's a sustainability question and it signals confidence, which is why the stock gets a huge multiple.","Richard H. Anderson","We always appreciate your input, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. Well, then -- okay. Fair enough. Related question, Richard. Does what happened to your stock in early May when it was off 20% from the top on backward-looking March PRASM data, does that make you lean towards buying back stock as opposed to other options?","Richard H. Anderson","Hunter, the reason I was so forthcoming in my narrative was in the hope that I would dissuade anyone from trying to get under the tent on what we're going to do when we have our announcement in the first couple of weeks in May. So I'm going to hold on that question, too. Since you're 0 for 2, do you want to try another one?","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Sure. Why not, actually? Paul, here's one for you. So you talked about Bakken coming in. I don't think Trainer is set up to receive crude by rail. So if you guys do start to get up to the 75,000, 100,000 barrels per day of output, are you going to have to -- is it going to require some incremental CapEx at Trainer to make it sort of Bakken-ready -- crude rail-ready, I should say?","Paul A. Jacobson","We haven't made any decisions on long-term investments around that, Hunter. I will tell you that there are multiple offloading and terminaling facilities on the East Coast, and there are multiple options for getting it there. Rail is just the majority of the trip, but you can barge it down from various locations as well.","Jill Greer","And that's going to conclude the analyst portion of the call. I'm now going to turn it over to Ned Walker for the media portion.","John E. Walker","Thank you very much, Jill. Jay, we'll go ahead and begin the media Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. Let's go ahead and begin.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Josh Freed with the Associated Press.","Joshua Freed","You mentioned earlier that you had this situation where Delta is biased towards yield, I think, was how you put it, caused you to need to then come back later and make some adjustments when maybe the efforts to get yield were a little too high. I was wondering if you could say a little more about that. I mean, was it that the demand changed all that fast or in some way it was different than what you were used to? Or is it that the bias towards yield was sort of above and beyond where it had been previously?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, in a yield management system, you make forecasts some 6 to 8 months earlier. So as we saw demand trends building from the end of 2012 into the first quarter of 2013, demand trends were quite strong. And so we made decisions, inventory classification decisions toward a yield bias versus a load factor bias. And as the close-in load factor build showed some weakness, we take steps to backfill the inventory with perhaps lower-yielding traffic.","John E. Walker","Does that answer your question?","Joshua Freed","Yes. Yes, that does help. And has the result of all of that then been a rethinking of how much you sort of bias the system towards yield or is it -- or do you do it the same as you always have and this is just an adjustment that was strictly related to demand?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, let's put it into perspective. This was -- January and February were really strong months. We were top of the industry in relative performance. In the month of March, where we saw this weakness, was the most profitable March in the history of Delta. So putting it in perspective, it shows you that yield management systems and the decisions around yield and inventory are dynamic and are driven by demand factors, external economic factors, pricing in the external environment and global economies. So it's a number of factors that go into it, and we constantly make those kinds of decisions. But I would say that if you look at the track record of Delta for 2 years, we've run a pretty significant year-on-year revenue premium to the industry. So we're pretty -- we're very good at it.","Joshua Freed","Right. Yes, I was just trying to get a feel for whether there had been any kind of change in philosophy before or after or if it was just simply an adjustment with the same philosophy in place.","Richard H. Anderson","It's just -- it's an adjustment with the same philosophy, which is to continue to expand the margins at Delta.","Operator","We'll go next to Mary Jane Credeur with Bloomberg News.","Mary Jane Credeur","Quick question, I missed what you said about those Heathrow slots, how many and what price?","Paul A. Jacobson","We had 2 slot pairs that we purchased for $47 million.","Mary Jane Credeur","Total or each?","Paul A. Jacobson","Total.","Mary Jane Credeur","Total. Okay, great. And then furloughs, are you bracing for this to last for weeks, all summer? What's the duration outlook on that?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, let's be clear about it. I mean whenever we get a question about furloughs, the answer is we do not do involuntary furloughs at Delta.","Mary Jane Credeur","I'm sorry, I mean the FAA furloughs. I apologize.","Richard H. Anderson","Oh, the FAA furloughs. Now what was your question again, Mary Jane? I got all focused on -- everybody thinks that we're going to furlough at Delta, we're not. So what was the question again?","Mary Jane Credeur","No, I'm sorry. The FAA furloughs, the controller furloughs, more specifically, are we bracing for this to last for weeks, all summer? I mean, what's the realistic scenario here?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, I think that it depends upon what the administration, how the administration handles the situation. What we're focused on is taking good care of our customers and continuing to provide to them the high quality customer service that we always provide, and we will manage through it on their behalf.","Mary Jane Credeur","And who takes the cost hit on that when those regional flights are canceled?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, the -- ultimately, the cost hit is on the consumer, right, I mean because of the FAA reaction to sequester. But we will do our very best to make certain that we get our customers safely to their destinations on time. Ultimately, the cost is borne in time by consumers. But we're going to work hard at Delta to make sure we take care of our customers.","John E. Walker","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","And that question will come from Linda Loyd with the Philadelphia Inquirer.","Linda Loyd","We're having a fire drill here, so we all had to vacate the building and I missed most of the analyst questions. So I do have a Trainer oil refinery question. You said you're expecting a modest profit in the June quarter. Are you expecting a profit for the full year at the refinery? Or are you...","Paul A. Jacobson","Linda, this is Paul. We're not giving any guidance beyond the second quarter at this time.","Linda Loyd","So I guess one last question. Are you still glad you bought an oil refinery, or has it been more of a headache than you originally envisioned?","Edward H. Bastian","Yes, we're glad we bought an oil refinery.","Linda Loyd","Okay. You say that each time I ask it, and you remain glad that you bought it, right?","Edward H. Bastian","Yes. Linda, one of the reasons why we're going to defer giving full year profit guidance for Trainer is because the crack spreads are pretty volatile right now and there's a lot of -- and so it's hard to continue to reconcile movements and crack spreads to guidance. So we've said that we expect to make a profit in the second quarter, and I think that's probably as far as we can give you guidance on at this point.","Linda Loyd","Okay. And is this Ed speaking?","Edward H. Bastian","Yes. And let me put one last piece in about the refinery. Jeff Warmann and the team are doing a great job running the refinery. We have been running at maximum throughput safely and efficiently for most of the third -- first and second quarter here as we came out of the effects of Sandy.

My name is Noah and I will be your coordinator. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jill Sullivan-Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. ","Jill Sullivan-Greer","Thanks, Noah. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for our September quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO Ed Bastian, our President Glen Hauenstein and our CFO Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of our financial performance. Glen will then address the revenue environment and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. ","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the investor relations page at IR.Delta.com. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Ed Bastian. ","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone, appreciate you joining us. This morning Delta reported a $1.9 billion pretax profit for the September quarter and earnings per share of $1.70 versus consensus of $1.65. The resiliency of our business and our people stood out this quarter as we generated a solid 19% operating margin, $1.1 billion of free cash flow despite the weakest revenue environment in recent memory and the impact of the $150 million technology outage. ","We apologize once more to those who were impacted by the outage and have already taken action to make sure an event like this doesn't happen again. I want to thank the entire Delta team for their great efforts, not only through the disruption, but also as we've worked to restore customers' confidence in Delta's reliability. Even with the impact of the outage, we delivered solid operations with a 99% mainline completion factor and an on-time arrival rate of 84% for the quarter. ","Importantly, of the 22 systemwide perfect completion factor days we had this quarter, what we call \"brand perfect days\" with both Delta and Delta Connection having perfect completion in all 5500 daily flights, 21 of them came after the events in August. So the operation is back and running stronger than ever and our team proved once more why they are the very best. I'm pleased to say we've added another $325 million towards next year's profit sharing for our employees, bringing the total so far this year to $920 million. While the outage was a one-time event, the bigger challenge we face is from continued unit revenue declines, a trend that has persisted for the last seven quarters.","And while our strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to keep margins consistent with last year in the September quarter, market fuel prices look to be higher in the upcoming quarter for the first time in several years. Therefore it continues to be a top priority for us to return to positive RASM in order to stabilize our margin performance and demonstrate the durability of the business model we have built. ","Capacity is a significant lever we can use to impact that performance and based on our RASM results earlier this year, we made the decision to lower our capacity growth to below 2% for the September quarter. And while the pace of improvement has been slower than we hoped, our unit revenues have started to move in the right direction with these lower capacity levels to which Glen will provide greater detail. ","That said, RASM remains negative and will stay conservative with our capacity, capping growth at 1% for the fourth quarter, a level of growth that we plan to carry over throughout 2017. With this cautious approach, we can focus on firming the trends that have us on track for positive unit revenues likely sometime early next year. This will go a long way towards demonstrating that Delta can sustain solid profits, margins and cash flows throughout the business cycle and provide further evidence that we have built a durable and sustainable model that warrants an improved valuation.","I want to thank the management and ALPA negotiating teams who've worked tirelessly to get to the agreement in principle that we reached with our pilots two weeks ago. The potential agreement recognizes the important leadership role our pilots play in Delta's long term success. It is now going through ALPA's approval and ratification process and to respect that process we're not going to comment any further than what I've just said. ","Finally in closing, I want to thank Richard for his leadership, his courage and his friendship to us all Delta, as he is now fully retired. Richard has been a transformative leader at Delta as well as for the industry. He is a true servant-leader as he served all 80,000 of us from his heart. We're fortunate to have Frank Blake, another outstanding leader, as our new Chairman. We look forward to working closely with Frank as we build an even stronger and more durable franchise for the future. ","With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Glen. ","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. I'd also like to start by thanking the Delta people for their perseverance through a challenging quarter. It is your hard work and dedication that sets Delta apart in our customers' eyes. And that translates into the revenue premium we realize to the industry. As Ed mentioned, the biggest challenge we face as a company is the persistent decline of unit revenues. This quarter our RASM was down 6.8%, including roughly 1 point of impact on the August outage and an additional point of headwind as we lapped the yen hedge gains from last year. Excluding our outage, our unit revenues were at the bottom end of our initial guidance range and we attribute that shortfall primarily to two factors.","First, the Transatlantic proved more challenging than we expected, given the supply\/demand imbalance in the region, caused by multiple terrorist events, low-cost carrier growth and Brexit which we're primarily seeing in the devaluation of the British pound. Second, the domestic close-in yield environment was weaker than expected in the first half of the quarter, particularly in early August. Overall, domestic unit revenues declined 7% on 4% capacity growth in the September quarter, with nearly 2 points of the decline attributable to the August outage. While this result was weaker than we initially anticipated, we did see improvement as we went through the quarter, particularly as we lowered our capacity levels with our fall schedule in mid-August and adjusted some revenue management strategies. ","The improvement was most evident in September when domestic unit revenue declines moderated to 2.5% for the month, driven primarily by improving business revenues. It is these trends that give us cautious optimism that we will have a path to positive RASM in the domestic entity in the December-January time frame, if not shortly thereafter. To get there, we will slow our domestic capacity growth further in the fourth quarter to 2.5% year-over-year which is less than half the rate we grew during the first three quarters of the year. We believe this lower capacity profile will position us to achieve a better RASM result during the upcoming off-peak season. ","As I mentioned, we adjusted our revenue management strategies. As we have rolled out this new approach, we have seen close-in yields strengthen and we're working to build on this trend going forward. In September, over one third of our domestic network saw RASM improve year-over-year, up from a low of 15% that occurred during the first quarter. We expect that percentage to exceed 50% over the next 90 days. There are some calendar delays over the next few months, but we believe on a combined basis, domestic RASM for November through January should be flattish as travel patterns shift between months due to holiday placements. And with domestic, the biggest driver of our overall system performance, this will be the major push we need to get our overall unit revenues back into positive territory. ","Moving on to Latin, I am pleased to say this is the first region to have turned the corner with a unit revenue improvement of 1.5% this quarter, the first time a Latin entity has achieved a positive unit revenue in 2 1\/2 years. After 16 consecutive quarters of negative results, Brazil unit revenues improved 30% year-on-year, with momentum building through the quarter as strengthening real drove more Brazil point-of-sale demand. We're seeing this positive trend continue as we head into the peak demand season.","Mexico business markets have also been a key driver on Latin's path to positive RASM, achieving the third consecutive quarter of positive unit revenues. U.S. and Mexico open skies were ratified and took effect late August and we expect the U.S. DOT will grant antitrust immunity by year-end, paving the way for the implementation of our joint venture with Aeromexico. Delta's U.S.-Mexico scale will triple as a result of the partnership and it will allow us to build on the strong momentum we already have in the largest revenue market for U.S. travel to Latin America. Regarding our fourth quarter 2016 outlook, capacity in Latin America will remain flat as we continue to look to improve our RASM performance before growing further in the region. ","Turning to the Pacific, in the September quarter the region saw positive RASM ex hedge for the first time since 2013. Japan was a notable bright spot with RASM ex hedge of 4% year-over-year driven by a stronger yen. On the other hand, China continues to be challenged as industry capacity growth outpaced increases in demand. ","Looking ahead, the industry supply-demand imbalance in the Pacific will become more acute in the winter off-peak season, with industry capacity up 11% in the fourth quarter, while demand is only up mid to high single digits. We will also continue to face the headwinds as we lap last year's hedge gains. For the fourth quarter, it is a $30 million impact or about half a point on system PRASM which translates to nearly a five point drag on Pacific unit revenues. While we were able to secure two daylight frequencies with the limiting opening of Haneda, it's forcing us to split our Tokyo operations between two airports, Haneda and Narita.","As a result, we announced in August that we will be further restructuring the Narita hub with the winter schedule. The network changes will result in a 30% capacity reduction to and from Japan this winter and allow us to retire two additional 747s by the end of the year. With the Pacific broadly, we will reduce our winter capacity by 9% to 10% as we continue to restructure our network for long term profitability and sustainability in the region. ","And finally we get to the Transatlantic. September quarter unit revenues were down 9.7%, driven by overcapacity, particularly from LCCs and Middle East carriers, while terrorism concerns, sluggish economies and Brexit all weighed on the demand side. While the revenue environment was probably the most challenging, we also had a solidly profitable summer because of lower fuel. That said, as we go into the seasonally weaker period, we will reduce our capacity offering by three to four points starting in November to address the unit revenue challenges we're facing. While we're expecting it to take a bit longer to get to unit revenue growth in the Transatlantic, we do expect that the pace of declines will moderate going forward. ","As we look out further, the Transatlantic has had some of the most unique competitive dynamics and we need to adopt our model to continue to leverage our existing joint ventures and seek new partners as we have done recently with Jet Airways, in addition to carefully managing our capacity in the region. ","Now let me address our fourth quarter outlook. We expect system unit revenues to be down in the 3% to 5% range, on a 1% capacity increase. ","In closing, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the unit revenue trends we're starting to see in significant portions of our network and we expect that with a lot of hard work we can continue to drive improvement and get to positive unit revenues by early next year. But as we have commented before, if we do not see the performance we expect as we move through the quarter, we will move quickly to make the changes we need to get the right outcome. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Paul. ","Paul Jacobson","Thank you, Glen and good morning, everyone, thank you for joining us this morning. Once again this quarter the Delta team was able to show with our continued discipline on cost and focus on free cash flow that we've built a solid foundation that has put us in a good position to weather the inevitable challenges we face in this business to deliver sustainable results. Lower fuel prices drove a roughly $300 million decline in total operating expenses, on a 1.5% increase in capacity. Non-fuel CASM was essentially flat, including the half-point impact of the outage.","This result is consistent with our initial guidance, as we continue to leverage the solid cost foundation we have built and deliver strong productivity savings, while we also continue to benefit from our upgauging initiatives. We expect our non-fuel unit cost to increase 1% to 2% in the December quarter which doesn't include any impact for a potential pilot agreement. This is slightly higher than our run rate from the past couple of quarters, but still comfortably below our 2% annual target, as we're seeing some pressure from our lower capacity levels and timing of maintenance spend. ","Turning to fuel, our total fuel expense declined by $350 million or 18% year-over-year, we had no hedge impacts during the current period given our decision to early settle our remaining 2016 positions during the June quarter. The refinery lost $45 million for the quarter, consistent with expectations driven by lower crack spreads. The hard work of our fuel team, coupled with the expertise we have with the refinery, has allowed us to harvest about a $0.03 per gallon unhedged fuel cost advantage over our competitors and we're focused on widening that lead. This advantage will become even more important as we look ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, with market fuel prices already higher year-over-year for the first time in over two years. We expect an all-in December quarter fuel price of $1.60 to $1.65 per gallon which is down for us year-over-year as we paid above market rates during the same period in 2015, but higher on a market basis. ","Now let me address our margin outlook. While we expect another quarter of solid cost performance, given a waning fuel tailwind and continued RASM headwinds, we're forecasting a December quarter operating margin in the 14% to 16% range which is down roughly 2 points year-over-year. As Ed and Glen both mentioned, we're cautiously optimistic about the revenue environment and combined with our conservative capacity plans, reinforces our focus on maintaining our margin performance.","Moving to cash flow, we generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We continued our balanced approach of deploying that cash with more than $650 million going back into the business, as we took delivery of 11 mainline aircraft and our fleet modification projects continue. We expect core capital spending will be roughly $700 million in the fourth quarter and we expect to spend an additional $520 million on the Aeromexico tender offer. We ended the September quarter with net debt of $6.4 billion, down roughly $400 million sequentially from June. ","We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow and returned $650 million to our shareholders during the quarter. That brings the total amount of cash we have returned to our owners year-to-date to $2.7 billion which already exceeds the level returned during all of 2015. We remain on track to meet our goal of returning at least 70% of our free cash flow this year to our owners. ","In closing, I also want to express my gratitude to the Delta family for all of your hard work and perseverance during the quarter that allowed us to deliver cost performance that was consistent with our initial outlook, despite the headwinds we experienced. I am confident that our efforts will allow us to continue to deliver sustainable results regardless of the challenges we face. Jill? ","Jill Sullivan-Greer","Thanks, Ed, Glen and Paul. Before we turn to the analyst Q&A, I'd like to remind everybody to mark your calendars for Delta's annual Investor Day which this year will be held on December 15. So with that Noah, if you could give everybody instructions for the Q&A session. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. ","Hunter Keay","Can you guys talk about, you mentioned LCCs in the Transatlantic and you talked about leveraging the JVs and exploring new partnerships. It sounds like you guys are starting to take a creative approach a little bit or at least considering a new approach to how to deal with that, because obviously there's the short term issue of oversupply, but there's a long term issue of the competitive dynamic changing a little bit. So is there a scenario where you guys consider maybe doing something a little more dramatic, like an airline within an airline strategy or something like that? Or is this plan to compete by using basic economy and segmenting your own cabin? And maybe something a little more tactical? ","Ed Bastian","Hunter, no, we have no intent to create an airline within an airline. ","Hunter Keay","And then can you maybe give us some color on how you guys use your route profitability reports and maybe how it's evolved in the last couple years? I think a lot of people are curious to know airlines and how Delta specifically plans for capacity. Is it a daily basis? Is it a weekly thing? Is there ever an element of strategic soft factors that are considered? Or is it simply, you get the route profitability reports, you see which routes are now losing money that used to make money and you trim back on those? I think maybe Glen, you want to talk about this. Just at a high level, can you sort of let us in to sort of how you plan in a changing demand environment? Thanks a lot. ","Glen Hauenstein","Hunter, that's a great question and of course there are a lot of elements that go into those decisions, including the market sizes, the relevant positions of the carrier, the long term sustainability and profitability potential of the market. But we adjust on a monthly basis, as you know and at about 3 to 4 months out, the less we touch the schedule, the better it is for our customers, because customers once they buy a ticket want you to fulfill that commitment of applying what they've purchased from you. So that's why it does take us a few months to ratchet up or ratchet down capacity in advance, once we see the trends developing. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","I wonder from a high level could you talk about your fleet assumptions underlying the 1% growth rate in 2017? Any incremental deferrals or retirements underpinning that plan? ","Ed Bastian","Duane, we're not going to get specific on 2017 at all. We will get specific at the December 15 event that Jill mentioned. But right now we're still in the planning stages for 2017, so it'd be premature and speculative. ","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. How about some of the recent press reports about incremental regional aircraft orders? Are those replacement in nature or are you getting additional scope relief in this agreement in principle? ","Ed Bastian","We have not made any incremental purchases of regional jet aircraft. There was certainly during the discussion with the pilots, whether we wanted to or not, but we're not planning on increasing our regional jet scope at this point. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. ","Michael Linenberg","Two questions here. Glen, you called out I think Brexit as an issue. What did you see with your position at Virgin Atlantic? And what was the, I guess, benefit from Virgin Atlantic in the numbers this quarter? It looked like it may have run through the miscellaneous line. Can you highlight that? ","Glen Hauenstein","Well I'll let Paul highlight the numbers, but clearly the hit to revenue was primarily based and almost solely based on the depreciation of the currency. And so you know that's a pretty dramatic, more than 50% of the revenues in the joint venture we have with Virgin come as point of origin UK and are denominated in pounds, so when you have a big currency moves like that there's a dramatic change in the revenue profile. ","Interestingly enough, we have not seen a lot of demand destruction, so that's the positive part. And we'll see how the winter, we're taking a very cautious approach with capacity into the UK, targeting it down in the mid single digits. Hopefully that will mitigate some of the drag we have from the currency. ","Michael Linenberg","And then I guess Paul, sort of the P&L impact, what it was this year versus a year ago in the miscellaneous line? ","Ed Bastian","Virgin is a private company so we're not going to give you the specific results of Virgin. But what I can tell you is it's largely consistent with what we had last third quarter. ","Michael Linenberg","And then just a quick one on the refinery. I think Paul, you indicated that it did lose $45 million for the quarter and I think publicly you've said that the estimate for the year is around $100 million? Is that still right? We've had some movement in fuel of late, so is that still a good number to use? ","Paul Jacobson","Yes, Mike it is. We've said on previous calls that we expect the full year refinery loss to be about $100 million. We're still in that range, even with the movement in prices, cracks have remained relatively consistent through this move up in crude. ","Operator","We will take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein. ","David Vernon","Glen, you mentioned that you guys had changed or tweaked your revenue management practices which helped support the domestic RASM. Could you help us understand maybe what approach you took and how the market reacted to any of the changes you might have made externally? To how you're managing that yield in domestic? ","Glen Hauenstein","We had gotten some very complicated pricing strategies in place that were becoming very difficult for us to manage in a simplified fare environment and so we went to a much more, much higher reliance on revenue management and a little bit less reliance on the pricing structure. We're trying achieve pricing structure advantages. So that was all an internal, I couldn't tell you how our competitors reacted to that. I don't even know if they've seen it. ","David Vernon","So it was more of an internal action it that just resulted in a better outcome? ","Glen Hauenstein","Correct. ","David Vernon","Okay. And then maybe Paul, just as you think about longer term and I appreciate that you guys want to respect the negotiating process and not talk about the pilot contract, but if you think about the long term rate of sort of CASM ex fuel including profit sharing, directionally what sort of number should we think about that number being in the three to five year time frame? ","Paul Jacobson","David, good morning and first of all welcome to the sector. As Ed mentioned, we'll have more detail on 2017, but as we've talked about in our long term plans that we typically update in the May time frame, long term we're still committed to the 2% non-fuel CASM growth for the future. Or lower. ","David Vernon","Okay. So then as you think about that kind of playing into next year and obviously seeing a little bit above that on the pilot contract, that actually puts a little more short term pressure on the need to get the RASM up, right? Am I thinking about that correctly? ","Paul Jacobson","Certainly as what we articulated in our comments before the Q&A, the operating margin pressure that we see from fuel, from costs, etcetera is driving the continued urgency and challenges to get RASM higher. That's a prime focus irrespective of what we do in the cost structure overall. But we'll get into the 2017 and longer term as we talk about it at Investor Day in December. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. ","Jamie Baker","Question for Glen, so JPMorgan won't permit me to buy basic economy. It's a product that's not well suited for business travel, so whether I try to book it myself or through my agency, basic economy is walled off. Can't see it, can't buy it, fine with me, probably fine with you, I prefer to be kept in the upgrade lottery and have some flexibility on the day of departure. So my question is whether my employer here is the norm or the exception? I mean if you were to look at, I don't know, your top 50 corporate accounts, is it common for most of them to have walled off this product for employees? Or do you not even have the ability to tell? ","Glen Hauenstein","It's not uncommon for employers to wall that fare product off. ","Jamie Baker","And would you say the overwhelming majority do? The slight majority? Any color? ","Glen Hauenstein","A significant number of major corporations in the United States. How's that? I'm getting some counsel here watching the political debate go on, in what to say and what not to say.","Jamie Baker","Very important lesson, though hopefully none of us need quite that level of schooling at this point. You've targeted -- so second question for Paul. You've targeted I guess 17% to 19% margins over the 2016 to 2018 timeframe. It looks like expectations for next year are actually below that, so the market doesn't exhibit a lot of confidence in this target. Fuel's heading higher, pilot costs heading higher. ","Arithmetically it looks like you have to have at least 3% RASM just to stay at the low end of the margin range for next year? Do you still have confidence that these targets are achievable? Or put differently, is it inevitable that Investor Day you have to revise them? ","Paul Jacobson","I will agree with you that the market has not expressed confidence in a lot of things that we're doing in the short term. We remain confident in our targets and our long term goals of what we're trying to achieve. We're talking about margin sustainability. We're talking about taking those steps to get there. We've known for a while now that fuel prices were trending higher and as we've talked about for multiple quarters, we're here. And that is fully expected and we believe the steps that we're taking are the necessary ones to preserve the foundation that we've created. ","Ed Bastian","The targets we put out there were just a few months ago, so there was nothing with what we put out that's changed. We expect to have a final deal, we expect the fuel prices to start to tick up, we expected to have RASM softness throughout this year. And you're right, the challenge is to get RASM back positive and we're optimistic that's exactly what we'll be doing. ","Glen Hauenstein","Could I add one thing, I think the one thing that would give us a lot of confidence, we do see a lot of green shoots like we saw in Latin and the domestic arena. And really if you look back at history, significantly lower fuel ultimately translates into lower fares. That's kind of a very high correlation over a long period of time, higher fuel turns into higher fares. The exact lag can vary, but it's usually in the 3 to 5 month category and as Paul says, we're facing higher fuel. And so we would expect seeing what we're seeing in the events and what we know, based on history of how long it takes for that to work its way back into the pricing structure, that it is right around the corner, we feel. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. ","Helane Becker","So on a unit revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, is there any way you can break down the percent related to FX and the percent related to calendar shift? ","Ed Bastian","The FX is not a big number, it's less than one point of negative impact. We don't have the calendar shift data because it's really, there's a lot of movement, that's why we try to give a 90-day forward kind of November through January view of what we see going on domestically. ","Helane Becker","And then my other question, just as you think about the New York area and the construction that's going on at LaGuardia and everything that's occurring, are you finding that your customers are shifting from LaGuardia to JFK? Or are there issues related to that, that are going to hold you back from being able to continue to expand the operation there? ","Ed Bastian","No, we're not. We're certainly well aware of some of the roadway challenges as the central terminal building construction started a couple months ago, but we're working with the port, we're working with the Governor's office to come up with better traffic patterns and no, we don't see any significant shift of markets. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. ","Joseph DeNardi","Glen, just a question on the Aeromexico relationship and the accounting around that. Can you just talk about, does that become a benefit from a PRASM standpoint, as some of the revenue flows through but the ASMs don't? If you could just walk us through how you plan to account for that once it closes? ","Paul Jacobson","So the Aeromexico, once that deal closes, assuming we get all the regulatory approvals and move forward which we expect will look a lot like the Virgin Atlantic accounting, so we'll have a piece of the joint venture that will flow through revenues and then we'll have a share of income which will flow through non-op. ","Joseph DeNardi","Okay, so the part that flows through revenue, will that become a tailwind for PRASM, since there won't be any corresponding ASMs for that? ","Glen Hauenstein","No, that's not the way it works. It's our reported unit revenues and then it goes into a different line item that's not in the reported unit revenues, (technical difficulty) key benefits. ","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then Paul, just a question on cash flows for this year, I know you guys don't guide on a full year basis, but are you still on track for the $8 billion to $9 billion target that you've given? ","Paul Jacobson","Yes, we're still largely on track as Ed talked about. We gave those numbers and figures back in May just a few months ago. We always project for higher fuel prices and we still feel good about our cash flow performance. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. ","Julie Yates","Glen, can you help frame expectations on the monthly PRASM cadence, just given all the calendar headwinds and noise that we'll see particularly in October? ","Glen Hauenstein","Yes, particularly October we'll be at the low end of the spectrum, actually below the quarterly guidance. November will be significantly above and December and January together, December will be significantly worse and January will be significantly better, as a lot of the holiday returns shift into the first couple of weeks of January. ","Julie Yates","Any updated thoughts on moving away from the monthlies, given all the noise it's been creating for the stock? ","Ed Bastian","We have no plans at this time, Julie. ","Julie Yates","Okay. And then one for Paul, Paul more specifically on 2017 in terms of the levers that you have to offset labor inflation and the headwind from slower unit growth, can you just remind us of some of the initiatives on the maintenance side and other opportunities that you have? ","Paul Jacobson","Sure, Julie, we can go into more detail at Investor Day, but as a reminder we're still in the middle innings of our upgauging strategy and we expect to continue to get those benefits in 2017 and beyond. That serves as the foundation, but we can get more specific on productivity initiatives and how we achieve those results tactically as we go through Investor Day in December. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. ","Dan McKenzie","Just a couple questions here. Glen, 1% growth in 2017, I'm wondering if you can share what the original plan was? Is that something that's less than what you had previously thought? ","Glen Hauenstein","This is the original plan for 2017. The planning season, we're just coming to the end of budget season or the beginning of budget season here and that's the template that we put out to the operating group. ","Dan McKenzie","Okay. And then Paul, given the 1% growth, I'm wondering if you can perhaps provide some more specificity on how we should think about aircraft and non-aircraft CapEx next year? I know you've put out a range before, but does the slower growth perhaps affect CapEx? ","Paul Jacobson","As Ed mentioned we'll provide more details on 2017 at Investor Day, but we're still consistent with what we shared a few months ago. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. ","Rajeev Lalwani","First question just on the positive RASM comment for early next year. How do you get comfortable with getting there, just given the fact that we've sort of been here before and had to push it out a couple of times? Or said another way, what's different this time? ","Glen Hauenstein","Well, the difference is the yields on close-in bookings. Yields in close-in booking volumes have significantly improved from where they were just six or eight weeks ago. And so as we went through the month, inside the month we were losing 3 to 4 points of unit revenues [indiscernible] and we get to a month say even, we would close the month minus 3% to 4% domestically. That number has significantly reduced. Now it's flat to minus 1% inside the month and so you see those trends sequentially and derivatively being improved week over week and month over month. So those trends continue to develop the way they have been, we see that that close-in inside the month would shift into positive territory the next few weeks and months here. ","Ed Bastian","I think the other thing to note is that capacity levels are lower than they've been all year long and will stay there until we get to the unit revenues we need and fuel prices have also firmed up which is providing a pricing floor. So I think we've got a lot of change we see happening in our specific circumstances. ","Rajeev Lalwani","And then a quick follow-up as it relates to the midpoint of your guidance, does that reflect close-in continuing to improve or that strength remaining as you look through the quarter? ","Glen Hauenstein","It assumes what we see today. It does not assume further deterioration or improvement. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. ","Savi Syth","Follow-up question on the pilot cost side of things. I know you don't want to talk about the contract or anything, but if it does pass within 4Q, is the accounting for that going to be reflected in the fourth quarter EPS? Or I was just kind of curious how the retroactive pay will be treated if the contract is ratified? ","Ed Bastian","If the contract is ratified, Savi and if there is a retro component to it, yes, in the fourth quarter there would be an accounting. But right now we're not making any assumptions or making any comment on it. ","Savi Syth","And then just if I may ask I know that you probably won't comment on some of the news out there about interest in Avianca, but just wondering if you could provide a little bit of insight into what you would gain from a closer relationship with Avianca? Or just what you might be missing in that part of the region and what you could do to address it? ","Ed Bastian","Your earlier premise is correct. We're not going to speculate on Avianca. ","Savi Syth","Or maybe if you can provide a little bit more color on maybe what you're missing in and I'm guessing because you seem to have a good relationship with GOL and have access to Brazil, so is it more, what's missing in Latin America from Delta's network? ","Ed Bastian","Well, we've got a great partner in Mexico, we've got a great partner in Brazil, we've got a great partner in Argentina. We don't have a partner relationship in Central America. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. ","Jack Atkins","Just a follow-up on an earlier question first here, if you could help me reconcile your comments around close-in yields improving over the last 6 to 8 weeks, but I think the September domestic RASM was down 2.5% I believe you said earlier? The original expectation I think on the last call was for flattish, so if you can help me reconcile positive close-in commentary relative to underperformance in September? ","Glen Hauenstein","Minus 2.5% was significantly better than we had been doing and our expectations were that it would be slightly better than that, but it did in our -- missed flattish by a point or two. It's very difficult to call an industry where 40% of your revenues come inside of 30 days and so that's one of the reasons I think that there's a lot of speculation is, can we get it done? And I think all we can tell you is the trends that we see and the trends that we see continue to improve and with those improving trends you would expect us to be and the macro backdrop of higher fuel as Ed points out, there seems to be everything lining up here for us to move beyond the minus 2.5% to a more flattish and then into positive territory as we close the year out. ","Jack Atkins","And then just a follow-up on that, can you speak to what you're seeing in terms of your business travel demand and yields there? Have you seen any sort of lingering effects at all from the IT issues in August? Thank you. ","Steve Sear","To your question, we still see the steady volumes which is encouraging and some of the ongoing yield pressure and we're continuing to grow share through the period. ","Jill Sullivan-Greer","We've got time for one more question from the analysts. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. ","Darryl Genovesi","Glen, just wondering you commented that the close-in stuff was looking a little bit better. What do you think is driving that? Is it an improvement in corporate demand? Or is it moves that the industry has made to try to limit dilution by holding less inventory towards the end of the booking curve? Or can you not tell? ","Glen Hauenstein","I think that the fares that we're realizing inside of 21 days are improving generally and the question is they are improving at different rates, corporate managed versus unmanaged and I think they are at slightly different rates, with managed being slightly below unmanaged. But the general trends are that inside the month now, we're seeing a more robust fare. ","Jill Sullivan-Greer","That's going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call and I will now turn it over to Kevin Shinkle, our Chief Communications Officer for the media portion. ","Kevin Shinkle","Thanks, Jill. Welcome to the media portion of our call. We'll have about 10 minutes for questions, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Noah, can you please provide the instructions again on how to register and ask a question? ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question today from Jeffrey Dastin with Reuters. ","Jeffrey Dastin","How does Delta expect the U.S. market to change once other legacy airlines implement their version of basic economy? And how would that impact Delta, if at all? ","Ed Bastian","Jeffrey, we're not going to speculate on future pricing trends. Right now we feel we've got a good product in the market and we'll see what happens. ","Jeffrey Dastin","And similar to Hunter's question, what is your long term strategy for fending off low cost, long haul carriers from Europe? ","Glen Hauenstein","I think we have to look at our entire service offering and ensure that we're supplying what the market wants to buy. I think what we know is Delta has a very, very strong brand and much stronger than some of the ULCCs and that people would prefer to fly with us than they would on some of the unknown non-brand names. But in many cases we don't have similar configuration, mixes, product offerings and I think that's where we're going to be looking. ","You don't need to create an airline within airline, you just need to adjust to what people want to buy in the marketplace. And the closer we can get to what our customers want to buy in every sector, the more successful we're going to be and Transatlantic is no exception to the rule. ","Jeffrey Dastin","Sorry, just to clarify, would this include basic economy for international? ","Glen Hauenstein","It includes all kinds of fare products, it includes cabins we don't have today and I think that's the exercise we're going through is to see what do people really want to buy and what are they paying for it and how do we capitalize on moving, not providing something that Delta wants to provide, but providing something customers want to buy. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Doug Cameron with Wall Street Journal. ","Doug Cameron","I'll stick with passenger experience too, since I think we've flogged PRASM to death earlier. Incidents involving both passenger and crew electronic devices on flights have been on the rise quite aside from what happened with Samsung. At the same time, the regulations for both transport and tackling incidents, the guidance remains unchanged. If you look at what airlines are doing and in some ways they're exacerbating the problem, more lie-flat seats which can crush phones which don't like to be crushed, more power ports which keeps all those battery chargers charged up. So Ed, I'd like to ask you, how much of a challenge is this for the industry right now? And what is Delta specifically doing to keep ahead or to mitigate the problems that are basically increasing? ","Ed Bastian","Well Doug, it is a challenge but I don't want it to be blown out of proportion either. We've had a very few single digit number of incidents occur. We're certainly reminding our passengers of the requirements, we're educating our crews, we're putting some additional safety elements on board the cabin to help mitigate a smoke situation. But it's not fundamentally different than challenges that we've had for some time. We're aware of the concerns around lithium batteries and we're very mindful of that, safety is always our most important concern. ","Q - Doug Cameron","For the additional safety measures you've taken on board? The elements, sorry, you said elements, what does that mean? ","Gil West","So what we've done is of course really the target training with our flight crews along with equipment. There are some other modifications that we're adding with containment bags as an example, that with any device that did experience a lithium battery fire you can put it in a containment bag that would certainly contain any possible scenario. But there's already equipment on board and has been that's capable with dealing with any of these situations. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News. ","Michael Sasso","The announcement the other day about Richard retiring completely from the company I think caught a number of people off guard and there wasn't much in the release about why. Can you speak to anything about the motivation of why he stepped off so quickly? Certainly there's a lot of speculation about it. ","Ed Bastian","Michael, I'm not going to speculate for Richard other than to say this was all consistent with the plan that we have talked to. I mentioned earlier today that he's given myself as the new CEO and Frank Blake as the new lead Director about six months of transition to make certain everything on the succession was going well. We do think everything is going well and he concluded it was his time to retire, so this was fully anticipated. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Ted Reed with The Street. ","Ted Reed","Ed, you said in opening that this is the weakest revenue environment in recent memory. Were you just referring to RASM trends or to something else? ","Ed Bastian","I was talking of pricing trends that we've seen this year. ","Ted Reed","Just pricing is really weak because of -- ","Ed Bastian","Demand has been strong, but it's related to weak pricing. ","Ted Reed","Okay. And secondly, recently Doug Parker said that the only goal that remains in talks regarding the Mid East three carriers is to eliminate this fifth freedom flights like the Milan flight. Is that your feeling? And what type of progress do you think the State Department is making? ","Ed Bastian","We have reason to believe the State Department is making progress. We're not going to get in front of the State Department by telling them what they need to do specifically, but freezing and\/or eliminating fifths would be a great start. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Edward Russell with Flightglobal. ","Edward Russell","With the further 747 reductions, could you confirm how many 747s Delta will have at the end of this year? ","Glen Hauenstein","Five flying. ","Edward Russell","Sorry, five? ","Glen Hauenstein","Sorry, five flying. ","Edward Russell","Five flying, great, thank you very much. ","Kevin Shinkle","Okay and with that I think we're gone through everybody. Thank you and we will conclude our third quarter earnings call. Thanks again. ","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

Welcome to the Delta Air Lines March Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference. My name is Kelly Ann and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following today's presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Miss. Jill Sullivan Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Jill.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Thanks, Kelly Ann. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for our March quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are Ed Bastian, our incoming CEO, Glen Hauenstein, our incoming President and Paul Jacobson our CFO. We also have the entire leadership team with us in the room for Q&A. Ed will open the call, Glen will then address our revenue performance, and Paul will follow and discuss cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings.","We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Ed.","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Jill. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us. This morning we reported a $1.56 billion pre-tax profit, our 12th consecutive record quarterly result as the business continues to benefit from low fuel prices and solid demand. We held our top line roughly flat, and realized substantial fuel savings which allowed us to expand operating margins by nearly 10 points to 18.5% and generate $1.4 billion in operating cash flows. These are nothing short of outstanding results and what is typically our seasonally weakest quarter of the year, where we also saw additional pressure from the tragic events that occurred in Brussels in late March.","Operationally, we again led the global industry with a 99.4% completion factor and a non time arrival rate of 86.5%. We have 49 perfect main line completion days and six additional days where the only cancelled flights in our network were to Brussels. It\u2019s now more rare to have a day with the cancellation than not on our mainline product. We also had eight days of no cancellations across the entire Delta system, both mainline and regional carriers what we call brand perfect days and we are focussing more and more on the system level performance and working hard to improve on this basis.","With these results, the Delta team proved yet again they are the very best in the industry. I am proud to announce we accrued $272 million in profit sharing this quarter on top of the $23 million in shared rewards they earned. I want to thank the Delta team for a terrific quarter. It\u2019s an honour to be able to lead this great company and serve all of you. I would like to take a moment to thank Richard for his leadership and vision in transforming Delta. Richard has been a great partner and mentor for me for the past decade and while he will be enjoying a well earned retirement, he will always be a trusted friend and advisor and we all benefit from his leadership as the Executive Chairman of our board.","Our strategy is working and our team is fully in place. We\u2019ve got Gil West, our Chief Operating Officer who leads the best team of operators in the industry. Glen Hauenstein, our new President has led our network in revenue transformation over the last decade. Steve Sear has taken us to five consecutive business travel news victories as head of our sales organisation, Paul, Joanne, Peter, Kevin the list goes on. Our bench is deep and we are going to keep building on our momentum.","While we continue to post record profits, we are very aware that fuel prices remain volatile and have increased nearly 60% from the lows earlier this year. For this reason we are determined to get our business back on the path of positive unit revenues because this is how we ensure that the margins and cash flows that we are producing are sustainable for good times and bad. Glen will be describing our actions along this course.","As we look ahead at Delta, we have tremendous momentum in the business while lower for longer fuel prices have added some painful uncertainty to our timeline on getting back to unit revenue growth, they are also driving roughly $3 billion of fuel savings this year and we are committed to pushing as much of that fuel savings to the bottom line as possible.","We estimate that we retained 50% of fuel savings in the first quarter on an ex-hedge basis, on a net hedge basis our fuel savings retention was 75%. We are using the cash flow generated by these record earnings to invest in long term profitable growth opportunities for the business improving the balance sheet by paying down debt and funding the pension and continuing to return cash to owners.","As we\u2019ve done for the past several years, we plan to update you on our long term plan and capital deployment strategy at our upcoming spring analyst meeting which will be held this year on May 16.","I\u2019ve been asked many times over the last couple of months as I take over as CEO as to what my priorities will be as we look to the future. Our goal as a team will be to continue to invest in the initiatives that are producing adorable, sustainable and industry leading foundation at Delta.","First, our top priority is running a safe, reliable and customer focussed operation. This is at the very core of what we do and it is producing meaningful improvements in customer satisfaction. It also translates into our industry leading RASM premium and a more efficient cost structure, both of which contribute to more sustainable margins over the long term.","Second, is enhancing our brand premium. We said before that our product is not a commodity. In order to earn a premium price from customers, we need to produce a premium product and a brand that drives loyalty. That starts with thoughtful service and reliable operations but also includes consistent innovation across the entire travel experience.","Third, you will see us continue on the path towards globalization, whether through initiatives like headquartering our Trans Atlantic operations in Amsterdam, or through our equity stakes in Virgin Atlantic, China, Eastern, Aeromexico and GOL we see the international market place at the source of long term profitable growth opportunities. Our goal is to be the best U.S. global airline.","And finally, we\u2019ll maintain the balanced approach for all our stakeholders. Our employees, our owners and the customers and communities we serve share in Delta\u2019s success. This strategy has driven tremendous value for all our stakeholders amidst the foundation for sustainable performance over the long term. I am excited about the future of Delta Airlines and honoured to lead the very best team of airline professionals in the world. I thank our investors for the trust they place in us and assure you we are working hard to be great stewards of your investment.","With that, I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to my good friend, Glen Hauenstein.","Glen Hauenstein","Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. I would like to start by expressing my deep gratitude to the Delta team for all of their hard work. Taking great care of our customers everyday has resulted in another record quarterly performance. I am honoured and humble to be taking on the role of President at this very exciting time for our company. There are enormous opportunities ahead for our business and I look forward to driving our continued success together.","Our revenues for the quarter were roughly flat to last year, including $125 million headwind from currency and a $5 million impact from the recent events in Brussels. We also maintain our top line performance despite a 40% decline in market field prices. Our corporate demand remains solid with volume growth of 2% this quarter, so our increases across most sectors including healthcare, financial services and technology, however the improvement in volumes is being more than offset by lower yields.","The outlook for corporate demand remains favourable with 82% of respondents to our latest corporate travel manager survey rejecting their overall travel spend will be maintained or increased for the rest of the year. This is consistent with outlooks from previous surveys.","We continue to see good performance with our branded fare initiatives. Total merchandising revenues grew over 30% for the quarter led by Comfort+ growth at 45% and first class revenue growth of 12%.","Basic economy drove roughly $20 million in incremental revenue and we began our broad city level expansion initiative during the quarter. Our partnership with American Express produced $80 million in incremental value this quarter and we expect $265 million in incremental value for the year.","Year-to-date new card acquisitions are at record levels and up substancially from 2015. Spend on our cards is up double digits. We continue to work with our great partners at AmEx to produce innovative program offerings for our customers and continue to grow our portfolio.","Our passenger unit revenues declined 4.6% with roughly two points of the decline attributable to currency. This result was at the low end of our initial guidance as we continued to see choppiness in the domestic gross and yield environment during the quarter. Focussing on our domestic business, unit revenues declined 5% on 6% more capacity with one point of that growth attributable to leap day.","All of our domestic hubs improved margins in the quarter with the best performances in Salt Lake City, Atlanta and Minneapolis. Our investments in markets like New York and Seattle are continuing to pay off as we drove margin expansion in excess of the domestic average in both of these cities.","Our international business is still facing headwinds from foreign exchange and lower fuel surcharges as well as economic and geopolitical challenges in certain regions, all of which we continue to address with capacity actions.","The TransAtlantic entity saw unit revenue decline at 6% on a 3.5% reduction in capacity, driven by a four point\u2019s headwind from currency and pressure on yields as industry capacity grew in the high single digits during the normally slow season.","In our core European markets, U.S. point of sale demand was strong and recovered quickly following the events in Brussels. On the flip side, European point of sales America has been softer largely due to the weaker euro.","We are pleased with our performance in London and we continue to benefit from a deeper integration with Virgin Atlantic and the network changes we made together in 2015. Paris unit revenues improved year-over-year as travel to the region rebounded following the events of last November.","In Latin America, unit revenues were down 9% with 5% of the decline attributable to currency, largely driven by the Brazilian real. Mexico and Caribbean markets performed well during the quarter and have remained resilient throughout the peak spring travel period. Weaker related cancellations had a very small impact on Latin America.","Our Brazil capacity has been reduced by nearly 30% from peak levels while our modest capacity growth has been well absorbed in Mexico and the Caribbean. In the Pacific, RASM declines are moderated with the unit revenues down 5% including roughly 8 points of impact from FX and fuel surcharges.","The Yen was a $35 million headwind in the quarter, $30 million of which was driven by a lower year-over-year hedge case. While the recent appreciation of the yen is a positive for our business we will see roughly a four point headwind to Trans-Pacific RASM from lower hedge gains through the remainder of the year.","Capacity to the Pacific declined 9% this quarter, primarily driven by Japan. This is part of our continuing Pacific restructuring which includes the ongoing retirement of our 747 fleet. Our China business continues to mature as do our partnerships with China Eastern and China Southern.","Today, between 15% and 20% of our customers are travelling beyond Shanghai and Beijing through our partners networks. We expect that number to steadily increase overtime. Demand in China and the broader Pacific held up well for the first quarter although yields remained under pressure due to high levels of industry capacity growth in the region. Looking ahead we are forecasting that second quarter unit revenues will be down 2.5% to 4.5%. The sequential improvement from our first quarter revenue results, on a 2% year-on-year capacity increase.","While we are not there yet, we understand the importance of getting back to positive revenue. Volatility and closer yields and challenges in Europe may mean we achieve our goal a few months later than we previously had expected, but we continued to target reaching the inflection point this year. We have a good line of safety getting there in domestic occurrence encouraged by the recent yield trends which are now beginning to turn positive after being down for roughly a year.","In addition to our domestic capacity, in addition our domestic capacity growth moderates with each successive quarter during the year. In Latin and the Pacific, our capacity actions and restructuring efforts will continue to benefit us, while currency headwinds are also easing. We continue to expect yield revenues to inflect in both entities in the summer time frame.","In the Trans-Atlantic which accounts for 15% to 20% of our revenues is where we have the greatest challenge. Yields remained under pressure as industry capacity growth continues to outstrip demand.","Peak season volumes from U.S. to Europe remained very strong and will drive record profits this summer giving a lot of fuel prices. And one positive is that we will get a big help from currency in returns from the headwinds into a tailwind beginning in the next quarter.","In closing, I would like to reiterate that we are focussed on taking the necessary actions to get the positive RASM in 2016 and ahead of our network competitors, if for no other reason than to get Ed off my back. We will have a line of say to achieving our goal in domestic, the Pacific and Latin America in addressing the headwinds we face in Europe and we will add quickly to move all the levers in our business including capacity if we do not see sufficient progress in the coming months.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to my good friend Paul.","Paul Jacobson","Thanks, Glen, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. While lower fuel cost are providing huge benefits for our business, there is a lot of uncertainty in the global environment and we know fuel won\u2019t stay low permanently. As a result, we remained focussed on staying disciplined with our cost.","Total operating expenses for the quarter however were down more than $1 billion as this decline in fuel cost offset wage increases as well as higher profit sharing expense which doubled versus last year at this quarter.","Non-fuel CASM increased 4.5% including profit sharing, better than our initial expectation with roughly half of that increase coming from higher profit sharing in the quarter. As you may recall, our cost growth is more weighted towards the front half of the year given the timing of last year\u2019s wage increases and this quarter is the peak.","During the quarter, we retired ten older main line aircraft including nine 757 and one 767-300 we removed six 50 seaters from our schedule also during the quarter. We continue to expect our re-fleeting efforts to drive another $350 million of savings in 2016. Our maintenance initiatives benefited us by $90 million in the quarter and we continue to target a $400 million benefit for the full year.","For the second quarter we expect non fuel CASM including profit sharing to increase roughly 2% as our productivity and other cost of initiatives help offset higher wages and product and service investments. CASM growth in the second quarter will be well below 1Q levels as we -- last years April 1st wage increase. We remain on track to keep non fuel cost ex-profit sharing below 2% for the full year.","Moving onto fuel, our total fuel expense declined by $1.5 billion due to lower market fuel prices and lower year-over-year hedge losses. Our all in fuel price was $1.33 per gallon down 55% from the prior year.","The refinery lost a modest $28 million in the quarter while lower crack spreads are a headwind for the refinery they are obviously a significant net benefit for Delta as a whole. Looking ahead we expect an all end June quarter fuel price of $1.48 to $1.53 which is down 40% from prior year. We continue to have no open hedges going forward and anticipate hedge losses of approximately $200 million in each of the remaining quarters this year.","With the combination of the fuel tail wind, our non fuel cost disciple and the sequential improvement in RASM performance Glen discussed we expect another record quarter in June with an operating margin of 21% to 23% a roughly 5 point improvement from the prior year.","On cash flow, we are using our strong cash generation to appropriately balance the long term investments we are making in the business while continuing to return cash to our owners and de-risking the balance sheet. As Ed mentioned, we generated $1.35 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. This was net of $1.5 billion in profit sharing pay-offs to employees for 2015 and $825 million cash contribution to the pension plan. We also contributed $350 million in Delta stock during to the pension during the quarter.","With the additional $100 million in cash we put in the plans this month, we have contributed $1.3 billion in cash and stocks since the beginning of the year. This completes our funding for 2016. We reinvested $870 million back into the business during the quarter. As you may recall we expect higher capital spending in the first half of the year due to the timing of aircraft spend and will spend roughly $1 billion again in the second quarter. Additionally, this year we expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the third quarter.","In the March quarter, we returned $880 million to shareholders including the $350 million accelerated share repurchase we completed to offset the dilution from the contribution to the pension plan.","Adjusted net debt at the end of March was $7 billion, up slightly from year end due to the timing of cash flows including pension funding and profit sharing. And the decision we made to stay on track for a run rate for buy backs during the quarter. We expect our adjusted net debt to be below $6 billion by year end with our cash flow.","We\u2019ve made significant progress on de-levering our business over the last decade and we are pleased to have this recognized with an upgrade by Moody\u2019s to investment grade during the quarter. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank and congratulate the entire Delta team not only for another record quarter but also for achieving our long held goal of returning as an investment grade company. These accomplishments would not have been possible without your determination, dedication and hard work each and every day. Jill, back to you.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Kelly Ann, we are now ready for questions from the analysts, if you could give instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move first to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for the time.","Ed Bastian","Good morning, Duane.","Duane Pfennigwerth","As we look towards the inflection to positive revenue later this year and you touched on some of this, can you just expand your thoughts on kind of domestic versus international? And which international region you might expect that first, specifically Latin America there's been a lot of capacity cuts. Are you any more instructive on getting back to positive unit revenue in that region?","Glen Hauenstein","Duane, this is Glen. I think we are very constructive because the not only do we have some positive chutes in Brazil, both first time in many years our close in bookings have actually provided positive momentum as it closed to -- negative momentum. We are coming off of a very low base in Brazil and as we start to lapse the currency changes I think we are pushing well with the capacity down towards and inflection point later this year.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And so would that be your guess in terms of getting back deposit RASM first?","Glen Hauenstein","No. I think we are already in positive RASM to already in some of our entities including Mexico now in Japan and domestic I think we have a good line of site for peak summer. So I think we have a lot of the network that\u2019s doing better, that\u2019s being also advised some very dramatic decreases in certain geographic areas including Brazil.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks for that color. And then, Paul, could you update us on your latest thinking regarding CapEx for this year and next? How do we think about your narrow body re-fleeting needs relative to kind of that $3 billion core CapEx level that you've outlined?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Duane. I think as we've talked about we're looking at balancing capital against our cash flows and approximately $3 billion remains our goal. We've got needs over the next five to seven years as we think about older narrow bodies, particularly MD-88s and we remained committed to doing that while achieving our EPS goals, achieving our cash flow goal and our balanced capital allocation.","Ed Bastian","Good morning. This is Ed. Let me add a little more to Paul's comments. Our 2016 CapEx guidance remains in line with what we gave you an expectations, there's no changes there. We are in good shape as we look out on our international wide bodies, so there's nothing on that horizon that's changing.","The focus we're in the midst of currently is the domestic fleet renewal over the next five years. It's not a short-term need. It's a medium term need, because MD-88s do need to retire. We have roughly 115 of them currently. And we also need to continue to up gauge our regional flying to the main line which we've had a lot of success in and there is much more to go. And I think we can do it cost effectively.","There's been a lot of media reports. We have nothing to report at this time. There are no decisions taken, so I will not comment on any media reports. What I do hope is that we'll have more information to report and give you that medium term outlook when we meet together next month in New York at the Spring Analyst Meeting, but the one thing you can remain convinced of here at Deltas that we will stay disciplined on capital deployment as always. That will never change.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll hear next from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Hey, good morning.","Ed Bastian","Good morning.","Savi Syth","Just on the domestic capacity, I know in the first quarter you had the increased related to the extra day, but its still about 5.5%, 6% and then if you look at second quarter and I might be reading the schedules wrong, but it showing maybe 4 to 5. So I was wondering does that -- are you still kind of thinking 1% to 3% growth for domestic market in which case maybe second half did you see in the growth is like 1% to 2%. Is that the still the thinking?","Ed Bastian","That is still the thinking and we do deceleration of that growth throughout the year. Thanks to Gil and the team one of the other good benefits we have in the first quarter with a much higher completion factor than we have preview. That was included in the higher number of spend for this quarter as well as the Leap Day. So we do see that number decelerating throughout the year.","Savi Syth","Understood. And then just on the fleet question, Just wondering if you're still finding attractive rates for aircraft to part out and even in midlife aircraft replacement or as you look to your narrow value replacement, are you focusing more on newer aircraft to kind of keep that barbell average age going?","Ed Bastian","Savi, as we said, we have nothing to report on any speculation in the media and we'll wait till we have something to tell, so we can layout what we're doing. But yes, absolutely, we continue to see good opportunities in the part out space and Gill and his team have created a new entity called Delta Material Services where we're going in and saving literally hundreds of millions of dollars in our tech ops and maintenance cost.","Savi Syth","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And from Cowan & Company we'll move to Helane Becker.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. So, I was wondering if you could explain a little more, flush out a little more the trans-Atlantic to comment about over capacity in the market. And I'm asking that within the context of the fact that there are three large JVs that seem to be able to adjust capacity. So, are you seeing other entities outside of the JVs, increase capacity in those part that are you seeing than back selling what you are taking out. So maybe you could just kind of flush that out a little more for me?","Glen Hauenstein","Helane, its Glen. One of the big contributors of course are the ME3, because they are included in our trans-Atlantic capacity. So for example here in Atlanta we have Turkish Airline starting non-stop services into Istanbul this spring. We also have Qatar flying from here to Doha this spring. And the Atlanta to Doha market is less people a day, so they're going to need to fill up on some flow. We don't they'll be successful, but those are capacity that we faced here locally that I think describe type of capacity that's in the trans-Atlantic.","And on the other side in Europe itself you have some of the growth from the ultra low cost carriers that are attempting now to fly in the trans-Atlantic such as Norwegian, as well as some of the majors like Air Canada. So when you add all that together we get a trans-Atlantic capacity increase is in the high single digit, low double digit through peak summer season given the economic outlook for the United States and for Europe, we think demand will grow in the 4%, 5% range and so there is more capacity can be absorb by the increase in natural demand.","Helane Becker","So, just a follow-up on that, are you seeing that pricing being more aggressive in that market and are you concern that if oil prices continue to move up it will pressure margins?","Glen Hauenstein","I think those are always are concerns. I think that the demand that is strong particularly ex U.S. and it's been little bit weaker ex Europe. But if these elevated level stay and fuel goes up and economies don't grow, I think that would be an indication that industry would need to full capacity in order to maintain margins.","Helane Becker","Okay. Thank you, Glen. I appreciate your help.","Glen Hauenstein","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Joseph Denardi with Stifel.","Joseph Denardi","Thanks. Good morning. Glen, just on the domestic side kind of given the slowdown in capacity expected throughout the year. Where are the investments being made now and what market is going to fund the capacity reduction through the year?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, I don't think it's necessarily capacity reduction, but it\u2019s a lapsing of the investments we made last year. So, as we get through the year our capacity in Seattle grew dramatically last year. Our capacity in the Europe grew significantly last year. As we get to that second half of the year those capacity additions start lapping each other.","Joseph Denardi","Okay. Thanks. And then Paul, just on some of the deferral and acceleration transactions you've made with the hedge book, I think that's kind of complicated the cash flows this year and into next year, so I'm just wondering if you kind of where the book stands right now, but what the net cash flows and outflows are this year and next?","Paul Jacobson","Hey, good morning Joe. What we talked about was if you recall at Investor Day \u2013 I'm sorry on the first quarter call that we had locked out the book that's where we sit right now, our expense recognition mirrors those cash flows. So we would expect about $200 million a quarter. We do have some modest quarterly impact in 2017, but it's rather immaterial, the crux about though is like we said the book remains flat and there is no participation, right now, it just sitting there.","Joseph Denardi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And Jamie Baker with JPMorgan has our next question.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning everybody.","Ed Bastian","Hi, Jamie.","Jamie Baker","First one for whoever might want to take it. The second quarter margin guide is healthy, no question about that. But whether or not we include fuel, you know there's traditionally been more improvement from the first quarter to the second, historically for Delta anywhere from call it 500 to 800 basis points. So today's guide is obviously below that range. Shouldn't the consolidated industry be showing a little bit more seasonality, not less as we move into peak periods? Any idea what might be contributing to this?","Paul Jacobson","Hey, Jamie, it's Paul. I'll start and let anybody else chime in that wants to. I think when you look at just where we are in this particular quarter to quarter you've got a move in fuel that, if you just look at our mid point of our guide for 2Q against our 1Q actually is moved up almost $200 million for that impact and while RASM is improving sequentially its not keeping up with that pace in the very, very short term. I don't think that's a judgement on consolidation. I think it just on the volatility of where we are. Despite that move in fuel we're sitting roughly at where ended up at year end.","So I think there's a little bit of intraquarter noise movement going on with the market generation.","Jamie Baker","Okay. That's helpful. Second for Glen, I'm trying to better understand what happened in the last couple of weeks with multisegment, itinerary construction domestically. Its unclear whether or not Delta led the effort, I guess that actually doesn't really matter as much as it seems that the reconstruction is potentially driving firmer RASM on multisegment fares, the type that I would often use if I would jump it around the country on Delta. Can you share any background on this?","Glen Hauenstein","Jamie, as always we don't really comment on fares on this call, so I would like to just \u2013 if you have another question we could answer?","Jamie Baker","No. But I'll end with this. We are with and believing you should be comped against high quality industrial transports, but you listen to the earnings calls from those companies this quarter or any other, most of them are going talk openly about pricing revenue. So high quality industrial transports don't duck and weave in this topic. So just something I would point out I'll pass to mic somebody else?","Glen Hauenstein","Thank you, Jamie.","Operator","And from Wolf Research we'll go to Hunter Keay.","Hunter Keay","Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Ed, I', curious to know what you expect from Richard as his level of involvement of Chairman, you know, how much is enough, how much is too much I should say and how much is not enough and what are your expecting from him and how much are you guys going to communicate maybe between board meetings?","Ed Bastian","Well, Hunter, I don't mean to speak for Richard, but Richard is going to become the Chairman of our Board in a few weeks. And I expect Richard to fulfil the same function enrol that our current Chairman Dan Carp has done very ably for the last seven or eight years. Richard and I obviously very close and we speak a lot. And I would leave it at that.","Hunter Keay","Okay. And Glen, does you on time performance give you the opportunity that maybe tighten some blocks times in order to facilitate maybe some more connecting volumes and maybe this question for you or maybe for Paul, maybe for Gil, he is there, but if you do have some potential CASM pressures in the event that you trim some capacity. How much of that can be offset by tightening some of those block times? Thanks for all time. I appreciated.","Gil West","This is Gil. Thanks for the question. I mean there's a number of variables that drive on-time. I would argue that execution is biggest of those wholly focused around that. Block time plays a role in it, of course the ground time also play a role. We run the tightest ground times in the industry and we try to bias ground time to the tightest for a number of reasons and block more or less average now with the industry maybe a little bit higher.","But we also try to not just blanket block time, we're more surgical about it, I think that's a next level that we continue to drive. But our connections are also a metric and variable that we look at, we run less than a 1% misconnect rate as well, while balancing all of that.","Paul Jacobson","And Hunter, this is Paul. I'll just add there. We're not going to degrade the customer experience, put the customer experience at risk in chasing after CASM goal, nor we're going to add capacity to manage cost, capacity is responsibility of the commercial organization to match the demand and where we see that opportunity. CASM has to be driven by productivity and we're going to continue to do that and if we're successful with that its not going to impact the customer, only enhance their experience.","Hunter Keay","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll move to next to Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi, everyone. Thanks for the time.","Ed Bastian","Hi, Darryl.","Darryl Genovesi","Not to be the dead horse on CapEx, but I saw Paul mentioned a $3 billion number and I just wanted to be perfectly clear on one point and is that -- are you recommitting to your $3 billion stated upper limit on CapEx regardless of which way the MD-80 replacement decision goes?","Paul Jacobson","Darryl we talked about CapEx for 2016 and long-term we mentioned that we've got some domestic fleet renewal needs and we don't have any updates to that number, but I think you need to wait and to see if we make decision along that line and we'll keep you posted.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. Thanks. And then bigger picture question for Ed or Glen, I appreciate and I'm sure most equity investors on this call probably appreciate your admiral goal of getting back to positive year-over-year unit revenue growth. I guess what I'm less certain of is whether sustain unit revenue growth is actually achievable over the next few years with returns running as high as there across the industry, which to me what appear likely to drive continued at least mid single digit supply growth which is kind of what we've been seeing.","So, just wondering and maybe perhaps just focusing on the domestic market assuming the current status flow of kind of low single digit GDP growth, fuel and kind of the low to mid 40s per barrel, and then continued mid single digit, domestic supply growth across the industry, how do you really establish any confidence that, you know, that you can get this sustain unit revenue growth and understandably demand is going to kind of ebb and flow and maybe you can get there for a quarter or two, but just any color on sort of how you can get there and sustain there given the return profile across the industry? Thank you.","Glen Hauenstein","You know If you look back over the last several years we had seven years of unit revenue expansion all of by it looks like about two years of contraction. It will be that two years of contraction which were caused really by fuel price being cut in less than half. And I think if you look at the coloration to fuel and unit revenues over time you'll see a very tight coloration in the longer term.","So depending on what your fuel assumption is if you see fuel bottoming at $27 in the December time period and then you see a gradual improvement. Although longer, lower for longer I think that ultimately will be reflected in ticket prices and that's one of the reasons I think we're relatively confident that we will get to our unit revenue in the back half of the year than we did in the first half of the year.","We coupled that was the foreign exchanges moving from a negative to positive, and I think that shows where we can get to. Back to the domestic arena I do think that most of this decline has been cost by the decrease in fuel.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. Maybe just to play devil's advocate, understanding all the historical metrics that you just laid out, I don't think -- we've really ever seen a period of \u2013 sustain period of time where the Airline industry was putting up a roughly 20% on levered return like it is today, right. So, I think most would agree that's well above the industry's capital and looking across other industries that with that type of excess return would typically lead to outsize growth, right. So I guess I have a little trouble understanding how the industry goes about getting price and how Delta goes about getting price with that kind of return backdrop and the likely supply trends that it would drive?","Glen Hauenstein","I just would comment, I think we have the very best revenue team in the business and I think that we are very confident that we have a path forward and there is more revenue for us to garner from particularly corporate as we continue to separate ourselves from the pack in terms of our products and services.","And really that's what our futures about; it's about getting pay for the high quality of services that buy in this national transportation network. So, if you spend some time I will walk you through some of the initiatives in more great detail, but we really do thing that we are poised to separate from the pack here.","Ed Bastian","And Darryl, this is Ed. Just to what Glen was saying. This is a different business and this is a different company and you also have to keep in to account the level of cash that we're generation and putting back into product and services and producing a product that customers want to buy and investing in segmentation technologies and merchandizing opportunities in corporate volume and volumes have stayed strong throughout this period. So, I'm optimistic we'll continue to produce the results that we talk about and we'll have \u2013 it\u2019s a good question, we'll talk more in the spring meeting about that.","Darryl Genovesi","Great. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","We'll move next to Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan McKenzie","Hey, good morning. Thanks. Looking out this summer, Europe really strikes me as a wild card, the best case scenario under our Brexit looks pretty deem, so I'm guessing the unit revenue outlook for the second quarter doesn't factoring Brexit, but I believe the demand trends were weaken even before the Brussels attack. So I'm wondering if you can provide some additional color about what's factored into the outlook exactly on this entity, so perhaps a trend line of continued decay, and then just remind what percent of the revenue is tied to the U.K. specifically?","Glen Hauenstein","U.K. specifically is probably for us less than 3%, but demand trends for the summer demand itself is strong, yields are relatively weak and lot of that was because of the currency devaluation, but now we are lapping that. So as we move forward from this point we should see actually a tailwind from the euro exchange rate.","So, your question kind of indicates doom and gloom. We will confidently say that we have record profits in the trans-Atlantic this summer that's with the high degree of confidence that our profits will be at historic highs trans-Atlantic this summer.","And as we get to June and as we usually do we'll assess what demand trends we see it for the off season and then we will take the appropriate adjustments if necessary to ensure that we have the right level of capacity in for the fall and winter.","Dan McKenzie","That's good color. Thanks, Glen. Following up, the GBTA forecast for corporate travel spends was revised downward this week. So I'm wondering if you can provide some color around this revenue bucket for Delta. Is the spend deteriorated somewhat, or are you expecting spend to perhaps trend a little bit more strongly this year? Just wondering what color you can share along those lines.","Ed Bastian","Dan, this is Ed. The GBTA report as I recall, I'd look at quickly the other night indicated that demand continues to grow, volume continues to grow and that's what we're seeing in our corporate space, our volumes were up in Q1 and our forecast through the summer and rest of the year for volumes still continue to grow. I think the numbers that they've revised down was more reflective of the current pricing environment in which fares our lower than were previously anticipated in the closing space. And I think \u2013 but we're not seeing any trend lines to give as pause.","Dan McKenzie","Very good. Thanks guys.","Operator","From Stephens, we'll hear from Jack Atkins.","Jack Atkins","Good morning guys. Thanks for - ","Glen Hauenstein","Welcome.","Jack Atkins","As it relates to rising fuel prices, I was just curious how quickly may you'll be able to pass that through higher fares. What sort of lag before that's reflected RASM?","Ed Bastian","Jack, you're breaking up, we're having real hard time hearing your question.","Jack Atkins","Sorry about that, is that any better?","Ed Bastian","Yes, it is.","Jack Atkins","Okay, great. So as it relates to rising fuel prices, I'm curious how quickly you would be able to pass that through via higher PRASM. What sort of lag would you anticipate with as fuel goes up before you'll be able to pass that through via PRASM?","Ed Bastian","That's hard to speculate on. Historically there's been a like and I think its anywhere from one to two quarters before RASM and volume adjustments get made to keep track of rising fuel price itself. Current environment is different than anything we've seen before at the same time, so it would be hard to speculate.","Jack Atkins","Okay. Then specifically with regard to the second quarter PRASM guide, what sort of FX impact is baked in there? If you could share that, that would be helpful.","Glen Hauenstein","I think its one point.","Jack Atkins","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And Rajeev Lalwan with Morgan Stanley has our next question.","Rajeev Lalwan","Hi, gentlemen, thanks for the time. Just as it relates to the June guide are you assuming the margin environment carries forward? And then just coming back to business travel, have you noticed any changes as far as policy shifts on the corporate side?","Ed Bastian","On the policy side, no, we're not seeing any significant shifts. And I'd say the Q2 guide is roughly in line with the trend lines that we closed out the first quarter at.","Rajeev Lalwan","Okay. And then just one other quick one, I think Glen you mentioned earlier that you're seeing some encouraging trends on the domestic front; can you just talk a little bit more about what exactly that was and implications for it?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, for many months and quarters now we've had advanced domestic yields and as they sit on the books for the out months in negative territory and as we get to summer of this year, peak summer of this year for the first time and quite a while the advanced bookings and advanced yield trends are favourable to the baseline Europe 12 months ago.","So, that is optimistic and now we have to do is get through that whole booking cycle all the way down the day of departure and keep in the positive territory. When you're sitting out at 30, 60, 90 days with the minus three or minus four it's harder to make it up inside that. So that's kind of the trajectory we're on and seeing a much more favourable advanced book than we've had in the past.","Rajeev Lalwan","Okay. Thanks for the time and congrats on all the new roles.","Glen Hauenstein","Thank you.","Operator","And from Deutsche Bank, Mike Linenberg.","Richa Talwar","Hey, everyone. Its actually Richa Talwar on behalf of Mike. Good morning.","Glen Hauenstein","Good morning.","Richa Talwar","So first, we would be curious to hear Delta's stance on slot restrictions at Newark airport being lifted in October. Does that represent a growth opportunity for you? And how do you think it will impact the New York market maybe more broadly and fit into your New York strategy?","Glen Hauenstein","New York is a very congested area in terms of capabilities, in terms of aerospace and it\u2019s a very complex and incredibly expensive environment to operate in. And so, well, we are enthusiastic about Newark's slot restrictions being lifted. We are also realistic that their airport does not have an infinite number of or infinite capability to handle traffic. So we will examine the options very carefully and see what it is we do to improve our position in Newark, but I don't see a significant amount for us in Newark.","Richa Talwar","Okay, great. Thanks. And then second, regarding the financial difficulties your Brazilian Partner is going through, we know GOL has a number of fairly young aircraft that it's looking to restructure with lessons. And it's been reported that Delta is in the market right now, as you've commented multiple times for narrow body jets. So is there a happy harmony on the table where you consider using some of their lift? Is that an outcome you would consider? Or are you really just opting for new aircraft or a different avenue as you consider your replacement needs?","Ed Bastian","This is Ed. We are working very closely with our good partners down in Brazil and they are certainly through a reduction of their fleet. We haven't made any decisions yet as to whether there would be some of the aircraft that we would take either through addition into our fleet or to part out opportunities, but we're dialogue with them. We're not the only individuals at the table because there's number of lessors are also talking about sending aircraft back to.","Richa Talwar","Okay. Thanks for that color.","Jill Sullivan Greer","And we got time for one more question from the analyst.","Operator","Okay. That will be from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Ed Bastian","Good morning, Julie.","Julie Yates","Glen, is there any color you can provide geographically on domestic RASM, pockets of strength and weakness? I think last year you called out three specific markets as driving the bulk of the weakness. Is it still a similar story, or was the weakness in Q1 more widespread?","Ed Bastian","I would say that we saw a deepening of the number of markets that were impacted by lower close-in-fares.","Julie Yates","Okay, great. Can you quantify that just in terms like the number of top 10 markets that are affected or?","Ed Bastian","I think what we can do is we can get back to you on that in terms of more specifics, because it is a much more widespread phenomenon than it was. Last year was really just in some key business markets and now it has broader implications. The good news is that the numbers haven't gotten worst so they tend to balance out in demand, but it is different than it was a year ago.","Julie Yates","Okay. And then just on the Q2 unit revenue guide of down 2.5% to down 4.5%, what's the underlying assumption for domestic versus international? And I'm curious if the sequential improvement is mostly a function of lapping the international headwinds like FX and surcharges, or if you expect domestic to materially improve from the down 4.8% given the comments you made on advanced bookings?","Ed Bastian","As we get through the peak summer we do expect domestic to improve from where we are sitting in March. May maybe a choppy month, but I think June and July will be very solid, and we do get one point reduction or point and a half on the currency headwinds as well. So I think we have some good visibility to peak summer, second quarter isn't the peak for domestic. July is really peak, and that's really where we headed to try and get a positive RASM in domestic, we'll see if we can get there.","Julie Yates","Okay, great. Thanks for fitting me in.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks Julie.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Thanks, Julie. And that is going to conclude the analyst portion of the call. I'll hand it over to Kevin Shinkle, our Chief Communications Officer.","Kevin Shinkle","Welcome everybody. We've about 10 minutes to take questions from journalists, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Kelly Anne if you could provide the instruction again on how to register to ask the question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move to Dennis Schaal with Skift.","Dennis Schaal","Hello, everyone. I was wondering if you see any challenges for Delta in Alaska Air's merger with Virgin America? And also, JetBlue announced this week that they are expanding Mint service into Seattle. How will these changes impact Delta?","Ed Bastian","Your question was high, I didn't fully hear your question, its high, how does the Alaska\/Virgin proposed merger impact Delta?","Dennis Schaal","Yes. Yes, as well as JetBlue expanding Mint service into Seattle.","Ed Bastian","Seattle we're doing quite well. We continue to grow there. We had a very good margin in the first quarter and I think our outlook is strong there. We're not going to comment on proposed transaction. We'll react when we see what happens in the marketplace.","Dennis Schaal","Okay, thanks.","Edward Bastian","On the Mint product between Seattle and JFK and Boston, we currently have flatbeds on a single flight between our two flights between New York and Seattle. We had already in the plans to make sure that we had a consistent product in terms of flatbeds seats in key time channels between the two markets. That's not all time channels, but on the red eye, certainly we will have flatbed product in Seattle to New York.","Dennis Schaal","Great.","Ed Bastian","We hosting our plans before Mint announced this.","Dennis Schaal","Got it. The other question was on basic economy. I think you said that it drove $20 million in incremental revenue in the quarter. Are you happy with that number? And are you not seeing significant dilution from passengers who would have otherwise purchased higher fares?","Glen Hauenstein","You know basic economy is really design for customers who solely are purchasing on price and I think our value proposition relative to the ultra low cost carriers is very, very strong. We have great customers, great operational reliability, great baggage delivery and we already have a lot of things that on other ultra low cost carriers are not free like. We don't charge for space in overhead bins.","So if you're stopping for just solely price we want to have a product that can compete effectively and provide the best services against carriers who are providing a much lower quality of service. And I think that's what this is design for.","And what we're seeing is when presented with the options and the really the way we get to the $20 million value is those customers when they were informed of what those product was show something else. And that's really how we get to that $20 million value. Remember it's really only in about 400 to 500 markets, now we have over 20,000 domestic markets. So our plan is over the next weeks and months we continue to roll it out. So we do have a great value proposition for people who are just looking for lowest possible fare.","Dennis Schaal","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And from the Wall Street Journal we hear from Susan Carey.","Susan Carey","Good morning gentlemen. Could you remind what your operating margin was in the end in the first quarter?","Paul Jacobson","The first quarter it was 18.5% Susan.","Susan Carey","Thank you. And secondly, there's a little tussle going on between the EU and the U.S. and Canada about possibly ending the visa waiver program. Apparently it's not settled yet, but are you thinking ahead to a possible negative impact if U.S. citizens have to apply for visas to go to France or something?","Ed Bastian","We're not anticipating that Susan.","Susan Carey","You think it will be solved then.","Ed Bastian","We don't have enough information, we don't have an informed opinion at this point, so I'd say, we're not making any plans.","Susan Carey","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to David Koenig with the Associated Press.","David Koenig","Really you answered the question I was going to ask, which was about basic economy. Just one other thing is the entry of American and United into that market this year, how is that going to -- do you expect how that will affect you?","Ed Bastian","We really don't have the details yet on what American and United product is, but I think we are consistent in saying whatever that product is, we want to have the best in class for it and we will make adjustments as necessary to make sure that for people who are just travelling on price as the only decision maker that Delta always offers the best product offering.","David Koenig","I guess what I\u2019m getting at. Let\u2019s assume for argument sake that American and United do something similar to what you\u2019ve done, you know it doesn\u2019t that you just kind of divide up whatever that market is and might that 20 million in incremental revenue you saw in the first quarter be a high water mark?","Ed Bastian","I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, so we can take that offline and discuss it with you but I think it might be the opposite.","David Koenig","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News has our next question.","Michael Sasso","Yeah, good morning. Could you just elaborate a little bit on your discussions with GOL particularly you were talking about doing you know maybe taking back some jets from them, what exactly, what are the range of options that Delta is considering regarding GOL and its aircraft.","Ed Bastian","Well Michael there is no decisions taken yet because GOL is still working through the impact with its -- and creditors down there but GOL has been public that there is a considerable amount of their capacity that they are reducing. And we as a number of stakeholders in GOL are looking at it whether there are some opportunities to take from used aircraft and either to enter into service and then induct or to part out those opportunities in both spaces.","Michael Sasso","Any specific types of aircraft you might look at?","Ed Bastian","There are only five 737 so \u2026","Michael Sasso","All right.","Operator","And from TheStreet we\u2019ll move to Ted Reed.","Ted Reed","Thank you. Glen, did you say that between Atlanta and Doha, there is only five O&D passengers a day, so and I think you said that, so do you have any routes like that. And secondly, do you guys feel there is a resolution coming in this dispute with the mid east carriers?","Glen Hauenstein","Well Ted you know I would -- we don\u2019t have any markets that we buy half way across the world, they had less than 10 people and I don\u2019t think you will find many carriers in the world. So I don\u2019t know what the latest is, maybe I\u2019ll turn that over to Peter and he will inform you on what the latest is\u2026","Peter Carter","I will tell you, this is Peter. This is our number one priority in Washington. We have reason to believe that the U.S. government is going to do the right thing and having said that because this is fundamentally a diplomatic process it will take some time.","Ted Reed","So nothing came in from the U.S. government? Nothing we are aware of.","Peter Carter","Nothing we are aware and Ted we do have some markets that we have four or five passengers and we call that Delta private jets.","Ted Reed","All right. Thank you.","Peter Carter","Thanks Ted.","Operator","And Kelly Yamanouchi with the Atlanta Journal Constitution has our next question.","Kelly Yamanouchi","Hi there, I was just interested in finding out how the current environment in your outlook as it stands effective, how does contract negotiations as you go into mediation and any time frame that you might have for reaching a deal there?","Ed Bastian","We are not going to comment publicly fairly on the status of the negotiations were. At the table we are working hard, our pilots are the best and we want our pilots to be paid the best and that\u2019s our commitment to them.","Kelly Yamanouchi","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And from Reuters we\u2019ll move to Jeffrey Dastin.","Jeffrey Dastin","Thanks very much. Has Delta considered starting direct flights into China\u2019s interior now that more of its customers are travelling beyond Beijing and Shanghai?","Ed Bastian","You know we have some great partners in China with China Eastern and China Southern and similar to how we transfer customers to our European Partners, AFKL and AZ, we think that the next few years is about continuing to develop those primary gateways in Beijing and Shanghai. And as you may know we\u2019ve applied to our new services during this December from Los Angeles to Beijing and that\u2019s going to be our focus for 2016 and 2017 as to our work to get that route and initiate it successfully.","Jeffrey Dastin","Thank you. And a brief follow up regarding the region. Does Delta have an update on talks to strengthen its partnership with Korean Air?","Ed Bastian","We are always in discussions with our partners to strengthen and Korean Air is no exception. And as the landscape in the Pacific continues to evolve and the geographies change, we think Korean is a very very important partner for our success in that region in the future and I know they feel the same way about Delta.","Jeffrey Dastin","Thank you very much.","Ed Bastian","And we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that will be from Edward Russell with Flightglobal.","Edward Russell","Hi yes, could you comment on the Haneda day time slots and does Delta plan to seek all of them if they are available in the proceeding later this year?","Ed Bastian","As you may know there are five daylight frequencies available to U.S. carriers. We are in the process of filing our route case and that will become public here in the next couple of week, but before that happens we probably would refrain from commenting on it.","Edward Russell","Okay, one follow up. What was the opening -- due to your Narita hub considering your earlier comments on playing down Narita?","Ed Bastian","You know we have continued to de-emphasize Narita over the last several years and we will continue on that process. Haneda probably accelerates that process by a little bit as we look through the fall of scheduled period.","Edward Russell","Thank you.","Ed Bastian","Thank you. And with that we\u2019ll conclude our earnings conference call. Thanks to everyone for listening.","Operator","Again, that will conclude today\u2019s conference.

Our strong cash generation continued with 1.3 billion of operating cash flow and over 9 million of free cash flow for the quarter.","Year-to-date, we have generated 4.3 billion of operating cash flow and 2.8 billion of free cash flow, which has allowed us to fund 900 million to our pension plans, reduce 2 billion of net debt, and return more than 775 million to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks. We continue to run by a very wide margin the industry\u2019s best operations.","In the September quarter, we delivered a 99.7% completion factor including 15 days with zero mainline cancellations. Our on-time rate improved 2.5 points to 85.6 and our customer satisfaction scores are climbing as our customer complains decreased by 3% as we consistently ranked number two fewest DOT customer complains. These operational results are a testament to how hard our employees are working across the system to raise the bar for our customers. We thank them for our service and we know that we have huge improvement opportunities ahead in our operation.","We showed our appreciation for our employees\u2019 performance on October 3rd when we paid out an advance of 305 million on our 2014 profit sharing equal to 5% of our employees\u2019 pay, which is an addition to the 24 million in shared rewards payments this quarter. We know that Delta\u2019s positive employee culture differentiates us from our competitors and we reward our employees with pay for performance through our profit sharing program and shared rewards. This alignment reduces risk and when employees have a vested interest in the future profitability of the company, they take great care of our customers, they take great care of each other. This drives revenue growth and better returns for our owners.","Six months ago, we raised the bar on our long-term financial goals and we attempt to continue to improve on our financial and operating results. This quarter shows our steady execution even in the midst of a choppy global economy. We also know we have more work and more opportunity ahead of us to reduce the level of risk in our business and continue to deploy our cash flow for our owners. This will strengthen our foundation and drive greater sustainability in our results regardless of the global environment.","There are three key areas that we\u2019ll de-risk going forward in our business. The first is the continuation of our capacity discipline. As margins continue to improve, a conservative level of growth is appropriate and we\u2019ll drive higher profits, expanded returns, and improved cash flows for our shareholders. We plan to keep our system capacity fairly disciplined at about the rate of growth of GDP. Through steep density increases and up gauging, we can generate modest capacity increases on a smaller fleet count. Since 2009 we have reduced our fleet by 200 airplanes, while we\u2019re still finalizing next year\u2019s plan and will have the details that our Investor Day in December, we\u2019re targeting overall 2015 system capacity growth at approximately 2%.","In the trans-Atlantic this summer the industry was pressured by excess capacity growth. Despite the capacity situation, our trans-Atlantic profitability increased year-over-year and again we produced really good double-digit margins with a very significant low factor premium to the industry. The industry capacity picture has changed significantly in the trans-Atlantic from where it stood three months ago. Together with our JV partners we have adjusted our course and we\u2019ll limit JV capacity growth to around 1% to 3% this winter, a level that is appropriate within the current demand environment.","This capacity reduction in the trans-Atlantic has freed up smaller gauge right by the aircraft that we can now redeploy to the Pacific allowing us to accelerate plans to retire our entire fleet of 16 747-400s. We\u2019ve already retired three in September and another one this quarter. Four more will be retired in 2015 and the remainder will exit the fleet by 2017. These retirements will be margin accretive and are expected to generate $100 million next year in operating contribution.","The second aspect of risk reduction is diversifying our revenue base by widening our global footprint, building immunized joint ventures internationally with our equity investments and expanding our ancillary and merchandizing offerings. These types of changes are building a more stable revenue base and reducing business risk. In just the September quarter, we saw more than 20% revenue growth from some of our ancillary product initiatives.","The final aspect is continuing to reduce financial risk. We are going to keep paying down debt. High quality industrial companies have investment grade balance sheets and their low interest expense allows them to consistently produce profits even in cyclical industries. With our recent S&P upgrade, we are two notches away from investment grade. We have reduced our debt levels by nearly $10 billion over the last five years, which is saving us more than $0.5 billion per year in interest expense compared to 2009. We are on-track to reduce our debt level below 7 billion at year-end and all the way down to 5 billion by 2016. We will continue to see the benefit to our earnings as our interest expense declines.","Deploying our capital in a balanced manner is essential for our long-term success. To this end we will invest approximately 50% of our operating cash flow back into the business, keeping our capital expenditures in the 2 billion to 3 billion range. Through a combination of new and used aircraft purchases and right now given the huge glut of airplanes in the global market, we\u2019ll have great opportunities for used aircraft purchases in the future. We are very disciplined in all of our capital spending and we have a path to keep our capital expenditures easily within these ranges while keeping our fleet vibrant.","With roughly 3 billion in free cash flow each year, we will continue to pay down debt, address our pension obligations and return more cash to our shareholders. As our net debt goes down and our free cash flow improves, our Board is quite focused on meeting ROIC goals, while continuously improving our shareholder capital returns. We have shown our commitment to return capital to our owners. In our initial capital deployment plan announced less than 18 months ago, we envisioned returning approximately $350 million per year. We will return more than 1 billion this year and have already completed more than 15% of our $2 billion share repurchase authorization in the first four months.","We will update our share repurchase progress at our December Investor Day. To reiterate we\u2019re on a long-term path to consistently deliver top-quality results and to be the best in the global airline industry. In closing while we are consistently producing record profitability we know there is more work ahead. For the fourth quarter, we expect 10% to 12% operating margins and a full year pre-tax profit comfortably above 4 billion. We have the right foundation in place, a clear direction where we want to take this company over the long-term and 80,000 Delta employees who are the very best in the industry.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed.","Ed Bastian","Thanks Richard. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. With the September quarter we reported a $1.64 billion pre-tax profit, which was a $431 million improvement year-over-year. Our net income was a $1 billion or $1.20 per share. Our results this quarter would not have been possible without the contributions made by the entire Delta team. I am pleased to say that we have set aside $384 million in profit sharing for the results this quarter, bringing us to a total of $823 million accrued so far this year. And we expect to payout a $1 billion total for 2014, our highest profit sharing ever representing about 15% of pay.","Turning to the specifics for the quarter, we grew our top-lines by 7% on a 3% increase in capacity. Our corporate revenues increased 6% compared to last year with continuing double-digit gains from the financial services and automotive sectors and high single-digit gains in the banking and media sectors. Our merchandizing and ancillary initiatives continue to exceed expectations and generated $290 million of revenues for the quarter with more than 20% revenue growth in the paid first-class upsell and Economy Comfort products. Our first-class upsell initiative helped push paid first-class load factors up more than 6 points to 44%.","Looking at unit revenues, our passenger RASM increased 2.4% with yields up 1.9%. The domestic entity was our top performer with 5% unit revenue improvements on 2% higher capacity. We continue to see solid results in New York. LaGuardia\u2019s performance outpaced the domestic entity with 10% unit revenue growth and the Transcon saw RASM gains despite 20% capacity growth. Our Atlantic domestic unit revenues were up 8% driven by near double-digit yield improvements in both the local business and leisure segments.","Seattle\u2019s domestic performance has significantly exceeded our expectations as unit revenues increased 6% on a 25% increase in capacity driving margin improvements year-over-year. Our decision to shift capacity out of Cincinnati and Memphis to build out the Seattle Hub is producing solid results. In the trans-Atlantic our unit revenues were flat with a 4% increase in capacity despite 1.5 points of RASM pressure from the events affecting Moscow, Tel Aviv and West Africa. Our joint venture with Virgin Atlantic is doing well with a 4% RASM gain and a 17% increase in profitability on a combined 7% increase in capacity.","Turning to the Pacific, the yen weakness contributed to unit revenue underperformance as unit revenues were down 2% on flat capacity. Yen revenues declined $20 million net of hedges. We are addressing this performance with our Pacific restructuring. And finally in the Latin entity our unit revenues were down 5% on more than 15% higher capacity as we continue to invest in this part of our network. While we have relatively small exposure to Venezuela and Argentina those two markets accounted for half of the unit revenue decline in the Latin entity. In addition, the entity faced headwinds from the World Cup this summer especially in Brazil. We are now seeing good recovery in this demand.","AeroMexico contributed more than 20% of the traffic into our key Mexican markets. And GOL contributed nearly 30% of the traffic from the U.S. to Brazil. Combined, this traffic generated $40 million of incremental revenues for the quarter. Our investments in these two carriers are proving to be beneficial.","Now looking ahead to the December quarter, the overall revenue environment remains solid. And we expect to produce a 0% to 2% unit revenue gain which combined with a significant decline in fuel prices will lead to continued margin expansion. There will be some noise between the individual months due to the timing of the ThanksGiving holiday with the Sunday ThanksGiving return traffic which is our largest revenue day of the year shifting back into November this year. For the quarter, we expect approximately 3% capacity growth. This top-line revenue of about 5%, combined with lower fuel prices and other cost productivity, will help drive an estimated 10% to 12% operating margin for the quarter, which is a 200 to 300 basis point margin expansion and also represents a 300 to 400 basis point pre-tax margin expansion.","We\u2019re obviously most levered to the domestic system with more than 60% of our revenue generated in that entity. And domestic continues to perform well. Our ThanksGiving and advanced unit revenues are up about 8% and the Christmas New Year\u2019s bookings look solid. The biggest driver of our domestic profitability improvement over the last two years has been our upgauging initiative which continues to drive higher unit revenues, lower unit cost and expanded domestic margins. We still have considerable opportunity ahead in this area as we reguage the domestic airline.","Probably the biggest sorts of questions we currently get from investors is how we\u2019re managing the international entities in the current environment. Optimizing the international network is one of the best opportunities we have to continuing to improve margins and returns. Capacity discipline is especially important to this effort. And to this end, our plan is to keep our international capacity growth relatively flat next year.","In the trans-Atlantic, capacity levels have been recalibrated to the current demand environment working with our JV partners we lowered our growth plans to 1% to 3% for the winter with a similar level of growth plan for 2015. While our overall trans-Atlantic capacity will modestly grow, we have very different approaches to capacity within the entity. Our primary growth area is London. The Delta Virgin Atlantic combined capacity into London is expected to increase 2.6% in the winter as growing demand is supported by our new joint venture. London-Heathrow continues to be a bright spot as we have seen our JV margins expand 270 basis points year-to-date.","For the remainder of Europe, we expect our capacity to increase just over 1 point with our major focus continuing on optimizing capacity between Delta\u2019s U.S. hubs and the Paris and Amsterdam hubs of Air France-KLM. Offsetting this growth however, our capacity reductions in the areas that continue to have demand volatility, Moscow, Tel Aviv, and West Africa. Through a combination of down-gauging, reducing frequencies and cancelling service to Liberia, we have reduced our capacity by 20% in these effected markets, which is in line with current demand trends. And to put into context, these markets represent approximately 1% of our overall system-wide capacity.","Looking at our Latin network, we\u2019re now entering the later stages of our investment with double-digit capacity growth in the December and March quarters followed by low single-digit capacity changes from that point forward. This density is absorbing our capacity investment quite well excluding Venezuela we\u2019re on-track to produce unit revenue gains in the December quarter on 15% capacity growth. We expect Latin\u2019s performance to further improve in 2015 as we annualize our capacity adds and our relationship with AeroMexico and GOL mature. By far the greatest potential that we had is with our Pacific restructuring. While there is still a lot of work to be done in the region it continues to be pressured by a weakening yen, we have an aggressive strategy to improve our margins and returns and we have a three-pronged approach to restructuring the Pacific.","First, we\u2019re adjusting our capacity levels. Our Pacific capacity will decline in the high single-digits next year with a 25% to 30% reduction in our low yielding intra-Asia flying. Second, we\u2019re getting the gauge rate regarding our aircraft in the market. We\u2019ve retired the first 4747s this year with the remainder set to exit the fleet over the next two to three years. This year we\u2019re backfilling a portion of this capacity with smaller gauged aircraft moved from the trans-Atlantic and as we take delivery of new Airbus 330s next year, this will help facilitate the retirement of the remaining 747s. The 747 retirement should improve our Pacific profitability by $100 million next year.","And finally, we\u2019re adjusting our hub structure. Although it remains a very important asset to our network, we\u2019re reducing our reliance on connecting traffic in Tokyo and leveraging the size and scale of our domestic network through our Seattle Hub as we introduce additional direct service from the U.S. to Asia. All of these initiatives are already in motion and we\u2019ll drive returns in the region over the next several years consistent with our long-term financial goals. I\u2019ll conclude by simply saying that not only do we have a lot of opportunity to generate additional value from our international network, but we also have a clear plan on how we\u2019re going to get there. We\u2019ll continue to be disciplined with our capacity and focused on improving our margins and our returns.","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Paul to go through the details on our cost and cash flow performance.","Paul Jacobson","Thank you, Ed, and good morning everybody, and thank you joining us today. Our ongoing focus on cost performance was a significant contributor to our margin expansion this quarter. Total operating expenses increased by $320 million for the quarter with almost half of that driven by higher profit sharing expense. We held our non-fuel unit costs flat for the quarter marking the 5th consecutive quarter with ex-fuel CASM growth below 2%. This is further confirmation that our cost initiatives are delivering the benefits that we expected and with the organization rally behind this, we expect that trend to continue.","One of our larger cost initiatives this year is the domestic re-fleeting. During the quarter, we took delivery of 22 aircraft and retired a total of 34 including 24 50 seaters. This strategy is producing significant operating leverage as we\u2019ve generated 2% higher domestic capacity year-to-date on 4.5% fewer departures. As we continue to retire 50 seaters in older mainline aircraft next year, we expect to see benefits and lower maintenance costs from a combination of avoided maintenance events and the ability to recycle parts from the retired fleet for use on the active fleet. This initiative drove $35 million of maintenance savings in the September quarter alone.","While the growth rate of non-fuel unit costs in the December quarter should increase from recent levels due to the timing of the off peak maintenance events, we still expected to be less than 2% and in line with our long-term cost goal. Moving onto the fuel, our fuel expense for the quarter decreased by $23 million as lower fuel prices and the refineries improved profitability more than offset the increase in consumption from capacity growth. Our fuel price for the quarter was $2.90 per gallon with the benefit of $63 million of hedge gains in the quarter, an equivalent level to last year despite lower market fuel prices.","The refinery made a $19 million profit for the quarter which lowered our fuel price by $0.02 per gallon. The refinery\u2019s profit represents a $16 million improvement over the same period last year. A key driver of the profitability was our domestic crude initiative as we processed 100,000 barrels per day of domestic crude during the quarter. We are on-pace to achieve our goal of averaging 70,000 barrels per day for the full year, which should increase to 100,000 barrels per day in 2015. For the December quarter, we\u2019re expecting to pay $2.69 to $2.74 per gallon for fuel including the refinery and hedge impacts. This includes the projected profit of the refinery of $20 million driven by widening crack spreads. The refinery team is running a great operation and continuous to generate meaningful year-over-year improvements there.","At current crude prices, we\u2019ll have approximately $100 million of hedge losses in the December quarter while our 2015 hedge book is near breakeven with a solid amount of protection at current price levels. Even with these hedge losses, we\u2019ve participated in 80% of the price declines since late June. With the expected December quarter losses, our hedges reduced our overall fuel costs by roughly $160 million for 2014.","Turning to cash, our strong cash generation continued to differentiate us from the industry. This quarter we generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and reinvested $411 million into the business primarily related to fleet. In the fourth quarter, we expect to spend $800 million on capital expenditures which will bring our total CapEx to approximately $2.3 billion for the year. With another quarter of solid cash generation ahead of us, we\u2019re on-track to produce $3.5 billion of free cash flow this year. We used that to continue to strengthen the balance sheet and return cash to shareholders with our $910 million of free cash flow during the quarter. Our adjusted net debt is down to $7.4 billion which held lower our interest expense by $60 million versus last year.","We have a clear line of site to achieve our $5 billion adjusted net debt targeted 2016. During the September quarter, we also returned $325 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. We paid out $75 million in dividends as we increased our dividend by 50% to $0.09 per share. In addition, we repurchased $250 million in shares during the quarter. Once again I want to thank the entire Delta team for another record breaking quarter. Our performance this quarter and throughout this year shows what we can do when we all work together to drive change and deliver results. Congratulations to each of you on a great quarter. Jill?","Jill Sullivan Greer","Thanks, everyone. Before I move to the Q&A, I just want to take a minute and remind everybody about our December Investor Day. We will have more details out shortly, but for now please mark your calendars for December 11th. So Kellian, if we could have the instructions as to how to ask the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll hear first from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners","Hi, good morning. I wonder, on your 2015 hedge book, if you could just give us a sense for how hedged you are and where the floors are on that. And then just remind us. When we see the mark-to-market changes on your book, should we interpret those as cash changes, or is some of that non-cash until it is realized? Thanks.","Richard Anderson","Sure, good morning Duane. For 2015, we are hovering around 30% to 40% hedged at current levels. We\u2019ve got significant downside participation even from these levels down. But we managed the book day-to-day basis, so that can change overtime, but we feel very good about where we\u2019re positioned for 2015. You have to remember for mark-to-market we do not use FAS 133. So for other carriers and comparisons those changes go straight to equity. But those are largely non-cash for this quarter, the bulk of it was the reversal of prior gains in the hedge book and that\u2019s what has positioned us. So it tends to be a little bit noisy during these times but it doesn\u2019t represent necessarily cash losses.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners","Okay, thanks. Then just had one on your -- it seems like you are making some changes around your basic Economy product. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about some of those changes. Should we think about this as revenue initiatives in 2015, or is this unbundling effort a competitive response? And thanks for taking the questions.","Richard Anderson","I think you would look at basic economy, as we want to be best in class in every sector we reserve and if you think about airlines we don\u2019t -- we are so large in terms of domestic capacity that we don\u2019t get the choice to really be high-end brand, a medium brand and a lower brand. So, we have to create those brands within the master brand and when we compete against Spirit of course or other ultra low cost carriers we always want to have the best product competing against us. And so the products that we\u2019re introducing in basic economy you get the reliability of Delta, you get all the operation excellence of Delta, but you don\u2019t get some of the amenities that you don\u2019t need. And if you need those amenities you can add them on later. So, I think what we want to have is an airline that\u2019s best in class for each consumer sector and basic economy is one of the things that will enable us to do that.","Ed Bastian","And in response to your question of, it is a revenue strategy.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear next from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research","Yes, hey, good morning, guys. Regarding the $2 billion share repurchase program through 2016, with the stock obviously sub $35, do you guys need an authorization from your Board to accelerate the buyback if you wanted? Or in theory, could you put that whole $2 billion to work this year if you wanted?","Richard Anderson","Well, we do need to go back to our Board and our Board is quite focused on two things which is one return on invested capital and keeping that number high, and number two driving continued improvement in the returns to our shareholder. We expected our Investor Day to be in a position to update our investors because it is an incredibly accretive to the company to buyback our stock at these multiples. So, as Paul reiterated we\u2019re well ahead of where we said we would be last May and you can expect that we would continue that kind of trajectory particularly given the tremendous value that we can create for our owners by buying back our stock at these prices.","Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research","Okay, terrific. And then I guess for the -- my second question here. On growth to Europe, the headline news almost on a daily basis seems to be pretty negative: deflation, and Europe that risk of sliding into a recession. So it seems there is a fair amount of macro here. As you look ahead to next year, what are the data points that you are looking at that give you confidence on the demand backdrop and the growth of 1% to 3%? It seems like your peers have reached a different conclusion. But anyways, I am just wondering if you can provide a little bit more perspective there?","Glen Hauenstein","Our growth in Europe this year was really in September as one of the issues that I think our investors need to understand that for the last few years we\u2019ve been doing modification lines on our airplanes whether or not it\u2019s satellite TVs or whether or not it\u2019s flatbed seats those modification lines continue to need and by 2014 and 2015 it\u2019s really about getting better asset utilization on the existing asset base. And so to the extent that we can see extending some of the U.S. point of origin markets beyond August into September, and early October, we will continue to do that. And that\u2019s where really most of our growth has come from new markets or upgauge it comes from really using the existing asset base slightly better. As mostly for those markets U.S. point of origin destination travel.","Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research","Okay, thanks Glen, appreciate it.","Operator","We\u2019ll move onto Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","A couple questions here. Paul, given the pullback in WTI and Brent, we have also seen jet fuel prices come down, but crack spreads have actually gotten wider. I know you mentioned that as being a source of profitability for the refiner in the fourth quarter. What is going on with crack? Why have they widened so much?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning Mike. Thanks for the question. What this sell off has been a very brand driven sell off where cracks tend to lag that and I think when you compound that with some of the supply delivery issues in the Northeast some refineries have come offline putting temporary pressure on those crack spreads. We are running near full capacity and expect to do so for most of the quarter. So I think when you combine it with temporary shutdowns with some of the supply disruptions that put a little bit of pressure on cracks.","Richard Anderson","Michael, now perhaps folks -- not now perhaps folks will better understand our refinery strategy.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Very good. My second question; and Richard, this is either for you or Ed. Look, Air France just went through -- I want to say the worst strike in I think two decades. They were running, I want to say 40% for two weeks. It doesn't look like it's in your numbers in the trans-Atlantic, but I am sure it had an impact. Can you talk about what the impact was, or maybe how you were able, just working together, able to deal with it?","Richard Anderson","Well, remember that a big network and that there were opportunities over Amsterdam and all of our flights ran really full. So we had Glen talked about a little extra capacity in September it happened to be at the perfect time because we absorbed an enormous amount of that and actually had a pretty nice uplift in revenue.","Operator","And from Bank of America, we\u2019ll go next to Glenn Engel.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A couple of questions, I guess, by your guidance other than Africa, you were not seeing any Ebola effect?","Richard Anderson","We monitor it on a daily basis, and we have not seen any changes in the booking trends.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","What type of currency headwinds are implied in your numbers in the fourth quarter?","Richard Anderson","Glen we\u2019re looking at obviously pressure on the yen. I think for the fourth quarter that number is in the $25 million to $30 million range of FX exposure.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But in the euro it\u2019s both revenue and an expense hit so it will show up in lower RASM but lower CASM?","Richard Anderson","Yes, exactly.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And Glen if I mark-to-market where interest rates are today, what type of headwinds can we expect in pension next year? And is there any plan to change the balance of profit share versus wages for your workforce?","Glen Hauenstein","On the pension side Glenn I think we\u2019re looking at a potential balance sheet adjustment of around $1 billion which is comparable slightly less than what we took back last year. That\u2019s not going to have a material effect on pension expense next year with our funding strategy and the other changes.","Richard Anderson","And Glenn on your second question, our formula here at Delta works pretty well. As evidenced by the performance, our performance over the last several years and particularly in this quarter. So, we\u2019re very careful about changing anything in that mix given our success.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just assumed at last -- at the start of this year you changed a little bit and I was wondering whether there was more wage increases you would announce for early next year whether that was going to be the same?","Richard Anderson","We\u2019ve already made our wage increase announcement. We did it as part of our early profit sharing payout.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. This is a question for Paul. How should we think about 2015 non-fuel unit costs, taking into account the recent wage increase and if a pilot deal work to get done sooner than later? How comfortable do you feel you can still achieve the less than 2% growth in non-fuel CASM again after such strong cost performance over the last five quarters?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Julie. Well, heading into 2015 as we\u2019re developing our operating plan right now, we still have the benefit of further increases in operating leverages as we continue to re-fleet and upgauge the airline, so that\u2019s providing a lot of tailwind. We do have some cost pressures in 2015 but we have those every year. So we feel confident about our ability to keep it below 2% again next year.","Julie Yates - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. And then can you guys update us on the outstanding wide body RFP? Do you still expect to make a decision by the end of the year?","Richard Anderson","This is, Richard, yes. We\u2019re still working diligently on evaluating both the Airbus and Boeing option. They both have very strong viable options, as do the engine manufacturers Rolls-Royce and GE. And we are in the midst of a very heated competition to see which of those will bring to the table the best economics for our owners. Remarkably right now, it\u2019s an interesting development in the wide-body market because there is so many orders out there the used market is really heating up and the pricing for 10 year-old wide-bodies is about 30% of what you\u2019d otherwise pay. So it\u2019s going to be a very interesting process because the most important thing about this for us is not operating cost its ownership costs and I think that\u2019s how candidly the whole industry are focused on ownership cost.","Operator","And Jamie Baker with JPMorgan has our next question.","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","Richard, just as a follow-up on the aircraft question, has fuel's recent decline had any impact on the RFP negotiations or pricing, or how you even think about the new orders that reside in your pipeline at the moment?","Richard Anderson","No, we\u2019re relatively short tailed because -- and the problem with big airplane orders is escalation clauses and PDPs. You don\u2019t want to get way out in front of an order or you end up giving up all the competitive economics of the fly off. So we tend to build long-term models that put pretty high fuel prices in because I don\u2019t think, if you take the last 10 years of fuel prices in the industry, there has been a lot of variability but the line has been an upward sloping line. And so we have used very conservative assumptions when we build our financial models to determine what to buy. So from that standpoint, we aren\u2019t going to change our price per gallon assumption over the next 30 years as a result of the short-term changes in crude prices.","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","Okay; I appreciate that. Thanks, Richard. My second question -- and, wow, I don't know who wants to take this one. Maybe Glen, but I am curious about how you model for new routes and whether that has evolved at all over time, and in particular whether you consider earnings multiple-destruction. I don't have the tools to say whether your next market from LA is going to earn a fully allocated profit. But I do have the ability to tell you that when you add capacity, particularly into OA hubs, it diminishes shareholder confidence; it suggests a lack of discipline; and in my opinion, it jeopardizes the likelihood of earning a multiple closer to that of high-quality industrial transport. So I know it may be difficult to quantify, but do you ever stop before you announce a route and just ask, or maybe run it past others: What if this destroys tens of millions of dollars of shareholder value by robbing me of a better earnings multiple?","Glen Hauenstein","See Jamie, it sounds like you\u2019ve asked and answered that question.","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","Well, Glen, in fairness, I'm going to ask it of others this season. So this is not uniquely directed?","Glen Hauenstein","Look, I mean think you\u2019re in an area that is in some respect it\u2019s not appropriate for an earnings call. But I will just say this, look at our results I don\u2019t think there is a more disciplined approach to the deployment of capital in this industry anywhere in the world and we\u2019ll continue to make the right unilateral decisions and we appreciate that you have a different opinion.","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","Well, and it is not necessarily mine, Glen -- or Richard. I am passing along the question that I have been asked here. But I appreciate your concise answer and we will leave it at that? That's fine. Thank you.","Operator","And from Morgan Stanley, we\u2019ll go to John Godyn.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Hey, thank you for taking my question here. I wanted to follow up a little bit on some of the capacity commentary. First of all, we have certainly heard some criticisms; and Jamie reflected some of those on the competitive capacity adds. But maybe enough airtime isn't spent on where you are cutting capacity, because at the end of the day your aggregate capacity growth is still relatively disciplined. I was hoping the team could elaborate a bit on what is funding these growth initiatives in certain regions, like the trans-Atlantic, like in Seattle, and perhaps like in LA?","Richard Anderson","I think this is a great question and I think what we continue to do is discover the network and find underperforming assets and try and move them up the scale. And so really to go back to the previous question and would say, what really happened in Seattle and Los Angeles, we increased capacity significantly on a year-over-year basis and margins in both those hubs increased at the same time. So what we were doing was trying to find the worst assets across the whole network wherever they were and redeploy them into better revenue potential opportunities. And that was really a key contributor to the improvement and the profitability of the airline. So, I understand the criticism, I understand the uncertainty of it, but the business continues to evolve and it continues to evolve as a consolidation of the four major carriers continues. And I think in Los Angeles we\u2019ve had four large carriers that\u2019s just the way it's going to be, in Seattle you have two large carriers that\u2019s the way it's going to be.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Got it, then the guidance for next year, 2% ASM growth and the context being sub-GDP, it does feel like -- not that I am an economist per se, but it does feel like GDP expectations globally are being revised almost daily in the marketplace. I am just curious. Do you feel like there is downside risk to that number if things get worse? Is that a number that is struck as recently as last week, or was that a planning process that occurred a month ago? If you could just help put some boundaries around where capacity could go from here in the context of some of these global growth concerns, that would also be helpful?","Richard Anderson","Thanks, John. You heard the, in the guidance we also said we expect our international capacity next year to be flat. So, I think that clearly addresses the question you\u2019ve raised with respect to some of the international economic concerns. Pacific where we\u2019re having clearly the most highest level of capacity concentration coming primarily from Foreign flags we\u2019re in the midst of a pretty significant restructuring of that capacity offering. And we said Pacific will be down in the high single-digits. Next year in Europe the majority of our capacity adds we\u2019re thinking will primarily be in London, which is producing significant returns as part of the Virgin JV and I think the bulk of the overall system-wide capacity add next year is going to be in the domestic system and it is going to be reflective of the upgauging initiatives that we\u2019re doing as both margin accretive and very incredibly cost efficient.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s very helpful. And just last one.","Richard Anderson","And John, last one as I\u2019d like to add to that as obviously we\u2019re speculating we have got a long ways to go here and these deployment decisions. Our current thinking but as we get into the year, we also have the ability to make alterations on a relatively quick timeframe given the capital efficiency of our fleet.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Great and I just want to follow-up on one of the things you mentioned which is upgauging. As we think about the 2% capacity growth for next year, can you give us a sense of what the seat count growth and fleet growth underlying that is, we\u2019ve certainly seen departures and seats underperform ASMs meaningfully, it does feel like maybe the trend is even more conservative than 2% would suggest?","Richard Anderson","I agree with that we are going to update you at the December Investor Day, the fleet count will be down next year. But we\u2019ll give you the ins and outs because you are right there, so moving pieces to that picture.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","Hey, good morning. On the U.S. dollar strengthening, I was just wondering if you could provide -- I know you provided a little bit on the trans-Atlantic but just, how much is your international sales are kind of on U.S. point of sale versus international?","Richard Anderson","On an aggregate level about 60% is U.S. based.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","60% of international sales are U.S. based.","Richard Anderson","Yes.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","Okay, got it. Then just from an ancillary revenue standpoint, it's been great performance here, a lot of it coming from Economy upsale and things like that. As we look into 2015, what kind of items can we think of as driving ancillary revenue growth?","Richard Anderson","I think that we have a lot of new initiatives which we\u2019ll be talking about in the marketplace over the next two to three months, probably give you an update at Investor Day. But we\u2019re extremely excited about being able to allow customers to really customize their travel experience on Delta.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","Got it. Alright. Thank you.","Operator","And from Goldman Sachs we\u2019ll move to Thomas Kim.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. I have a couple questions on pricing. First off, can you walk us through the PRASM guidance? I am wondering to what extent the low end of the guidance is being conservative; or does this in fact maybe reflect some risk with regard to erosion in pricing power? Whether it is in the US, which seems unlikely, but I know I certainly would appreciate color there; or maybe further deterioration in Asia, which is obviously reflected in some of the capacity decisions; or maybe even Latam. So if you can just help us understand the lower end of the guidance, that would be very helpful? Thank you.","Richard Anderson","Tom I think you answered a lot of your question, we gave you our best view as we\u2019re seeing today. I think the strength of the ford environment and the domestic system is where the bulk of our upside opportunity sits.","Ed Bastian","And let me just add for everybody on the call, we will not discuss pricing. And we will not discuss capacity among competitors on these calls today or in the future because it\u2019s not appropriate. And it\u2019s not appropriate for the analyst community that be engaging in what forward capacity and pricing decisions are at Delta.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Can I ask a broader question, just with regard to how you see the industry, thinking about how their revenue environment might change or adjust with the change in the cost environment? One would -- fuel in particular, this is one where we have seen historically, where prices or revenues have generally moved directionally in line with where oil price has gone. And I am wondering, just given the strength of the domestic market, could we in the market or the investment community be underestimating the potential impact of how much lower fuel price should really benefit profitability as we look out to the fourth quarter, but importantly out into \u201915?","Richard Anderson","Let me just answer it generally. We can\u2019t speak on behalf of the industry, we can only speak on behalf of Delta and that\u2019s all we will speak on behalf of. But when you think about where fuel prices are today versus where they were just a few weeks ago, it\u2019s in excess of a $1 billion of cost of goods sold improvement. So overall the fuel price reductions we\u2019ve seen in the marketplace are a huge opportunity going forward.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Alright, we\u2019re going to have time for one more call from the analysts.","Operator","And that will be from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital","Hey, good morning, everyone. Hopefully this is on the right side of, Richard, your commentary on capacity. I am just curious, though. Fuel is obviously -- I get the commentary on how you do fleet versus long-term fuel prices. But I am curious. How should we be thinking about tactical moves or utilization flying in off-peaks, when fuel is whipping around like this? I presume we have to obviously have a view. Is that similar to fleet, where you're not taking it into account? Or should we start thinking differently about what you might do in the first quarter if fuel stays here?","Richard Anderson","Well, I mean that -- as we said, we\u2019ll update our 2015 capacity plan for Delta only at the December Investor Day. But just broadly, we\u2019re driven by profitability and return on invested capital. And what that means is that we make fleet planning decisions we include ownership costs and we include ownership costs even in our short-term planning. So, the bottom-line is we want that 19% return on invested capital on a consistent basis and in order for us to do that we\u2019ve got to be very adroit at deploying our capital to make sure we get a return or the maximum return every quarter.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital","That helps quite a bit. I think the rest of mine have been asked already. So, I\u2019ll step back. Thank you.","Jill Sullivan Greer","That is going to conclude the analyst portion of the call. Before we turn it over to the media portion, I do want to say that there were a sizeable number of analysts that didn\u2019t get on the call. And we will follow-up with each of you directly offline. And with that, I will hand it over to Kevin Shinkle.","Kevin Shinkle","Hi. This is Kevin Shinkle, the Chief Communications Officer. Thanks to the reporters who are on the call. I would like to say that, and we have about 10 minutes so if you can keep it to one question and a brief follow-up it would be great. So with that, I\u2019ll turn over to Kellian for repeat of instructions.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to David Koenig, The Associated Press.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","I think Richard if you could answer this just curious what you think about the CDC\u2019s decision to let that second nurse fly on that Frontier flight less than 21 days after her possible exposure to Ebola and I heard your comments earlier about your booking. But what do you think of that decision?","Richard Anderson","Well, I think Dr. Frieden was very clear in stating that the CDC made a mistake. I think what\u2019s worth noting is you really can\u2019t catch Ebola on an airplane. And the screening techniques that the governments put in place are going to detect folks coming from the risk areas in Africa in advance of entering United States. So, I think that Dr. Frieden has done a good job answering that question.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","So does that mean you have confidence that the government is going to get this right?","Richard Anderson","Yes.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And from Thomson Reuters we\u2019ll move to Jeffrey Gaston.","Jeffrey Gaston - Thomson Reuters","Thank you and good morning. What additional steps might Delta to take convince investors that Ebola will not impact the airline\u2019s future performance?","Gil West","Hi. This is Gil West. Well, first, I\u2019d just point out, this isn\u2019t the first communicable disease that we faced as an airline or an industry. And we\u2019re well versed at managing these type of events ensuring the safety of our customers and crews. We have got a corporate safety and security staff that\u2019s in continuous dialogue with the CDC and World Health Organization, and we adhered all their recommendations. I just point the virus is as -- I am sure you know is extremely difficult to transmit. A person has to have symptoms to be contagious. As Richard pointed out, there are CDC screening protocols in place in and out of all the West African countries as well as into the U.S. and the EU to prevent a person with symptoms from flying. We\u2019ve also got well established hygienic cleaning procedures and use disinfectants prior to every flight. And then the CDC -- and I continue to point out that there is virtually no risk to all air travelers no matter where you travel.","Jeffrey Gaston - Thomson Reuters","Thank you and I may ask a brief follow-up on, has Delta taken any steps to protect itself against employees that potentially could sue the Company as Ebola spreads?","Gil West","On the employee side, yes, we\u2019ve got -- I mean if I understood your question when we\u2019re talking about employees, I mean we have ongoing dialogue with our flight crews and awareness and educational campaigns as well as provisioning the aircraft with preventative kits in case they do encounter anything unusual.","Operator","We\u2019ll move onto Mike Sasso with Bloomberg News.","Mike Sasso - Bloomberg News","I actually had a question, are you seeing any reticence by pilots or flight attendants to fly certain routes and I am thinking West Africa. I did hear something about speculation that maybe high senior pilots are bidding off of those routes? Are you seeing any of that from any of your ranks of employees?","Joanne Smith","Hi, this is Joanne Smith, and the answer is no. We\u2019re not seeing any pilots or flight attendants who are bidding off and it\u2019s a very flexible bidding system and certainly the opportunity for swapping trips is there, but we\u2019re not seeing any issues specific to this, also for Africa.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move now to Linda Loyd with Philadelphia Inquirer.","Linda Loyd - Philadelphia Inquirer","You mentioned that the refinery made a $19 million profit in the third quarter and then you referred to a $20 million profit and I just didn\u2019t hear whether you said that was for the fourth quarter or the year. I just wasn\u2019t sure what you said?","Paul Jacobson","Hi, Linda, this is Paul Jacobson. We, that was guidance for the fourth quarter, so we produced a $19 million profit in the third quarter and we anticipate approximately a $20 million profit for the fourth quarter, the team up there is doing a fabulous job of running the plant and they\u2019re keeping it up and operational.","Linda Loyd - Philadelphia Inquirer","So do you expect the refinery to be profitable for the entire year 2014?","Paul Jacobson","It will be close for the entire for the full year 2014, yes.","Linda Loyd - Philadelphia Inquirer","Close to profitable?","Paul Jacobson","Yes.","Richard Anderson","Okay, with that, that concludes our call for today.

My name is Cynthia, and I will be your coordinator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations for Delta.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Cynthia. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our March quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are Richard Anderson, our CEO; Ed Bastian, our President; and Paul Jacobson, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for the Q&A are Glen Hauenstein; Steve Gorman; Mike Campbell; Bolton Shannon; Mike Randolfi; Gary Chase; Evan Hurst; and Ned Walker. Richard will open the call. Ed will then address our financial revenue performance and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and liquidity. And to get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. ","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in our SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted and you can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at delta.com. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Richard.","Richard H. Anderson","Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us on the call today. Before we go through our results, I'd like to congratulate my friend, Paul Jacobson, on his recent promotion to Chief Financial Officer of Delta. Paul started his career at Delta in 1997 and prior to his promotion, Paul was our Treasurer. He spearheaded our debt reduction and fuel management strategies, among other very capable activities on our behalf. He has a great track record and we're really pleased to have him in his new role. ","Also, Mike Randolfi is a 12-year veteran at Delta. We promoted Mike to the position of Senior Vice President of Finance and Controller. He has the lead on our accounting reporting and controllership functions. With his broad background at Delta, Mike is well suited to lead our cost-reduction efforts. ","And to round out our leadership changes, I'd like to welcome Gary Chase to Delta, where he is now our Senior Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. Gary brings a wealth of knowledge of the airline sector from his years as a very capable analyst and we're really glad to have him on this side of the call for a change. The great thing about it is, I was able to get all of his questions asked before the call started. ","But congratulations to all of you. We're humbled that you're here with us. ","Getting to our results this morning, we announced a pretax loss of $36 million, which is a $355 million improvement over last year, despite $250 million in higher fuel costs. We expanded our operating margin year-on-year by 4 points. We had strong revenue performance. Once again, we produced a revenue premium to the industry. Our total revenues increased $665 million or 9% from the prior year, against a 3% decrease in system capacity. I'd like to thank our employees for running a great operation and taking care of each other and taking care of our customers in the March quarter. ","Our DOT on time arrival rate was 7 points better than last year. Our completion factor was 99.6%, a 2.8% improvement year-on-year, and we had a 31% decrease in Department of Transportation bag claims, a new record low. And not surprisingly, our DOT complaints have fallen 53% year-to-date through February. And our international on time performance is industry-leading. ","Running reliable operations is important to our customers and clearly contributed to our revenue outperformance. The consistent ability of our employees to deliver a great operation and provide courteous customer service plays a big role in our success and for their great performance, our employees earned $22 million in share rewards for the quarter. ","Our March quarter improvement in results and operations is evidence of the momentum we've built by executing consistently on our plan year in and year out. We've been successful at passing along higher fuel costs and have implemented a number of initiatives designed to ensure we are compensated for the services we provide. As a result, our revenue performance outpaced the industry and we saw margin improvement in every region and in every hub across our global network. ","You've heard us consistently state that we must be disciplined with capacity. To that end, our March quarter capacity was down by 3%. And for the full year, our system capacity would be down 2% to 3%. We continue to closely monitor all of our markets, and for that matter all of our city pairs, to be certain we match supply to demand so that we may fully cover the fuel costs and meet our profit goals. ","The business is generating solid cash flows, which we are using to reduce debt and make investments in our products, facilities and network. For every $2 in cash we generate, $1 goes to paying down debt and the other is prudently invested in the business to meet our return on invested capital target of 10% to 12%. Last month, we began the largest expansion at LaGuardia by any carrier in 4 decades and we are building the first true connecting hub at LaGuardia. By this summer, we will have more than 250 flights per day, offering more service to more cities than any other airline from New York's preferred close-in business airport. We've seen excellent results so far and Ed will provide additional color on our performance. ","We ended the quarter with adjusted net debt of $12.2 billion, a nearly $5 billion reduction in 2 years, and we fully expect to hit our $10 billion net debt target next year. Finally, our return on invested capital for the last 12 months was 10.6%, in line with our stated 10% to 12% ROIC goals. ","You've heard us detail our plan to build a durable business model that generates strong profit margins cash flow and allows for investments in our future. This plan is the same strategy we have discussed with our investors consistently for the last 3 years. So please expect more of the same ahead. We're not, obviously, pleased with a loss for the quarter but a $355 million pretax improvement shows that our plan is working.","Most importantly, and I stress this, we had margin expansion in all regions and all hubs, and we expect our 2012 full year profit and margin will increase over 2011, even with higher fuel costs. ","So in summary, we like the trajectory we are on and so we will stay the course and remain focused on strong revenue growth, very disciplined capacity management, tight management of cost and CapEx, debt paydown, great operations and customer service with the best employees in the industry. ","Thank you for calling in this morning, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.","Edward H. Bastian","Thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for your time. Excluding special items, Delta reported a net loss of $39 million or $0.05 per share, in line with First Call consensus. ","As Richard said, while any loss is disappointing, our pretax results reflect a $355 million improvement from the prior year. And to give some perspective, this is the best March quarter Delta has generated since 2000. So clearly, our plan is working. ","Our operating margin in the quarter was 2.6%, which was 4.1 points better than the prior first quarter. Special items for the March quarter included a $163 million net gain and included a $151 million mark-to-market gain on fuel hedges, a $39 million gain from the slot exchange with U.S. Airways, and a $27 million charge for fleet facilities and other items. ","Turning to revenue, our top line revenue for the March quarter grew $665 million or 9%, despite a 3% reduction in capacity versus the prior year. That increase in revenue was more than twice the $250 million increase we experienced in fuel expense. Our passenger unit revenues increased 14%, driven by a 9-point yield improvement and a 3-point increase in load factors. And in March, we generated a revenue premium to the industry for the 12th consecutive month. Our cargo revenues were down slightly due to lower yields versus the prior year and other revenues increased $21 million, driven by a 20% increase in MRO revenues. ","During the quarter, we saw strong unit revenue trends across all our entities, driven by our capacity discipline, corporate booking strength and the benefits from the investments we've been making in products and services. Our domestic unit revenues increased 12% against a 3% decline in capacity. Our Detroit and Minneapolis hubs performed particularly well, and we are seeing strength in our high-yield close-in bookings. New York outperformed the domestic route results by 2 points, which bodes well for our expanded presence in New York. ","We had 2 days in March which were in the top 10 highest unit revenue days for the domestic entity since 2008. Typically, our highest domestic unit revenue days are around July 4 and Thanksgiving. So seeing this revenue performance this early in the year is a good trend. And that strong environment isn't just limited to March. We've already had 2 days in April which have hit the top 10 mark as well. ","In the Trans-Atlantic, we trimmed our first quarter capacity by 9 points, which helped to drive the 22% year-over-year RASM increase and a revenue premium to the A48 carriers. The Trans-Atlantic entity contributed a large portion of last year's March quarter loss and we are encouraged that the capacity actions we have taken, in concert with our JV partners, have delivered significantly improved results. ","The unit revenues for Delta's Lat Am entity increased 8 points. While this is less than our system average, our Lat Am entity faced tougher year-over-year comps than any of our other entities. The Pacific has largely recovered from last year's earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Pacific RASM increased 15% year-over-year, driven by improvements in yield and load factor, and we are seeing particular strength in Narita and our beach markets. ","We continue to make gains with corporate accounts, with total corporate revenues for the quarter up 11%, despite our 3% capacity reduction. The corporate growth is broad-based and the industries where we saw the most significant increases were financial and business services and manufacturing. ","I'd also like to thank the Delta employees worldwide for this quarter's strong revenue performance. Their efforts to deliver a top-notch customer product are why our customers are increasingly choosing Delta and paying a premium to fly our airline. ","Turning to our outlook. For the June quarter, the year-over-year comps get progressively tougher as we move beyond April because we lapped some significant fare increases from last year. That said, the revenue environment is holding up nicely, and we are forecasting April unit revenues to be up 11% from the prior year. We also see good traction in May, with May RASM forecast to be up in the high single digits despite very strong prior year performance.  For the domestic entity, we're seeing improvements in both booked load factor and yield in April and May, and we continue to see year-over-year yield improvement in May as well. ","We are beginning to see the benefits of our increased services in LaGuardia, which is contributing to an increased volume of higher yielding close-in bookings, as well as corporate share shift. Thus far in April, on a 25% increase in capacity, LaGuardia is showing the biggest margin improvement for any of our hubs, as well as the highest absolute margin, which is an encouraging trend as we execute the second phase of our slot swap in July. ","It's great news to have had such a  strong launch of our new service. Thanks go out to Gail Grimmett and her fantastic team in New York. ","For the Trans-Atlantic, our bookings are tracking in line with last year and we are seeing positive traction on yields. The second quarter is traditionally a shoulder season for our Latin markets, but we are seeing improved load factor trends on a year-over-year basis. And in the Pacific, yield improvements are driving higher booked revenues for both May and June. ","Finally, we are seeing incremental revenue gains as well from new products and services. For example, our new First Class upsell product has reached the $200 million run rate of annual incremental revenue and that pretty much goes straight to the bottom line. This and many other new merchandising and sales initiatives contribute to the $1 billion in new revenue goal we expect to achieve by 2013. ","Turning to guidance. We're expecting a solidly profitable June quarter, with an operating margin of 8% to 10%. On capacity, we're forecasting system capacity to be down 1% to 3%, with both domestic and international both down 1% to 3%. Our Pacific capacity will be up 7% to 9% due to the resumption of our Detroit to Nata flying and the normalization of our Japan capacity. ","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul A. Jacobson","Thanks, Ed. Thanks, everybody for joining us, and good morning. It's an honor to be here. Turning to cost performance for the March quarter, operating expenses for the quarter increased 4% or $334 million, driven primarily by our fuel price, which was up 14% to $3.28 per gallon. Total fuel expense increased $250 million, as the increase in fuel was partially offset by $45 million of net hedging gains and reduced consumption on lower capacity. ","Nonfuel operating expenses increased $80 million for the quarter as the benefits of lower capacity and savings from mild weather conditions partly offset higher ancillary business expenses and employee costs. On a unit basis, nonfuel costs were up 3.6%, driven by higher employee and maintenance cost, as well as the impact of our 3% capacity reduction. ","Looking ahead, we expect our June quarter nonfuel unit cost to increase 3% to 4% versus prior year, driven by our capacity reduction, combined with higher employee costs, which are being partially offset by productivity improvements. ","We are committed to reducing our nonfuel unit costs and have begun implementing the structural changes needed to get there, including improving maintenance efficiency, eliminating small gauge inefficient aircraft and improving employee productivity. As part of this, we are aligning our headcount with our reduced capacity. To that end, we are currently offering a voluntary retirement package that closes next week. We expect those employees will exit after the summer flying season. ","Turning to fuel. For the June quarter, we have had 70% of our consumption between $3.05 and $3.40 per gallon. For the September quarter, we are currently hedged 40% between $3.05 and $3.45 per gallon. As of Friday's market close, with these positions, we are forecasting a June quarter all-in fuel price per gallon of $3.28 and an all-in price of $3.27 for the September quarter. ","Shifting now to liquidity, we ended the March quarter with $5.7 billion in unrestricted liquidity, including $1.8 billion in our undrawn revolving credit facilities. Operating cash flow for the quarter was strong, with $947 million driven by strong advance ticket sales. Our capital expenditures in the quarter were $350 million, primarily consisting of $300 million in aircraft parts and modifications. ","On this cash -- the strength of the cash flow, we were able to pay down $450 million in debt, including $40 million in early debt retirements. As Richard mentioned, we ended the March quarter with adjusted net debt of $12.2 billion. Additionally, due to our strong liquidity position, we were able to fully fund our 2012 pension contributions in early April, well ahead of our plan. ","For the June quarter, we expect capital spending to be $400 million and have net debt maturities of $450 million. We are forecasting unrestricted liquidity balance of $5.8 billion at the end of the quarter and expect to have our adjusted net debt balance down to $11.6 billion. We remain on track to reach our goal of $10 billion of adjusted net debt by the middle of next year. ","So to conclude, the year is off to a good start and we plan to build on the momentum you see in these results. And finally, in closing, I'd also like to echo Richard and Ed's comments and say thanks to our employees that all worked so hard to build the tremendous momentum we have here at Delta. I'm very appreciative for all that they do to make Delta a great airline with an even brighter future.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Richard and Paul. Cindy, we are now ready for the Q&A. If you could give the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask a question just on capacity. You guys have been very disciplined in that regard and the commentary on revenue was really quite strong. But we've also seen some fare, attempts to raise fares fail and I'm not sure how to reconcile all of that. Why would a very strong revenue environment see failure when capacity seems reasonably disciplined? Does it suggest the industry needs to take more out? Or how do I kind of reconcile these ideas?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Bill, it's Glen. We have had a lot of success in what I would call some smaller changes to the fare environment, which have produced these results. Clearly, some of our competitors don't like the absolute fare increases that have been in the marketplace but there have been a lot of strengthening of defenses, a lot of strengthening of the advanced purchase, of the state requirements that have yielded this. So I think you have to look at fares in more than just the dollar amount we're charging, but in the qualifications for how you actually get those fares. And I think that's what's driving industry yields up across the board. So while we have had some resistance to those types of fare increases, we've made a lot of progress on the other side of the fare equation.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Fair enough. Another question I had, I don't know if it's for Glenn or for Richard, but obviously you've seen some early success here with the slot swap at LaGuardia. You do have a perimeter rule there. Is there any reason to think that we could ever address that? And if so, if that were either lengthened or eliminated, would that materially affect your performance at LaGuardia or is that not a big opportunity?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Clearly, the primary role restricts LaGuardia and it is a remnant of when Kennedy was open and the government was trying to force traffic to go to Kennedy. There's no real structural reason for LaGuardia to be limited. And similar to DCA, over time, and I have no idea what the timeline is on this, but those restrictions tend to be loosened over time. This one has not to date, and I wouldn't want a forecast if and when it would ever change. But clearly, I think customers would benefit if they had the option to fly beyond the perimeter rule of LaGuardia.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker at JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A question for Paul. You touched on some cost-reduction initiatives but can we get a specific update on the 8.4 set CASM target, when you think you'll be able to reach that goal? Obviously, there's been some slippage in the targeted date in the past.","Paul A. Jacobson","I think, Jamie, we're on our way in terms of making improvements to that through the employee initiatives. Some of that we wouldn't expect to take in until after the summer flying season. But with the maintenance savings, as well as some of the fleet-related savings as we get into next year, we start trending pretty rapidly into that space.","Edward H. Bastian","Jamie, this is Ed. We, if you recall, when we laid out that target last year, we said it would probably take 18 months to 2 years to ramp into that number of structural initiatives. We're working on more to come in that area, but we're confident we've got some reductions in the not-too-distant future.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And a follow-up for Richard, the topic is pilots. Obviously -- well maybe not obviously, in my opinion, you enjoy a better relationship with your pilots than some of your peers. I'm not going to ask you when you'll have a new contract, and even if you told me, I wouldn't hold you to it. But is it fair to extrapolate that you're more likely to get a deal sooner rather than later? And is that, indeed, a priority for you?","Richard H. Anderson","It is a priority for Delta to get a new agreement with our pilots well in advance of the amenable date. Which I believe, Mike Campbell, is it the end of the year?","Michael H. Campbell","Yes.","Richard H. Anderson","And so if you look at our track record, and you look back to 2007, in 2007 we reached agreement with our pilots 3x within 6 months on new contracts that were well accepted. So we really value that relationship and we want to -- it is a high priority here to get a new agreement concluded as quickly as we can.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is the timing potentially impacted at all by some of the labor headlines going on these days, related to --","Richard H. Anderson","No. I think if you did it based upon how the rest of the industry does it, we'd be about 5 years.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Savanthi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","On the maintenance expense, are there big maintenance events coming up in 2012 and 2013 versus what we've seen in the last couple of years?","Paul A. Jacobson","Savi, this is Paul. We have talked about lowering those expenses through the retirement of older airplanes and we're continuing to work in that direction. We've said that, that opportunity over the next 18 to 24 months is in the $200 million range.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's offsetting those expenses coming on. And then just a follow-up question, on the ancillary businesses related expenses, it seems as that's been increasing over the last few quarters pretty rapidly. I'm just wondering with that is related to, and if we start to see that gap or how we should think about that?","Edward H. Bastian","Savi, this is Ed. That's the increase that we've had in our MRO revenues.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it seems even if you look at it as percentage of other revenues or cargo and other revenues, it's increasing even as a percent.","Edward H. Bastian","Well, we can go off-line with the details, but we've had 20% growth in MRO revenues over the last year. So those costs are up considerably as well.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Linenberg at Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions. First, I'm just looking at your regional breakout on revenue. I -- you look at the unit revenue performance by region, I can kind of understand why the Pacific's up 15%, you had maybe a few weeks of an easy comp there. But the one that really stands out is the Atlantic, the 22% PRASM gain. And I know that's obviously being helped by the 9% capacity cut, but we read in the headlines this morning that the U.K. is now officially in a recession. Germany contracted in the fourth quarter, there's some talk that it contracted in the March quarter. Spain and Italy may be in a recession. I mean, is this just -- you've talked about the past, what you've learned with your JV partners. I mean is that, as a result of that, is that what we're seeing here? Because this type of performance, given the macro backdrop, it just -- it -- they don't reconcile and yet the numbers are quite good. What can you tell us about that? It's probably to Richard and Glen.","Glen W. Hauenstein","Mike, this is Glen. I think you have 2 things going on here that produced that I think is a pretty amazing number for us in the Trans-Atlantic. One is clearly the reduced capacity and the secondary impact that has on recapture on the remaining flights. But more impressive is the fact that business travel, in aggregate, is increasing despite the fact that Europe's in a recession. And that's really contrary to what we might expect given all the headlines that we read. And we try to go back and figure this out and what we see is that the U.S. is seeing opportunities in Europe to work. And so we've seen actual cabin load factors and same-store sales where we haven't changed capacity and the business cabin go up, as well as revenues. So we're monitoring that very, very closely because I think if we were to see signs of weakness there, we would take some actions in terms of the fall and winter capacity again next year. But to date, we have seen a little bit of a contrarian view in terms of what the headlines read versus what we've seen on our flights.","Richard H. Anderson","And I would add 2 other points to that. The first is, is the investment in our products, the lie flat product, the 76-400, is all lie flat now. And we just made substantial investments there that we are seeing pay off, not just in the RASM but also in our customer preference scores. A sub part of that is, is that we have an intense focus on reliability and on-time performance across the Trans-Atlantic, so that we're providing a premium product with the best schedules and an intense focus by the employees to be certain we're doing the very best job. And then the last point I'd make is leveraging the integration in the alliances. So we've been at this alliance activity for almost 20 years now. And as we get closer and closer to our partners across the Trans-Atlantic, it tends to drive real distribution strength, and the distribution strength is an important part of the equation. So I think it's a combination of all of the above.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, good, that's helpful. And then just my second question, just a commentary about the profitability of LaGuardia. And you made the point, I think it was you, Richard, where you indicated that not only did it see the most margin improvement, but it had the highest absolute margin. Now when I think about your 10 or 11 hubs, and, I don't know, maybe LaGuardia is the 12th hub, I know you concluded with New York. But my sense historically, and I realize these are my estimates, my sense is that LaGuardia was always clear to the bottom. So what you're seeing in LaGuardia is significantly, even based on the comments, what you're seeing is pretty significant and yet you're only getting maybe 1\/2 of the benefits, you don't have the additional flight for another month or 2. Is that -- I don't know what you can say or agree but is that a fair statement, that LaGuardia maybe has moved from being not just meaningful improvement but from being one of maybe the worst performing hubs in your system to the best performing hub? What can you say on that?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Mike, it's Glenn again. LaGuardia was not ever one of our worst performing hubs, so but the model needs to probably be adjusted on that. But hey, it was clearly not one of our best. And so what we're seeing now is a significant improvement and I think I would agree with your statement, that we're only halfway there and we're optimistic as we get the other half of the slot, that it will continue to improve.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Glenn Engel with Bank of America.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, if I stripped out the MRO business, the other revenues would be down, with -- are ancillary revenues no longer rising?","Glen W. Hauenstein","I think that's probably capacity, Glenn.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Second, on the maintenance side. I thought if I -- it was really high at the start of last year, it was really low at the end of the last year. I thought a normal number was an average of all 4 quarters, and yet the first quarter was again off the charts high. What is a normal number for maintenance in the quarter?","Paul A. Jacobson","Well, I think, Glenn, we have in the first quarter and fourth quarter, we have a lot of seasonal-related initiatives that are going on with cabin interior upgrades, et cetera. So I think you're looking at a heavier weighting in the winter months than you are in the summer months for maintenance again.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And roughly, how much for the full year would you expect maintenance cost to be up?","Paul A. Jacobson","I think we're generally flat year-over-year.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And finally, if I think of last year, I remember that business comparisons were difficult in April and May, but I thought got somewhat easier in June. Is that not correct this year?","Glen W. Hauenstein","I think it's early to forecast what June's going to be, Glenn, that we give you our April and May snapshot and I think it's probably as much visibility as we're comfortable providing at this point. We do know that the May comp was -- is quite tough and the June comp's a bit easier. So we'll probably have  a little more color for you at your conference coming up in a few weeks.","Richard H. Anderson","Glenn, this is Richard. If I could make just one point on the maintenance costs and how they vary from quarter-to-quarter. We tend to try to now push all of our maintenance into the shoulder months. So 1Q and 4Q tend to be -- or the end of 3Q, a good part of 4Q, except for the latter half, or the latter half of December. And then January, February and March are where we try to put it in those shoulder months so that you have the maximum fleet availability to be able to fly the peak. And I think we're -- and on the unit revenues, it's pretty clear that we're forecasting unit revenues in April at 11%. So we think the revenue environment is, at least for Delta, pretty strong.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a question, I guess maybe for Glen. Over the last couple of years, you've been able to cut capacity deeper than the industry and outperform on revenues. So obviously, you're retaining an awful lot of the revenue and the capacity you're cutting. As you look out over the next year or 2, is that something that you just, you see a lot more opportunities in the network to optimize? Or is there just something else going on that explains that, where we just don't see from the outside?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Well, I think our revenue performance is attributable to 2 factors. One is capacity discipline. The other is really providing a better and better product each and every quarter. And our share -- our revenue performance is really divided into 2. One is the retention of the underperforming revenue or the recapture of that revenue, and the other is obtaining new, higher-yielding accounts. And I think we've been hitting it out of the park, really, on both sides, or in this quarter anyway, in terms of not only retaining the revenue on capacity we've removed, but also on bringing ourselves into a higher realm in terms of corporate share. I think that's really what's driving it. And we will continue to look at the underperforming markets, and we will continue to remove those that are a drag on us.","Richard H. Anderson","If I could just add to that, if you've just taken up all the kind of macroeconomic, and you think about an airplane as an investment, the factory investment, you've got to get the maximum production out of each unit. And there are a myriad of actions that you take, from scheduling the costs to revenue. But we have to -- we're going to continue to shrink the fleet, upgauge the fleet and improve the profitability of each shell, because it's a significant capital investment and each of those capital investments has got to contribute to the return. And then lastly, do you have any questions for Gary Chase?","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I thought about ceding the rest of my time if he had more questions for you, Richard. But one question for Gary, on the slot swap, you'd mentioned last quarter there's some -- just the phasing was suboptimal. Is that something that affects the month-to-month progression in RASM that we should know about? Or is it just too small to sort of affect the overall April RASM outcome?","Garrett L. Chase","As it refers to phasing of...","Glen W. Hauenstein","So as many of you know, the government asked us to do the LaGuardia slot transaction in 2 phases. The first phase was in the latter part of March and the second phase is the 11th of July. And we swapped about 1\/2 of the slots in the first swap, and then we'll swap the other half in the second, which leaves USAir in certain markets that they will eventually be turning the slots over to us, and that's why we think it was a suboptimal in terms of P&L during the transition. So not probably enough to move the meter directionally but clearly when you get to July, we think that will make our LaGuardia performance relatively even stronger.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So I'm wondering if the use of market value and equity calculation of invested capital is the best way to go. I mean, doesn't that mean that when your stock price goes down, your ROIC goes up? That just -- it just doesn't really feel right. First of all -- and I appreciate you disclosing how you calculate it, for one, I should mention that -- but is there may be a better way to consider calculating your ROIC?","Richard H. Anderson","That's why we hired Gary Chase here, Hunter. So let me turn that over to Gary, see if he's got a view on that.","Garrett L. Chase","What it does do, Hunter, is adjust a way for a lot the, what you see in the accounting impacts. If you look through time, how much book equity do you hold, the accounting that comes through bankruptcy, the way to think about how we're performing versus the market value of our capital base. So in any -- there are going to be flaws in any methodology, and I think the important thing is that what we're trying to do from an ROIC perspective is to be on a trend, to drive behavior, to think about taking capital out of the business and drive better returns. And regardless of the method that you choose, that's a constructive process.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yes, I think that's fair. It's just -- I think it becomes a bit of an issue when things like executive comp are based on it and it's different from the rest of the industry, particularly different from how I think a lot of people on the street are calculating it. But again, you're there. As long as -- I mean, would you say maybe it's reviewable at this point, I mean as sort of a methodology? Because I calculate it my own way, obviously. But is the way you're calculating it reviewable? I appreciate the concept, Gary, but how you actually think about going about it?","Richard H. Anderson","I think, Hunter, the important thing is we're one to provide the transparency on how we think about it, and Gary said the right thing. The key is not necessarily the calculation as much as the results that calculation drives in, the continued improvement over time using a consistent methodology.","Glen W. Hauenstein","And we're transparent about how we calculate it.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yes, I know, I appreciate that.","Glen W. Hauenstein","We want you to see how we calculate it. But let me take this down to kind of a more practical answer, which is, you've got to drive margin in the business, number one. And number two, the cash that you do generate has got to be put to the very best use of the capital holders. And by limiting our CapEx, and being really disciplined about airplane purchases and the like, to be certain that we're going to get a return and making commitment to our capital holders, that 1\/2 of what we generate is going back on the balance sheet to de-risk the business, which are all very accretive moves. I think if you look below that calculation and you look at all the things that we've been steadily doing, they're all the right things for the shareholders.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","I can appreciate that. And real quick, Paul. In terms of -- I think you guys mentioned in the press release some opportunities for some accelerated debt paydown and also you guys prepaid a little bit of debt. How should we think about full year net interest expense? If you want to talk it in the context of total non-Op that's fine too, but I'm specifically referring to that one that was $901 million in 2011, how should we think of the one that upticked a little bit in 1Q? Should we think about that sort of decelerating through years sequentially?","Paul A. Jacobson","No. I would say that net interest savings is going to accelerate through the year on a quarterly basis. We had some overlap in the first quarter, but as we continue to pay down debt, we would expect that net interest expense for the year is going to be about $1 billion.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dan McKenzie with Rodman & Renshaw.","Daniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division","I know you've got initiatives underway to lower costs and I guess I'm wondering if you hit your goals, how does the cost outlook for the year change, if at all? And I guess what I'm wondering is, is if there is some cost, unexpected cost inflation that you're trying to offset or whether there are potentially -- so you're just trying to keep level, or is there some potential for the cost outlook for the year to potentially improve here?","Paul A. Jacobson","Dan, we gave our guidance at the start of the year for costs. And I think we're probably still in that general range. We've had some favorability in the first quarter of the year with weather, which has naturally been helpful, not just in raw savings, but also in a little higher capacity that it produced. But the -- I'd say our outlook for the year is consistent with what we gave you at the start.","Daniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then I guess my second question here just ties to Japan. The commentary of course was really helpful, I get restatement of flying revenues up. But the industry capacity from Japan in the second quarter is a much different dynamic than the first quarter. Second quarter up 14%, first quarter -- versus first quarter, roughly up 2%. So it does look like there is a chunk of new flying that kicks into in the second quarter that didn't exist in the first quarter. So and I guess first off, is demand sufficient enough to maintain pricing and keep pace with increase of capacity? And if so, I guess I'm wondering what's driving that? Anything you can share would be helpful there.","Glen W. Hauenstein","Dan, it's Glen. Maybe we need to reconcile our numbers because, clearly, the second quarter is up, but by the time you get to peak July, the numbers that we're showing for the industry is capacity relatively flat because you have a lot of ins and outs of there. You have American dropping out of JFK and Narita. You have the year-over-year inclusion of L.A.-Haneda and Detroit-Haneda. So I think it's really over a month by month, and I think in the second quarter, we might have a little bit of rockiness in terms of the capacity being ahead of the demand. But by the time we get to third, it looks really solid.","Paul A. Jacobson","We also -- we brought back Detroit-Haneda in this month as well, which is also part of the...","Richard H. Anderson","Considering the base last July. So...","Glen W. Hauenstein","Right. Not this April.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Dahlman Rose.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 questions. I think you said corporate bookings were up about 11%. I didn't catch whether that was in March or the March quarter?","Edward H. Bastian","That was the actual March quarter revenues, Helane. Our corporate revenues were up 11%.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, can you say how it's trending now?","Edward H. Bastian","April continues to look strong. In fact, it's ticked up from there a little bit.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my -- just an unrelated follow-up question. I think you mentioned the voluntary retirement program. Are there charges that are going to be taken as a result? Were they taken in the first quarter -- if so, were they taken in the first quarter, or will they be in the current ones or going forward ones, which is subletter A. And subletter B, is it included in your cost guidance?","Paul A. Jacobson","Helene, this is Paul. In response to your subletter A question, we would expect any charges to occur in the second quarter. And in response to subletter B, those would not be included. Those would be special items.","Jill Greer","Cindy, we're going to have time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","Our last analyst question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore Partners.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Looks like air train capacity is down pretty significantly over the June and September quarters. I realize a lot of this is small markets that they're exiting. Probably the only reason you flew to these -- some of these markets, Glen, is because air train was flying there. But wonder if you have stats handy about your sort of domestic competing capacity out of Atlanta in June, and how that compares with the March quarter?","Glen W. Hauenstein","I don't have it at the tip of my fingers, but generally, it's better as we move through the year.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I'll just take a stab at this one. I doubt you'll answer it. But can you disclose revenue in the March quarter from the sale of SkyMiles? And what the change was year-to-year, and does that flow through passenger revenue?","Jill Greer","It's in other.","Glen W. Hauenstein","Yes, it's in other revenue -- it's a complicated accounting because some of it's in passenger, some of it's in other revenue, Duane. And we're going to take your question off-line, and we'll help you understand our disclosures. But we're not going to provide any new information.","Jill Greer","That's going to conclude the analyst portion of the call, and I will now turn it over to Ned Walker for the media.","John E. Walker","Thanks, Jill. And Cindy, we're ready to go ahead. And if we could ask the media to ask one question with a quick follow-up. Also, if you could review the process for getting your questions in queue, that would be appreciated as well.","Operator","Again, that does conclude the analyst portion. All questions now need to come from the media. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first media question from Mary Jane Credeur with Bloomberg News.","Mary Jane Credeur","There have been a number of media reports about Delta's interest in a certain idled refinery in Pennsylvania. And I wondered if you guys could talk a little bit about how something such as that might fit into your overall fuel hedging and mitigation strategy? If -- I realize you probably can't talk about the plant itself.","John E. Walker","Yes, Mary Jane, we're going to consistently not comment on industry rumor and speculation. We're just going to keep that line.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jack Nicas with Wall Street Journal.","Jack Nicas","My quick question is there were reports yesterday, you were talking to increase your stake in GOL to 20%. Are you considering increasing your stake in GOL at all?","John E. Walker","No.","Jack Nicas","No? That's a definitive no?","John E. Walker","No.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Josh Freed at Associated Press.","Josh Freed","Can you say a little more about your fuel hedging as it stands today? I mean, you had a big gain on that this quarter. I realize it's mark-to-market. But are there -- are you taking a different approach to hedging than you used to? Are you doing more quick trading, or less maybe than you used to? Or is it the same as it's always been?","Paul A. Jacobson","This is Paul. Our program is the same as it's always been, and we don't comment on any specifics within the plan.","Josh Freed","All right. And your reduction of the 50-seat jets, is that still kind of proceeding at the same pace that you had anticipated, or is that going faster or slower than it used to?","Paul A. Jacobson","It's proceeding at the same pace that we've previously discussed.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andy Compart with Aviation Week.","Andrew Compart","Just a follow-up on that 50-seater question, I'm just trying to get a handle of what the pace and timing is of that, given that you've recommitted the Pinnacle July 22, I believe it is, and they have 140 of them at the moment. But they never really spell out how many of those do you get rid of by 2022. Can you give me some firmer idea of what to expect -- or how many 50-seaters do you expect to retain, and then what timetable? I'm not sure how many are flying right now with the partners.","Paul A. Jacobson","We have -- we're not going to provide any specific goal. We've mentioned consistently over time that we're going to look to reduce the size of that fleet. It's not a cost effective solution for us. And the individual transactions or methods by which we'll get there, we're not going to share at this time.","Andrew Compart","Do you expect, eventually, to get rid of all of them?","Paul A. Jacobson","We did not say that, no. We said we will be reducing them over time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Karen Jacobs with Reuters.","Karen Jacobs","I was wondering if you could comment on what has been the response so far to the voluntary retirement package offers?","Michael H. Campbell","This is Mike Campbell. We do not have a set number, and it is a process that will conclude in another week. What typically happens in these types of programs is it's really up until the end, that people will make the decision. So we have roughly the same numbers as of the take-aways to this one.","Karen Jacobs","As a follow-up to that, are these kinds of offers going to recur at Delta? I mean, I noticed there was one last year.","Michael H. Campbell","No. The typical one that's being offered this year is a unique one that will not be reoffered at Delta. It's a onetime program. And what has happened is over the last 3 or 4 years, because of the revolution of representations, we haven't been able to offer one program to all of the employees of the same nature that's being offered. And we use the opportunity when we got the resolution and all the representation issues to make this one-time opportunity, but I do not envision we'll ever offer this type of program again. We just [indiscernible].","John E. Walker","Cindy, we have time for one more question.","Operator","We'll take our last media question from Cathy McKitrick at Salt Lake Tribune.","Cathy McKitrick","My question deals specifically with the Salt Lake City hub. I was wondering what the reductions in flights will be out here and how that might affect the nonstop flights to Tokyo and Paris? And also, if you expect any layoffs in this area?","Glen W. Hauenstein","No, we do not expect any layoffs in the Salt Lake area. The hub is performing well. We have some seasonal adjustments that we make. They're going to be driven by demand and fuel.

My name is Lauren and I will be your coordinator.","At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Thanks Lauren. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Our CEO, Richard Anderson is joining us remotely today and Ed Bastian our President, Paul Jacobson, our CFO, and the remainder of the leadership team is here in Atlanta today.","Richard will open the call. Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow up.","Today\u2019s discussion does contain forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings.","We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. And you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Richard.","Richard Anderson","Thanks Jill. This morning we reported another record quarterly result. We maintained our revenue base despite an 18% decline in fuel prices, which allowed us to expand our pre-tax margin by 200 basis points, improving earnings per share by 22% year-on-year and generated free cash flow of $1.6 billion in the quarter.","We also delivered a return on invested capital of 23.5% for the last 12 months. We benefited from lower fuel expense in the quarter despite a $600 million hedge loss. Excluding the impact of hedges our operating margin would have expanded nearly 700 basis points to more than 21%.","As of July 1, the fuel hedge headwind we have faced over the last six months is behind us and we expect the fuel price we will pay in the second half to be in line with the industry.","Our strong cash generation continued with $2.5 billion of operating cash flow and $1.6 billion of free cash flow for the quarter. This allowed us to accelerate returns to our owners with $1 billion in dividends and share buybacks while also reducing our adjusted net debt by another $250 million to $7.1 billion.","We continue to run the industry's best operation by far. In the June quarter, we delivered 99.8% completion factor including 43 days with zero mainline cancelations. Our mainline on time rate improved two points to 85.3. None of our global or national competitors are even close to this level of performance.","These outstanding results were made possible by the dedication of our employees who work extremely hard every day to provide an industry-leading customer experience and outstanding returns to our owners.","Regarding the current environment, business conditions generally remain favorable, currency volatility continues to impact our international business while domestic yields have been under pretty significant pressure. Despite these headwinds the result we reported this morning marks the best June quarter in our history.","We still have great momentum in the business and we expect to report record earnings again in the third quarter. Specifically, we're forecasting EPS growth in 3Q of well over 30%, operating margins of 19% to 21% and $1.9 billion of operating cash flow in the September quarter.","We will use that cash flow to reinvest in the business, reduce our debt, return cash to our owners, all of which will be consistent with the capital deployment plan we provided to the marketplace last May.","Last week we announced a strategic investment in GOL that will play a key role and helping us achieve our long term goals. Ed will provide specifics, but I\u2019d highlight that building out our Latin network is a major initiative for Delta.","Our stake in GOL will further this effort as the largest domestic carrier in Brazil and it will provide significant long term upside in the region for Delta particularly as we move toward open skies with Brazil, when we couple our investment in GOL with the significant investment we have in AeroMexico we have the foundation for the strongest network in Latin America.","We have a long and successful history with our partner Air France KLM that has allowed us to build a very profitable Trans-Atlantic business that coupled with our Virgin Atlantic investment will allow us to continue to leverage that kind of model with new partners in other markets and regions of the world.","I also want to comment on our fourth quarter capacity outlook. Margin expansion is a key component of the long term plan at Delta and adjusting Delta supply to meet market base demand is necessary to drive margin growth and to hit our long term financial targets.","We're currently benefiting from lower fuel prices. We do not believe margin expansion driven largely by declining fuel prices is sustainable over the long term and our plan assumes raising fuel prices over time.","Because of this, RASM growth is a necessary component of our business strategy over time and we will unilaterally determine Delta\u2019s capacity at levels consistent with achieving our long term goals. Much like consumer retail our store sales must be positive year-over-year over the long term.","For the fourth quarter, our domestic growth will be 2%. As we announced last April international capacity will be down 3.5% in 4Q. This is slightly larger change then we announced last April. This reduction in international capacity is driven by currencies and economic weaknesses in certain countries around the world.","These actions will result in system capacity being consistent with last year\u2019s levels and in line with current demand expectations which we expect will get to unit revenue to be roughly flat by year end.","Lastly regarding the recent pilot vote, we were disappointed our pilots turned down an agreement that would have improved upon their already industry-leading contract. However, this outcome doesn\u2019t mark any change to the strong working relationship we have with our pilots who are leaders in our operation and key stakeholders in the enterprise.","We will continue to work together with them to find common solutions. We\u2019ve been doing this quite well for the last decade and I have confidence that we'll continue to do so in the future.","Operating our business with a long-term perspective has proven very beneficial for Delta\u2019s customers, employees and share owners. We\u2019ve been able to invest in our employees through wage increases, healthy profit sharing and job growth for our customers.","We run absolutely the best operation in the world. We\u2019ve improved our products, technologies, operations and service with nearly $10 billion in capital investment in the last five years.","And for owner, we\u2019ve returned over $3 billion in the last two years while improving the strength of our balance sheet with over $10 billion of debt reduction and we\u2019ve increased our market capitalization to over $30 billion.","We have a lot of upside in the business. We can do more in the future as we continue to execute on our plan the way we have consistently executed over the last decade.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed and Paul to go through the details of the quarter. Thank you.","Ed Bastian","Thanks Richard. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.","We delivered a record June quarter with pretax income increasing 14% to $1.64 billion. Our net income was slightly north of $1 billion or $1.27 per share, $0.06 higher than consensus. We expanded our operating margin 1.7 points to 16.8%, which is in line with our initial guidance range for the quarter of 16% to 18%.","I\u2019d like to thank Delta employees for their contributions to another record result, which we are pleased to recognize with an additional $411 million contribution to next year\u2019s profit sharing payoff.","We\u2019re able to grow our topline slightly as the number of our revenue initiatives and non-passenger revenue sources help to offset a $116 million foreign exchange headwind.","Corporate demand remains solid with volume growth of 3% in the quarter while that was largely offset by fare pressure. We continue to see good performance with our branded fares initiative. Total merchandizing revenues and fees grew by 11% led by incremental first-class revenue growth of 17% and comfort plus growth of nearly 30%.","We increased our paid first-class load factor to 57% out eight points year-over-year on a base of 7% more first-class seats. Our enhanced agreement with American Express produced an incremental $60 million in revenue this quarter. Our partnership with AmEx remained strong.","Despite these improvements the strong dollar and lower fuel surcharges remained headwinds for international business while softer yields in certain domestic markets resulted in revenues that fell short of our initial expectations.","For the June quarter, passenger unit revenues declined 4.6% with 2.5 points attributable to currency and lower surcharges and the remainder attributable to lower domestic yields.","This yield weakness domestically was limited to a small group of markets. In fact, three markets accounted for 50% of the overall domestic yield weakness. Despite these pressures, we're able to expand our domestic revenue premium to the industry, which now stands at 115% year-to-date.","Margins did expand across all our domestic hubs in the quarter and excluding the effect of our fuel hedge losses achieved a 23% domestic margin up 800 basis points relative to last year.","Relative to some of our growth initiatives, Seattle performed well absorbing 35% higher capacity while maintaining RASM levels. We\u2019re also pleased with the performance of our JFK long-haul markets especially the LAX in San Francisco Transcons that we announced late last month that we'll be adding additional and upgraded service as United exits JFK.","In the Trans-Atlantic, unit revenues declined 11.5% with over six points of impact from currency and fuel surcharges. We faced a tough comp in the region this quarter as Trans-Atlantic unit revenue improved by more than seven points last year.","In core European markets, we saw improved U.S. point-of-sale demand, but this was more than offset by a reduced point-of-sale demand in Europe and the effect of the weaker Euro.","While we continue to face headwinds in Africa, the Middle East and Russia, we're seeing some positive signs in places like Johannesburg. We continue to make capacity adjustments in these challenging markets including the suspension of service to Moscow for the upcoming winter season.","We're pleased with the performance of our two Trans-Atlantic joint ventures this quarter as these relationships through the Air France, KLM and Virgin Atlantic saw margins expand once again despite continued currency pressure. We\u2019re using the success of these joint ventures as the model as we deepen our partnerships with carriers in other parts of the world.","In Latin America, unit revenues were down eight points on 8% higher capacity. This decline was driven by currency and pressure from last year\u2019s Venezuelan capacity reductions. This quarter marks the last of our high single-digit growth in Latin America as we\u2019ve largely finished building out that portion of our network.","Going forward, our capacity growth in the region will return to levels more consistent with the system average. Our partner's GOL and AeroMexico contributed $25 million in incremental revenue this quarter and we're taking advantage of the opportunity to expand upon these relationships.","As Richard highlighted, we will be increasing our equity investment in GOL by up to $56 million as part of larger rights offering, which will result in Delta potentially increasing our position up to 9%.","At the same time, we will be guaranteeing $300 million of unsecured debt to be entered into by GOL. That guarantee will be secured by GOL\u2019s interest in Smiles, the company\u2019s publicly traded loyalty program.","This will raise GOL\u2019s cash position to a level that ensures that carrier will have ample liquidity in the difficult economic environment in Brazil. Adjusted for these initiatives, GOL would have ended its second quarter with $1.1 billion in liquidity, 35% of their annual revenues.","We feel great about our long-term prospects with GOL and are pleased to stand behind the company and the work Kakinoff and his team are doing to address these challenges.","As part of the transaction we\u2019ll extend our exclusive commercial partnership with the target of getting to a joint venture with GOL as Open Skies with Brazil becomes effective later this year.","When combined with a joint venture that we have planned with AeroMexico would involve immunized alliances in two of the two largest aviation markets in Latin America.","In the Pacific, the revenue environment remains challenging with the unit revenues down 8.5% on 4% lower capacity and roughly 12 points of impact from FX and fuel surcharges. Specifically, the Yen revenue headwind in the quarter was $27 million net of hedges.","As we\u2019ve laid out previously, restructuring our Pacific network is one of our biggest opportunities for margin improvement going forward and the early results of these efforts are positive.","As part of these efforts, we\u2019ll be reducing our winter capacity into Pacific by 6% to 8% including retiring six of the 747s and cancelling the loss making Seattle Canada service.","And now looking forward to the September quarter guidance, we expect the revenue environment across the system to remain under pressure and we\u2019re forecasting total revenue to decline slightly from prior year levels with RASM down 4.5% to 6.5% on three points of higher capacity. The quarter will be a bit choppy with the July and September months posting better results than August.","However we\u2019re expecting fuel expense to be a $1 billion lower year-over-year, which will more than offset this revenue weakness to result in another record profit with an operating margin of 19% to 21% of more than 400 points year-on-year.","As Richard, mentioned the right balance of supply and demand in the business is key to achieving positive unit revenues over the long-term. This is a fundamental component of our plan and the financial targets we outlined at our capital meeting in May.","Based on the current environment we believe that our previously announced capacity plans are still at the appropriate levels for this winter. As such, we\u2019re planning for 2% growth domestically and a 3.5% reduction internationally, which is a 50 basis point further reduction from what we previously announced, which will result in overall system capacity being flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","We believe this plan is in line with current demand and GDP forecast and it will allow us to get our unit revenue back on the right trajectory with our goal to be flat by the end of the year.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul, to go through the details on cost and cash flows.","Paul Jacobson","Thanks Ed and good morning, everyone.","Consistent cost of execution continued again in this quarter and was a key contributor to the 160 basis points of operating margin expansion relative to last year.","Total operating expenses were $85 million lower as the decline in fuel cost offset the investments we\u2019re making in our product as well as $71 million in higher profit sharing expense.","Non-fuel CASM declined under a point on a 3.4% capacity increase. This performance was slightly better than guidance as a result of some favorability and one-time benefits that occurred during the close process.","This marks the eight consecutive quarter of non-fuel CASM growth below 2% and the sixth consecutive below 1%. As is evident in this result, the entire Delta organization is highly focused on controlling cost.","Our updating progress, maintenance initiatives and other productivity improvement efforts were the key drivers of this strong cost performance. As an example, since 2010 in the domestic entity we've increased capacity approximately 1.2% per year, but that\u2019s been on 13% total fewer departures and 9% total fewer aircraft over that time.","FX also benefited non-fuel CASM by about a point. We expect non-fuel CASM to be flat in the September quarter as our cost reduction initiatives continue to keep our performance below our 2% growth target.","Moving on to fuel, our total fuel expense declined 16% as lower market fuel prices more than offset higher consumption and our hedge losses. Our all-in fuel price was $2.40 per gallon down from $2.93 in the same period last year.","Hedge losses were at $0.58 per gallon headwind in the quarter. The refinery made a $90 million profit this quarter versus a $13 million profit the same period last year driven by lower crude cost and improved mix of North American supply. A continued favorable crack spread environment and increased throughput also contributed to the refinery's profit.","Over the last four quarters the refinery has produced a cumulative profit of $300 million. We expect that trend to continue to build in 3Q with a projected profit of approximately $60 million.","With the recent sharp drop in fuel prices, we currently expect our September quarter fuel expense will be $1 billion lower year-over-year, net of roughly $200 million of hedge losses.","At $1.90 to $1.95 per gallon, our second half fuel price will be 28% lower than what we paid in the first half of 2015 according to the current curve. We expect this price will be in line with the industry average for the balance of the year.","For the remainder of the year, we\u2019re approximately 15% hedged against an increase in prices with approximately 85% downside participation to Brent prices of $40 per barrel. Overall, we continue to expect fuel cost to be an enormous tailwind and provide a net benefit of more than $2 billion for Delta this year.","We\u2019re also well positioned to benefit if fuel remains at these levels for 2016.","Our already strong cash flow will continue to benefit from these lower fuel prices, which will allow us to return cash to our owners, while also further strengthening the balance sheet by paying down debt and funding our pension plans.","For the June quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of operating cash flow net of $300 million in pension contributions. At this point we\u2019ve made all of our planned 2015 contributions for a total of $1.2 billion.","We also reinvested $900 million back into the business primarily related to 737, 900 and A330 deliveries as we continue our long-term focus. For the September quarter, we\u2019re projecting roughly $800 million in capital expenditures.","With the $1.6 billion of free cash flow we generated during the June quarter, we continued our tap that we said out in May of increasing shareholder returns with $72 million of dividends and 925 million of share repurchases during the quarter.","We completed all that remained under our $2 billion authorization from 2014 as we had planned. We also opportunistically repurchased an additional $200 million under our new $5 billion authorization as we took advantage of share price weakness during the quarter.","In addition we repurchased another $50 million in just the first two weeks of July. We expect to return nearly $2.5 billion to shareholders this year consistent with our goal of returning at least 50% of free cash flow through dividends and buybacks.","Adjusted net debt at the end of the quarter was $7.1 billion and our debt reduction lowered interest expense by nearly $50 million for the quarter relative to last year. Our goal is to achieve and maintain $4 billion in adjusted net debt levels by 2017 and we\u2019re on track to do so.","The improvements in our balance sheet were recently recognized with a credit upgrade from Moody's, which now has Delta two notches away from investment grade alongside the other agencies.","In closing, I\u2019d like to thank the entire Delta team for another record-breaking quarter, in fact our ninth consecutive. We have the best employees in the industry and our performance is driven by your contributions. Thank you. Jill?","Jill Sullivan Greer","Lauren, we're now ready for questions from the analysts if you could give everybody instructions on how to get in the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning team. First question for Richard, I wouldn\u2019t expect you to comment on the legal merits of the DOJ\u2019s recent inquiry, but I am curious in your mind in a worst case scenario, if you can envision an outcome that would impair your current level of transparency?","Richard Anderson","I don\u2019t really think I want to comment on any of that Jamie.","Jamie Baker","Okay. All right.","Richard Anderson","But I think that we\u2019re going to always be transparent with our investors. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any legal prohibition on being transparent unilaterally that is with our investors.","And if you think about the data that\u2019s available on airlines, our schedules are public. We\u2019re filed in OAG and ATP Carro and under DOT regulations we're required to file huge amounts of data with the government in addition to all the public data that\u2019s made available through the GDS Systems.","So bottom line is we\u2019re going to continue to comply with the law, act unilaterally and do our best to give our investors visibility into our business.","Jamie Baker","Excellent, I appreciate it. And the follow-up, since you brought up the topic Richard to the pilots, rather than just rely on my contacts or trolling the message boards, what are the three or four biggest reasons in your mind that the PA was rejected by a fairly wide margin?","Was it noise around the sick leave issue, changes around JV flying and how Virgin got treated? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for what portions of the drawing board you might need to return to as opposed to just pay rates or something like that?","Richard Anderson","I think it\u2019s premature to do that. The Delta Master Executive Council is going to be meeting in a couple of weeks and we really need to hear back from them.","I think the overarching story is that we have an incredible track record with them and if you think about it, we\u2019re still five months ahead of the amendable day. So bottom line is the relationship is still strong. It\u2019s intact. We have a decade history of being able to work well together and we\u2019re still operating on both sides in that same spirit.","Jamie Baker","Got it. I appreciate the answers Richard, take care. Safe travels.","Richard Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Yes hey, two questions here Ed. I want to go back to Trans-Atlantic, I think you talked about fuel surcharges and currency weakness and accounting from six points of the 11.5% decline and then I know you also had a difficult comp.","What sort of component or as it relates to connecting flows and how that number builds up, what are you seeing on just your connecting traffic to your partners as we see a lot of capacity getting added into the marketplace? Is that also driving that number down or putting pressure on that -- on the Trans-Atlantic PRASM?","Glen Hauenstein","Mike, its Glen.","Michael Linenberg","Hi Glen.","Glen Hauenstein","One of the things that our great relationship with Air France scale I mean now Virgin, allows us to do is to do contract during periods of lower economic growth and route that traffic over the European hubs in Amsterdam in London.","So what you see with us for example as we reduce our capacity into Russia because of the weakness in the demand to Russia, we expect to generate a significant or retain a significant amount of that over those hubs and so as we work our way through this situation with the lower Euro and the lower European demand, we actually would increase -- we would expect to increase our connecting traffic over our European hubs.","Michael Linenberg","Yes I am just -- but I\u2019m wondering Glen are you seeing some displacement of that traffic to competitors such as Emirates or Etihad or Qatar as they continue to add more and more seats into the marketplace? And I\u2019m looking more like U.S. into India, Middle East, Africa because there is a decent amount of flow traffic between you and your partners.","Glen Hauenstein","Correct. As we\u2019ve stated in the past, we are not -- we have not been the largest player in the U.S. to India or the Indian Subcontinent but it is a significant long-term threat to us. As much a missed opportunity, we believe that under the right and clear circumstances that we should be able to fly non-stop from the U.S. into India.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Great and then just quick one monthly PRASM, is this -- was June the last month or are you going to continue to provide that?","Ed Bastian","We\u2019re going to continue to provide it for the time being.","Michael Linenberg","Great, thanks Ed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate your commentary on the small number of markets that drove yield weakness in the U.S. I wonder, one, did you comment on what you think domestic unit revenue will be in that third quarter guidance?","And then with respect to those weaker markets, are you detecting any firming or how is your maybe forecasting approach changed with respect to those smaller but weaker markets?","Ed Bastian","Duane, we did not disclose our domestic unit revenue expectations for the third quarter, but what I can tell you is that we have embedded within our third quarter overall unit revenue guide the expectation that through the summer that domestic weakness is going to remain.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. Thanks. And then just on the branded fares, can you expand a little bit about what\u2019s driving that $56 million and how you define whether or not that that\u2019s incremental.","Ed Bastian","Well, our three really branded fares that we're talking about today, one is basic economy, which is our spirit match fare if you will or ultra low cost carrier which is a de-comp dented product. We have Comfort Plus, which we re-launched in the quarter with a few additional amenities and we saw a huge uptick now.","We believe this is all incremental because the transaction is actually a post purchase transaction. So you have to go in and buy the additional service upgrade after you purchased your ticket and so we view that as fully incremental.","And then first-class up-sell is really the amount of incremental seats that we\u2019ve sold net of the cost of or the displacement of the coach fares that were upgraded from. So achieving a 57% paid load factor in first class is another stepping stone along our path.","I believe when we started, we told our investors that we file this as a several billion dollar opportunity in total with all four of these classes intact or three of the classes intact in the main cabin and so 70% is our long-term goal. We\u2019re at 57 today and we started at 13. So we\u2019ve made quite a bit of progress in the last several years on that front and we\u2019re very pleased with the results in all of our product lines.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First just a clarification on commentary. It sounds like you're now saying the goal is to achieve flat unit revenues by the end of the year and I believe at the risk of getting too granular here that at a conference in June you cited that the company would be on a past to get to positive unit revenue by the end of year. So am I reading too much into that or is there slight shift here?","Richard Anderson","There is a no shift in that Julie. Our plan is and our goal is to get there by the end of the year and we would like to get to positive. But we got to get to flat before we get to positive right.","Julie Yates","Makes sense. Okay. And then just a quick one on buyback. So clearly the market is not ascribing the same value to fuel driven earnings versus PRASM driven earnings. And so on the scenario which if fuel stay below $2 in the market continues to undervalue your stock with a PE multiple sub ten times, how do we think about the sustainability of the nearly $1 billion buyback we saw in the second quarter?","Paul Jacobson","Julie, good morning. This is Paul. Clearly as we articulated back in June, we have taken the opportunity given these low prices to accelerate the buyback a little bit.","Part of our long term goals is what we\u2019ve talked about is returning at least 50% of cash to shareholders in a balanced fashion. So we don\u2019t have any comment on what our pace is going to be in the second half of the year. But we need to continue to make progress against all of our goals that we outlined in May.","Julie Yates","Understood. Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David Fintzen","Hey, good morning, everyone. For steadying the supply and the demand and getting that right into here and can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s embedded in kind of your domestic demand assumption? Is it some of that weakness we\u2019ve seen lately for our stabilizes improve? Just kind of how are you really starting to think about the end of the year?","Glen Hauenstein","Hi, this is Glen Hauenstein. So I think as you look at where the weakness is, it is not in corporate demand. It is in the yield that we\u2019re obtaining from corporate demand.","And so as we continue to move forward, we don\u2019t talk about future pricing initiatives we never have and so -- but I would say is I think that corporate demand remains very, very strong and very, very strong even out of the cities that have had this yield impact and how the industry reacts will determine how those three cities do.","David Fintzen","Okay. Okay, appreciate that and then just quietly bigger picture, for getting that kind of record earnings on lower fuel, lower RASM, does that start to change some of the -- through return on investment on some of the density as of the up-gauging?","Does that kind just mitigate some of the speed of up-gauging regional etcetera, or is that still sort of ahead and sort of incremental opportunities.","Richard Anderson","Let me take this. Where the up-gauging strategy is an important -- continuing important part of our fleet strategy because no matter what, operating the fleet more efficiently makes good sense from a margin standpoint.","And so when we up-gauge 50-seater to a 76-seater or a 76-seater to a 100-seater and all the way up the line, we\u2019re still going to be able to operate a larger number of ASMs with a fewer number of shelves in that kind of efficiency.","If you just think about it from a factory standpoint, we\u2019re running our factories much more efficiently and you\u2019ll always invest in efficiency in an industrial business.","David Fintzen","Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi good morning guys. Paul does the CASM ex-fuel guidance for the third quarter contemplate any deal with the pilot tap-ins that actually impacts the third quarter?","Paul Jacobson","We never those -- we never project future labor deals in our cost guidance.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then on I guess on pension discount rates seem to be up about 50 basis points year-to-date. Could you guys just give us say an update on where the pension expense and the deficit is projected at this point?","Paul Jacobson","Sure Darryl, Paul. The sensitivity on the underfunded pension plan is about a $1.5 billion for every 50 basis points. So we would expect to see obviously some goodness on the liability there. The rate isn\u2019t as sensitive on expense, but as we continue to fund above the minimum contributions we should see some expense going here as well.","Darryl Genovesi","Thanks and then if I could just squeeze one last one in, on the American Express deal, you laid out at the Investor Day a plan to essentially double our revenue stream over the next four, five years. Can you give us a sense of how much of that incremental revenue should drop due to earnings?","Paul Jacobson","I would anticipate we haven\u2019t publicly disclosed what the deal or the margin performance of that is, but there is a high contribution margin associated with the improved AmEx economics.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. Great. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew Didora","Hi, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my questions. I guess Ed, a housekeeping question, are you able to disclose kind of the cadence of domestic PRASM over the course of 2Q by month?","Ed Bastian","Domestic PRASM by month, I don\u2019t have that in front of me, but we\u2019ve disclosed that already.","Andrew Didora","Okay. I will add just another words.","Ed Bastian","We did overall not domestic. We will need to get back to you. We don\u2019t have that in front of us.","Andrew Didora","Okay. And then Paul in your prepared remarks, you had 15% hedged for the rest of the year obviously remains lower than where you have been in the past. How are you thinking about hedging now that oil has stayed in this kind of 60-ish dollar per barrel range now for good part of the year?","Are you content remaining to float at these levels? Are you interested in lettering on some more hedges as we go throughout the course '15?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Andrew. We haven\u2019t actually materially changed our hedge profile really since February. We\u2019ve been kind of sitting back watching the market there. There isn\u2019t really any urgency here and we\u2019re not really changing the course of action and we\u2019re content with where the book sits right now.","Andrew Didora","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much operator. Hi guys. Thanks for the time. Did you say and I missed the three cities that you were seeing weakness in, in the demotic market and can you say if you didn\u2019t?","Paul Jacobson","We did not say but they are Chicago, Dallas and Orlando.","Helane Becker","Great, okay. Thank you. And then my other question is, you guys do deliver a pretty amazing product to your customers on out of some pretty tough markets in which top rated like the Northeast where you get a lot of thunderstorms and a lot of air traffic control issues and so on.","So two questions A and B, one, as you get bigger especially in New York, how do you ensure that you continue to deliver that great operational performance and then B, is do your code share and JV partners deliver the same product and how do you ensure that your customers get the same product across all Delta code, coded flights. Thanks.","Richard Anderson","Let me try to answer those. As to the second point without going into the specifics because they're proprietary to Delta, we have very good programs to be certain that our products are consistent across our code share partners both domestically and internationally.","And we have a pretty significant focus on that and some firm specific proprietary strategies and processes that actually have our connection carriers running better on reliability basis in some of our mainline competitors.","And I think in New York and in Minneapolis and Detroit where you have really cold weather all the time in Atlanta, we have just made a lot of investments and I think have the leading management operations management team in the world for an airline.","And if you look at the performance of our operation, there is no airline even close to our size that performs at the kinds of levels and I think Ed had described it well at an Analyst Conference a while back last year and we\u2019re going to beat the record this year, but last year we had in the domestic system I think 195 days where we didn\u2019t cancel a domestic flight.","I think American, United and Southwest together add 12 and it just -- that same operating knowhow and capability which is driving huge share and revenue shifts to Delta can continue to improve and will continue to improve because we\u2019re just about at scale in both JFK and LaGuardia.","Helane Becker","Okay. So as we think about that, it\u2019s really that you\u2019re making investments on the technology side or on that the air, I guess the air side technology wise in an effort to really drive this improved performance because you\u2019re also doing it with fewer air traffic controllers and a pretty big decline in the ATC system as well.","Richard Anderson","We are, but we also had employees that are all incredibly committed to making the airline run and there is -- in the end, there is no substitute for the power of the -- and the knowhow of the employees.","But I would say it\u2019s a merrier of investments. Its better planning tools. It's a lot of technology investment. Its core reliability investments. Its process investment and how we build our schedules. It\u2019s a very long list of actions that we\u2019ve taken over time and investments that we\u2019ve taken over time.","Helane Becker","Great. Thank you so much for the time. I really appreciate it Richard.","Paul Jacobson","Helane, if I could jump in I just want to clarify one, Andrew from Merrill Lynch asked earlier about our domestic unit revenues by month, domestic unit revenue in April was flat. Domestic unit revenue in May was down 3% and in June it was also down 3%. So I just wanted to give that additional of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Tom Kim","Hi, good morning. Thanks for your time. Glen, I just want to press a little bit on your comment on corporate demand, how do I sort of reconcile some of the industry commentary about the weakness in close in bookings with your comment that corporate demand remains really strong.","Glen Hauenstein","I don\u2019t know where that weakness in close in bookings came into play and I apologize for not knowing when that comment was made, but it really has not been a weakness in close end bookings. It's been a weakness in close and yield and there is a big difference in there.","If corporate was not travelling, that would be one that where there was a demand weakness in terms of total load factor that would lead you to one conclusion. If there was a weakness in Europe because of a change in pricing that would lead you to a different conclusion.","So I did want to clarify that because I have read it in several reports where people were talking about close in demand deterioration, which is not what Delta has experienced, but we have experienced closing yield deterioration in several key business markets.","Tom Kim","Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. And then I just wanted to also ask you maybe a little bit of a longer-term question in nature with regard to ancillaries and your other segment category.","This year looks like it\u2019s going to be a flat if not a down year for passenger revenue, but clearly you\u2019re seeing really good growth in contribution from other avenues and I\u2019m just wondering we had nearly two strong good years of growth, can you give us a sense of what 2016 growth rate should look like as we start to try to model something around?","Is it something that\u2019s arguably a little bit more defensive or little bit more resilient where we consider kind of head on little bit more certainty?","Richard Anderson","I think we\u2019ll save that for our Investor Day later in the year, but while it's safe to say is some of the products are very, very popular with our customers are still very difficult to purchase from us and so 2016 is about arguably to bring us to the market in a much more user-friendly environment and continue to expand our products and services we have.","So we see a lot of continued upside through '16 and I think we\u2019ll save the punch line for our next Investor Day.","Tom Kim","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Hey good morning. Two questions, the first is on the third quarter unit revenue guidance, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what you\u2019re expecting from an FX and fuel surcharge? And then generally if there is any expectation of trend change within the regions?","Richard Anderson","We\u2019re pulling out little bit of it, Glen, do you have other ones. Go ahead.","Glen Hauenstein","FX surcharges are about half a point.","Richard Anderson","Okay.","Paul Jacobson","Savi you asked for the FX impact and the impact of surcharges, the FX is about three points and surcharge is about half point for the third quarter.","Savi Syth","Okay. And then generally the trends in there especially in national regions you\u2019re expecting a continuation of what you\u2019re seeing in the second quarter?","Richard Anderson","Yes, we are.","Savi Syth","Okay. And just a second question on the -- in Brazil and Mexico with the Open Skies like they're coming on here and the potential to do a antitrust immunized JV with your partners; just wondering, one is there sufficient swaps in this markets to take advantage of a situation and then also what a kind of ATI JV might contribute versus the type of partnership we have today with these partners?","Richard Anderson","Well obviously in the key markets in Sao Paulo, Mexican City there is a lot constrained and this will take time to continue to build out the efficiencies, but as we create the joint ventures and get our operations working together, we think there will be opportunities to certainly increase throughput there in the big markets and then to me more importantly working throughout the domestic landscape in both markets.","Savi Syth","What\u2019s the benefit of getting an ATI JV here and I know the chance you can just do a little bit more scheduling and what can you do today that you could do with that and what kind of contribution can we think of?","Richard Anderson","With ATI protection, we can go to the market together. So we can sell together. We schedule together. Our international feet, today we can\u2019t do that in those markets.","Savi Syth","Thank you.","Jill Sullivan Greer","We\u2019re going to have time for one more question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi","Hey thanks. Good morning. Sorry to harp on the PRASM here, but just kind of the walk from 3Q to 4Q, I guess the sense that there is some skepticism about the flat 4Q, is it just a function of the surcharges and FX comps get easier in 4Q and then you get the benefit of lower capacity.","Is that how you guys are kind of planning forward to get to flat in fourth quarter?","Richard Anderson","To be specific we said by year-end. So we set by fourth quarter and yes, there will be considerable amount of capacity reallocations potentially in the international arena. We will lapse the effects, the big effects of the unit revenue hedge largely from the fourth quarter on FX and our goal is to get the -- as we\u2019re heading into 2016 on a positive trajectory.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then Glen on the basic economy product, can you just walk me through how broadly that\u2019s deployed across the network at that point and whether that\u2019s contributing to any of the yield weakness you're seeing domestically?","Glen Hauenstein","Absolutely it\u2019s not contributing to the yield weakness because it\u2019s a very restricted product that really isn\u2019t purchased by most of our corporate clients. So as a matter of fact many of the corporate agreements we have exclude that as well as here in the marketplace.","So what we\u2019ve seen is a very high up-sell rate from that. Once people see what that fare is and what it offers that they\u2019re actually not purchasing that. So through delta.com when you look at that fare and then you are presented with other option 65% of the customers opt out of that fare.","And so we actually think that\u2019s yield accretive for leisure and really not very applicable for business travelers.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. So as you see more people opt out of it, does that result in you guys reducing the capacity that you\u2019re allocating to basic economy?","Glen Hauenstein","No, when I say opt out of that fare that means they\u2019re purchasing a higher fare on that flight. So if and let's just give an example of this, if the lowest fare from Detroit to Orlando is $59 and that was match of an existing spirit fare from it was presented on delta.com the $59 gets you a product that is without a seat assignment most people are opting not to take that fare, but to take the next higher fare, which is essentially an added on price.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. Thank you.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Okay. Let\u2019s then include the analysts portion of the call and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin Shinkle, our Chief Communications Officer.","Kevin Shinkle","Thanks Jill. We have a limited amount time for media. So we'll as many questions as possible. Please keep them brief and limit yourself to one follow-up. And with we'll go to our first call.","Operator","Our first question comes from Susan Carey with Wall Street Journal.","Susan Carey","Good morning. Could you all tell us a little bit more about your plans for Skymark?","Ed Bastian","Sure Susan. This is Ed. We are discussing with the creditors of Skymark the opportunity to invest as part of their rehabilitation and reconstruction process. We\u2019ve long been fairly public about our interest in having a local domestic Japanese partner.","This is an opportunity essentially to create that, but I think it\u2019s premature to speculate as to the odds of success of where this is going to go given there is a lot of unique attributes to the Japanese rehabilitation process that are been explored and we have -- we\u2019re in the discussion phase.","Susan Carey","Thank you. Let me just follow-up with one more, what\u2019s going to happen to the airplane orders for the 737900s and the Embraer 190s as a result of this pilot rejection?","Richard Anderson","Those orders will be canceled.","Susan Carey","That\u2019s Richard speaking.","Richard Anderson","Yes.","Susan Carey","Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dominic Gates with Seattle Times.","Dominic Gates","Hi, wanted to ask first you had a very heavy growth here in Seattle 35% year-on-year. Are you expecting the same level of growth to continue? What\u2019s your projection?","Richard Anderson","We couldn\u2019t hear that question. Could you just speak up.","Dominic Gates","Sorry, I\u2019ll switch to handset. Are you expecting to maintain the same level of growth out of Seattle in SeaTac as you've had in the past year?","Richard Anderson","We have said that our growth will start to meter down a bit, but we still are projecting future growth in SeaTac yes.","Dominic Gates","All right, but do you got a number on that?","Richard Anderson","We have not given a number, no.","Dominic Gates","And can I just follow-up the longer terms Transpacific strategy, could you just talk about where you see that going and about your fleet replacement plans there?","Richard Anderson","We think that the Pacific continues to be a bright spot in terms of global economic development and Seattle of course is our best positioned U.S. hub. We\u2019re very enthusiastic about the results to date in Seattle and today as of last month we are connecting now to over 700 people a day in SeaTac to firm our domestic system to our international network.","And that\u2019s why it\u2019s very important for us to continue to work with the city to ensure that we had adequate facilities to be able to create a world-class connecting opportunity in the City of Seattle.","So we\u2019re very enthusiastic about the potential in the future and we\u2019re committed to working with the communities to make sure that, that facility is a world-class experience for connecting customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffery Dastin with Reuters.","Jeffery Dastin","Thank you very much for your time. Would a deal with Skymark may strengthen Delta\u2019s relationship with Korean Air less important or would the two complement each other?","Richard Anderson","We\u2019re not going to speculate on future transactions Jeffery.","Jeffery Dastin","Okay. Thank you very much.","Richard Anderson","Well, if there are no other calls, I think we can conclude -- no other questions, we\u2019ll conclude this call.

My name is Cynthia and I will be your coordinator. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations for Delta.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our September quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta are Richard Anderson, Delta\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; Ed Bastian, our President; and Paul Jacobson, our Chief Financial Officer. Richard will open the call. Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and liquidity. We have our entire Executive team with us for the Q&A session and to get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted and you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations at delta.com.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard Anderson","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today we announced a September quarter profit of $768 million or $0.90 per share and an operating margin of 10.2% excluding unusual items. On a GAAP basis our net income was $1 billion. I\u2019d like to thank the entire Delta team for staying customer focused and running a good operation while producing strong financial results.","Delta is quite unique in the global industry with strong employee relationships. Our people are committed to make Delta the best and we are not distracted from serving our airline and its customers. That unique quality de-risks our business and is good for our equity holders. We look forward to rewarding our employees with well-earned profit-sharing checks in February which totaled $309 million in profit-sharing accruals year-to-date.","Delta\u2019s strong third quarter results combined with industry-leading operations and customer service reflect the benefits of steady execution of our strategies across the business and our prudent investment in the airline. We now have a product network and operation that customers are willing to pay a premium for.","During the quarter we produced an 8.3% revenue premium to the industry \u2013 our best performance on record. We have generated a revenue premium to the industry 18 months in a row and we intend on continuing to do so. Our operational performance this year has been quite good. For the last 12 months our all-time performance is running at about 87% domestically and our completion factor is 99.7% which may be a record for a major airline. Our DOT mishandled bag rate was down 18% from the prior year and we had a 35% decline in DOT customer complaints. Since 2007, our system bag claims have declined 66%.","Looking forward, we continue to have a positive outlook on RASM yields and loads in the December quarter. This is based on corporate revenue gains and Ed will discuss that in much greater detail, a strong global network, superior product and facilities.","Our October unit revenues will be up 4% to 5%, our capacity down 1% to 3% and we expect the December quarter to produce good profitability with an operating margin of 4% to 6%. With our consistent investment in the business and significant capacity reductions our non-fuel costs have grown faster than we would prefer in the past few quarters and this trend will continue into the first half of next year.","The actions we are taking now which include a $1 billion structural cost reduction over the next two years will allow us to maintain strong financial performance and free cash flow yield while laying the foundation for future revenue growth, cost efficiency, margin expansion and consistently hitting our return on invested capital targets. We are managing fuel, our top cost item, by taking the unique step of operating a refinery to address high jet crack spreads. Our refinery turnaround is progressing well under the leadership of Jeff Warman and our trainer team. We expect to be at full production by first quarter of 2013 and we expect a positive trainer contribution in 4Q. Paul will go into greater detail about our fuel positioning.","We are working to change the cost dynamic in this industry around fuel and our results from trainer and the events in the industry have validated our strategy. Delta will continue to take industry-leading action to control fuel expense by managing capacity, fully pricing our products to cover fuel costs, operating our refinery and deploying effective purchasing and conservation strategies. We will continue to prudently manage our capital spending in order to ensure that we generate strong free cash flow yields for our shareowners and we will continue our march to pay down debt.","With $5 billion of debt reduction already complete interest savings already generated are substantial and there is more to come as we approach our $10 billion target over the next year. In this quarter we paid down $270 million in debt bringing our adjusted net debt down to $11.9 billion. Debt pay down is important for our equity holders as it is the most accretive way for Delta to improve its EPS and derisk the business.","Finally, our $1 billion program of structural cost initiatives is important to maintain our unit cost advantage. The biggest part of this initiative is our domestic fleet restructuring which will fundamentally change our cost dynamic as part of our three year financial plan while simultaneously providing a superior product to our customers. We will begin to see those fleet restructuring benefits in the back half of 2013. The recent agreement with our pilots was critical to this initiative and our unique employee relations are instrumental in that effort to transform our fleet by up gauging across our domestic network.","The other initiatives in our cost reduction efforts will focus on maintenance savings, technology and process-driven efficiencies. The path we are taking has demonstrated that it is right for our shareholders, employees and customers. 2013 will be our fourth consecutive year of good profitability and free cash flow yields. While investments are producing results we must and will expand our margins and hit our ROIC target of 10% to 12% on a consistent basis over the next several years.","The strong financial foundation we have built is what allows us to move the focus away from a short term focus to positioning ourselves for long-term expansion, sustained profitability and shareholder returns.","Thank you for joining us. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed.","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone. As Richard mentioned, excluding special items, Delta reported a $768 million net income for the September quarter or $0.90 per share. This is in line with first call consensus. We had $279 million in net gains from special items which produced a $1 billion GAAP net income for the quarter. Special items included a $440 million gain from mark-to-market adjustments on fuel hedges, a $39 million gain from the slot exchange with U.S. Airways, $78 million in charges related to debt extinguishment, severance and related expense, and $122 million in facilities fleet and other charges which include the charges resulting from the closure of Comair.","I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank the Delta team for their work in producing another strong quarter for both financial and operational performance and I\u2019m happy to announce that we set aside $174 million in profit sharing this quarter, bringing our year-to-date profit sharing accrual up to $309 million.","During the quarter our top line revenue increased $107 million or 1% on a 1.5 point decrease in capacity. Passenger revenue grew $124 million driven by a three point improvement in yields. Our passenger unit revenues increased three points against a difficult base comparison period driven in part by corporate revenue gains. Cargo revenue decreased $40 million due to economic softening that we experienced in the Pacific region which resulted in a 10 point decline in cargo yields. Our other revenues were flat year over year as a decline in MRO volumes were offset by higher coach share and SkyMile revenues.","We have solid unit revenue performance across all entities during the September quarter. Our domestic unit revenues increased 3% on a one point decline in capacity. We continue to see strength in corporate revenues and we are pleased that our LaGuardia unit revenue was flat year-over-year despite the 42% increase in capacity from our new slot portfolio. This bodes well for our long-term LaGuardia strategy.","In the trans-Atlantic we saw the benefit from our proactive 5% capacity decrease as unit revenues increased three points despite the adverse macroeconomic outlook and a weak euro. Our Pacific performance was the best in the network as we saw a six point unit revenue improvement for the quarter due to strong yields and load factors on both the transpacific and intra-quart flying. Our land franchise was solidly profitable during the quarter with year-over-year unit revenue growth roughly flat on a three point increase in capacity.","We continue to gain traction in corporate revenues with our corporate revenue bookings up 8% over the last four weeks. We continued to see strong double-digit year-over-year performance in financial services and banking and our manufacturing and technology sectors each grew at 9%. We\u2019re making good progress on our revenue initiatives. Year-to-date, 2012 our first-class up-sell program has generated a paid first class load factor of 32% which is up seven full points from the prior year and we continue to see strong revenues from our popular, economy-comfort product.","For the September quarter we generated a 106.7% system index as measured by the A4A RASM benchmarking. This represents a 2.3 point year-over-year improvement in revenue market share. I\u2019d like to thank the entire Delta team for the outstanding revenue performance we\u2019ve seen this year.","In terms of our outlook our December quarter bookings are shaping up well for both the yield and load factor size. For the month of October, we anticipate that our unit revenues will increase 4% to 5% driven by corporate revenue strength and continued capacity discipline. We\u2019re seeing positive trends in November despite difficult comps and slow demand during the election week. The month of November will be our second most difficult year-over-year comp this year, second to September, so we expect November to post smaller year-over-year gains than we are experiencing in October.","Domestic demand for the quarter looked strong. We experienced good leisure demand around the Columbus Day holiday and we are optimistic that leisure traffic will also be robust for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.","In New York we\u2019re seeing positive trends in our enhanced LaGuardia network as well as on our Transcons out of JFK which are benefiting from the upgrades we\u2019ve made in our business elite product.","Our Transatlantic outlook for the December quarter is solid despite the economic backdrop as the entity is benefiting from both Delta and our JV partners capacity discipline, product improvements and continued corporate revenue share gains. Pacific demand has held up well for October although we anticipate some pressure for November and December due to tougher comps and higher industry capacity levels in Tokyo. And on the corporate side we continue to see strength out into the quarter. In our quarterly survey of corporate travel managers, 82% anticipate that travel spend will remain either the same or increase versus prior year for the December quarter and the level of optimism for travel spend growth improves as we move forward into 2013.","For the company\u2019s guidance, we\u2019re forecasting a solidly profitable December quarter with an operating margin, as Richard said, of 4% to 6%. We are forecasting our December capacity to be down 1% to 3% with domestic capacity down 1% to 3% and international capacity down 2% to 4%.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Jacobson","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter our nonfuel unit costs increased by 5.6% and we expect to see a similar level of growth in the December quarter. While due in part to our capacity reductions, we\u2019ve continued to experience cost pressures from the investments that we made in the business. The 5.6% increase was driven primarily by wage and benefit changes which accounted for roughly half of the increase and maintenance costs which were up $65 million for the quarter. This maintenance increase was largely due to a one time acceleration of engine inductions to take advantage of favorable vendor pricing as well as initiatives aimed at improving our operational reliability and positioning us for future efficiencies. As we look forward, we expect maintenance expense to be roughly flat in the fourth quarter the prior year.","Up to this point, our margins have expanded through a period of product investment in cost increases. While this trend will continue into the first half of next year, now is the time to lay the foundation for future margin expansion through our $1 billion program of structural initiatives. We anticipate these initiatives will generate significant savings beginning in the second half of next year while maintaining a high-quality product, network and operation that we have built. These initiatives will produce comprehensive structural changes to the way we do business at Delta. They are not easy and it will take some time and some upfront cost to implement but when we are complete, we expect them to take our earnings power to the next level.","The initiatives are focused in three broad categories. The first category is our domestic fleet restructuring. As far as this effort, we will be updating our fleet by replacing 50-seaters with mainline aircraft and larger regional Jets. The mainline aircraft begin arriving next summer with the arrival of both the 717s and the 737-900s. These new aircraft are expected to generate significant operating and maintenance savings. This up-gauge our fleet is a good fit for our system and enables us to leverage the benefits of consolidation and our scale. In addition, the associated 50 seat retirements will allow us to avoid significance maintenance expense in the future.","The second major category is maintenance savings. In addition, to the savings associated with the 50 seat retirements we have a comprehensive focus on reducing material expense by capitalizing on used aircraft purchases and part-outs.","The final category technology and process driven savings. We will leverage the investments and continue to leverage them that we\u2019ve made in our systems and our Delta.com platform to improve distribution expenses by continuing to ship more share to Delta.com. In addition, we have initiatives underway targeted in improving logistics, lowering vendor expense and maximizing the benefits from our investments in our scheduling systems and facility. We will discuss these in more detail at our Investor Day in New York in December.","Turning to fuel, Delta paid $3.14 per gallon during the September quarter, $0.05 higher than prior year. We had $26 million of settled hedge losses during the quarter. Based on Friday\u2019s market close, we are projecting a fuel price of between $3.15 and $3.20 for the December quarter. Production levels at Trainer are continuing to ramp up and we are pleased with the initial results we\u2019re receiving from the facility. Jet fuel production began in September and we anticipate the refinery to be at full production run rate in November. Based on recent curves, which have been highly volatile, we expect Trainer\u2019s production to generate a contribution of break even to $25 million for the December quarter.","Shifting now to liquidity, we ended the September quarter with $5.1 billion in unrestricted liquidity which included $1.9 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $545 million and we generated $120 million in free cash flow.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $425 million of which $275 million were for fleet investments which included deposits for new aircraft, induction costs for used aircraft and continuing our fleet modifications including flatbed installations.","During the quarter we paid down $270 million in net debt ending the quarter with an adjusted net debt of $11.9 billion \u2013 another step forward in our delevering strategy. This is the first time since 2007 that our net adjusted debt has been below $12 billion.","Our debt reduction has already produced $60 million in interest expense savings for year-to-date 2012 as compared to prior years including $34 million in the September quarter alone. While we are focused on reducing our debt we are also working to lower rates across our overall debt portfolio. To that end this month we refinanced $1.7 billion in debt and undrawn lines of credit secured by our Pacific groups and slots. Strong investor demand for this transaction allowed us to upsize and provide very cheap liquidity, maintain our revolver and still achieve an all-in interest rate at 4.5%. We anticipate achieving more than $30 million in annual interest savings from this refinancing alone.","To wrap up, we had a good September quarter with good profitability and further debt reduction. I\u2019m proud of the work the Delta team has continued to do this quarter and I\u2019d like to thank the Delta employees worldwide for their dedication and determination as we continue the hard work of building a better airline for the long term.","I\u2019m excited about the steps we\u2019re taking for the future and look forward to sharing more with each of you at Investor Day.","Jill Greer","Thank you Richard, Ed and Paul. Before we move to questions I did just want to take a minute and remind everybody as Paul mentioned about our annual Investor Day which will be held on December 12 in New York. So please mark your calendars. We\u2019ll send out more information shortly and we hope to see you all there.","So with that, Cindy, could you give everybody the instructions for the Q&A process.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you, Ms. Greer. (Operator Instructions) Our first analyst question comes from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great job with gaining corporate travel share, but I think there\u2019s a bit of a concern that you\u2019ve over-earned on corporate travel in recent years just given the challenges that some of your competitors have had. As we think about a world where American is getting closer to emerging from bankruptcy alone or not, to what extent do you think your corporate travel share is going to be put at risk?","Ed Bastian","John, this is Ed. Thanks for your compliments. We\u2019ll try hard to make certain that we maintain all the share that we\u2019ve acquired to date. A fair bit of the share that we\u2019ve acquired is truly new share as we brought the benefits of our investments in product and technology, facilities in New York, facilities in Atlanta. So I don\u2019t anticipate there is going to be a dilution of that as we look forward. I think any future change in the industry will be positive for everyone. I know we\u2019ve had in the most recent weeks certainly some share gains from some of the problems that American has had but they\u2019re relatively modest and candidly are not big numbers of that share gain that we\u2019ve seen.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I guess the concern is more on the economics of the business too \u2013 not just the share. When we think about potential consolidation just for the economics of corporate travel going forward, is that specifically a negative or a positive on corporate travel isolated?","Richard Anderson","This is Richard, John. We think that further industry consolidation will be overall quite good for Delta and quite good for the industry and believe that if you look at the current organizational construct of the industry we need the next transaction to be completed. And when it\u2019s completed then we have a pretty rational organizational construct in the industry that will benefit Delta.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Jill Greer","Thanks, John.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Fintzen with Barclays Capital.","Dave Fintzen \u2013 Barclays Capital","A question for maybe Paul just picking up on some of the cost commentary for next year. As we look at this 5% to 7% non-fuel CASM pressure in the fourth quarter, is that the right run rate to think of generic, roughly? I know it\u2019s early to have specifics but is that the right run rate to think in the first half of next year? And then how fast do we sort of pivot as those investments benefit you and then we obviously overlap the raises from this year. I\u2019m just curious how should we think about first half versus second half and first half run rate?","Paul Jacobson","I think David, it\u2019s a little premature to go into more specifics around first half cost guidance but I think if you look at salaries and wages the increases took effect in July and there\u2019s another tranche to come in January. So the first half pressures are going to continue to be there. I think as we get to Investor Day, we\u2019ll have more details around the timing of some of these structural initiatives which we expect to begin to take hold in the second half of next year.","Dave Fintzen \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Appreciate that. And then maybe a broader question, on the move to re-fleet the domestic, how much concern or focus is there on what others are doing with regional jets in terms of how that could affect the revenue assumptions? I mean does it matter in terms of this project if United is re-fleeting with 70-seaters as well? Or is it pretty much a Delta-specific project.","Richard Anderson","I can\u2019t speak to what any other competitors around the world are doing with their fleets. I can speak specifically to the economics of the 50-seat fleet. And by our point of view the 50-seat fleet reduction will be significantly accretive to our enterprise. Because, when you think about it in a really basic way, we\u2019re going to reduce the number of airplanes we have on the enterprise because the 50-seaters have the long-range fuel prices that we have today are no longer economic, particularly in states lengths over about 450 miles. So by up-gauging the domestic with MD-90 and 717s which are really capital efficient and then the 737-900s, we\u2019ll be able to produce the same number of seats but we\u2019ll do it with fewer airplanes, fewer takeoffs and landings which is where the scale leverage comes from, from the fleet changes. I don\u2019t know about others. I can just talk about what it does for the Delta network.","Dave Fintzen \u2013 Barclays Capital","And just in the sense of retaining that revenue on that lower-cost base, you\u2019re pretty confident that its revenue that\u2019s in the network, solidly in the network and you don\u2019t need to worry about someone coming in and down-gauging and stealing some of that share?","Ed Bastian","No, because actually, we\u2019ll be mindful of our frequency by market and that\u2019s a key driver, and the 717 deal, particularly, gives us much better gauge and the second thing is, I don\u2019t think customers want to fly 800, 900 miles on a 50-seater. Part of what we\u2019re doing here is putting a better product in the market, better fuel efficiency, fewer airplanes in the air and our customers tell us they much prefer flying on mainline airplanes rather than 34-, 44-, and 50-seat airplanes.","Dave Fintzen \u2013 Barclays Capital","No, that make sense. I appreciate the color. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Will take your next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","Richard Anderson","Good morning.","Jill Greer","Hey, Jim.","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan","First question for Richard, you\u2019ve had another three months or so to think about how you\u2019ll proceed after achieving Delta $10 billion net-debt target. Any current color in regards to how you\u2019re thinking about pension pre- funding, share buybacks or a potential dividend policy?","Richard Anderson","Maybe I\u2019ll start by answering at the same way I did three months ago and ask you what we should you think we should do?","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan","Well, quite frankly it\u2019s up to your actual owners, but I speak to them a lot, all the analysts do, and I think we\u2019re kind of at an inflection point here at $10. I think at a depressed share price, there\u2019s appetite for buybacks, but if your trading $15, $16, $17 certainly our hope, I think a dividend policy is in the lead right now, pension pre-funding definitely bringing up the rear amongst most equity clients that I speak to.","Richard Anderson","Well, look that\u2019s really good feedback and it\u2019s really important feedback for us. So to give you our plan, we\u2019re going to get through 2013 and complete our leveraging goal that we have. I do think it\u2019s worthwhile for us to continue deleveraging on the balance sheet because it\u2019s so accretive when we take the non-op expense out. But at the same time, our Board and our management team understand our large shareholders want to understand what we\u2019re going to do with our free cash flow yield when we get down to the end of 2013.","So I would extend an invitation, not only to the December 2012 annual Investor Day, but to the December 2013 annual Investor Day because I think we\u2019re going to have pretty good color on what our next steps will be, and we are sympathetic to our shareholder desire to share in that free cash flow yield.","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. And second question for Paul, you talk about this $1 billion mystery program of initiatives. Unfortunately it comes after you identified an $8.04 x-fuel target for this year only to consistently time and time again back away from that figure. My first question is whether this is truly a new initiative or simply a do-over of what you failed to achieve this year. Second question is it that if it is something new, why should we trust that things are going to turn out better this time? And is $8.04 still the right target to be using?","Paul Jacobson","I think, Jamie, as we think about targets what were focused on doing is identifying and communicating the billion dollars as clear and a transparent manner as possible, and we\u2019ll plan to do that at Investor Day where there\u2019s a better, longer forum to do that. The targets and the CASM is really a function of what our long-term plans are. I\u2019m not comfortable talking about that right now without discussions around how longer-term our strategic plans look as to capacity re-fleeting et cetera. I think the better avenue to do that is at Investor Day.","Ed Bastian","Jamie, this is Ed. The $1 billion that we\u2019re referring to is candidly, part of that same cost-reduction initiative that we talked at the Investor Day last year as we laid out that plan. As I think he said at that planned discussion it\u2019d take probably about two years to implement and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at now in terms of the implementation. I think we said at the time and we said since that 8.4 was a calculation at a point in time, it\u2019s obviously influenced by a lot of other factors, capacity levels which we continue to take down, the opportunity to move ahead with our pilots which obviously puts much higher pressure on it. So from that standpoint it\u2019s not backing down from our cost goals, we\u2019re saying that we\u2019re going to have to have a reset though due to the change in the macroeconomic factors, not anything that\u2019s different from the $1 billion target.","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. Thanks for the color, I appreciate it. Look forward to hearing more in December. Take care.","Richard Anderson","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning, everyone. Two questions here. When we talked I guess it was Paul, you had talked about the fleet restructuring, Richard yourself as well, you talked about bringing on the 717s and the 737-900s. You also get the ability to add more, larger regional Jets, the 76-seaters and I believe you go from, I want to say, 255 up to 325. Are those airplanes going to be sourced from your current partners? Or will Delta be in the market? Will you be out there either putting those airplanes on your balance sheet or signing the master leases? And what\u2019s the timing on that?","Ed Bastian","Well, we are in the process now of running a competition between Bombardier and Embraer and our expectation is that time around, by the end of the year we\u2019ll have a pretty good idea of what direction we\u2019re going to go. Our goal is to use that to take out a significant number of 50-seaters.","So we will look at all alternatives in terms of which balance sheet they end up on, the regional partner on Delta but when you think about it from a total liability perspective, what our goal is, is to take out the debt and significant costs that are part of owning all these 50-seaters. So when you think about say bringing in 40 76-seaters and taking out 60, 50-seaters, there\u2019s a really good balance sheet and CASM trade there. So when you think about, regardless of where it ends up in terms of the balance sheet, we want to take a significant amount of debt off, to the extent we put that on, by buying 76-seaters.","Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Super helpful, Richard. And then my second question, this is to Paul, you ended the third quarter with $5.1 billion of cash and it looks like at year-end you\u2019re going to be $5.2 total liquidity. I did see the blurb about that, it looks like you\u2019re going to pay down $600 million of debt and it looks like by way of a call option here sometime, I think it\u2019s in November. Are you going to see any cash come in the door from your AMEX agreement? Can you just reconcile some of those different events?","Paul Jacobson","Well, the call that you referred to is related to the Pacific refinancing that we did.","Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Ed Bastian","We\u2019ve closed the cash to fund that, but if you look at our fourth quarter free cash flow from last year, there\u2019s a similar pattern this year in terms of the flows from AMEX and miles purchases.","Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James","Good morning, everybody. Just a question on the Latin American revenue. It seems like unit revenue desolated more than the other regions and I was wondering, is that a result of capacity growth in the region or is there kind of a slowing down in demand?","Glen Hauenstein","This is Glen Hauenstein, and what we see moving forward in Latin America is an increase in capacity offered primarily by the foreign-flag carriers with both Lon and Tom being up significantly into South America, it\u2019s primarily focused on South America and so yields and traffic in South America has come a little bit under pressure.","Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, understood. And then just a quick follow-up question. On the 50-seat RJs, have you decided what you\u2019re doing on the 41 that Delta is responsible for related to the updated agreement SkyWest ? Meaning, if you\u2019re taking those back, are there costs related to that will be hitting in 2013 or so?","Glen Hauenstein","I think the individual sales that we\u2019ve identified through the 50-seaters, we haven\u2019t gone into that detail but we\u2019re working through to identify specifically which aircraft are coming out. But as Richard mentioned, the goal is to make this as close to debt-neutral as we can.","Ed Bastian","Savi, this is Ed. The 41 you\u2019re referring to, actually it\u2019s 66 not 41 and yes, we\u2019ve accounted for the 66 and they\u2019re going to be either sat down, parted out or otherwise disposed of.","Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James","Okay.","Richard Anderson","But that\u2019s all in our forward-looking guidance that we\u2019ve provided.","Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James","Perfect the 41 I mentioned is because I think 25 is on SkyWest\u2019s balance sheet. Correct?","Richard Anderson","Right but we got out of 66.","Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Glenn Engel, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Two questions please, one on RASM, if I look at the Asian RASM it was up six which was good but the industry was up nine. Why would you be lagging?","Ed Bastian","We got a lot of new capacity in from the over flights and the stage link was up substantially in the quarter. I think that would be the primary differential, and then there\u2019s also a lot of capacity in Japan. So as we move forward with ANA and Jal, we are the largest carrier to Japan so there is a lot of pressure with new frequencies to New York, new frequencies to Seattle, new frequencies to San Diego and San Jose offered by the Japanese carriers as they complete their restructuring.","Richard Anderson","And, Glenn, the other, we restarted Detroit Inada, that\u2019s in the quarter, that wasn\u2019t in the prior year comp and that was another two point drag on the Pacific which we\u2019ve now taken out of the system as of October 1.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Second question on the cost side, $1 billion is about 3% or 4%, one I\u2019m never sure cost, is this cuts from what would\u2019ve happened? So you would have had cost increases and you\u2019re going to take the $1 billion out of the cost increases? Or is this actually saying we\u2019re going to lower the nonfuel costs by $1 billion? And is the $1 billion enough?","Paul Jacobson","Glenn, it\u2019s never enough, right, so we\u2019re always looking for ways to improve, but the $1 billion is the total amount of the initiative, not the net. There will be cost growth in other areas and the $1 billion is our primary means by which we\u2019re combating inflationary pressures which we\u2019re seeing in many parts of the business.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So the $1 billion will just hopefully keep you from your unit cost growing, you really wouldn\u2019t expect it to bring the cost actually down at any point?","Paul Jacobson","We\u2019re going to go through that on Investor Day Glenn.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore Partners.","Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. On the fleet savings you expect, can you comment on the negotiate conditions on the 717s and specifically how much life will be left on those engines? And how should we be thinking about a maintenance honeymoon, if any, as you transition to that fleet?","Richard Anderson","The airplanes come fresh out of their next check and fresh out of overhaul. Steve Gorman you want to give some particulars?","Ed Bastian","The only thing I would say to add to what Richard said would be that from an engine standpoint we would basically be taking on long-term power by the hour deal on the engines and so that probably would not be in a maintenance honeymoon period. And what Richard said on the check airplane check is exactly right, they\u2019re fresh out of check as we receive them, of whatever their next check due was.","Richard Anderson","And the cost related to putting them in the Delta configuration with Delta seats, Delta delivery, Delta interior product, fresh overhaul, paint job and all the reliability mods, the airplane is delivered to us in that condition so that cost is not ours.","Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then just if I could follow up on the refinery, I think you talked about a longer term target of $300 million and I think the underlying assumption on that was a $16 jet fuel crack spread. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of volatility around that assumption but if we look now in the, call it $35 $40 range what would be the updated savings estimate be?","Richard Anderson","I think, Duane, I think when you\u2019re looking at a $35 to $40 crack, you\u2019re looking at it off the WTI versus a brent crack. We still feel confident in our $300 million annual target. It has to do more with the relationship between all of the products that are produced at the refinery, but in spite of the volatility that we\u2019ve seen, we remain confident in achieving that over the long term.","Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners","It seems there would be upside to that number just wondering why \u2013 I guess we\u2019ll wait for Investor Day.","Richard Anderson","Well, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s upside to the number depending upon what crack spreads are, and we built our case on a conservative basis, and we think the refinery is going to be a very quick payback.","Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Richard Anderson","Good morning, Hunter.","Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Hey. How are you? Glenn a question for you; so we\u2019ve noticed that Air France along with you guys obviously are adjusting some of the winter schedule pulling down or terminating actually, say some service to both Miami and DFW. I\u2019m wondering if this is because the one world JV is turning out to be maybe a little more competitive than you guys initially assumed. Or have they just been pricing sort of aggressively and irrationally there just to kind of drive you out. Maybe some color on that market dynamic would be helpful.","Richard Anderson","Hunter, I think that what we did when we plan the fall and winter was to look at the macroeconomics, the forward fuel curves, the forward demand set, the economic forecast for Europe and it really had less to do with competitive set because when you add it all out, the competition is actually offering \u2013 in aggregate, is offering less capacity this winter than they did last winter, and you pointed out one world is expanding, one world is expanding and that remains to be seen how successful that expansion is in the winter season but it was not in response to that, it was really in response to what we saw as the macroeconomic forecast.","Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay. Thank you, Glen. And this is a little more of a sort of off-beat question. I\u2019m not sure who would answer this, maybe Paul. As you think about the implementation of the Volcker rule in the fourth quarter here and beyond, there\u2019s going to be an impact not only as to how banks run their commodities trading desks and I know you guys have ramped up your own commodities trading operation, so it\u2019s a two-part question, one, what do you expect the commodity trading landscape to look like after Volcker rule has been implemented? And two, is it going to impact how you decide to hedge your fuel? Thanks a lot.","Richard Anderson","That is an obscure question.","Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","I know. It\u2019s obscure but it could have an impact. I mean, Goldman is talking about potentially getting rid of its commodity-trading operation. I mean it\u2019s a very less profitable operation then it was for the bank. Obviously, your answer is what it is, you haven\u2019t really thought about it too much at this point it seems, right?","Ed Bastian","Well, I mean first of all, I think the characterization about a trading operation compared to corporate hedging program I don\u2019t think is necessarily a good one. We\u2019re very confident in our execution and don\u2019t see any significant changes coming through our counterparties. We have close relationships with them; we\u2019re comfortable with where we sit.","Richard Anderson","Hunter, this is Richard. First we would get an end-user exemption under the CFTC rules, so in terms of what it would require in terms of counterparty postings and the like, I think we\u2019re going to continue business as usual in that regard. The second thing is, is the over-the-counter feature will give us a lot more transparency into what the profitability of our counterparties may be in some of these trades. The third thing I\u2019d point out is, it might be a good thing for a lot of people to take their passive money out of the forward market, because we still think there\u2019ll be enough liquidity in the futures market, and one of the things that I still think the industry has suffered from is that the forward fuel market has become the next stock market.","And so you have so much passive money in the last 10 years that it flowed into the futures market that it might not be all bad to have a lot of that money flow back out of the market so that the supply and demand signals that we see in the underlying market tell you that jet fuel ought to be \u2013 brent ought to be about $20 less than what it is today. So maybe we get to more rational markets.","Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay. Great. Thanks for that, Richard. Appreciate it.","Richard Anderson","You bet, Hunter. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dani McKenzie \u2013 Buckingham Research","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks. A couple questions here. Paul if I could circle back to your commentary, margin expansion resulting from investment which would help take Delta\u2019s earnings power to the next level once done. I believe Delta today is targeting 10% to 12% margins on a calendar basis. Does that mean you\u2019ll start to target 15% margins longer-term, something higher? What can you say to elaborate on that? Thanks.","Paul Jacobson","Well, I think Dan, that\u2019s taking it from where we are today to getting to that 10% to 12% level. We\u2019ve put a lot of investment into the product and it\u2019s paid tremendous dividends with our revenue performance. There comes a point where you can\u2019t always count on further revenue performance going forward, and we want to make sure that we\u2019re restructuring to address the cost side of the equation too in order to contribute to that future margin expansion off of today\u2019s current levels.","Richard Anderson","And to clarify, Dan, not to speak for Richard but the 10% to 12% that you referred to was return on invested capital not operating margins.","Ed Bastian","Right. Which was exactly where we are this quarter.","Dani McKenzie \u2013 Buckingham Research","I appreciate that clarification, thanks. And then secondly, Glen, I see the capacity cuts to Europe of course which are pretty steep on Delta\u2019s part but I wonder if you can provide a little bit more perspective about the demand set, this just follows up on Hunter\u2019s question. I guess as you look ahead with respect to the inputs, does it factor in price elasticity from higher ticket prices? And I\u2019m guessing it does but I guess I\u2019m not sure how you go about measuring that elasticity given the macro here. Maybe to ask a little differently, is the demand set really driven by corporate travel feedback, something different? Any additional color you can provide can provide would be helpful just given how the wheels look like they could potentially fall off the wagon.","Glen Hauenstein","I think our premise, our basic premise is airline seats are more elastic than people give him credit for and the industry has passed along their increases we see very little drop-off in demand. As a matter of fact in the month of October we\u2019re running a month to date load factor that\u2019s around 84%, so we\u2019re maybe at historic highs despite improving yields. Is that your question or is it more specific to Europe?","Dani McKenzie \u2013 Buckingham Research","Yeah, I guess it was really specific to Europe, just given the volatility in the macro backdrop there which could really disrupt demand trends.","Glen Hauenstein","Absolutely and I think again this is similar to a comment I made in last quarter, is the headlines don\u2019t match our results. And what we see through the winter months is actually some very positive signs in terms of European command, the market responds to the capacity discipline. So we\u2019re very optimistic as we run through what\u2019s historically the winter odysseys and the weak five months of the year and we\u2019re going to post very favorable improvement in unit revenues despite not only the economic headwinds but the headwinds of the currency on a year over year basis. So we\u2019ve mitigated, it looks like we\u2019re going to mitigate both of those and the demand is actually moving both ways, so European multinationals who are having trouble doing business in Europe are actually coming to the U.S. to do business, and so there\u2019s lot of dynamics that are appealing in that I think.","Dani McKenzie \u2013 Buckingham Research","Terrific. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Bob McAdoo with Imperial Capital.","Bob McAdoo \u2013 Imperial Capital","My questions have all been answered. Thanks. Good job, guys.","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Bob.","Richard Anderson","Thanks, Bob.","Jill Greer","And, Cindy, I think this is going to be our last question coming up.","Operator","Our last analyst question will come from Helane Becker with Dahlman Rose.","Helane Becker \u2013 Dahlman Rose","Thanks, Jill, for squeezing it in. I appreciate it. Just a question about Atlanta. You guys talked a lot about picking up corporate share in New York, but I think when Southwest bough AirTran and they start to take over and reconfigure their aircraft, they\u2019re getting rid a lot of the front seats. So can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in Atlanta in terms of both pricing on the walk up side and in terms of share gains?","Glen Hauenstein","This is Glen, how are you?","Helane Becker \u2013 Dahlman Rose","Good, thanks.","Glen Hauenstein","We see a very favorable dynamic going on in Atlanta in the short, medium and long-term since AirTran has been taken over by Southwest, they\u2019re down almost 50% in capacity from what AirTran\u2019s peak was as you look out into the forward months. And they are rationalizing more and more cities. I believe last week they announced that they were stopping service next spring to Charlotte, to Rochester, New York and to Flint, Michigan from Atlanta which is in addition to the many cities they were already closed.","Their departure levels are down to about 177 a day but the transition has been I think from our perspective difficult because if you look at the key 100 data that comes out in the spring, AirTran and Southwest have a lot of trouble filling their seats so they put some very aggressive sale fares out there. We think those will be mitigated over time as they continue to rationalize capacity and we\u2019re very optimistic as we go through the winter schedule and the spring schedule that we\u2019ll have a lot of traction here in Atlanta.","Helane Becker \u2013 Dahlman Rose","Okay. So you would say that you we\u2019re seeing share gains from them, is that it?","Glen Hauenstein","Absolutely","Helane Becker \u2013 Dahlman Rose","Okay. Great. Thanks. We\u2019ll see you in September.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Helane, and that is going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call and so I\u2019ll hand it over to you Ned Walker.","Richard Anderson","Okay. Thanks very much, Jill. Cindy, if you could go over the process again for queuing up to ask a question for the media and once again for the media, we would like to have one question with a quick follow-up and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to accommodate everyone.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now take questions from the media. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our first question from Josh Freed with the Associated Press.","Josh Freed \u2013 Associated Press","Good morning. You mentioned earlier that you\u2019re seeing that customers are willing to pay a premium to fly on Delta and just wondering if you could say more about that. I mean are you seeing that premium show up in fares? Or are you thinking of that is more of a sort of general premium because you\u2019re also collecting out baggage fees or upgraded seats or that kind of thing? Where are you seeing that premium show up?","Richard Anderson","Primarily, in corporate share and yield. But the airline is running very, very high load factors on an annual basis. So it\u2019s very hard to take in traffic and what we\u2019re seeing is a higher and higher share of the higher-yielding customers selecting Delta.","Josh Freed \u2013 Associated Press","All right. Thank you.","Richard Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andy Compart with Aviation Week.","Andy Compart \u2013 Aviation Week","Good morning.","Richard Anderson","Hey, Andy.","Andy Compart \u2013 Aviation Week","You guys are doing well. Just a couple quick questions. On the refinery, you said that revenue prediction is pretty much staying the same. I\u2019m wondering if the cost estimate you gave at the beginning which I think was around 100 million, if that has stayed the same or if you you\u2019ve had some unanticipated costs or anything?","Richard Anderson","Hey, Andy. Richard, good question. Our turnaround costs are tracking quite close to plan through the end of the year and the turnaround will result in our being at full production probably near the end of 4Q but for sure by 1Q.","Andy Compart \u2013 Aviation Week","And just to be clear on the regional jet timing. Can you expect to make a big decision between LaGuardia and Embraer by the end of this year? And then...","Richard Anderson","Andy, that\u2019s our plan.","Andy Compart \u2013 Aviation Week","And then, at that point do you think you\u2019ll have agreements in place which regionals are going to operate which jets and where the 50 seaters are going to be dropped. Is that going to be wrapped up by then?","Richard Anderson","Yeah, we still have that we wrapped up, Andy.","Andy Compart \u2013 Aviation Week","Is that the same time table or different?","Richard Anderson","We hope that it\u2019s around the same timetable.","Andy Compart \u2013 Aviation Week","Okay. Thanks.","Richard Anderson","You bet. Thank you for calling in.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Karen Jacobs with Reuters.","Karen Jacobs \u2013 Reuters","Hi. I had a follow up on the Lombardi and Embraer content. How many planes are you looking to buy?","Richard Anderson","We haven\u2019t finalized the number of airplanes. Under our agreement with our pilots we have the ability to take up to 70 additional 76-seat airplanes, so it would be some number less than 70.","Karen Jacobs \u2013 Reuters","Okay. And then I had another question, sort of a question about the cost-cutting plan. Have you ruled out layoffs as you look to drive down costs over the next year?","Richard Anderson","Right. We have ruled out layoffs. We have a strong tradition at Delta of managing our unit cost per person now by using voluntary programs and pushing productivity throughout our business. So it\u2019s a really important part of the strong relationships we have with our employees. We want them to be secure in their jobs so they can provide really good customer service to our customers.","Karen Jacobs \u2013 Reuters","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mary Jane Credeur with Bloomberg News.","Mary Jane Credeur \u2013 Bloomberg News","Hi, folks. Can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re going to afford that new pilot contract?","Richard Anderson","Hi, Mary Jane, this is Richard. Sorry for not saying hello. When you look at the overall value that we\u2019re going to create as a result of unlocking the ability to refleet plus the productivity that has been built into that agreement, we\u2019re confident that it will be an important part of our ability to get to unit cost over the next couple of years to improve our margins and our return on invested capital.","Glen Hauenstein","And, Mary Jane, this is Ed. One additional thing, we also reduced the profit sharing going forward and that\u2019s an important part of helping to fund that cost growth.","Mary Jane Credeur \u2013 Bloomberg News","Sure. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ted Reed with TheStreet.","Ted Reed \u2013 TheStreet","Thank you. Rich, you said that you would applaud the industry consolidation, that it would be quite good for Delta but the contemplated transaction would make a much stronger competitor to Delta in the Southeast across the Trans-Atlantic and probably elsewhere. SO what\u2019s the rationalization for saying that?","Richard Anderson","Ted, good question. When you just think around the world and it\u2019s not just in the U.S. but around the world, the industry consolidation has really helped regions around the world, and the region I think about is Latin America which has probably led the worldwide region, the regions around the world in consolidation. And so you end up with just a much more rational industrial organization, and when you have a much more rational industrial organization the participants in the organization tend to do better. So we think we have competitive advantages that will allow us to continue to sustain the distance that we put between ourselves and the rest of the industry, and of course, we don\u2019t intend on giving up any market share.","Ted Reed \u2013 TheStreet","All right. Thank you.","Richard Anderson","Okay, Cindy. We have time for two more quick questions.","Operator","Okay. We\u2019ll take our next question from Kelly Yamanouchi with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.","Kelly Yamanouchi \u2013 Atlanta Journal-Constitution","Hi, there. I was wondering, as Southwest and AirTran are re-gearing their networks, are you starting to see noticeable frequent-flier loyalty gains or new AMEX card holders from them?","Richard Anderson","Hi, Kelly. This is Richard. I\u2019m going to ask Glen to answer that.","Glen Hauenstein","Hi, Kelly. It\u2019s Glen. How are you?","Richard Anderson","Hi, there.","Glen Hauenstein","We just had record acquisitions for the last several months but it\u2019s primarily acquisitions in both New York and Atlanta so we\u2019re very excited about the card and the AMEX card it looks like (inaudible) next few months and I think we are seeing share gains not only in our hubs but across the entire network.","Kelly Yamanouchi \u2013 Atlanta Journal-Constitution","Great. And I was also wondering if there\u2019s an idea for a timeframe for deployment of the additional 76-seaters once you reach a deal?","Richard Anderson","Kelly, this is Richard. Typically when you place an order for an airplane, the earliest you get it is 16 months to 18 months after you placed the order. So you would expect just like on our 73-900ER order, we placed that, it\u2019ll be 2 years ago this August or August 13 and we\u2019ll end up taking the airplanes somewhere around, the first airplane about 26 months after the order. So, and then you end up taking about a dozen the year, something like that. So I hope that helps give you some timeline.","Richard Anderson","Okay. One more final question, Cindy.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our last question from Linda Loyd with Philadelphia Inquirer.","Linda Loyd \u2013 Philadelphia Inquirer","Hi. Thank you very much. I have a question about the Trainer refinery. The refinery before it was reconfigured was 185,000 barrels a day. With the reconfiguration, is it still that much oil? And how many barrels of jet fuel will you be producing when you\u2019re at full run rate?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Linda. This is Paul. Thanks for your question. None of our modifications are intended to expand production at the plant, so we remain at 185,000 barrels a day. We said that we intend to get about 50,000 barrels a day of jet fuel when we complete the modification sometime during 2013, but we will be producing significantly more jet fuel then ConocoPhillips produced when they ran the plant beginning in the first quarter.","Linda Loyd \u2013 Philadelphia Inquirer","Thank you very much.","Ed Bastian","Okay. Hey. Thank you, Richard and Paul, and that does conclude our September quarter call. Well, see many of you at Investor Day in New York City on December 12 and get back on the telephone with everyone here for the January quarter results. Thanks again, everyone.","Richard Anderson","Thank you, all.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s conference again.

My name is Alan. I will be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","Now I would like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Jill Greer","Thanks Alan. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for our June quarter earnings call. Joining us today from Atlanta are CEO, Ed Bastian, our President, Glen Hauenstein and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is also here in the room for the Q&A session.","Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta's financial performance. Glen will then address the revenue environment and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings.","We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted and you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.","With that, here's Ed.","Ed Bastian","Thanks Jill. Good morning everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. Earlier, Delta reported a $1.6 billion June quarter pretax profit and earnings per share of $1.77, beating consensus of $1.72. Our EPS was up 11% over last year driven by tax reform benefits and the lower share count. Our revenues grew 10% to $11.8 billion, a record level for the June quarter. We have seen early success in addressing the fuel cost increase and we did offset two-thirds of the $600 million impact from higher fuel in the June quarter. While this is good progress, there is still more to be done.","Strong demand, a recovering fare environment and momentum across our business will all be critical as we work to fully recapture higher fuel costs. I would like to thank the Delta people for all their doing, especially during our busiest time of the year. With a record 50 million passengers this quarter, more customers than ever are choosing Delta because of the great service our people provide and the reliabilities of the product that we deliver. We are running the world's best operation and our people continue to raise the bar.","For the first half of the year, we have had 58 days without a single cancellation across the entire Delta system, an improvement of 23 days versus the same period last year. This is continuing in July. I would like to congratulate our Delta connection team as they are currently on a 12-day streak this month without a single cancellation. Our customer satisfaction scores demonstrate that we are increasingly a carrier of choice.","Year-to-date, we are seeing a domestic net promoter score of 44%, up three points versus the prior year. This is all a testament to our employees and it's an honor to recognize them with $400 million accrued in profit sharing this quarter and $23 million in shared rewards. Our people are the best in the business and it's our employees and our culture that are Delta's strongest competitive advantage.","Since our last call, we have seen a significant increase in fuel prices and now expect our fuel expense to increase by about $2 billion for the year. Our new EPS guide of $5.35 to $5.70 per share reflects both higher fuel and a stronger revenue outlook. While the rapid increase in fuel prices puts downward pressure on our earnings in the near-term, we have the right plan in place to address the challenge that we expect to return to margin expansion by year-end. We have solid revenue momentum and improving cost trajectory and we will take 50 to 100 basis points of underperforming capacity out of our full schedules.","We are continuing to look for opportunities to reduce marginal flying in a higher fuel environment. With a strong financial foundation in place, we expect to deliver a fourth consecutive year of pretax earnings above $5 billion, a result largely in line with last year despite the significant fuel headwind. This shows that the plan we laid out at Investor Day is working and positions us well to succeed in today's fuel and revenue environment.","First, we are seeing outstanding results in growing our topline. Our record June quarter shows solid revenue performance across the business. We also have the most diverse revenue stream in the industry with contributions from our MRO, cargo, loyalty program and our joint ventures. During the June quarter, we saw four new top 10 revenue days and that momentum is continuing in the September quarter with a new top five day last Sunday. We are raising our full year revenue guide to 7% to 8%, reflecting strong demand, pricing momentum and record unit revenue premiums.","Next, we are changing our cost trajectory. For the June quarter, unit cost growth rates are down sequentially for the third consecutive quarter. This trend is expected to continue in the second half of the year getting us back into our target range of less than 2% annual growth for 2018 and beyond. Since the merger, we have grown non-fuel unit cost at a rate below inflation while investing significantly in our people, customer experience, operation, fleet and products.","And finally, we are continuing to invest in our international franchise. Through our growth and joint ventures, we are building a best-in-class global network for our customers. In 2018, we expect to drive $100 million in incremental value from all these relationships with even greater upside to come.","Delta has the right combination of strategic advantages to be successful in any environment. Our culture, leading operational reliability and unrivaled network, loyalty programs, including our relationship with American Express and an investment grade balance sheet, this powerful combination sets the stage for continued success and consistent earnings growth.","Our strong foundation underpins the Board's decision to increase our dividend for the fifth year in a row. Beginning in the September quarter, our dividend will increase by 15% to $0.35 per share. This increase demonstrates our conviction in the durability and sustainability of the Delta business model. At yesterday's closing price, this represents a nearly 3% yield.","In closing, while higher fuel prices are pressuring near-term results, we remain on track to deliver a solid year. Offsetting the $2 billion cost increase to deliver a pretax results this year that's largely in line with 2015. And as we look forward to 2019, we are confident in our ability to drive long-term value for our owners through topline growth, margin expansion and prudent deployment of capital.","Before turning the call over to Glen, I would like to take a minute to congratulate Gary Chase on his new role as Chief Strategy Officer. Gary has been a key part of our team since joining Delta in 2012, including leading our One Delta initiative. We are excited that he will now shift his focus to the formation and execution of our strategy, helping position Delta to keep climbing.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Glen and Paul to go through the details of the quarter.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. First I would like to thank the entire Delta team for the great service they provide customers each and every day, enable us to generate record revenues of $11.6 billion in the June quarter. These results were driven by a continuation of strong demand coupled with yield momentum that built throughout the quarter. We also experienced significant gains in cargo, loyalty and branded fares all contributing to nearly $1 billion of topline revenue growth. This produced a 4.6% improvement in total unit revenues year-over-year at the high-end of our initial guidance for the quarter.","Corporate revenues grew 10% and were our highest quarterly corporate revenues ever. There were increases across all entities and across all industry sectors. Our corporate demand outlook remains strong. In our most recent survey, 84% of corporate travel managers expected to maintain or increase their travel spend in the third quarter. Improving corporate yields remains a significant opportunity and focus.","While we are pleased with the June second quarter revenue results, as of June we have only recovered 20% of the decline in domestic corporate fares since our peak in 2014. While we saw sequential improvement in corporate yields within each of the three months in the second quarter, we still see great opportunity and momentum as we continue to work every day to recapture the cost of higher fuel through further yield improvements.","In the June quarter, cargo and loyalty revenues both grew by double digits. Our close relationship with American Express is a true source of competitive advantage. In the quarter, we drove an incremental $120 million in value and we are on pace to deliver $3.4 billion in total for 2018, up from our initial prediction of $3.3 billion.","Direct digital channels experienced their best quarter on record with direct sales up 13% year-on-year. We recently launched the newest version of delta.com and the Delta mobile app. These new products are producing record revenues as well as record satisfaction numbers as we continue to bring industry-leading products and services to market through our digital applications.","Focusing on fuel, there has been a substantial run-up in market prices since this time last year. There have been two sharp legs-up, one in late last year and one more recent in late spring. Given the industry's historical fuel recapture lag, we have fully recaptured the first leg in fuel run-up and are working hard to realize the second leg as quickly as possible.","Strong core demand, recent industry momentum as well as programmatic international industry fuel surcharges, which kick in over the next quarter give us confidence that we will successfully recapture the most recent leg of the fuel run-up during the second half of 2018. While we have reduced our fall capacity plans by 50 to 100 basis points, work is ongoing and we will continue to adjust capacity in markets which we are not able to pass along higher fuel costs. We expect to see new unit revenue premium records in the June quarter. This is again a testament to the strength of the Delta brand as both our increases in stage length and gauge significantly outpaced the industry in the quarter.","Turning to our entity performance. Domestic revenues grew 8% on a 2.5% increase in yield and a load factor of 87%. Delta's top position give us a unique opportunity to continue to benefit from upgauging while maintaining the best revenue premium in the industry. 70% of our domestic growth this year is from higher gauge as we continue to retire our MD-88 and replace them with larger, more efficient 737-900s and A321. Over the next several years, our domestic fleet will receive further step function improvement as we delivered the new A220 aircraft and A320neo, which both replace older less efficient aircraft and provide best-in-class economics.","Internationally, we experienced improving trends with unit revenues up 9% versus last year. This was led by strong demand in both leisure and business segments, coupled with growing revenues from the suite of products and services we have begun to sell internationally. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that international unit revenue growth has outpaced domestic. Transatlantic unit revenues increased 11% driven by very strong business cabin performance and robust leisure demand combined with a three point currency tailwind.","We now offer a complete set of branded fares across the Atlantic and are working with our partners to provide a more seamless experience when flying Delta and our partners by aligning those products and services as closely as possible. Our Alliance team is building the largest and most profitable joint venture with our European partners Air France-KLM, Virgin Atlantic and Alitalia. We continue to rely more heavily on our partner's EU hubs and now deployed 60% of our transatlantic capacity into their hubs. We have successfully added routes like Los Angeles to Paris, Indianapolis to Paris, Orlando to Amsterdam, Los Angeles to Amsterdam into our portfolio of successful transatlantic markets.","Unit revenues increased by 1% in Latin as this region faced the most headwinds during the quarter. Weak demand to Mexican beaches and currency devaluations were offset by strength in Central America and the Caribbean. We are reducing capacity to match demand in the impacted markets. Forward bookings into the Caribbean remain a bright spot as demand has rebounded more quickly than expected from last year's hurricanes. And with the most recent election now over and stabilizing of the peso, Mexico business markets are showing improvements in the back half of 2018. Our JV partnership with Aeromexico, which just celebrated a one-year anniversary, gives us a great platform for providing the best product for business and leisure travelers to and from Mexico.","In the Pacific, our multiyear restructuring is delivering solid improvements in margins and we now provide the most efficient and comprehensive route network in the Pacific. An 8% increase in year-over-year stage length makes our 10% unit revenue growth even more impressive. We officially launched our joint venture with Korean Air in May marking a very significant milestone for us in the Pacific. In the June quarter, we experienced double-digit unit revenue growth in Korea on a 24% increase in year-over-year capacity. We are very pleased with a strong start to our joint venture and would like to thank our Pacific team and our partners at Korea for delivering such terrific results. We are committed to continuing to improve our products as well as our network footprint as we add A350s and reconfigure 777s with our four class products, including Delta One Suites, Premium Select and the industry's largest seats and coach our 777 fleet.","Across all regions, segmentation initiatives are one of our largest commercial opportunities. During the quarter, domestic first-class and Comfort+ revenues grew almost 20% on an 8% increase in available premium seats. Looking forward, we will continue to grow our ability to offer customers upgraded experience as we add premium seats domestically with our fleet renewal program. We know these products are not yet mature and we are increasing the ways our customers will be able to purchase them. For example, since launching last May, post purchase upsells have generated over $200 million of revenues and now account for over 10% of all premium products.","We continue to roll out more options that our customers are asking for, including the ability to paying with miles by the end of 2018. Delta Premium Select expanded into the transatlantic during the quarter and by 2021, all of our international widebodies will be equipped with this cabin, which is generating an average bare premium of over 100% to a standard coach seat. Our success in selling branded products, growth in our premium seats and enhanced future functionality give us confidence that we will deliver the $350 million of incremental revenues in our 2018 plan. And looking forward, we believe there will be significant continued growth and expect an additional $500 million in 2019.","With momentum from fuel price recapture and our commercial initiatives, we expect top line growth of 8% for the September quarter with total unit revenue growth of 3.5% to 5.5% on 3% to 4% higher capacity. Importantly, baseline unit passenger revenue trends are showing improvements despite tougher comps and headwinds due to holiday timing. The trends we are seeing combined with the level of service that only Delta people can provide drive us to raise our full year revenue growth to 7% to 8% from our previous guide of about 4% to 6%. This will be Delta's highest topline revenue growth since 2011, a year in which we successfully recaptured a $3 billion increase in fuel.","With that, I would like to turn it over to Paul.","Paul Jacobson","Thank you Glen and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. For the June quarter, total operating expenses increased 13%, or $1.1 billion with over half of the increase driven by higher fuel prices. With market fuel prices up 10% over the March quarter and 50% versus prior year, our fuel expense increased nearly $600 million for the quarter. For the September quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to increase approximately 40% over last year to $2.32 to $2.37. At the current forward curve, year-over-year increases in fuel should moderate to about 20% in the December quarter.","In the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.85 per share which equates to a pretax margin of 12% to 14%, about two to three points behind last year's 15.6% results. With a strong revenue environment and a back drop of moderating fuel increases, improving our non-fuel unit cost trajectory will play a key role as we drive toward a return to margin expansion by the end of the year and in 2019.","Non-fuel unit costs were up 2.9% for the June quarter, a one point step down from the March quarter. In the September quarter, we take a bigger step down and expect our non-fuel CASM to be flat year-over-year with the fourth quarter slightly better than that. As we have discussed since Investor Day, the second half of 2018 is an inflection point on CASM as overhead pressures moderate from categories like depreciation from our fleet retirements, investments made in the back half of 2017 related to our products and security enhancements and one-time benefits last year from the Republic bankruptcy emergence and other settlements which occurred in the first half.","Unit cost in the back half of the year should be three to four points better than our first half performance. One to two points of that relief is driven by lapping these overhead pressures just mentioned, with the remainder of the improvement driven by a ramp in One Delta productivity and refleeting benefits. This puts us on a trajectory for 1% to 2% non-fuel unit cost growth for 2018. This is a solid result, albeit at the upper end of our original range due to a half point of pressure from weather and currency.","Our One Delta project is progressing well and as we roll into the second half of the year, we will begin to see more benefits throughout the P&L, including in fuel. As an example, we recently launched a fuel initiative that focuses on auxiliary power unit usage to optimize how we power aircraft on the ground while also working on improving our load planning. The One Delta team has made good progress and remains focused on process improvements that create a short-term benefit, but more importantly build a foundation for Delta's long-term success.","This fall, our network optimization efforts kick into high gear. This is one of our more substantial long-term opportunities where we are designing a new process to create and implement schedules, driving expected annual run rate savings of more than $300 million. Recently, we also identified opportunities in our supply chain in categories like maintenance components and IT hardware. Looking forward, One Delta initiatives combined with our fleet renewal and simplification should drive substantial efficiency gains over a multiyear period.","With 30 aircrafts still to be delivered this year, refleeting will also drive significant seat cost improvements in our domestic hubs, which are the most profitable in the industry. Internationally, our new A350s and A330s will improve our Pacific profitability through increased fuel efficiency and better revenue performance from an industry-leading product.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $2.8 billion of operating cash flow for the quarter which allowed for reinvestment in the business through $1.4 billion in CapEx, with 1.2 billion of that related to aircraft and aircraft modifications. In the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow and returned $813 million to shareholders through $600 million in share repurchases and $213 million in dividends. Since announcing our strategy to consistently return cash to shareholders five years ago, we have reduced our fully diluted share count by 19% and have returned more than $11 billion through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining low debt levels and improving the funded status of our pension plans. We continue to buy back shares every day and are on pace to complete our current authorization in 2020. Our repurchase activity and dividend increase demonstrates our conviction on the durability and the sustainability of our business model.","Harnessing our investment grade balance sheet, we completed $1.6 billion unsecured debt offering at a blended rate of 3.85% that was used to refinance secured debt and freed $8 billion in previously encumbered assets while lowering our annual interest expense by about $20 million. As part of these transactions, we also increased our undrawn revolver capacity by about $600 million to a total of $3.1 billion. We also, during the quarter, launched and closed a $1.4 billion tax-exempt bond offering to finance our LaGuardia project. By self financing this project we can maintain control of the construction and drive more certainty in our long-term cost structure and product. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and our combined adjusted net debt and pension liability declined $600 million since the end of last quarter.","In closing, we delivered solid earnings for the June quarter despite higher fuel costs. I want to add my thanks to the entire Delta team for their hard work and dedication in helping to produce these results. As we look forward, we are excited about our continued revenue momentum and improving cost trajectory. Irrespective of fuel, returning to margin expansion is a critical focus for this team.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A.","Jill Greer","Alan, we are ready for the analyst Q&A section, if you could give the instructions for how to get into the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Good morning everybody. Paul, the $3 billion in AmEx contribution last year, can you tell us how you are tracking in 2018, but also how we should reconcile that on the income statement? How much is accounted for in revenue? How much is accounted for in reduced expenses? Just trying to understand how you define the term contribution?","Paul Jacobson","Sure. As Glen mentioned in his comments, we are expecting $3.4 billion from our AmEx relationship this year, which is higher than our original expectation going into the year. The overwhelming majority of that appears in the other revenue line through both other revenue and then once the miles are redeemed for flying. There is some element of cost and we can walk you through separately on the detailed modeling exercise of that.","Jamie Baker","That helps. Second question for Ed. This whole leap of faith and I know that's not your term, but you know we have said it different this time. It's not your grandfather's airline industry. You have spoken to the industry's structural changes. I think you and I are in agreement on this topic, but the economy is roaring, your stock's down 10% year-to-date, you are trading at a multiple that's no better than when the industry was basically a joke, you are essentially getting zero credit for what you have accomplished. I mean I think the sell side has done a pretty good job at pointing out what's better, the rating agencies get it, marks investors, the credit market gets it, look at your debt costs. So my question is, what is still broken here? And please don't tell me that we have to pass the recessionary test in order for multiples to rise because that just means there is no reason to own the stock today. So I promise there is a question here. What is still broken? What does Delta or the industry in general still need to tackle in order to get its message through to the equity market?","Ed Bastian","Well, Jamie, you expressed a frustration I think many of us in this room and throughout the industry feel. Fundamentally, we believe in the thesis we need to continue to perform. I agree that I don't think we need to go through hard times to demonstrate that this model works. All you have to go back is through the hard times in 2009 at the bottom of the recession, ex a bad fuel hedge decision, Delta would have been profitable in 2009. And if you model us today, in any reasonable economic downturn, we are, I think, talking significantly profitable going forward. So we are going to continue to produce. We are going to continue to point investors to where the opportunities are. Certainly fuel prices have been weighing on the stock. One of the things, I think, is most important that we get back to margin expansion. When you think about the margins in this industry, they have declined now three years in a row. We need to stop that. We need to grow the margin and I am hoping, certainly by year-end, that we are starting to grow margins again and hopefully, with a little luck, maybe even in Q4.","Jamie Baker","All right. I appreciate the comments. I will turn the microphone back to others for all the RASM and CASM questions. Thanks guys.","Operator","All right. Next, we go to Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Hi. Good morning. I guess I will ask the RASM question. Just on the international side, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on what you think the transatlantic, especially dies FX start to be less of a tailwind? And also, does Air France-KLM strikes have any kind of beneficial impact there in the first half and maybe not as much in the second half?","Ed Bastian","We see very robust demand and continued strength into the third quarter and the early results for fall, as you know, transatlantic tends to book sooner than domestic. So we have a little bit more visibility into what we are seeing in the third quarter and beyond. And we feel really comfortable and this is a very, very strong environment for the transatlantic.","Savi Syth","So then what's driving that? Is it strong economy? Or any kind of thoughts on that?","Ed Bastian","Business traffic, some things that are a little less obviously, I think, is we hear a lot about Brexit and we see all the rhetoric about Brexit, but business traffic to and from the U.K. on Delta and our partners is at record levels. Similarly in Continental Europe, we are seeing record revenues in terms of yields and in terms of traffic into Continental Europe. So it is a relatively robust business environment and very, very strong leisure demand. And I think when you think of how fuel weighs on the ultra low cost carriers in that marketplace, it tends to have more of an impact on them and their raising fares has translated into our ability to get higher fares for not only business but for leisure as well.","Savi Syth","Thanks. And if I might ask just a follow-up on the capacity comment? I know you have talked about adjusting capacity in the markets where you can pass through the higher fuel costs. But as you look at your position in the second half and beyond, are there markets where you are actually seeing stronger than expected results and maybe an opportunity to increase capacity in some of the entities?","Ed Bastian","I think that's what we do every day here is, try and figure out where we want to position the airline's capacity and try and continue to optimize it. And we are working very hard. And I think the result in the second quarter saw again a step function improvement versus the general industry and our ability to go ahead and do that and that's a testament to the entire commercial team here at Delta who takes the great product that our people produce every day and takes the demand set for that and then tries continuingly to reoptimize it. And I think if you look at long-term trends, this will be yet another record for our system unit revenues versus the industry.","Savi Syth","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. How do you calculate that two-thirds of fuel being passed through? I am curious because you mentioned in the context of how you think about capacity planning and I would love to be able to replicate that in my model simplistically if I am able to do it.","Paul Jacobson","Sure. Good morning Hunter, it's Paul. What we do is, we basically take all the revenue growth, subtract out the cost and then cover the difference in pretax margin as a function of what the fuel price is. So if you look at that, our pretax was down slightly under $200 million for the quarter on $600 million of fuel pressure.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then with the caveat that this is not necessarily a comment on capacity guidance for next year, how are you thinking about net changes to the fleet count or even better on a seat count basis in 2019?","Ed Bastian","Hunter, we haven't given the 2019 guidance. We are not going to give it on this call, as you can appreciate. I think our fleet is expected to grow by about 80 aircraft next year. In total the gross new aircraft we are taking, most of those will be replacement aircraft. But we haven't decided what the net growth position of the airline will be.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will go now to Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew Didora","Hi. Good morning everyone. I guess Glen, just wanted to touch upon your total revenue growth number share. Coming to the years, you said that you didn't really expect much deviation in quarterly RASM. Now with your 3Q guide, first half results, this has really been true. I think total revenue growth has been around 9.5%, but fuel has obviously moved here. So I would have thought things should be getting better but that's not really what your 4Q revenue guide would imply. Given your total revenue growth number for the year, it now goes down to 7% to 8%. And I know there are tough comps out there, but can you maybe walk us through any headwinds that you see as we get later into the year? Or is your total revenue growth outlook really more a function of having shut down the refinery for most of 4Q? Thanks.","Glen Hauenstein","I will turn that over to Paul here.","Paul Jacobson","Yes. So Andrew, thanks for that. As we have talked about going back through Investor Day, we do expect that the refinery will be shut down in 4Q for its systematic turnaround effort. So that's a bigger drain on 4Q that is a disproportionate step down from what we have seen for the rest of the year.","Andrew Didora","Got it. Okay. So just in terms of everything else in the business, it seems like pretty, when I back that out, it seems like pretty steady growth is still anticipated?","Glen Hauenstein","Yes. We are seeing very good momentum on the passenger revenue line item. And I think we are anticipating that to continue in the third and fourth quarters.","Andrew Didora","Okay. That clarity is helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Yes. Two quick ones here. Just on the refinery in the quarter, Paul. I don't know if it was in the press release. Do you have what the P&L was on that?","Paul Jacobson","Yes. It was about a $40 million benefit for the quarter.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Great. And then just to Glen. Glen, you talked about third quarter RASM outlook. I mean it sequentially looks better than June. And then you talked about the fact that there are some headwinds. I think you said holiday shift, maybe difficult comps. Is the holiday shift, is that Labor Day or July 4? And what about the storm impact? Was that a benefit? Or how do we think about those?","Glen Hauenstein","So there are a of ins and outs in the quarter as they are always are. The holiday we are referring to is the shift of the Jewish holidays from a weekend day in October timeframe to a weekday in September.","Michael Linenberg","Okay.","Glen Hauenstein","And that's actually a pretty big number, when you think about the quarter shifting and actually going from a weekend to a weekday ruins a whole week of business travel for a sector of our business travelers. So that is impacted, also the storms as we said last year, were one point favorable impact and then we have a difference in the PRASM to TRASM which has been negative in the third quarter, which was a positive in the second quarter.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Great. All right. Thank you.","Glen Hauenstein","I want to just reiterate that the passenger revenue momentum that we saw accelerating into the second quarter is continuing into the third quarter.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Great. Thanks Glen.","Operator","Next, we go to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess Ed or Glen, I mean, back to Jamie's first question here, should investors just expect that we are going to have a lot of earnings volatility in any up economy, because when we go back historically, usually oil prices move with economy. So how do you think about is going forward? What are some proactive measures you can make to maybe temper out some of that fuel driven earnings volatility?","Ed Bastian","Well, Brandon, I can't speak to the industry at large. I can only speak to Delta. What we are trying to do is deliver a premium product that customers prefer. It's driving our net promoter scores. It's driving an outperformance within the industry. It's top line, not just growth for growth sake, but growth for premium sake as well. And get back to margin stabilization and expansion. The fuel price volatility has certainly been somewhat dysfunctional within the industry over the last several years. We have all talked about that and fuel prices where they are today at roughly $75 brent does not scare. I think that's actually a good stable place that we can platform from to continue the growth to get back to growing more margins. So I think that's what the industry needs to do.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. I appreciate that. And Paul, can you remind us on the One Delta initiatives what your long-term CASM guidance is? I think you did provide that through 2020? And I think you said $1 billion of non-fuel costs that you are looking to save by that time period. Does that also include the fleet renewals that we are looking at?","Paul Jacobson","No. So Brandon, thanks for that question. The One Delta initiative stand on its own and it's all about improving processes and really an enterprisewide project for just performing better and more efficiently. That is over and above the fleet efficiency. So what we have said is, $1 billion from that program building over the next few years will keep us below 2% unit cost inflation and help us to drive towards the continued goals for the long-term.","Brandon Oglenski","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we will go to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hi. Thanks. As you watch how the rest of the industry has implemented basic economy so far, have you detected any positive share gain versus some of the more punitive implementations of it, no carry-on, et cetera? Any sense the customers really don't like it?","Glen Hauenstein","Those are not a very, very difficult things to isolate and I think you know what we look at is our relative revenue performance in aggregate and are we supplying the right products and services that people want to buy from us and I think as the quarter unfolds over the next couple weeks here, as everybody announces the details of their earnings, you will see that we, I think, took another step function improvement in aggregate and produced the highest level of revenue premiums we have in our history. So it's very hard to isolate which individual piece contributed to the whole brand impact, but I think that's certainly a contributing factor.","Ed Bastian","Part of that, Duane, also is the net promoter scores that we see and mentioned our domestic net promoter scores were up three points year-over-year, which is huge when you measure net promoter scores to drive an improvement at an already good base of further improvement. So clearly, customers of all classes are preferring Delta in increasing numbers.","Duane Pfennigwerth","That's helpful. And then Glen, I always appreciate the reminder on how much you recovered in corporate fares and how much potential is out there. I wonder if you could offer a view on short headroom by geographic region, which geographic entity do you think has the most upside potential? Thanks for taking the questions.","Glen Hauenstein","Well, I think we are most focused on domestic, right. The domestic is where we really need to get those fares moving. They have moved internationally. And we are continuing to focus on that everyday. We see great opportunity and that's what gives us really good confidence as we move through the rest of the year that we will be able to hit the margin expansion by year-end.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we will go to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi. Good morning gentlemen.","Ed Bastian","Good morning.","Rajeev Lalwani","Ed, in terms of the capacity outlook, can you just reconcile the full year guide going to the to the top end of the range, but then also highlighting 50 to 100 bips or so of trimming in the fall schedule?","Ed Bastian","Well, I will let the Paul and Jill provide some of the details, reconciliation of the numbers. Part of the increase is the higher completion factor that we are running above plan. That's a meaningful part of it. But the other thing to think about when you are looking at our overall 3% capacity, that's entirely gauge and stage related. Departures actually are down for the full year. Our expectations are departures count will be down and when you are thinking within the industry, I think we are the only major, maybe the only airline out there that's got departures down. But I think we are being very prudent as to how we are thinking about capacity. We are certainly outperforming the industry on revenue production and revenue productivity and we also know that we have got big non-fuel CASM reduction plan that we are working heavily on and fleet is a big part of that too.","Rajeev Lalwani","Got it. Thanks. And Glen, a network question for you. Can just talk about how you go about evaluating whether or not to take away a flight or even add a flight? Is it looking at margins? Or is it just simply, hey, if a route is profitable, there is no reason to cut it?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, I have a dart board in my office. We have teams that comb through the day-in and day-out and we have really the best teams in the industry. I am really so proud of them and they are every day working to optimize our capacity and press the envelope in terms of trying to raise the yield. So this is a great process that we have in place and one, I think, that's proven Delta as at the top of the industry, year after year in producing these returns. And I would love to say it's me, but it's not. It's a team of hundreds of professionals every day that are working to make this happen for us and they do a great job at it.","Rajeev Lalwani","Right. So maybe the other way to ask the question is, if you have got, say, a flight out there and it's barely profitable, do you say, hey look, that's additive to EPS. We should keep it there? Or is it sort of, hey it's not really reaching a return threshold, it's time to go kind of a thing?","Glen Hauenstein","I think that highly oversimplifies the process that you look at a flight plate. It's clearly in terms of the competitive dynamics of that and what your expectations are for that individual flight. And of course, when you look at the flight level details, what time of day is it, what's the opportunity cost for that flight. So it's a very complicated transaction. I think we are oversimplifying it by trying to put it in boxes like that. It's a much more complicated and rigorous and happy to spend a day down here sometime, if you want to come down and look how we do it, because I think it's a really interesting feature.","Rajeev Lalwani","Very helpful, as always, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we will go to Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much operator. Hi guys. Thank you very much for taking the question. So I think you mentioned that, for an example, you were adding Indianapolis to Europe service. Is that a connection? Is it really about connecting Indianapolis traffic with other points in Europe as opposed to point-to-point and instead of over hubs in New York and Detroit? And B, should we think about opportunity for you in that small or medium size city to Amsterdam and Paris and to some extent London going forward?","Glen Hauenstein","Helane, a great question and I think that really is the point is that when we fly from Indianapolis to Paris, we are not just flying from Indy to Paris, we are flying from Indianapolis to Paris connecting to all of Europe and then really connecting Asia and Africa through Paris. So we would never contemplate flying from Indianapolis to Paris if it were two endpoints on our network, but really given the strength of the frequent flyer base and the loyalty we have in Indianapolis and the amount of traffic that's continuing on to those destinations beyond Paris, that's where we have really added over the past years, using our partner hubs. Really exciting for the results too. Indianapolis to Paris is doing quite well in its first year of operation. We also added Orlando to Amsterdam. That's also doing quite well. And Los Angeles to both Paris and Amsterdam. Interesting factoid is, of the three major U.S. carriers in Los Angeles, we were the only one that did not have nonstop European service on our own metal. So we added that this year and that's doing really well as well.","Helane Becker","Is that designed to prepare the airline and your partners in case there is no EU-U.K. or U.K.-U.S. agreement after March 29?","Glen Hauenstein","We haven't really done that with that in mind, but I think we don't connect a lot of traffic in Heathrow, because we have a great partner that has the number two position in the U.K. But it's really not a hub connecting complex. They have a few connections, but it's not the size and scale and scope of Paris or Amsterdam, which are two of the largest connecting complex is in all of Europe.","Helane Becker","Got you. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the answers.","Operator","Next, we will go to Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan McKenzie","Hi. Good morning. Thanks guys. Glen, the stat in the script that stood out to me is an 8% increase in premium seats that drove a 20% increase in upsell revenue. Please correct my math here, but it sounds like premium products in total are driving roughly $2 billion annually. And I am just wondering if we should interpret this segment of the business as growing double digits? Or maybe if you could just clarify and help us understand how to think about the sustainability of the premium suite of products that you are selling today?","Glen Hauenstein","Dan, this is really something we continue to remain excited about and excited about our future. As we continue to drive brand loyalty and to drive better customer segmentation, we have seen continued strength here. And when you add 8% in capacity and you far outpace that in terms of revenue growth, we think that's just another factoid in, hey people really want to buy that from us. So our fleet sets up nicely in the next few years to continue to expand those number of seats and then we are taking some changes to the fleet. For example, adding the Premium Select into all of our international widebody fleet, which is a really a new announcement that we made in this call that will all be complete by 2021 because people want to buy these products and services from us. And quite honestly, we haven't made it that easy for them. And over the next months and years, we are going to make it easier and easier with more and more ways to buy these products and services and we see that as a real growth opportunity.","Dan McKenzie","Very good. And then just a second question here. We got a better revenue outlook this morning, despite greater macro volatility and so the revenue outlook is a little better than I would have anticipated. And the industry has cited, escalating trade war as a risk to revenue. And I am just wondering how you guys are thinking about it? What you are seeing today? How that's factored into your revenue outlook, if at all, as we look out through the end of the year here?","Ed Bastian","Dan, this is Ed. We are not seeing any signs that the rumors escalating trade wars are impacting business travel or travel in general. We just posted our highest quarter in history. Our total topline is up 10%. I think the increased outlook, as you say, we gave for revenue is through the help of the international as well as the domestic economies and also the fact that we need to cover the higher price of fuel in our ticket price. So who knows where the saying goes, but we are not seeing any negative impacts from it.","Dan McKenzie","Perfect. Thanks Ed.","Operator","Next, we will go to Kevin Crissey with Citi.","Kevin Crissey","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Maybe a question for Glen. Your Q2 domestic yield is up 2.5%. That's inclusive of your domestic portion of international itineraries, I assume. Can you talk about what that might look like if we just looked at a domestic origin to a domestic destination? And if you don't have that handy, maybe you could just talk about maybe the situation in ULCC competitive markets? That's what I am getting at there. Thanks.","Glen Hauenstein","Well, domestic portion of international journey is not going to have a significant impact on that number. And ULCC traction has been very strong. We have seen a lot of strength in leisure in ULCC competitive markets. When you think about the business model at a more macro level, clearly higher fuel has much more impacted them in terms of trying to drive leisure traffic that might not otherwise fly. So I think we have seen some very good traction in those markets.","Kevin Crissey","If I could just follow-up on that. Given the strength of the international franchise and the yields are putting up there and the overall average fares, why wouldn't the allocation of that to the domestic market be impactful? I am not sure I understand that.","Glen Hauenstein","Because the number of passengers, while the revenues are 40%, the number of passengers because of the higher ticket volumes, it doesn't drive a whole lot of travel on the domestic portion and the pro rata relatively low to begin with. So that's not going to drive a whole lot. And we can happily walk you through that math. I mean, it could be a few tenths of a point, but it's not going to be significant.","Kevin Crissey","Terrific. Thank you.","Jill Greer","And Alan, we are going to have time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","Okay. We will take that last question from Susan Donofrio with Macquarie.","Susan Donofrio","Yes. Good morning everybody. Just a quick question. So is there, I think following up with Jamie and Brandon's question and trying to think through how to perhaps help mitigate earnings volatility, you guys own your own refinery, as you know and certainly domestically that helps, would you consider, I guess, hedging more internationally? Or is there anything else you could do when you look at some of the drivers that perhaps could help placate investors a little more?","Ed Bastian","Susan, what do you mean by hedging internationally?","Susan Donofrio","Well, I was thinking more just on the fuel side, if there is more FX currency or just anything you could perhaps put a little more in your numbers?","Ed Bastian","We are not thinking of doing anything like that, Susan, no.","Susan Donofrio","You are not. Okay. And then just a follow-up domestically. Can you broadly give us maybe more of a sense of pockets of strength and weaknesses? Is it more in the low-fare airline overlap? Just a little more color, I think would be helpful.","Ed Bastian","I think what we have seen as we seen really robust business travel in terms of volumes. The yields have been weaker than we would have liked or anticipated given the robust levels of demand.","And so that's the piece that we are working on every day to try and improve. And leisure travel, so all of the events, as when you look out are very strong in terms of both yield and traffic. So we have the flush of consumer continues and that consumers want experiences and travel fits well into that experiential model. So we see robust demand there and we see really, really strong demand for business in terms of volumes and now we continue to need to work on improving the yields.","Susan Donofrio","Great. I will end with that. Thank you very much.","Jill Greer","That's going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I will hand it over to our Chief Communications Officer, Ned Walker.","Ned Walker.","Hi. Thanks Jill. We will go ahead and begin the media Q&A now. First I would like to ask the media to limit themselves to one question with a quick follow-up. That should allow us to accommodate almost everyone. And Alan, if you could please review the process to queue up to ask a question, that would be helpful. Please go ahead.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We take our first question from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal.","Alison Sider","Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just sort of curios, looking out, at what point do you start to see higher fares starting to discourage passengers and dampen demand?","Ed Bastian","Hi. this is Ed. We are not seeing anything other than strong demand for our products. Pricing is certainly a function of cost and with higher fuel prices, you are going to expect to see ticket prices go up as well our pricing currently is up about 4% on a year-over-year basis. So I think it's at a good level, but best revenue performance in our history this quarter and our outlook is strong.","Alison Sider","Thanks.","Ned Walker.","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Next, we will go to Leslie Josephs with CNBC.","Leslie Josephs","Hi. Good morning guys. On the premium economy, are you seeing a lot of corporate travelers take those fares and is that cannibalizing from the more expensive business fares? And then also on the international growth, how much of that is on your own metal? And does that help you or hurt you, how it's broken up with your JVs? Thanks.","Ed Bastian","So we have seen robust demand for our Delta One product, especially in the Pacific as we have introduced Premium Select into over 50% of the market now, we have seen no real degradation in terms of the demand for the premium products and services, the most premium. And what we have seen is really consumer discretionary and corporations that have travel policy that only allow for coach really using that extensible. And as we continue to roll out different ways to buy those products, we will see I think another explosion in demand as other customers will use their miles to sit in the cabins they want. And I think bringing that ability of our frequent flyers to choose where they want to sit after they buy the ticket is really going to be something that's going to generate a lot of great products and services for customers as well as revenue for the airline.","Leslie Josephs","And on the international growth, how much of that is your own flying versus your JVs or cochairs or another partnerships?","Ed Bastian","So generally, we stay balanced with our partner so that all of our joint ventures are based on a 50-50 growth pattern. And so over the long-term on any individual season or month, it might be a little bit weighed to one or the other, but over the long term, it's based on growing at the same rates. So a lot of that's our own metal and a lot of it's partner related.","Leslie Josephs","Okay. And is there any number on the upsell between economy and premium economy or economy and Comfort Plus? I think you guys were like 50% last year upsell?","Ed Bastian","Sorry. Could you repeat that question?","Leslie Josephs","What's the upsell from economy to Comfort Plus domestically or economy to Premium Select? I think it was like 50% or 60% last year.. Has that grown?","Ed Bastian","So the average fare differential from main cabin to Comfort Plus is between $25 and $35 domestically on average. So very nominal fees to get a really, I think, a great product value. And then internationally, which is the only place we have Premium Select, it's about 100% fare premium differential in the markets. Right now, it's mostly in the Pacific. So that's several hundred dollars more but we will be rolling it out to the transatlantic where we actually started but it's really only on one flight right now. But it will be ubiquitous in our long-haul network over the next several years.","Leslie Josephs","And the upsell from the customers that are looking at regular economy versus buying up to something more expensive?","Ed Bastian","Regular economy. Internationally?","Leslie Josephs","That or both?","Ed Bastian","Well, domestically it's about $35 for Comfort Plus. We won't have Premium Select in domestic. And then internationally, it's about $50 to $100 depending on the market to go from main cabin to Comfort Plus on the long-haul. And it's about several hundred dollars to move into Premium Select.","Ned Walker.","Okay. We will take the next question now.","Operator","Next, we will go to Edward Russell with Flightglobal.","Edward Russell","Hi there. Thank you for taking my question. There has been some recent reports out of Austin about Delta having interest in potentially building a focus city there in the future, especially as the C-Series start to come in, sorry the A220s? Could you comment on this report and Delta's ambitions in Austin?","Ed Bastian","Ed, we are not going to comment on any future plans that haven't already been announced.","Edward Russell","Okay. Understood. And then a follow-up. Could you comment on how many A220s you expect to take delivery of this year and when those deliveries will begin?","Ed Bastian","So you mean the 220s?","Edward Russell","Yes, A220s.","Ed Bastian","We expect to take delivery of a handful by the end of the year and we will be putting them into service in the first quarter.","Edward Russell","Okay. So still no set date or number yet?","Ed Bastian","It will be the beginning of the year.","Ned Walker.","Okay. Alan, we have time for one more question.","Operator","All right. We will take that last question from Dan Reed with Forbes.","Ed Bastian","Hi. Dan, we cannot hear you.","Dan Reed","I am sorry. Can you hear me now? Okay. Ed, at the risk of -- hello?","Ed Bastian","Yes. We are having trouble. Sorry, but ask the question again, Dan.","Dan Reed","Okay. At the risk of asking you to practice as a psychoanalyst, let me ask you a question that Jamie Baker asked in a different way. Why do you think investors are hesitant to bid up Delta's stock price principally, but also some of the other industry player's stock prices? Why are they being so hesitant to go where you think they should go?","Ed Bastian","You certainly should get that feedback from the investors directly themselves. We are doing our very best. The Delta stock price is roughly adding American and United's market cap combined, that's what the Delta price is. So we do think we get a premium. And from a performance perspective, we can just control what we control which is delivering an outstanding value for our consumers, great product, reliability, with the best service and hospitality from our employees that's driving the higher customer satisfaction that we have ever seen and the highest revenue growth rate. I think one of the things that's been weighing on the stock, as we all know, is the growth in fuel prices in the short term and we have said on the call that we expect to be able to cover most if not all of it this year by the end of the year and set the pace for margin expansion going into 2019.","Ned Walker.","Okay. Thank you very much, Ed, Glen, Paul and Joe. That concludes the June quarter 2018 call. Thanks everyone and have a good day.","Operator","Again, that concludes today's conference.

Earlier today, we reported our December quarter and full year results, including a December quarter pretax profit of $923 million and EPS of $0.82, in line with consensus. Normalized for the out of quarter cost of the new pilot contract, our pretax income was $1.3 billion with a 15% pretax margin and EPS of $1.16. This rounds out what has been a record-breaking year across-the-board for Delta, financially, operationally and for our customers.","Financially, we produced $6.1 billion of pretax profits, 16.5% operating margin and a 26% pretax return on invested capital. It looks like we will be the only major to have grown its operating margin in 2016. We generated $7 billion in operating cash flow and nearly $4 billion of pretax [loans] [ph] we used to reduce our adjusted net debt to $6.1 billion, achieved an investment grade credit rating and returned over $3 billion to our owners.","Operationally, we ran the best operation in the industry by a wide margin and we continue to raise the bar on ourselves. We ended 2016 with 241 days of no mainline cancellations and 81 days with no system cancellations, a level of performance that no airline has ever come close to producing on our scale. As we are doing that, at the same time we are regularly keeping on-time arrivals at nearly 87% and improving our bag scores by 13%, incredible work by Gil and the entire operations team.","We know that our operational reliability is a key driver of customer satisfaction and one reason why more customers than ever prefer flying Delta. With our operating performance, combined with the investments we have made in our fleet, products and facilities, we have seen a consistent improvement in our net promoter scores hitting a record 44% in November. All of this is due to the outstanding efforts of 80,000 Delta people and it's an incredible honor to recognize that with over $1 billion in profit sharing for the third year in a row. Sharing the success of the company with our people is one of the things that makes Delta truly different.","The major theme at our Investor Day last month was the sustainability and durability of our business. And with fuel and labor costs rising, we must grow unit revenues if we were to sustain our margins. So we are pleased to have seen our fourth quarter unit revenues come in better than not only our original guidance but also better than the guidance we gave in mid-December. While it's taken longer than we wanted to get here, we are cautiously optimistic that the revenue environment finally appears to have turned the corner and after a flat RASM in the month of December we expect unit revenues to turn positive for the first quarter.","That said, we are going to remain conservative with our capacity until we see two things. In the short term, we will need to see a further firming of current revenue trends. And over the medium to longer term, we will keep our capacity in check until we are achieving our 17% to 19% operating margin target because as we also said at Investor Day, 2017 is going to be a bit of a transition year. While revenues are on a better trajectory, we expect margins will decline 100 to 200 basis points year-on-year in 2017, given the current forward curve and the expense of our labor cost reset.","However, we expect the margin pressure to peak in the March quarter and by the back half of this year, we would be in a position to expand margins as our unit revenue base improves. This should be a very good setup for 2018 and beyond. So as we look ahead, I am optimistic. By executing flawlessly against our core principles, we are confident that we are the right path to return to an improving margin trajectory later in the year.","First, we will continue to be America's best-run airline focusing on producing the best operation every single day for our customers. Next, we will continue to strengthen our brand, improving our product and service in the eyes of our customers and generating a sustainable revenue premium versus our competition. We will also expand our global reach through equity stakes, joint ventures and partnerships around the world. I am looking forward to completing our Aeromexico tender offer in the first half of the year. Finally, we will maintain our solid foundation with cost and capital discipline, making sure that every dollar we spend is put to good use without burdening the business with high leverage. Put together, this will create the sustainable returns and cash flows that our owners expect over the long term delivered by the very best team of airline professionals in the business.","And with that, I am happy to turn the call over the Glen.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks, Ed, and good morning everyone. I want to start this morning by thanking the Delta people for taking great care of our customers everyday. It's your efforts that make Delta grand and drive our premium to the industry. I also want to give a special thanks for our commercial team for all of their very hard work that got us to flat RASM for the month of December and should return us to positive unit revenues in the first quarter. While total demand remained strong throughout 2016, weak business yields were prevalent and drove RASM declines. To address this, in the December quarter, we adjusted our revenue management approach and capped our capacity growth below 1%.","Following the election in November, we began seeing improvements in business demand and the firming of business yields. These trends continued into December, which was the first month in over two years that yields improved on a year-over-year basis. As a result, our fourth quarter unit revenues were down 2.7%, better than both our initial guidance and the updated outlook we gave at Investor Day.","As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the trends that we see. At a macro level, consumer confidence remains strong and demand remains solid. And the outlook for corporate travel is positive. In our most recent survey, 85% of our corporate customers expect that they will maintain or increase travel spend in the first quarter. This figure is up nine points from the previous outlook than last quarter and is the best outlook we have seen in two years.","In addition, we are maintaining our commitment to moderate capacity growth until we see further firming of the current revenue trends. Our capacity will decline about half a point in the first quarter of 2017 but excluding the impact of leap year, our run rate will continue to track below 1%.","Finally, while domestic business yields have turned positive, there is still a long way to go and a great opportunity for us before they are back to historical levels. These points, combined, give us confidence that we are on the right path and we expect system revenue RASM to increase 0% to 2% for the March quarter with February and March stronger than January.","Geographically, our path to positive RASM is heavily dependent on the domestic entity, given it's relative [indiscernible] in our network. For the December quarter, domestic unit revenues were down 3%, which is a four point improvement from what we saw during the third quarter and the momentum is continuing. More than half of our domestic network is currently realizing positive RASM today, up from 20% we saw during the summer period. And our network investments continue to drive results with JFK, Los Angeles and Seattle notable bright spot for us as each posted positive RASM for the December quarter and have superior forward trends.","With the demand in yield improvement we are experiencing, we now expect domestic PRASM for the November through January period to be slightly positive versus our prior outlook of flat. We also expect that our domestic unit revenues will be positive for the March quarter. We will continue to be prudent about our capacity increases as we work to maintain our revenue momentum and we expect domestic capacity to be up 1.5% in the first quarter. In addition to the benefits we anticipate from adjustments to our revenue management strategy, we will also begin lapping the domestic close in pricing weakness we started experiencing around February last year.","Internationally, we are seeing trends improve. While there are pockets of weakness around the world, we are taking the appropriate action to ensure our results continue moving in the right direction. International capacity was down 2% for the December quarter and will be down 4% in the first quarter of 2017. Our LatAm unit revenues improved 5% year-over-year in the December quarter, the second consecutive positive result for the region and we anticipate the momentum will continue in the first quarter. Brazil have led the turnaround in the region, but each sub-entity in Latin America has posted positive year-over-year RASM for the first time since the third quarter of 2011. We see momentum in LatAm continuing as we move through 2017.","In the Pacific, we continue to execute on our multiyear restructuring which deemphasizes our hub in Tokyo and continues to build on our partner hubs in Shanghai and Seoul. As a result of these changes, the spool of new domestic services and a challenging capacity environment, our Pacific entity unit revenues declined 9% on 6% less capacity. Roughly half of this RASM decline was driven by lower Yen hedges on a year-over-year basis. We expect fourth quarter of 2016 will mark the trough for our Pacific unit revenue performance as our restructuring efforts take hold and industry capacity growth moderates. Specifically, we expect a significant capacity growth in the U.S. to Shanghai and Beijing market, which has occurred over the last several years to slow in 2017 as both the Chinese and the U.S. carriers will reach their respective frequency caps this summer.","Turning to the Atlantic. Our European portfolio remains challenged due to industry capacity and balance and currency headwinds. While our Transatlantic unit revenues declined 6% for the quarter, the region still produced one of its most profitable December quarters in history. As we have seen the industry fare environment evolve, we have been thoughtful and proactive in our capacity adjustments and are planning 1Q 2017 Transatlantic capacity to be down 3%. In 2017, we will continue to build on our presence in our strategically advantaged hubs in London, Paris and Amsterdam, while deemphasizing high EU point-of-sale markets. And as we move into the summer season, we expect point-of-sale U.S. demand to be at record levels, which will help mitigate the point-of-sale European weakness.","For our international network broadly, further strengthening of the U.S. dollar does pose some incremental risk to 2017. However, we are well positioned to mitigate these potential headwinds though our capacity and fleet actions. At current rates, our year-over-year foreign exchange impact in 1Q of 2017 is expected to be a $25 million headwind. With positive RASM in our line of sight, our next priority goes to consistently producing topline growth as we return to margin expansion in the back half of this year.","To this end, it is our focus on the customer and our brand that will allow us to maintain our momentum and ultimately drive a better revenue outcome. Branded fares remain a huge opportunity for us and will continue expanding and merchandising our suite of products that allow customers to tailor their travel experience. This year we expect to generate an incremental $300 million in revenue from our branded fare initiatives. Our newest product, Delta Premium Select will debut in the first half of 2017 providing elevated service and improved amenities on Delta's longest flights. And the expansion of basic economy will also continue in 2017. Today basic economy is over 40% of the domestic markets and we expect to have full domestic coverage by mid-2017. The broader international rollout will follow and we expect to be complete with basic economy in our entire network by 2018.","We are expanding the breadth of our products in the marketplace. We are investing in technology in commercial improvements to advance the way we offer these products. We want to consistently have the right product at the right price at the right time for our customers. We continue to develop our international partnerships and we were pleased to be granted antitrust immunity by the DOT for our proposed JV with Aeromexico in December. We expect the JV will become effective on April 1. We are excited about the opportunity that this presents both airlines in the largest business travel market between the U.S. and Latin America.","Finally, we will continue to invest roughly 50% of cash flow back into the business to improve the customer experience. Whether it's new aircraft in our fleet, our new all-suite business class product, improvements to the Sky Club or the investments we are making in innovation like RFID or other customer facing technology, Delta continues to invest in having an industry-leading product. The opportunities to drive additional revenues are great and I cannot be more excited about the business in 2017 and beyond.","And with that, I would like to turn it over to our birthday boy and CFO, Paul Jacobson.","Paul Jacobson","Thanks Glen and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us. Once again, this quarter Delta team was able to demonstrate that despite challenges and cost pressure, we have built a durable business that can deliver consistent results.","Total operating expenses increased $573 million in the quarter, primarily driven by $475 million of pressure from the new pilot contract with $380 million of that being related to the retro payment back to January 1. Nonfuel CASM increased 10.6% in the quarter, roughly eight points of that pressure driven by the pilot agreement in the quarter. Excluding the portion of the contract expense not related to the quarter, Delta's normalized nonfuel cost increased approximately 4%","That said, fourth quarter saw a bit more cost escalation than we have been seeing so far this year. In addition to the impact of wage increases related to the ratified pilot agreement, there were timing issues in light items such as maintenance, contracted services and rents and landing fees that drove expense pressure in 4Q after having provided benefits in earlier quarters. However, fourth quarter and our full year results are consistent with the expectations we have had all year.","For the March quarter, we expect nonfuel cost to increase 5% to 7% on a reported basis as cost pressures in 2017 will be weighted towards the first half of the year. Normalizing 1Q 2016 cost to include the portion of the pilot contract related to that period, our nonfuel CASM is expected to increase in the 3% to 5% range in the first quarter, although we will strive to be in the low end of that range. For the full year, we continue to expect our nonfuel unit cost to increase in the 2% to 3% range on capacity growth of 1% due to higher maintenance volumes, greater depreciation expense, reduced asset utilization and the continued investments we are making in our people.","Turning to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by $240 million or about 15% despite higher crude oil prices, as we lapped hedge losses from 2015. While crude has moved higher, crack spreads have remained low, which has helped keep jet fuel prices relatively in check for the airline with pressures result at the refinery which lost $40 million for the quarter as expected. For 2017, we expect our fuel cost pressures will be weighted for the first half of the year. As you remember, during the first quarter of last year crude prices averaged $35 a barrel and hit a low of $26 in late January before they began to increase steadily from there.","So for the first quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.73 per gallon which is up roughly 30% year-over-year, hopefully the largest headwind from higher fuel we will see all year. With similar timing on our nonfuel cost pressures and the pace of our unit revenue improvements Glen discussed earlier, this should result in a March quarter operating margin of 11% to 13%. As we move through the year, with our cost increases moderating and our RASM trajectory improving, we should be in a position to see margins stabilize in the second quarter and begin expanding again by the second half.","Moving on to cash flow. We generated more than $1.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. Consistent with our balanced capital deployment strategy, a little over $600 million, roughly half of that cash flow, went directly back into the business for aircraft modifications, facility upgrades and technology improvements. We expect core capital spending will be roughly $800 million in the first quarter, largely driven by aircraft related spend. Also in the March quarter and consistent with prior years, we have already contributed $1.1 billion to the pension plan.","With the DOT grant of antitrust immunity for our proposed joint venture with Aeromexico in mid-December, we now expect the tender offer to occur in the second quarter of 2017. While we continue to make investments in our business for the future, we are also strengthening our balance sheet as we work towards our $4 billion net adjusted debt goal for 2020. We ended the December quarter with net debt of $6.1 billion, down roughly $500 million from yearend 2015.","We generated $640 million in free cash flow and returned $450 million of that to our shareholders in the quarter. For the year, we generated nearly $4 billion in free cash flow, more than $3 billion of which went back to our owners after investment in the airline. That is roughly an 80% return rate and our goal continues to be to return at least 70% of our free cash flow to our owners annually.","Looking back on 2016, it was a year in which the uniqueness of the Delta model and our disciplined approach to the business allowed us to deliver a result that was consistent with 2015 despite a lot of headwinds. I would like to thank each and every member of the Delta family for their hard work this year as we continue to show investors why they can rely on Delta and the Delta family. As we move forward into 2017, we are committed to staying focused on cost and our balanced capital strategies because that is what differentiates Delta and that is what will provide for sustainability next year and over the long-term.","With that, I will turn it back to Jill.","Jill Greer","Thanks Ed, Glen and Paul. And we will now go to questions from the analysts. Dana, if you can provide the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Hi. Good morning everybody. First question for Paul. I just wanted to delve a bit further into the comment that second half margins would show year-on-year expansion. I think for the fourth quarter, that's a no-brainer given you booked the entire incremental pilot expense in fourth quarter 2016. If you had spread the retro payment over the quarters in 2016, would your comment that second half margins should show expansion, would that still be the most probable outcome?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning Jamie. Thanks for that question. Yes, that is what is the most probable outcome. As we go through 2017, we are running the business on a normalized basis. That's the run rate of the salaries and wages. So as we look at the effects of the pilot contract in 2016, we are trying to normalize for that flow and we feel confident that we will be able to achieve that in the second half of the year, even as we look through that adjustment.","Jamie Baker","Okay. That's helpful. And a second question for Glen. Where are we in terms of achieving the 100% of domestic markets equipped, for a lack of a better term, with basic economy? And more importantly, I suppose, when you convert a market to one that does offer basic economy, what sort of RASM impact does that have? Should we assume that it's the basic economized markets, for a lack of a better term, that are contributing to that statement that you made of half of your domestic market experiencing positive RASM? Or is that reading too much into it?","Glen Hauenstein","I think that's reading too much into it. The huge driver in markets returning to positive unit revenues is getting momentum back in the business yields. And even if you experience a 60% sell up rate which is slightly higher than we have experienced in the past, let's say 50% to make the math easy on an average sell up of $40, you are not talking about a huge amount of money. I think it's more of a competitive tool than it is a huge value driver in the long run. So what we are really excited about are the branded fares on the premium side, the continuation of more usage in first class, continuation of the higher branded products like Comfort Plus and our new Premium Select that we are introducing later on this year.","Jamie Baker","Got it. Paul and Glen, thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Conor Cunningham","Hi guys. It's actually Conor in for Helane. I realize you made some cuts on the Atlantic side. Can you just discuss what gives you confidence that the Atlantic will eventually sort itself out? I mean I realize that there's seems like there's going to be significant low cost growth for years to come. How does Delta and those JV partners expect to mitigate any market share losses to those guys? Thanks.","Glen Hauenstein","Well, I am not sure that we would say we are going to mitigate any share losses. I think what we are going to do is preserve and accelerate our margins. And I think that's where having partner hubs and becoming more and more reliant on the partner hubs where we have competitive advantages is a key to our strength moving forward. Clearly also in the segmentation of products, we have further segmentation to do and I think that's one of the reasons we look at the products we are introducing in the marketplace like Premium Select.","If you look at what Norwegian flight, they don't have flatbeds. If you look at what a lot about the ultra low cost carriers, they haven't made that investment in those types of products. And we need to adjust to that new paradigm as high quality products for leisure customers who are willing to pay more than just standard coach fares. So we have some adjustments to make in our model. We will continue to work with our partners to make sure that our model is more durable and I think we have a very good hand in Europe in the long run.","Conor Cunningham","Has there been some discussion of potentially bringing basic economy to the international side at all? Or is it just still a domestically focused product at this point?","Glen Hauenstein","In the call today, we said that we will have it ubiquitous in our entire system by 2018. So it will be in all of our international markets.","Conor Cunningham","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Linenberg","Yes. Hi. Good morning everybody. Glen, I want to go back on the markets domestically. You called out a couple of airports as notable bright spots. And I think you said that they had superior sort of demand trends going forward. You called out LAX, Seattle, JFK. Where's LaGuardia in that? Is it New York that you are seeing? Or is it just specifically JFK? And LaGuardia maybe isn't strong enough to warrant a call out. Can you just comment on that?","Glen Hauenstein","In LaGuardia, as you know, one of the key business markets, Boston LaGuardia, has a new entrant who has extraordinarily low fares, which is putting a little bit of pressure on LaGuardia as well as all of that new service from New York to Florida. So I would say there is little bit more pressure on LaGuardia than there on Kennedy right now.","Mike Linenberg","Okay. Thank you. And then just a question to Paul. Paul, where are you, I am not sure if you have the numbers yet but with respect to the pension, where that liability, the under funding, where that ended at yearend 2016. Can you update us on that?","Paul Jacobson","Sure Mike and good morning.","Mike Linenberg","Good morning.","Paul Jacobson","We ended 2016 with a pension liability of about $10.6 billion of the unfunded liability. That's down a little more than $0.5 billion from 2015. The rate improvements that we saw towards the end of the year largely offset the declines that we saw through the middle part of year. So it's up substantially from what the peak liability would have been intra-year, but the year-over-year change was moderated a little bit.","Mike Linenberg","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan McKenzie","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. If I am interpreting the press release literally, it implies essentially no sequential improvement in unit revenue in the second quarter and from where I sit that, of course, doesn't make sense just given the value pricing that was going on in the second quarter. So to get at your commentary, are you assuming a more conservative fuel price than is implied today by the futures for the stabilization of margins in the second quarter?","Ed Bastian","Hi Dan. It's Ed. I don't know what your calculus is for the second quarter. But I would say your model has got some challenges in it. So maybe you can take that offline.","Dan McKenzie","Well, okay. Well, I guess the point I am just trying to make is, we should continue to expect sequential improvement in unit revenue in the second quarter?","Ed Bastian","That was what I was inferring by my comment.","Dan McKenzie","Yes. Okay. Perfect. And then second question here, Los Angeles was highlighted at Investor Day for infrastructure improvement. And I am just wondering where you are at now just in terms of gates and where would you go with respect to gates after the improvements? And what kind of growth does that potentially unlock for Delta at Los Angeles?","Glen Hauenstein","We are substantially constrained at LAX today. We have, I believe, 15 gates currently in terminals five and six and when we get to terminals two and three, we have the possibility to come close to doubling the gate pods but it is going to take some time as we redevelop terminals two and three. That's not overnight. And it will also take a little bit of the pressure off of the turns on the gate today. We turned terminals five and six to highest levels in the system and once we get a better gate pod, we will be able to reduce some of the congestion at the airport. So, we will have more gates but that doesn't necessarily mean more direct flights as a result. But net net, we absolutely will be increasing our footprint and our capacity in LAX over the next few years.","Dan McKenzie","Would that primarily --?","Glen Hauenstein","One of the big advantages to us today is we are not co-located with our partners in Los Angeles and this swap from terminals five and six to terminals two and three allows us to co-locate with our partners on a much more aggressive timeline. So we won't be busing people around the year or asking them to walk outside and go between terminals and really that drives a significant amount of value in the short run to be able to accomplish at a faster rate than we would otherwise do, particularly as we look to carriers like integrating with Aeromexico. So we are very excited about that in the short run.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just from a regulatory policy perspective, obviously very early days here, but maybe you could list for us your top three opportunities and risks you see. What are the potential changes on the table that you are most excited about?","Ed Bastian","Hi Duane, this is Ed. There's a number of things we are excited about. One of the things we are very excited about is the potential investment opportunities of the new administration, talk a lot about improving in airport facilities we have been doing, a considerable amount of investment alongside our public partners in LaGuardia, LA, Seattle, Salt Lake, Atlanta, but the ability to continue to work with the federal government to drive improvements to the infrastructure is clearly a big deal for us. We are very excited about the opportunities to present our case relative to the Middle Eastern situation with all the growth that those carriers have brought to this country on a subsidized basis where we are competing against governments, not the other airlines and the opportunity to let the Trump administration know how we can do, as an industry, a better job of protecting U.S. jobs and U.S. opportunities going forward and also protecting trade deals and enforcing trade deals that are being violated in the present time. There's tax benefits that are being discussed. There is regulatory changes being discussed, whether it's in the RFS on RINs potentially or other means. So there is a pretty good list of opportunities that we are -- I think we have already provided some input into the transition team and it will take some time over the next few months as things become a little more clear and individuals are staffed into new roles, but we are very excited.","Duane Pfennigwerth","I appreciate that. And then just on the airport investments that you are making in the New York area and it's tough, I guess, for me to know how much of this is conceptual versus committed at this point, but what is the annual investment that you have committed to at this point? How long term are these projects? And how should we be thinking about your longer term cost structure at these airports in New York? Thanks for taking the questions.","Ed Bastian","LaGuardia, it's premature to be talking, be giving numbers our because we don't have signed leases in place yet and we are working with various entities there. You are not going to see a significant spike in CapEx, if that's your question. We are doing our best to work with various public partnerships and private partnerships to minimize that but no question, as the airport facilities come online you will see increase in the cost of the facility and we also think you will see improvement in revenues and the efficiency of the facility as well.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Operator","And not take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi. Thanks for the time. Actually a question for Paul and kind of following up on what Duane was asking. With all the chatter out there around border adjustment taxes, do you see the potential for maybe higher aircraft CapEx as a result of import tariffs or anything like that? And then on corporate tax reform, what do you think the opportunity is for you either directly or indirectly, if you can, Paul?","Paul Jacobson","Sure. Good morning Rajeev. On the first question, it's way too premature to speculate on what any specific impacts might be to the airlines. We are following it closely as everybody else is. I think generally speaking, tax reform is good for the airline industry. It is a U.S. centric business model and one that, we believe, it continues to be very, very important for the U.S. infrastructure. So we feel optimistic that we can a net beneficiary of any tax reform and we are eager to see what the results are.","Rajeev Lalwani","And, Glen, a quick question for you, I guess more of a clarification. As we look ahead, would it be fair to say that capacity is more or less going to move in tandem with margin strength? Or should we assume that capacity kind of remains in check until you get margins to that targeted 15% to 17% range or so?","Glen Hauenstein","I didn't quite understand the difference between those two questions you pose, but I think that's what you see is with a higher dollar and with the competitive environment we have internationally, we have been decreasing our offerings internationally in order to achieve margins. And as we get there, we would start looking at flattening our capacity and then eventually growing it. Hope that answers your question.","Rajeev Lalwani","I guess I was asking, is capacity going to stay in check until margins get higher? Or should we look at --?","Glen Hauenstein","Absolutely. That's the plan.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. Thank you sir.","Operator","We will take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Good morning. Paul, a happy birthday. Just had a question on the cost side of things. Outside of labor costs, could you talk about the items that are placing the greatest pressure on unit cost this year and maybe how they progress through the quarters?","Paul Jacobson","Sure. Thanks, Savi, for the birthday wishes. You know, a gift would be not asking a question about CASM, but the biggest drivers, as we talked about in the calls for the first quarter and then what we saw in the fourth quarter is really timing of maintenance events. As you know, we tend to seasonally do that a lot in the winter and the off-peak periods. But it's just a natural progression of things as you go throughout the year. And now we feel like as we start to normalize the business and go through the summer periods, we expect to see a lot of the continued benefits from upgauging throughout the business to moderate some of that cost pressure in the first half and get us to the point where we feel confident that were in the 2% to 3% range for the full year as we talked about.","Ed Bastian","Savi, this is Ed. If I could add to that, I know there is some choppiness in year as the quarters rollout. But if you look at the full year of 2% to 3%, I would say, very high level, half of that's due to the labor reset that we have talked about and the other half is due to reduced utilization of the is run rate of airline's capacity. If you look at the reduced run rates of capacity, there is certainly a knock-on effect of nonfuel costs. I would say, high level, those are the two big drivers.","Savi Syth","Got it. Helpful. And then just a question on the product side. I know product segmentation has been kind of an important part of this, I think, the change in the industry as you kind of move away from having a commoditized product and I think customers have definitely benefited, improved operations and different things like that. But I guess, do you have a litmus test that we don't repeat the sins of the past where you add a lot of frills on to the product and then come a downturn you have to take that away? How do you, in your thinking about introducing food in economy on trans-con and things like that, just what's the litmus test as to the sustainability of that and maybe the demand for it?","Glen Hauenstein","Savi, I think we respond to demand and I think in different parts of the economic cycle, different things are important to different customers in each segment. And that's why I think as we continue to refine our customer segmentation, we want to continue to provide what customers are willing to pay for us. And in this part of the economic cycle, they are with consumer confidence side, with the consumer flush with cash, they are willing to pay for more frills. And you know, we make a mistake as an industry when we anticipate or try and be in the minds of consumers as opposed to responding to what's important at point in time. And I think, as a successful airline through all parts of the cycle, we are going to have to continue to monitor what's important to customers, what they want from us at that time. And that's what we are doing today.","Savi Syth","So you could see in downtowns, where you do cut back on certain things --","Glen Hauenstein","Absolutely. If fares become more relevant to customers than some of the amenities we put on, absolutely. I don't think you box yourself into the fact to say that what customers want today is what they want five years from now.","Savi Syth","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Thank you. Good morning. Glen, I know you said you are obviously optimistic about the outlook for corporate spend based on your survey but is there a practical risk that your corporate accounts may have reset their annual travel budgets a lot lower if they base it on the last couple year spend where corporate air fares were down so much? I don't think this would be uncommon with what's happened in prior airline cycles. So maybe you get this pop in the first half on higher spend but as the year progresses some of your maybe more midsize corporate accounts end up bumping into the ceilings of their annual travel budget because it was based off of lower dollar amount in a lower fare environment. So is that something that you have seen before? Is that something you are considering or planning for as we move through the year?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, Hunter, I think if you look at the travel spend on a lot of corporates, particularly in major lane segments of domestic U.S., they are considered to be the primary business segments, that the fares were down 30%, 40% on historical basis. And I don't think we have to get a significant, we are not expecting them to go back to the historical levels in our current plan. This is a journey. It's not a race. And so I do think that if the economy holds out, which we are forecasting today that it will and business continues to travel which we are forecasting it will, that the opportunity to raise fares in that environment with a lower level of capacity offering from the industry is significant and it gets better as we move throughout the year because the fare has got to be so low for business travel by midyear last year. If you take one of the primary business markets in Atlanta to City X, that used to be $750 for a day trip, it got down to $119 for a day trip today. It is sitting at $350 for a day trip. Could it go to $400? Could it go to $450? We see no propensity to decrease travel going from $750 to $100 and I don't think we will see it our way back.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Alright. That's good. Thanks. And then sorry for the modeling question but I think this is relevant. The other revenue is up about 11% in the fourth quarter. How much of that was maybe refinery third party sales and how much of that is just sort of like good run rate core revenue that's going to repeat, not based on the price of oil?","Paul Jacobson","Hunter, this is Paul. The third party revenues in the refinery were about $90 million that was equally offset by cost in the other cash cost line.","Hunter Keay","So other revenue outlook for 2017? Ballpark?","Paul Jacobson","For the full year?","Hunter Keay","Yes. If you don't mind?","Paul Jacobson","We can get back to you on the modeling questions.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thank you Paul. Thank you Glen.","Operator","We will take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon","Hi. Good morning guys and thanks for taking the question. I guess at a high level, I would like to understand what your thoughts are as far as how quickly you think you can get back to that 17% to 19% margin guidance after this coming year of 100 to 200 basis points of compression?","Paul Jacobson","David, it would be premature to speculate on a time frame. We gave you our best view on 2017. It's a year of some transition. Our goal would be, as I said in my opening comments, I think 2018 is going to be a good year, from what we can tell, but it's a long ways away. So we see the trajectory starting to turn back by mid-year and that's important.","David Vernon","Well, I guess internally how do you guys think about that long-term target then? Is it a multi-year thing? Is it an ambitious goal? Like how should we be thinking about it from a modeling perspective?","Paul Jacobson","It's our long term target and it still is and we are optimistic we will get ourselves there.","David Vernon","Okay. And then I guess maybe just as a quick follow-up. As you look at the --","Paul Jacobson","If I could add a point, David.","David Vernon","Sure.","Paul Jacobson","If you look at our 2016 results, we are right at the low-end of that target range, 16.5%. So it's not some wildly ambitious goal. That's the run rate this business has been on or has been on in terms of building towards it. We had a speed bump RASM, no question about it. And as RASM starts to improve, I think we will continue the trajectory to get better.","David Vernon","Okay. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. If you think of that 100 to 200 basis points of compression, how much of that would be just because fuel prices are going up? And how much of that is just that timing issue of getting RASM and cost ex-fuel right?","Paul Jacobson","I think there is lot of geography given that this time last year fuel prices were $30 a barrel and today they are $55 a barrel. So it's going to take a couple of quarters and I think that's a sizable amount of that 100 basis point compression we are talking about and that is front loaded to the front half of the year plan and probably by the second half I think we w ill on margin expansion.","David Vernon","Excellent. Thanks a lot for the time, guys.","Operator","We will take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew Didora","Hi. Good morning everyone. Glen, just a follow-up on some international commentary. I guess we have been hearing from some other global carriers that both Pacific and Transatlantic may have been holding up a little bit better than some expected given the capacity growth out there. In your prepared remarks, it didn't seem like you are seeing the same thing. Is that a fair assessment? And then from a corporate volume perspective, are you seeing a similar type of corporate uptick on your international routes? Or right now is it mostly domestic based? Thanks.","Glen Hauenstein","Andrew, the entities are a bit different. I think we probably would, when all this is said and done, underperformed in the Pacific, because we had the biggest restructuring going on in the Pacific and we did have Yen year-over-year hedged less hedge gains. So that had a lot of pressure on it. The core demand is very strong but it's not keeping pace, as an industry, with all of that capacity. We are optimistic as you get to the summer. When you look at Japan, it's very stable. When you look at China, we think there is going to be stability because we are out of the frequencies.","So we think there is a really good opportunity in the back half of this year to start making up some ground on the Pacific. As you know, we have also announced the retirement of our 747-400 fleet, which should be fully out by the end of this year. That should have some impact as we take some of the seats our of the lane sectors that plane was built for different network than we have today. So we are optimistic there as well. So we have a lot of changes in the Pacific and I would expect that when all is said and done that, that would be entity for us versus our competitive set that's most under pressure.","In the Atlantic, we have seen strong business demand and strong business yield continue. But again, there is a lot of currency going on in Europe. And when you look evaluate currency, that accounts for a significant portion of the declines we have seen. It's really not a core demand issue.","Andrew Didora","And then just like from a corporate volume perspective, are you seeing it coming back internationally as well? Or is it more domestic?","Glen Hauenstein","If you think about the nuances of what we have said, we didn't say that core demand for business in the U.S. was suffering in 2016. As a matter of fact, it was relatively real plus. What we saw was essentially a corporate fare war that occurred for various reasons that spread throughout the domestic U.S. network. That did not occur in the international entities. So the rate at which those yields improve or recover from more historical level is much more heavily weighted towards the U.S.","Andrew Didora","Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We will take our next question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi","Yes. Thanks very much. Glen, I was wondering if we could just talk about the SkyMiles program a little bit. At the Investor Day, you guys had a chart that showed total contributions from your Amex relationship and about a $2 billion total increase from 2014 to 2021. My understanding that, of that incremental revenue that's about 100% margin similar to what American Airlines has disclosed. So is it fair to say that by 2021 you will have conservatively $2 billion in EBIT coming strictly from the SkyMiles Amex relationship? Not to box you in at all, Glen, but I feel like that's kind of a yes or no answer.","Glen Hauenstein","Or no comment, right? It could be the third option. And I think that's the one we are going to go with here. We don't disclose the core economics of the Delta Amex relationship. So I am going to take box number three and then hand it over to Ed for additional comments.","Ed Bastian","Joe, this is Ed. I agree. We are not going to give the future margin on the Amex. But your topline numbers are right that when we did the deal a couple of years ago with Amex that the goal was to double our revenue contribution from Amex. We are right on pace there. And you would be safe to assume there is a very high margin contribution on those revenues. I wouldn't say it's a 100%, but it's a high contribution.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. Would you say that the incremental revenue year-to-year is 100%, that all of that flows down to pretax income? That's simply what American Airlines has disclosed as well.","Ed Bastian","I don't know what American Airlines deal is. They sound like they got a good deal. But I will tell you what our deal is. It's a high margin contribution for us. I will leave it at that.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay.","Ed Bastian","And ultimately those miles have to be redeemed for travel. So I don't know exactly how they are saying 100% of growth.","Joseph DeNardi","Sure. Well, that revenue flows through a different bucket, but be that as it may. So I think what that ignores a little bit is the remainder of the revenue, say that $2 billion where you started in 2014, quite a bit of that is also very high margin. So can you tell us, I guess you have answered this, can you tell us what the margin revenue of that stream is? Or could you at least tell us what the marketing revenue from that program is currently? It seems like an enormously profitable part of your business that most investors completely under-appreciate. Our analysis suggests that you guys earned roughly $2 billion in EBIT currently just from SkyMiles. So can you provide us some color around that?","Ed Bastian","We are not going to provide the details, Joe. I will disappoint you on that. But what I can tell you though is that it's not all margin. There is a significant cost of fulfillment. We don't give SkyMiles out and not deliver the travel service. So it's a source of revenue. It's far from a 100% flow-through. I would say, on the incremental structure going forward, yes, I think there is much higher margin compliment on the go forward, given that we have already got the base program being served, but no, on the first $2 billion it's a great program, but it's nowhere close to a high margin compliment.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. Thank you.","Jill Greer","Dana, we are going to have time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our final question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi guys. Thanks for the time. I guess maybe just to dig in a little bit, Glen, on some of the stuff you said on both the Atlantic and the Pacific. It sounded like you were experiencing some RASM headwinds as a result of the restructuring and then it also sounded like perhaps, so just I guess there's an opportunity there as that restructuring wraps up and some of these new markets start to mature and then also across the Atlantic, it sounded like you said you are going to try to reallocate some capacity into stronger U.S. point-of-sale markets. Between those two, either individually or on a combined basis, is there a significant RASM tailwind to come as these prophecies play out independent of what's happening with the underlying market?","Glen Hauenstein","The big question mark, I would say, is currency. If I had one issue that I would be a bit of a cautionary issue is if the dollar continues to appreciate, that would put a little bit more pressure on foreign point-of-sale. But core demand as strong and capacity levels seems to be generally in a better spot this year than they were last year looking forward. So I am cautiously optimistic that absent of another run in the dollar, another significant run in the dollar, that this is, as we have said, in the Pacific, that the fourth quarter would be our low point and that we would move forward from there and that summer in the Transatlantic with heavy point of sale U.S. would be a very good summer.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then I guess, if you were to just take your RASM guidance for the first quarter and assuming you come in line with the midpoint of that guidance based on normal seasonality if you just assume that there was no further improvement from there, where do you think you would end up for the year?","Glen Hauenstein","We are not going to speculate on a full year RASM guide. That's a good shot, though. But if you look at --","Darryl Genovesi","I was just asking if you were flat, what would that kind of imply? But okay. I get it. And then maybe if I could squeeze one in for -- sorry?","Glen Hauenstein","Let me just add one thing though, I think you do have to look at comps and comps get considerably easier as we proceed through the year. So that would infer an improving RASM performance.","Darryl Genovesi","Thank you. And then if I could, just a quick one last one in for Paul. Paul, you had commented that asset utilization was down. Is that kind of by design? Or would you anticipate, if we are not in a situation where you are accelerating the SM growth looking out a few quarters or a year, would you expect the longer term CapEx guidance to start to get revised down?","Paul Jacobson","Well, good morning Darryl. I think the asset utilization being down is wholly consistent with the plans for the year, as we talked about at Investor Day and the current revenue environment. So I wouldn't take anything more or less out of it than that. And we are where we expect to be on the long term with capacity down a bit. CASM 2% to 3% is still in that long-range strategic view of what we said to be consistently up to with about 2% capacity growth. So we feel good about our cost performance in running the business for margins and doing it the right way.","Darryl Genovesi","Great. Thanks a lot and best wishes for a happy birthday.","Paul Jacobson","Thank you Darryl.","Jill Greer","A great way to wrap up the analyst portion of the phone call. I will now turn it over to our Chief Communications Officer, Ned Walker.","Ned Walker","Hi. Thanks Jill. As we begin the media Q&A, I would like to ask everyone that they could have one question and one follow it up with a brief follow-up question. And with that, Dana, could you review the process to get into queue to ask those questions?","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Susan Carey.","Susan Carey","I ask you about Aeromexico. You say you anticipate closing your equity investment in the second quarter. I am wondering what regulatory approvals are still required? And can you give us some kind of idea about the estimated cost of this investment?","Ed Bastian","Hi Susan, it's Ed.","Susan Carey","Hi.","Ed Bastian","How are you?","Susan Carey","Good.","Ed Bastian","We are in the process of working through the remedies that are required in order to get the antitrust immunity and we have to have it done sometime the slot divestitures and the JV itself implemented prior to being able close on the deal. So I would say, we are looking at as probably a 60 to 90 day process here to get all the regulatory approvals, the divestitures in place. Relative to cost, I don't have a current, it's going down given the decline in the Peso. It's in the $400 million range, I think.","Susan Carey","And the regulatory approvals needed?","Ed Bastian","The regulatory approvals are in place. We just need to comply with the requirements. But we are waiting on additional regulatory rules.","Susan Carey","Thank you.","Peter Carter","Susan, this is Peter. Hi Susan. There is one thing we are waiting for, the Mexican securities authority to approve the transaction.","Ed Bastian","That's a tender.","Peter Carter","The tender offer. So we are waiting for that approval.","Susan Carey","Alright. Thank you.","Peter Carter","We do not anticipate any issues with the securities regulator there.","Susan Carey","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Alana Wise with Reuters.","Alana Wise","Hi. Good morning everybody.","Ed Bastian","Good morning.","Alana Wise","So my question is, I am looking at our sheet right now and see that you guys' stock is down about 3% this morning. So I was just wondering if there was any sort of comment on the guidance you guys provided as to why think this might be?","Ed Bastian","I could not understand what you were saying.","Alana Wise","I can hear you.","Ed Bastian","Yes. It is better now. Can you just ask your question again?","Alana Wise","Sure. So I am looking and I see that your stock this morning is down about 3%. And I was just hoping for any sort of comment you guys can provide around that? Why it might be? Or any sort of guidance you can give on that?","Ed Bastian","So the stock price was up this morning. It's down a little bit. The market is down today. So we don't, I think it's up currently, so we don't comment on the moves hour-by-hour, now. I think our results came generally in line with expectations. So it should have a significant impact on the stock.","Alana Wise","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ted Reed with TheStreet.","Ted Reed","Thank you. I have two questions. I guess, first for Glen. You said that basic economy is going to be 40% of domestic markets and I know you are adding a premium product in coach also. So listening to you makes me think that some day there won't be coach plans as we know it or there will be hardly any coach class as we know it because of all these various products. Is that fair?","Glen Hauenstein","No Ted. I think actually for the foreseeable future that the main cabin is where a preponderance of our customers sit and that a vast majority of our revenues reside. So the death of the main cabin, I think, is premature to prognosticate on that. But what the offering is in each one of these cabins, think about what United is doing in basic economy, which is very different than what we are doing. We have this all changes as we respond to what consumers really want to buy from airlines is going to be fascinating to watch.","Ted Reed","Alright. Thank you. My second is for Ed. It's mainly because I could barely hear you, Ed, when you talk about what you expect from the Trump administration. I understand there is more business travel and there will be more support for you in these cases with the Mid East carriers and Norwegian, but I couldn't hear you. So I would like you to address that. Thank you.","Ed Bastian","Sorry that you could not hear me, Ted. I thought I was clear. There is going to be a number of opportunities for us to present our views to the new administration, which we very much look forward to. I mentioned that we are going add more opportunities in infrastructure, given the level of investment we already are making in our airports and facilities and partnering with the government to do even more. That would be a great opportunity. I mentioned the Middle Eastern situation, how we are competing against governments, not airlines in the Middle East. The blatant violation that we see relative to subsidized air services, $50 billion of subsidies over the last 10 years and our opportunity to have the governments move to enforce its trade agreements as compared to victim of it as well as protect U.S. jobs all alongside that. And then the other item that I mentioned is the tax reform that's being discussed. I see Delta certainly being the beneficiary of that, though it's hard to speculate as to the form it will take given it's very early.","Ted Reed","Alright. Thank you, Ed.","Ned Walker","Okay. Dana. we have time for two more quick questions. I think we have one from The Wall Street Journal coming up again as well as The Philadelphia Inquirer.","Operator","Yes, sir. And we will go to Linda Loyd with The Philadelphia Inquirer.","Linda Loyd","Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned that the Trainer refinery lost $40 million in the fourth quarter. What's the outlook for the refinery in 2017? And when, if at any time this year, might you expect a profit, the refinery to turn a profit?","Paul Jacobson","Hi Linda. Good morning. This is Paul Jacobson. The refinery, we are expecting to produce a profit of around $100 million this year, based on where the current crack spreads and margins look like. We are projecting a slight profit in the first quarter based on where the current environment is. But the refinery continues to perform well against our broad-based strategy, what we look at. We were up there visiting with the refinery employees in December and morale remains high and we remain committed to that investment despite some of the challenges across the industry and the cyclicality.","Linda Loyd","Thank you. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Susan Carey with The Wall Street Journal.","Susan Carey","Thanks fellows. Condolences on this, but I have to ask. On the Fort Lauderdale situation, have we determined that all the injured and deceased were Delta customers? And have we seen any kind of tingling or paperwork filed for lawsuits on this situation?","Glen Hauenstein","Susan, it's an active investigation. So we are pretty limited to what we can discuss. It did happen in our terminal. So yes, Delta customers were impacted. But we really can't provide much more than that.","Ned Walker","Yes. Susan, I would suggest you talk with the FBI. They have asked to be the coordinator for all information pertaining to the investigation. So I would turn it over to their PIO down in Fort Lauderdale.","Susan Carey","Alright guys. Thank you.","A - Ned Walker","No. Thanks for the question. Thank you Ed, Glen, Paul and Peter. That wraps up the December 2016 quarter call. We will be back in April for the March 2017 call.

My name is Melody and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow today's presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our September quarter call. Speaking on the call from Atlanta today are Delta's CEO, Richard Anderson; our President, Ed Bastian; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. We have the entire leadership team here with us for the Q&A. Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings.","We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Richard Anderson.","Richard Anderson","Thanks, Jill. This morning, Delta reported a $2.2 billion pretax profit for the September quarter, a 33% improvement year-on-year, as our business continues to perform exceptionally well. We delivered earnings per share of $1.74 versus consensus estimates of $1.71. As demand is good, we essentially held revenues flat against a steep decline in fuel which allows Delta to bring about two-thirds of our fuel savings to the bottom-line for our owners.","Therefore despite economic uncertainty in some international markets such as Brazil and Japan, and the impact of a strong dollar, we were able to expand operating margins by 5 points to 21%, and improve earnings per share by 45%. We generated $2.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.4 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, and we have delivered a return on invested capital of 26.3% for the last 12 months.","We reduced our net debt by $1 billion year-on-year, held our non-fuel CASM growth to 0.9% in the quarter, and we have returned over $2 billion of cash to our owners year-to-date. These types of results investors expect from a high quality industrial company like Delta, our metrics rank among the top 10% of S&P Industrials. Our free cash flow performance puts Delta in the company of companies like 3M and Lockheed Martin. Our work over the past decade has produced a strong and durable foundation. We have consistently hit our EPS and cash flow commitments over the years. We will leverage that foundation in order to consistently produce strong and dependable earnings and cash flows throughout the business cycle. At the base of that foundation are the people of Delta, and our unique employee culture. Our outstanding results this quarter were made possible by the dedication of our employees who work hard every day to provide the best operation and service in the industry.","Last month, we took steps to improve wages for our employees and announced a 14.5% base pay rise for our ground and flight attendant groups that will take effective December 1. This will be accompanied by a change to our profit sharing program starting in 2016 in a response to feedback from our employees who want more certainty in their base pay while maintaining a variable component of compensation that is tied to the company's profitability and align all of our incentives across the enterprise. We continue to run by far the industry's best operation.","In September quarter, we delivered a record 99.9 completion factor, including 40 days with zero cancellations, and our on-time rate improved to a point 86.1%. In the month of September alone we cancelled only 13 flights out of more than 83,000 performance our competitors will not match and I actually have to repeat that. In September alone we cancelled only 13 flights out of more than 83,000 flights and our competitors can't match it. This type of performance and the investments we have made in our network and products are driving the best revenue generation in the industry as our domestic premium stands at 14%.","We continue to benefit from the decline of fuel prices, which provided more than $1 billion of benefit this quarter, and at current prices will drive a $750 million benefit in 4Q. As a result, we are uniquely positioned among global industrial peers to drive record earnings in the face of a strong dollar and economic uncertainty in some international markets. The level of cash we expect to generate from these earnings will put us in the top 10% of the S&P 500.","While industrial revenue is currently weaker because of the strong dollar and the runoff of fuel surcharges, we still have strong margins, overall because of lower fuel, and we see good opportunity over the long-term internationally. To this end, two of our major initiatives over the past several years have been investing in our Latin network and restructuring our Pacific franchise. During the quarter we increased our stake in GOL Aereos down in Brazil, the largest Brazilian domestic carrier to just under 10% and also entered into a long-term exclusive partnership with China Eastern to build a hub in Shanghai which includes our taking a 3.5% ownership position in China Eastern.","Ultimately JVs will give us the foundation to build the leading U.S. gateways to China and Brazil, including hubs in Shanghai and Sao Paulo with our great partners China Eastern, China Southern, and GOL. Our partnerships with these carriers, along with Virgin and Aeromexico, will further our efforts in these regions and in Western Europe and Mexico and provide significant long-term upside for Delta. Delta is quite unique in these investment strategies as we are the only U.S. carrier with equity investments coupled with long-term JVs, and commercial cooperation with airlines in Asia, the United Kingdom, and Latin America.","We've proven with Air France-KLM, and Virgin Atlantic that we have a unique model that creates huge value for our owners. The cash we are generating allows us to fortify our balance sheet. We've reduced our net debt by more than $10 billion over the last several years and we're on track to reach $4 billion in net debt by 2017. This progress has been recognized by the rating agencies and today we are just one notch away from investment grade, as we run this company on investment grade metrics. At the same time, we accelerate capital returns to our owners; we repurchased 8% of our equity since buying our first share just 26 months ago. We expect to return $2.5 billion of cash to our owners this year and we will continue returning more than 50% of free cash flow to our owners going forward.","We have a significant opportunity ahead, as fuel prices remained low, and we continue to push forward to achieve positive RASM. RASM growth remains a key component of how we drive margin improvement over time and we remain committed to improving our unit revenue trajectory. Our plan is to manage the business tightly and preserve the fuel savings to drive margin expansion.","In May, we outlined the key metrics specific long-term targets for our business to attain. These include delivering annual EPS growth of greater than 15%, achieving returns on capital of 20% to 25%, and generating operating and free cash flow in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion and $4 billion to $5 billion respectively. We have consistently achieved our long-term goals and will continue to do so regardless of the direction of fuel prices.","For the fourth quarter, our system capacity will be flat year-on-year, with fuel down about 40% year-on-year. We expect another record quarter with operating margins in 4Q of 16% to 18%. In addition, strong cost discipline is imperative since 2008. We have kept our non-fuel cost growth below at 2% compounded annual growth rate. We're using the current environment to evaluate and improve cost across all parts of the business, including our overhead functions, making sure that we're investing in the right parts of the business, and at levels we can sustain over time, regardless of fuel prices and the economic cycle.","As we lay out the framework for 2016, we are not recasting our business to low fuel prices. Instead we budget fuel prices significantly higher than the forward curve because fuel remains volatile we will prudent in how we manage our expense, capital, and our capacity.","Our initial plan is for 2016 capacity to be in the range of flat to up 2%. We believe that this is an appropriate level of growth to balance capital investment, supply, and demand and ensure the momentum in our business continues. By prudently managing all aspects of our business we can make strong progress against our financial targets continue to work towards earning the premium valuation of other high quality industrials who produce similar results to Delta's the results we announced today. But with that said Delta today trades at a 40% discount to our S&P peer group.","So before I turn the call over to Ed and Paul to go through the details of the quarter, I want to congratulate Jill Greer, on her promotion to Vice President, very well deserved and thank you for all your contributions to Delta. With that, Ed.","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Richard. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. We delivered the best quarter ever posted in the industry, the September quarter, with pretax income increasing 33% to $2.2 billion. Thanks to the Delta employees for their contributions to an outstanding quarter, a performance that drove our profit sharing accrual of more than $560 million. This brings our profit sharing total to $1.1 billion year-to-date. We have already surpassed the total profit sharing paid last year, so the upcoming Valentine's Day will be especially sweet for our Delta team.","We expanded our operating margin more than 5 points to 21% which is at the high end of our initial guidance range. Our revenues were roughly flat despite facing a $235 million headwind from foreign exchange. Our commercial initiatives are producing great revenue momentum. Corporate demand remains solid with volume growth of 5%.","In the domestic entity, corporate growth was notably strong in the Transcons and West Coast markets as we successfully leverage our investments in New York, LA, and Seattle. We saw meaningful improvements in our healthcare, financial services, and media sectors, offsetting declines in energy and manufacturing.","We have rolled out branded fares in 462 markets and the initiative continues to go well delivering an additional $75 million in high margin revenue for the quarter. We are especially pleased with sales in Comfort+ which increased 42% and First Class upsell where we increased our paid first class load factor to 56% up 8 points year-over-year on a base of 5% more First Class seats. Our agreement with American Express produced over $100 million in incremental value this quarter. As you may recall we renewed our contract with American Express at the end of last year. We have a great partner in American Express and continue to expect the revenue benefits will double over the next few years as we work together to enhance our leading co-brand offering for customers.","Our cargo business is facing a similar dynamic to our passenger business with domestic performing well, while the international business is facing significant currency and related demand headwinds. For the September quarter, passenger unit revenues declined 4.9% which was in the upper half of our initial guidance range of down 4.5% to down 6.5%.","Domestic unit revenues declined 3%, as yield pressures continue in a fashion similar to previous quarters. Despite the yield decline, we are quite pleased with the profitability of the domestic business. We've been able to expand our domestic revenue premium while growing our top-line cost effectively through higher gauge and strategically expanding service in our hubs in New York, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Our Seattle domestic RASM was on par with the entity average despite a 24% increase in capacity. Our significant investment in the city has grown regional connectivity and local traffic and yield strength is outpacing capacity growth. The RASM performance in New York and Los Angeles was both above system average as the benefits of our investments continue to mature.","JFK-LAX saw RASM improvement and load factors up 3 points. Our international business continued to face headwinds from foreign exchange and lower fuel surcharges. We are actively addressing these areas of weakness by making sizeable capacity reductions in the winter schedule. The TransAtlantic entity was challenged by currency pressure and industry capacity growth outpacing past year demand. Currency pressures in the quarter were partially offset by improved U.S. dollar point of sale.","As a result, unit revenues in the TransAtlantic declined 9.5% with 6.5 points of that income impact coming from FX which represented $120 million from that entity alone. Core European market demand remained strong though but we are addressing the headwinds in Africa, Middle East, and Russia.","Our TransAtlantic JVs with Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic saw margins expand once again despite these continued currency pressures. We are using the success of these joint ventures as the model as we deepen our partnerships with carriers in other parts of the world.","We also acquired six additional pairs of slots in London, Heathrow which will further strengthen our position in the most important business market in Europe. In Latin America, our unit revenues were down 5% driven entirely by currency, primarily in Brazil. Our capacity growth in the regions slowed to 2% this quarter after eight consecutive quarters of growth that was materially above the system average. Mexico and the Caribbean are mostly U.S. dollar point of sale and as a result continue to do well.","During the quarter, we increased our ownership stake in GOL to just under 10% and we continue to work closely with them to address the economic uncertainties in Brazil. We expect Open Skies with Brazil in the next year and intend to file for an antitrust immunity shortly thereafter. We also expect to receive the antitrust immunity and establish a joint venture with Aeromexico in the coming months. Ultimately we expect to have immunized profit sharing joint ventures with the leading carriers in the two largest markets in Latin America.","In the Pacific, the revenue environment remains challenging, with unit revenues down 9% during the peak resort market season on 4 points of lower capacity. Currency and fuel surcharges were a 14 point drag on unit revenue in the quarter. Specifically the end revenue headwind was $55 million net of hedges. As we've outlined previously, restructuring our Pacific network is one of our biggest opportunities for margin improvement going forward. We are pleased with the initial results we are achieving.","Our Narita hub margins expanded by 7 points, excluding hedges over the last 12 months and we have restored the hub to profitability. There is certainly more work to get to our targeted return levels but this an important milestone with the entity.","And we have taken the next step forward by making a $450 million investment in China Eastern and establishing a long-term commercial partnership. China Eastern is one of the largest Chinese airlines and the home carrier in Shanghai, the commercial capital of China. And this relationship will allow Delta to broaden its reach in Asia.","Now, looking ahead to the December quarter, we will continue to leverage opportunities in our network, while reducing capacity in areas most affected by currency, macro, and geopolitical uncertainties. Our domestic pretax margins improved 8 points ex-hedges to 22% in the September quarter, with our largest hubs delivering margins well above this level. As a result of the continued strong performance in the domestic market, we are planning for 3% growth in this region for the fourth quarter in line with how we see demand and economic growth in the U.S. Our domestic growth is focused on areas where past investments will now allow us to offer superior network, product, and service which is enhancing profitability and returns and driving the expansion in our domestic unit revenue premium to the industry.","We will reduce international capacity by 4.5% this quarter, with cuts of 20% or more in places like Japan, Brazil, Russia, and the Middle East, while we continue to invest in certain parts of our international network like Mexico and China.","The combination of domestic growth and international reductions will result in our capacity being flat at the system level for the fourth quarter and we expect these actions to help drive improvement in our unit revenue performance which we forecast will decline 2.5% to 4.5% for the December quarter. This forecast includes a 2 point headwind from currency. The quarter will be a bit choppy. November is expected to post the best monthly result and December the weakest due to the Thanksgiving holiday shift, with October somewhere in between.","This conservative growth profile in an environment where we expect fuel prices will be down by almost half demonstrates our commitment to getting RASM on a positive trajectory. While we said as the goal early this year to get RASM flat to positive by year-end, the continued low fuel price environment, and steeper FX headwinds have made achievement of our goal more challenging. In fact, fuel prices have declined 25% further from when we initially set this goal in early June. But it's still an important goal for our commercial team even if it happens on a slightly longer timeline. While we may say pressure for RASM for longer, we are getting significantly larger cost savings from fuel and therefore margin and cash flow benefits. So as a result we expect a record fourth quarter with an operating margin of 16% to 18%, up 4.5 points on a year-over-year basis.","Now, I will turn the call over to Paul to go through details on cost and cash flows.","Paul Jacobson","Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I will start by highlighting another strong cost performance at Delta this quarter. Lower fuel prices and strong cost controls contributed to a roughly $650 million decline in total operating expenses, despite 3% higher capacity.","Non-fuel CASM increased by 1% as we continue to benefit from our re-fleeting and cost reduction initiatives. The benefit accrual related to the recently announced pay increases for Delta employees created about a point of pressure that was not included in our initial outlook, but our performance remained consistent with our stated goal. We have built a good foundation for cost productivity and our up-gauging initiatives are creating operating leverage that will benefit us for years to come.","In fact, in 2008, our domestic gauge has increased from about 104 to 118 seats and we expect it will increase further over the next several years.","FX also benefitted non-fuel CASM by a little more than a point during the quarter. Looking ahead to the December quarter, we expect non-fuel CASM to be up about 2%, expenses related to the pay increases that go into effect on December 1 are creating about a point of pressure, while air national capacity reductions are also creating a temporary headwind for CASM as the cost takeout associated with these changes comes at a lag.","Turning to fuel, our total fuel expense declined by over $1 billion in the quarter; as well market fuel prices more than offset higher consumption. Our all-in fuel price was $1.80 per gallon down from $2.90 in the same period last year. We expect this will be below the industry average price for the quarter.","The refinery made a record $106 million profit this quarter, up from $19 million in the same period last year. Lower crude cost, a favorable crack spread environment, and increased throughput drove the refineries profit. Our average throughput at the refinery for the quarter was 200,000 barrels per day and we produced over 40,000 barrels per day of jet fuel at the plant.","For fourth quarter we are projecting a profit of approximately $30 million for the refinery, which would bring the full year contribution to $320 million. The moderation from 3Q profit levels is driven by typical seasonality in crack spread.","We currently expect our December quarter fuel expense will be $750 million lower year-over-year. Our December 2015 results are net of roughly $250 million in hedge losses.","At a $1.75 to $1.80 per gallon our fourth quarter fuel price will be $0.85 per gallon below last year's all-in fuel price and we expect again to be below the industry average. For the fourth quarter we are approximately 40% hedged against an increase in prices with approximately 70% downside participation to Brent prices of $40 per barrel.","Moving onto cash flow we are using our strong cash generation in a balanced, deliberate, and sustainable manner, to reinvest in the business for long-term, further strengthen the balance sheet, and return increasing levels of cash to shareholders.","This quarter we generated $2.4 billion of operating cash flow which provided us with an ability to fund a strategic investment in China Eastern, a partnership that will drive significant value overtime.","Capital spending for the third quarter was just over $1 billion including China Eastern and GOL strategic investments made during the quarter.","For the December quarter, we are projecting roughly $1 billion in CapEx also which consists of aircraft acquisition, fleet modification, and includes the purchase of the six pairs of slots at Heathrow that Ed mentioned earlier. Free cash flow during the third quarter was $1.4 billion of which 40% was returned to shareholders including $107 million of dividends and $425 million of buybacks. We expect to return roughly $500 million to shareholders again in the fourth quarter. That will bring us to roughly $2.5 billion in returns this year which equates to 7% of our current market cap and approximately 60% of our free cash flow. We continue to expect to return more than $6 billion through 2017, while also reducing debt to $4 billion while we continue to proactively fund our pension plan.","Adjusted net debt at the end of September was $6.4 billion and our debt reduction lowered interest expense by $33 million in the quarter relative to last year. We expect our debt to trend slightly higher in Q4 due to seasonality in cash but will end the year below $7 billion as we remain on track to hit our goal. The improvements in our balance sheet were recognized this quarter with upgrades from S&P and Fitch, which both now has Delta just one notch away from investment grade. That momentum allowed us in August to refinance our senior secured credit facility ahead of its scheduled maturity. The new borrowings included $1.5 billion undrawn revolver, a $500 million term loan, and a $500 million double EETC with a blended rate of 3.8%. Because of the improved strength of our balance sheet we were able to lower the overall rate we are paying on this debt, increase our revolver capacity by $275 million, and lowering the outstanding principle by $320 million as we continue to work towards our goals.","In closing, I'd like to thank the entire Delta family for another very strong quarter; this was achieved as a result of your contribution. Jill?","Jill Sullivan Greer","Thanks Richard, Ed, and Paul. And with that, Melody, we're ready for Q&A with the analysts, so if you could give them instructions on how to get into the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","We will go to Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew Didora","Hi, good morning everyone. I guess my first question, Ed can you maybe provide what your flat to up 2 capacity looks like next year broken out on a domestic and international basis? And then just from a domestic perspective are there any specific markets where this growth will be concentrated or any specific market or markets you plan to build out a larger presence in like you've done in Seattle this year?","Ed Bastian","Andrew we will provide more detail at our Investor Day in December on 2016 plans, obviously the shape of 2016 is following what you're seeing in the fourth quarter with domestic up in line with general economic growth in the U.S. and international down in the areas with the greatest FX and demand weakness.","Andrew Didora","Got it. And then just a follow-up for Paul. I guess at this level of flat to up 2% capacity do you still feel like you can keep unit cost growth at or below 2% next year outside of any new pilots agreement?","Paul Jacobson","Yes, we do Andrew, I think the capacity is going to put a little bit pressure on unit costs but given the productivity goals that we have and the continued benefits of the leverage that we're driving in the operation we feel good about our ability to hit that goal for the year.","Operator","We'll go next to Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi guys, thanks for taking the time. So may be first on the 2016 capacity guide, if I look at your first-quarter published flight schedules it looks like you've scheduled kind of 4% capacity growth or so. Would you expect a downward revision there or are you essentially just implying a very front-end loaded year?","Ed Bastian","That's very preliminary, Darryl. Yes we really haven't got it and made the final revisions to Q1 or for that matter any part of '16. And I just want to let you know; traditionally we've reduced the schedule as we get closer in.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then on the -- if I just look at the domestic unit revenue performance in the quarter, the down 3% number that you reported, if I were to just look at entirely domestic itineraries, would that number reflect a smaller decline because of the -- and is there an impact from essentially the accounting allocation of domestic connections on international itineraries that are weighing down the domestic number as reported?","Richard Anderson","There's a little bit less than 1 point of domestic itineraries that are related to the international O&D.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. So you're saying 1% of RASM headwind or 1% is kind of the mix?","Richard Anderson","Of the 3 points a little less than 1 point is international operational itinerary that's related to the FX change.","Darryl Genovesi","Great, thank you. And then if I could just squeeze one last one in for Paul, Paul, the comment that you made a few minutes ago about still seeing unit cost growth trending below 2% next year I assume that would be inclusive of profit sharing, is that correct?","Paul Jacobson","Yes, that's how we look at it. We'll have some geography changes in 2016. We'll highlight all that in Investor Day.","Operator","Our next question comes from comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning everybody and Richard you beat me to it. I thought I caught a new title for Jill in the opening remarks, so my congratulations there as well. A question for Glen. I do understand, I think we all understand the issues that are impacting international RASM. What I'm really having difficulty with is reconciling the domestic weakness. I mean, if you or I had been in a coma for five years and somebody just handed us the A4A revenue report or even your Q3 domestic RASM print, my first guess would be crap, we're in the recession again. But the fact is we aren't and other consumer sectors don't suggest this level of demand weakness. So what sort of explanation and you highlighted DPIJ in Darryl's question, but what further explanation can you provide as to why domestic RASM quite frankly stinks and more importantly what you think has to happen either at Delta or the industry level to improve upon it?","Glen Hauenstein","Yes, Jamie, as a rule we don't talk about the industry we talk about Delta. So I'll talk --what that is.","Jamie Baker","Sure, fair enough.","Glen Hauenstein","I think Ed highlighted in his comments that we see demand as strong and we see even business itinerary demand as strong, so closed end short stay travel and corporate contracted travel are all at record levels but we are not obtaining the yields that we had in the past. And I'll just leave it at that.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Second, not sure if this is for Ed or for Richard but and I know you don't tend to comment publicly on pilot negotiations, but when we think about profit sharing going forward what's management's tolerance for operating two succinct profit sharing schemes, one being more generous than the other? And also and I suppose I should know this but are the Air Canada 190s still up for grabs? The one that initially had been part of the fleet plan assuming a ratified TA?","Ed Bastian","And you asked and answered the first question which is we don't generally comment on the status of pilot negotiations. We respect the process and we respect the relationship. We're perfectly inclined to run two profit sharing programs. Our regular employees have been very pleased with 14.5% raise and I think we still have -- they'll still have one of the most if not well they'll still have the most lucrative profit sharing program in the industry. And so that's on the profit sharing and what was your second question?","Jamie Baker","Just whether the E190s, the Boeing\/Air Canada E190s are still up for grab. I think Boeing had made that part of your initial aircraft agreement.","Ed Bastian","I don\u2019t know whether they are or not.","Jamie Baker","Okay.","Ed Bastian","We had signed agreement with Boeing and when the TA was rejected we had the right to terminate it and then we terminated it and all the deposits were returned to Delta. And so you have to ask Boeing about what the status of those airplanes are.","Operator","We'll go next to Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. ","Julie Yates","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Last quarter I believe you guys called out three specific cities that were driving the bulk of the weakness in the domestic market. Is that yield weakness in Q3 still limited to a small number of markets or has it spread to be more broad-based?","Ed Bastian","Hi, Julie, it's, Ed. Yes, it's still relatively restricted. I would -- the commentary from the second quarter is consistent with the third quarter but it's still largely restricted yes.","Julie Yates","Okay. And then on the capacity you're pulling done internationally are those planes being retired or reallocated or is this a reduction primarily through utilization?","Glen Hauenstein","Combination of all of those. Some are being retired, some are getting lower utilization and some are moving into the domestic market place. For example, as United exits the JFK-LA and JFK San Francisco market, we are moving a couple of our wide bodies into fill out patterns in those key markets that are the largest markets in the United States.","Richard Anderson","But then on top of that Julie, we have 757s retiring. So we have a significant number of 757, 200s that are leaving the fleet.","Julie Yates","Okay, great. And then lastly any update on Open Skies with Brazil and Mexico and timing there. I think Brazil was supposed to happen sometime in October.","Richard Anderson","There is no update, we expect some time in 2016 to get those ratified.","Operator","Helane Becker with Cowen & Company has our next question.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, Operator. Hi guys, thank you very much for the time. Just two questions. One is can you comment at all on the type of competition you're seeing in some of your bigger cities like Atlanta and perhaps in LA specifically from low-fare airlines?","Richard Anderson","You know, Helane, let me go at it from a macro perspective which is we have record margins in all of our hubs in the U.S. and virtually every part of the domestic business is performing at new record levels or at above record levels and that includes Seattle and LA and New York and Minneapolis and Detroit and Cincinnati and Salt Lake and Atlanta. And on top of that the focus city flying we do in places like Raleigh-Durham and Indianapolis is performing extraordinarily well. I think what the marketplace misses is that we are able to keep, if just look at the revenue picture at Delta, our revenue is relatively flat year-to-year and we're putting two-thirds of the fuel savings on the bottom line for the owners.","And our focus is to manage the business for margin and cash flow. And we have a lot of leverage to do that. A fantastic product that no one in the industry can match, happy employees that are working very hard to be the best in the industry, a smart revenue management team, a very smart network planning team, the lowest capital cost in the industry on the fleet, and the maximum flexibility to manage our capacity to move back to positive RASM.","Helane Becker","So, Richard, thank you for that. I really appreciate your answer. And I kind of wonder at the fact that the market seems to continually miss the fact that you are delivering the best product in the industry and continues to ask what do you do for an encore, you continue to deliver yet your stock price doesn't reflect it.","Richard Anderson","Well actually our market cap does reflect it and our stock price does reflect it against the industry. I think our next closest domestic peer has a market cap it's $10 billion lower. And when you look at where the P -- the forward P is where our opportunity is, is to continue to derisk the balance sheet, derisk our business model, have the best employee relations in the industry, investment grade balance sheet, and continue to move our P\/E up to match our performance versus the S&P Industrials and we're going to quietly continue to do that.","Helane Becker","That's great. Thank you. Thanks very much for your help.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Linenberg","Yes, hey, good morning everybody. Hey, I just, I want to go back to in the non-op area some of your investments. I believe you account for Virgin Atlantic under the equity method. Can you just may be give us a feel for how much better that's running this year versus last year? And then just with the changes in your investments in some of these other carriers are they still accounted for as investments or say like a goal are you going to run that through under the equity method given your Board seat and your increased ownership stake?","Ed Bastian","Hi, Mike, it's Ed. On Virgin, the Q3 results they had were fairly comparable to what they had a year ago, little bit better. They had some fairly large fuel hedging losses, so they haven't gotten as much of the pass-through on the lower fuel savings. But we expect that's going to get increasingly better next year.","And the answer to your second question is no, we treat the China Eastern and GOL and Aeromexico investments still on the cost method. So we don't take the share profit or loss in the quarter.","Mike Linenberg","Good. And then just one other and this is either for Ed or Paul. Your earnings progression has been fantastic on one hand. On the other hand it does get you closer to the point where you will start paying cash taxes. When I look at sort of where the numbers are in our forecast for next year it seems like sometime next year you may be a cash taxpayer may be in the latter part of the year. Is that right or do we still have enough NOLs that may be we get into 2017? What's your thoughts on that?","Paul Jacobson","Hi, good morning, Mike, it's Paul.","Mike Linenberg","Hey, Paul.","Paul Jacobson","Go back to what we have talked about in May when we laid out our long-term plan, we anticipate that we will have some cash taxes until 2017 at our current trajectory but wouldn't become a full payer until 2018. That's consistent and you've got to be careful with the differences between GAAP and tax accounting for big areas like depreciation on fleet et cetera.","Richard Anderson","Let Mike -- let me -- we're going to update at Investor Day on our tax rate going forward in 2016 and this is another differentiator for Delta that goes back to our international focus and our minority investments, equity investments around the world in our joint venture strategies. We can have an advantage tax position versus our domestic competitors and we're going to update that at our Investor Day in December.","Mike Linenberg","Great. Looking forward to it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David Fintzen","Hey, good morning everyone. A question for Glen. On the international side particularly Pacific obviously there's currency, there's probably demand as you highlighted, there's also surcharges that in some cases had to come out really quick. As you start to overlap that and you get into '16, do some of that surcharge revenue can you take that back into base pricing as you go a long? Or is that something we should just think is sort of gone until oil comes back?","Glen Hauenstein","Well we have the currency headwinds which will as forward curves go from about $700 million this year to about $150 million next year. And then, as fuel stabilizes, we will of course attempt to raise fares as we always do but that will depend on what the market is and that's based on individual market performance. So we see strong demand, we see strong demand through the winter and into the spring already, and our load factors are running ahead in every entity including domestic throughout rest of the year. So hopefully who knows what's going to happen in the future but it looks like it's shaping up to be pretty good year in '16.","David Fintzen","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just in terms of the 4Q RASM guidance would you be willing to split that kind of domestic international or at least kind of speak to does the decline in moderate kind of reasonably evenly across different segments or entities? Or is there something that really stands out particularly, does domestic inflect as much?","Glen Hauenstein","We're not going to break that out, David. We never do but you see that the trends that we've seen this year and you probably can draw your own conclusions.","Operator","We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, thanks for the time. I just wanted to come back to your capacity guide and may be just better understand what factors we should look at to get you to may be a higher end or the lower end of that this year too and whether it's PRASM or margin in the economy? Just some color there would be great.","Richard Anderson","All of the above.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay, easy enough. Then I guess a related question to that, to the extent as we look into next year demand starts to really weaken, et cetera, be it the economy or otherwise how aggressive do you think you could be with pulling down capacity just to keep supply demand balance?","Richard Anderson","Look, I mean, we stay focused on margin and margin expansion and free cash flow we have many levers to drive those factors in our -- or those outcomes in our business. One of the things that we're fortunate at Delta in addition to having the most reliable fleet when we only cancelled 18 flights in the month of September tells you a lot about the fleet that we operate at the same time that we have a lot of paid-for airplanes. And the lever that we have in the business is that paid-for airplane if you decide to put 757 down it also becomes a parts depot for the rest of the fleet. So you not only have a good lever from the standpoint managing capacity it's also a non-fuel CASM play.","Rajeev Lalwani","Great. Thank you.","Richard Anderson","We have plenty of those -- we have optionality, we like optionality across our business. And so we view our fleet the same way as they're optional, many of those assets are optional assets.","Operator","We'll go next to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks, good morning. Paul, I wanted to ask you about hedging. Have you started adding positions into 2016 and can you tell us what the hedge loss you're baking in for the fourth quarter fuel guide and what the magnitude of the losses are at this point into 2016?","Paul Jacobson","Hey, good morning, Duane thanks for the question. As we talked about we are only about 5% hedged for 2016. We obviously have taken this environment and been very cautious and slow about it as we look into to the year. We said in our prepared remarks that we got about $250 million of losses in the fourth quarter but about 70% to 80% downside participation all the way down to $40 a barrel in Brent.","So as we go into 2016 obviously we have a tailwind behind us on fuel price because of the hedge losses in the first half of this year. But we're pretty cautious on where we go given the forward curve and the option premiums that you have to spend and put hedges on right now.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay and then may be just a different tack on the same question regarding your desire to control input costs. Have you evaluated expanding your presence in the energy industry beyond just owning a refinery? Have you looked at any potential domestic production assets?","Richard Anderson","No, we haven't.","Operator","Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Hey, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on some of the 2016 capacity questions. Is it fair to assume just given the current environment that domestic capacity growth would be similar to 2015 and 2016?","Glen Hauenstein","I think it's early to comment on the intricacies of what 2016 turns out to be and I think what Richard pointed to earlier is the flexibility that this company has to respond to market demands as they evolve. And so I think we will give more color as what we think in December as we get to our Investor Day Conference. But we are always moving airplanes around or grounding them or whatever it takes to achieve our margin expansion that we need to. And while we like to say we have a full vision as to what next year's economy is going to be we don't. And so what we can say is we think it's 0 to 2 for next year as we sit down today and we will make those adjustments as we get closer into it capitalize on where we see opportunities.","Richard Anderson","I think the thing that people don't have a full appreciation for just how rapidly we adjust to markets. And if you even just think out about 2015 and what we said we were going to do in December of '14, in fourth quarter 2015, situations change, currencies got weak in Brazil, currency got weak in Japan, fuel surcharges ran off, sanctions in Russia, and we've responded very quickly. And that's the wonderful thing about what these assets are. If you own a hotel in Manhattan and something doesn't go well in Manhattan and you can't move the hotel? Right. But we can take our frequencies in Venezuela down to one a week and we could take Russia down to one a week and you don't see all those moves, but the reason why we have ever expanding margins is at some point the Street just needs to understand that we're going to continue to manage the business to drive margin and free cash flow and we have a lot of leverage to do that.","Savi Syth","Good plan. Just specifically on the fuel side I know you mentioned that two-thirds of the fuel declines have been captured to the bottom-line. I wonder if that's despite your kind of fuel hedge drag and is it your contention that may be if you didn't have the fuel hedge drag you'd still be able to have a similar capture and so may be the fare environment is may be stronger than that two-thirds would imply?","Ed Bastian","Savi, it's Ed. I wouldn't try to draw any correlations to the fuel hedge. The two-thirds we're looking at was really the current quarter the September quarter we did. We had modest hedge losses. It wasn't material and compared to the first two quarters anyway. And you also have to take into account that two-thirds is a bit of a macro estimate, it's much higher on the domestic, I think domestic we were probably capturing 80% to 90% of the fuel savings. But internationally because of the currency weakness as well as demand weakness that's limiting our ability to capture as much as the fuel. So in total it's about two-thirds but very high domestically which is where we're growing and it's weaker internationally which is where we're shrinking.","Savi Syth","Okay, that's very helpful. And if I could just ask one last one, on the regional fleet I know we saw the complaint filed again Republic. Should we be concerned with the impact of securing regional fee on kind of capacity plans or costs?","Richard Anderson","No, you shouldn't be -- we're not going to comment specifically on the litigation but you shouldn't be concerned about that. We just like our partners to keep their deals.","Jill Sullivan Greer","And Melody, we're going to have time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","Thank you. That will be from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Sam McKelvey","Hi, it's Sam McKelvey on for Joe DeNardi. What sort of pressure is the Gulf carrier issue having on your relationship with Air France-KLM? Are they wanting to add more capacity onto the Atlantic than you view is necessary to offset some of the share they are losing in other markets?","Richard Anderson","Well first our relationship with Air France-KLM couldn't be better. Our combined margins in the Transatlantic couldn't be better in terms of the cut we're setting all time contribution margins in that joint venture.","And it's by far the model of joint ventures in the world. We don't, as Glen said earlier, we're not commenting yet other than zero to two on our network and we're still building our business plan, we will give more color about what our forward capacity is. But in terms of our relationship with Air France-KLM I mean we're tightly synced in our operations, capacity planning, and distribution.","Jill Sullivan Greer","That's going to conclude the analyst portion of the phone call. Before I turn it over to Kevin and the corp comm team just to have everybody save the date for December 17 for our Annual Investor Day and with that I will turn it over for the media unit.","Kevin Shinkle","Good morning. I'm Kevin Shinkle, our Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Welcome to the media portion of our call. We have about 10 minutes to ask questions. So please limit yourself to one question and one brief follow-up. Melody, could you please try to give any instructions on how to register to ask a question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","We'll go to Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News.","Michael Sasso","Good morning. Yes, I had there's kind of the rumor mill has been hot lately about Delta looking at some 777s coming out of Singapore. Can you just talk about that and is there any truth to that?","Richard Anderson","Yes, I'd be glad to. Well we're seeing a huge bubble in excess wide-body airplanes around the world and we've been approached by more than one party. I mean the market appears to be the 777-200s about 9 to 10 years old the price is about $10 million. And on A330-200 the lease rate is about a fifth of what it would be new.","So we do think that the aircraft market is going to be right for Delta and over the course of the next 12 to 36 months and we think that that weakness in that aircraft bubble in wide-bodies is going to spread to narrow-bodies and that there will be some huge buying opportunities because low interest rates really have created a huge wide-body bubble in the world.","Singapore Airlines, I think has 70 of these airplanes that are coming off lease or being retired that are 8 to 10 years old.","Michael Sasso","Just a follow-up. So is there a deal with actually in the works or recently completed for?","Richard Anderson","There's no deal on the works we just -- it's a relatively small market in the world right there is not many people in the world that can take a dozen 777s, right, there's a handful of customers. It's a very small market, it's a very transparent market, and we get calls all the time. There is no deal. Prices are going to get lower; you wouldn't strike a deal now.","Operator","We'll go next to Edward Russell with Flightglobal.","Edward Russell","Hi yes. You mentioned the acquisition of six slot pairs at London Heathrow and looking at your schedules in 2016 at here and in Salt Lake City. Could you give some insight on to how well you plan to use those new slot pairs?","Richard Anderson","We already operate in slot pairs. ","Edward Russell","A follow-up then, there is replacing slot that you have lease agreements coming up on or?","Richard Anderson","The slots that we have leased previously for a number of years for Air France-KLM that we're just turning that we're purchasing instead of leasing. We will have more flexibility to slot them around with our partners at Virgin Atlantic.","Operator","David Koenig with The Associated Press has our next question.","David Koenig","Hi, thanks. I have a parochial question this time. We're waiting for a ruling in the Dallas Love Field litigation and I wonder whether you think if there's an adverse ruling or whatever ruling winds up would have it have an precedent setting affect that other gate or slot restrained airports or the -- the terms and situations so unique in Dallas that it would not.","Richard Anderson","No. If Love Field is such an anomaly if you just step back and think about it, the city of Dallas is -- will be the first time in modern aviation that an airport and interstate commerce where the operators trying to evict and interstate commerce operator. I think it\u2019s actually the opposite and it won't have any effect.","Operator","We'll go next to Sheryl Jean with Dallas Morning News.","Sheryl Jean","Hi, I have a similar question along those lines at Dallas Love Fields. Can you give any insight into whether you're planning to appeal if the judge in that case does make an adverse ruling for Delta?","Peter Carter","This is Peter Carter. We would intend to appeal any adverse ruling.","Richard Anderson","And we still have administrative actions in front of the Federal Aviation Administration to revoke AIP grants in the PFCs they collect.","Sheryl Jean","Thank you.","Richard Anderson","You're welcome.","Kevin Shinkle","Well, thank you.

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode until we conduct a question and answering session following today\u2019s presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations.","Jill Sullivan Greer ","Here in Atlanta today we have Richard Anderson our CEO, Ed Bastian our President, and Paul Jacobson, our CFO, and we have the remainder of the leadership team here in the room with us for Q&A. Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and cash flows. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow up.","Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. ","You\u2019ll find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the investor relation\u2019s page at ir.Delta.com. With that, I will turn the call over to Richard.","Richard H. Anderson ","This morning Delta reported a $1 billion pretax profit for the December quarter with EPS of $0.77 which beat consensus of $0.75. We grew the top line 6% despite a fuel price decline of 14%. Delta expanded margins by over four points. For 2014 we generated a $4.5 billion pretax profit, an increase of 70% over 2013. Revenues grew for the full year by 7% and we expanded our operating margin by four points to 13.1%. Our ROIC was 20.7%. ","We generated $5.8 billion of operating cash flow and $3.7 billion of free cash flow and returned $1.35 billion of cash to our owners. Delta was the sixth best performing stock in the S&P 500 with a 79% gain. In two years we have increased our market cap by $30 billion. Our $3.7 billion of free cash flow was better than 90% of the S&P Industrials and Delta has the third highest free cash flow yield of the S&P Industrials. ","These results include over $1 billion of profit sharing for our employees equal to more than 16% of their 2014 pay. We are proud of that at Delta and I want to thank the entire Delta team for their hard work that is the reason why we were successful in 2014. We ran the best operation in the global aviation industry with 95 days of no main line cancellations, a completion factor of 99.8% and an on time rate of 85% excluding the onetime impacts of the winter storms in 1Q of \u201814. ","Remarkably, Delta had only 414 main line maintenance cancellations for all of 2014, a number that our competitors sometimes exceed in a single month. That operational excellence, along with investments we\u2019ve made in products and services drove increases in our customer satisfaction with our domestic net promotor score increasing more than two points to 33%. High customer sat translates into a revenue premium as customers have showed a willingness to pay for high quality service.","For 2014 we generated 107% of industry average revenues across the system and a 113% domestic RASM premium. We continually obtain efficiency and productivity which caused roughly flat non-fuel costs year-on-year in 2014. These factors combined to produce a $1.9 billion increase in our pretax profit for 2014. This profitability translated into strong cash flows which produced $6 billion of operating cash flow and allowed $2.1 billion of capital investments. ","We used a portion of that to strengthen our balance sheet reducing our net debt to $7.3 billion. Our stronger balance sheet has been recognized by rating agencies as we are just two notches away from investment grade. We run the company on investment grade metrics and strive to obtain investment grade ratings. We are exceeding our long term shareholder commitments. Our long term op margin goal is 11% to 14%, we achieved 13.1%. ","EPS growth long term goal is 10% to 15%, we achieved 70% growth on a pretax basis. Our ROIC goal is 15% to 18%, we hit 20.7%. Our free cash flow goal was $3 billion, we hit $3.7 billion. We make decisions in the business for the long term. We\u2019re focused and disciplined. We manage our capacity, capital, and costs tightly. We drive high ROIC. We\u2019re focused on growing free cash flow and raising cash shareholder returns. We believe these are the most important metrics for large cap long term equity owners. Our top line growth is strong which is driven by operational and service excellence. We have increased our earnings by $3 billion since 2012 and generated $6.5 billion in free cash flow over that time. We expect to significantly improve on this performance in 2015. ","There\u2019s a tremendous opportunity in front of us from lower fuel prices. We will drive these savings to the bottom line with strong revenue growth and yield preservation regardless of fuel prices. At current fuel prices, we expect to capture over $2 billion in fuel savings benefit in 2015 net of our hedges. If fuel remains at these levels we are set up to fully participate in recent fuel declines during 2016. In addition, our hedge book provides excellent protection should fuel rise from current levels. ","We will use the decline in fuel prices as an opportunity to accelerate progress towards our long term goals. Fuel will remain volatile in 2015. We are not making any changes to our 2015 capacity plan in light of the lower fuel prices. In fact, we continue to trim capacity on the margin to maintain yields and our RASM premium. Between fuel savings and the benefits of our revenue initiatives, we expect to produce a significant pretax profit increase in 2015. These higher earnings should translate into growing free cash flow which will be allocated between strengthening the balance sheet and returning cash to our owners.","Our top priority continues to be paying down debt. We expect to have our adjusted net debt below $6 billion by the end of this year and achieve a $5 billion target next year. We will contribute over $9 billion - $900 million to our pension plans this year which marks the third year of excess contributions to the plan to address that obligation. We will accelerate our capital returns to our owners with a minimum of $1.5 billion in dividends and buy backs this year. We will complete our repurchase authorization by the end of 2015, a full year ahead of schedule.","Similar to the past two years, we will update you on our capital deployment plans in May after our board of directors completes its annual strategic plan review in the spring meeting of 2015. As we discussed at our investor day last month, our work lies in continuing to build a durable industrial company with strong financial performance throughout the cycle. We\u2019re making great progress. We\u2019ve got the right people and the right strategies to continue to do so.","Delta today has the fourth lowest PE of the S&P Industrials so there is much opportunity ahead. The operating environment for Delta and the overall industry in the US is remarkably good. Carbon price declines are a huge benefit to the overall US economy. In addition, the US is experiencing a pilot shortage at the regionals caused by the 1,500 hour rule and the long term hiring trends at the majors. At Delta the large size of the airline requires 12 to 18 months of advanced planning to significantly change our capacity plans. The same is true across the industry.","These jet fuel savings are enormous and we are diligent at maintaining those savings for the bottom line. In high level conceptual terms at Delta, the first quarter is a good indicator of the macro trends for 2015. We expect to keep our RASM and non-fuel CASM about flat in 1Q. Capacity growth will be about 5% but just 3% net of last year\u2019s weather. With fewer airplanes and fewer departures with revenues growing 7% fuel savings will go to the bottom line which will set up for a very strong 1Q and these trends in 1Q bode well for all of 2015. ","Thanks for your support and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed who will detail our strategies and commercial initiatives.","Edward H. Bastian ","For the December quarter our pretax income increased $474 million year-over-year to just over $1 billion. Our net income was $649 million or $0.78 per share which was generally in line with consensus of $0.77. We expanded our operating margin by more than 400 basis points to 12.6%. Our results for the quarter include $262 million in profit sharing expense which brings the total for the year to $1.1 billion. ","2014 was a fantastic year on all fronts and it will be an honor to be able to reward the Delta team come profit sharing day for driving industry leading operational, customer service, and financial results. These results have led Delta to be the second best performing stock in the S&P 500 over the last two years. Hats off to our 80,000 strong. ","We had solid revenue performance growing the top line against a back drop of significantly lower fuel prices. Passenger revenues increased 4.6% on 3.7% higher capacity. 2014 has been a strong year in corporate sales with our corporate revenues increasing 7%. We saw the strongest performance this year in the financial services, media, and automotive sectors. This corporate sales growth was a key factor in driving our New York hub to profitability.","In our most recent Ford Corporate Travel Survey, 88% of our customers anticipate increasing or at least maintaining travel spend in Q1 and over the balance of 2015. We also saw good traction with our ancillary and merchandising revenues which increased by 16% for the quarter. Our first class paid load factor increased by six points to 49% and we did that off a base of 8% more first class seats than last year. Our revenues for our premium economy product comfort plus, increased by 18% and we\u2019re now generating an annual incremental revenue stream of roughly $350 million. Passenger unit revenues grew 1% with our strongest performance in the domestic entity. ","International faced headwinds from the dollar\u2019s strength versus both the Euro and the Yen, which combined with the impact of our service reduction to Venezuela, impacted revenues by $60 million and lowered system unit revenues by about 6.6 points. Domestic unit revenues increased nearly 3% on 3.6% higher capacity. We\u2019re especially pleased with our performance in New York and Seattle which have built good momentum as we\u2019ve been upgaging the domestic fleet and investing in our networks, products, and facilities in those two cities. Seattle\u2019s domestic unit revenue grew 6% on 33% higher capacity. ","In the Trans-Atlantic unit revenues declined slightly on 2% higher capacity. Our best performance was to Europe especially, Amsterdam and Paris where our joint venture with Air France [indiscernible] helped produced unit revenue increases above the entity average. We continue to face headwinds in Africa, the Middle East, and Russia which pressured European entity unit revenues by more than two points despite 13% capacity reductions in those markets.","Our joint venture with Virgin Atlantic continues to perform well with an 800 basis point margin improvement in the quarter on 2% increase in capacity. Our Latin unit revenues declined 4% on 15% higher capacity but nearly all of the unit revenue decline was driven by our capacity reduction into Venezuela. Our investments in Latin America are paying off as we had strong performance in Mexico and Brazil. Our commercial partnerships with Aero Mexico and Gulf are driving higher yielding traffic onto our core business markets. Those two carriers accounted for $35 million in incremental revenue for the quarter. ","In the Pacific our unit revenues declined 5% on slightly lower capacity as the entity continues to see pressure from the weakened Yen. Net of hedges, the Yen reduced revenue by $31 million and pressured unit revenues by four of those five points. Since we\u2019ve began down gaging the 747s and restructuring our Narita hub, we have already seen nearly $25 million improvement on our Tokyo routes in Q4. ","Turning to guidance, Richard made an important point earlier, the focus of the commercial team is to continue to grow revenues as we seek to drive the fuel savings to the bottom line. We are seeing some continuing pressure on international unit revenues from the stronger dollar and lower fuel surcharges. In the domestic market demand and revenues remain solid. We are forecasting our March quarter revenues to increase about 7% with RASM roughly flat on 5% higher capacity. That forecast includes about a point of unit revenue pressure and two points of capacity growth from last year\u2019s winter storm so schedule-over-schedule our capacity will be up roughly 3%.","The storm impact will also affect the monthly RASM op ex. We expect our January RASM will be the lowest performer with monthly results progressively improving as we move through the quarter. Our revenue growth combined with $0.50 to $0.60 in lower fuel prices and solid non-fuel costs productivity should result in an operating margin of 11% to 13%. This is a 400 basis point improvement compared to last March\u2019s quarter and a 500 basis point improvement on pre-tax earnings.","Looking ahead, we face about $300 million of revenue headwinds in 2015 from the stronger dollar, close to a full point of RASM but we have a number of revenue initiatives that give us confidence that we can not only overcome that pressure but continue to grow revenues through the year. First, we\u2019re continuing to make adjustments to our network to improve our revenue and our margins. While we will make incremental capacity additions in New York, Seattle, and Los Angeles this year, we are also focused on tactically adjusting the gage and frequency of flying to better match demand including, deciding this week to take 1.5 points out of our domestic schedule starting in March.","In Latin America, our growth will tail off in the back half of the year. We are already seeing benefits in those markets as our capacity additions have matured and we expect to see that momentum build as we go through 2015. We will also benefit as we begin to lap the impact of our Venezuelan reductions later this year. In the Pacific, we continue to restructure our network in light of continued pressure from the weakened Yen. This will take a couple of years as we retire the 747s and back fill a portion of that flying with new smaller gaged aircraft. However, we expect to make good progress in 2015 as we will retire five additional 747s which will reduce capacity into Japan by 15%.","Second, we have strong opportunity in our joint venture and our investment with Virgin Atlantic which we expect to produce $200 million of benefit this year alone. We just celebrated the first anniversary of our joint venture and we are gaining familiarity and expertise as we cooperate on pricing, scheduling, and capacity decisions. Delta and Virgin combined will increase our US to Heathrow capacity by 10% in 2015. Our increased service to London Heathrow, a key market that Delta didn\u2019t serve just a few years ago, has been a stronger driver of the momentum we\u2019ve seen in our corporate sales growth.","A third focus for our commercial team is rolling out our branded fair initiatives. Our basic economy product is already in over 75 markets and is producing strong results as we continue to expand it into additional domestic and Latin markets. Finally, we\u2019ve changed SkyMiles from a distance based program to a spend based program. This change should drive higher revenues from a stronger customer loyalty as we put rewards into our most valuable customers and we are already receiving positive feedback from them.","We were also able to translate the value of our frequent flyer program into improved terms in a new agreement we reached with American Express which we announced last month. That new agreement which went into effect on January the 1st is expected to delivery several hundred million in higher revenues to Delta this year through a 15% improvement in terms.","2014 was another excellent year on all fronts and we expect that 2015 will be even better. Again, thanks to our 80,000 Delta colleagues for their contributions to another successful year. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul who will take you through the details on cost and cash flow performance.","Paul A. Jacobson ","Consistent cost control was again a significant contributor to our 400 basis points of margin expansion this quarter. Total operating expenses increased by $135 million driven entirely by higher profit sharing expenses. We were once again, able to hold non fuel CASM essentially flat in each quarter of 2014 and this quarter marks the sixth consecutive quarter of non-fuel CASM growth below 2% as we are continuing to see the benefits of our upgaging initiatives and lower maintenance expense due to the 50 seat retirements.","There is tremendous commitment across the entire organization to continue to achieve our goal of cost growth consistently below 2% and we expect that momentum to continue through this year and into 2016. This year we took delivery of 84 aircraft and retired 89 aircraft which included 60 50 seaters. We improved our operating leverage through upgaging generating 2% higher domestic capacity for the year on 3.9% fewer departures, all while the operational team delivered the lowest maintenance CASM in the industry with the best operational reliability. ","As we progress through 2015 we will continue to see the benefits from upgaging. The retirement of 50 seaters and older main line aircraft, as well as the benefits of productivity improvements across the organization. ","Moving onto fuel, fuel expense declined by $342 million for the quarter, driven by the sharp decline in market fuel prices. Our all in fuel price was $2.62 per gallon which was $0.43 lower year-over-year. Our results this quarter included $180 million in settled hedged losses which were offset by $105 million profit at the refinery. At December 31st we had $925 million in hedge margin posted with counterparties which we suspect will be substantially reduced by June 30 based on current prices. Based on current prices, we are projecting an all in fuel price of $2.45 to $2.50 per gallon for the March quarter.","For the full year we are forecasting an all-in price of $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon which is approximately $0.50 to $0.60 lower than 2014. These lower prices should produce over $2 billion in lower fuel expense including hedges. For 2016 we are well positioned for full downside participation should fuel remain at these levels.","As I mentioned, the refinery made $105 million profit for the December quarter which represents $151 million improvement versus last year. Lower crude costs combined with higher product crack spreads and increased throughput were key contributors to the refinery\u2019s heightened profitability this quarter. Our already strong cash flow will further benefit from the low fuel price environment which will allow us to continue our progress in strengthening the balance sheet by paying down debt, funding our pension plan, and continuing to return cash to our owners.","This year, we generated $5.8 billion of operating cash flow and reinvested $2.1 billion back into the business primarily related to aircraft modifications and purchases of the CRJ 900 and 737 900s which are replacing the 50 seaters and older 757 aircraft. For the March quarter we are projecting $700 million in cap ex primarily related to 737 900 deliveries and deposits on future aircraft.","With the $3.7 billion of free cash flow that we generated in 2014, we were able to reduce our adjusted net debt down to $7.3 billion. This reduction in adjusted net debt represents a $2.1 billion decrease compared to the same time last year and delivered $200 million in interest savings year-over-year. We expect another $200 million in interest expense savings in 2015 from continued debt reduction. Additionally, we continued our path of increasing shareholder value by returning $1.35 billion to shareholders through $251 million of dividends and $1.1 billion of share repurchases that retired over 28 million shares for the year. ","Moving into 2015 we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow during the March quarter. As Ed and Richard mentioned, we will continue to grow free cash flow throughout the year which will go towards completing the $2 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of 2015, a full year ahead of schedule and towards paying down additional debt. We\u2019ll update you in May our further capital deployment plans. ","Our long term goals remain at the forefront of how we manage our business. We will continue to prudently reinvest in the business on investments that align with our return on invested capital goal, pay down debt, and return value to our shareholders. In closing, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire Delta team for a record breaking year. We have a special family here and our performance this quarter and throughout the year are a direct result of the contributions made by each and every one of us. Thanks and I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jill.","Jill Sullivan Greer ","That is the wrap up of our prepared remarks. Operator, if you could give the instructions for the analysts to ask their questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Fintzen with Barclays Capital.","David Fintzen","A quick question on the pilot comments, when you look around the world are there a substantial number of Americans still flying outside of the US? Could this tightness in pilots start to show up not in the US but outside the US as pilots start to come home that would potentially like to?","Richard H. Anderson ","I don\u2019t know David. My remarks were focused on what the US industry faces today with a pretty significant shortage building in the regional space and that\u2019s exacerbated by the fact that you have, at the majors, a significant wave of retirements over the next decade just because of demographics and it\u2019s pretty much the same at all the carriers so there\u2019s a big pull from the majors, and the 1,500 hour rule is really affecting the ability of the regionals to be able to attract a significant number of new pilots. So, it\u2019s really an effect on the US industry as we see it.","David Fintzen","On the infrastructure sort of in place to train pilots as you\u2019re sort of coming through that attrition I mean, is that a limiting factor as well or is there sort of ample training facilities to kind of roll through pilots?","Richard H. Anderson ","Well, I can speak for Delta. Delta has more than ample training facilities at Delta to run a first rate training operation and I think in the broader industry there is too, the question is the regulatory requirement on 1,500 hours. ","Operator","Your next question comes from William Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William Greene","I think you guys are probably getting this question at lot as well which is I think a lot of investors think about fuel as creating a windfall. I realize you\u2019re going to try to keep as much of it as possible but can you take a little bit about insofar as you start to hit some of these targets sooner than expected, do the priorities you outlined at the investor day in terms of what to do with this cash so if we did get a bit of an extraordinary windfall that wasn\u2019t persistent, how do you think about what to do with that cash? What are the orders of uses in that sense?","Richard H. Anderson ","Well, I think the first order of use is going to continue to reduce our net debt and the second order of use is going to be higher cash returns for our owners. Now, that\u2019s subject to our Board approval and I\u2019ve got to be careful about not getting to far out there before going through the five year plan. But, our fleet can run at this level of CapEx very easily for a very long period of time on our fleet so we don\u2019t see some big fleet order coming. We think there\u2019s going to be an opportunity for a bunch of used airplanes for us at some point here giving all the NEO deliveries in the narrow body world. We just placed our wide body order, we\u2019re fine on wide bodies so the fleets in good shape and the run rate cap ex that you saw this year, the $2.1, that vicinity is a good run rate because we\u2019ve got to keep our ROIC above that 18% so it\u2019s going to reduce debt and higher shareholder cash returns.","William Greene","Then Richard, when you think about fuel and what you should use to underwrite in a five year plan or even a one year plan, what fuel price do you use? I guess where I\u2019m getting at is if fuel were to jump back up do you have to adjust to that or are you really operating at a much higher fuel price so there wouldn\u2019t be a change at Delta even at higher fuel prices?","Richard H. Anderson ","We actually use pretty high fuel prices in all of our planning and this was a shared experience with Ed and I, we\u2019ve learned this over the years that planning with a low fuel price will only disappoint and planning with a high fuel price if you end up being wrong and the fuel price is lower, you\u2019ll be pleased. But it\u2019s really important when you\u2019re planning an airline over the long term, or making a 30 year MPV decision on buying an airplane to use a very high fuel price otherwise you\u2019re not going to get an ROIC and a free cash flow number that you\u2019re going to like. ","Paul, our fuel price for our assumption for our budget was $2\u2026?","Paul A. Jacobson ","$2.82.","Richard H. Anderson ","$2.82 even though we knew it was going to be lower. But that way you plan the capacity on a much more muted basis and you make sure that you put the strategies in place to hold yield and RASM.","William Greene","So, insofar as fuel went back up you wouldn\u2019t need to make any adjustments I assume, or is that not the right way to think about it?","Richard H. Anderson ","Well, if fuel goes back up remember, it takes a lot to make a capacity adjustments at an airline of this size. We have 12,000 airplanes so 1% of 12,000 airplanes is 12 airplanes, there\u2019s eight crews per airplane. You\u2019ve got to get all those people hired, and trained, and the flight attendants, and we tend to be on the conservative side, because we don\u2019t want to over shoot on capacity or expense because if you\u2019re adding fixed expense you better be certain you\u2019re going to get a return on it. So, bottom line is it\u2019s always a really conservative approach to how you plan and you should always plan with fuel prices high. We\u2019ve seen this movie many times in the industry and so you\u2019ve got to run the company conservatively and we\u2019re trimming capacity as we speak as we get close into the beginning of the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Kim from Goldman Sachs.","Tom Kim","I just wanted to ask with regard to the level of competition out there. Obviously, this industry is always competitive, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re beginning to see any signs or indication that competition within the domestic market might be increasing at all?","Edward H. Bastian ","No, we don\u2019t see any signs of that right now.","Tom Kim","Then I guess just with Lat Am and the Pacific obviously, you guys have been flagging this very well, I\u2019m curious is this more of a demand side issue, or is it really supply side, or a combination of the two? Then, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re seeing any signs of inflection in these markets but I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts in terms of whether there is any supply side response largely from the overseas carriers to actually suggest we could see possibly a pleasant surprise with regard to the Lat Am and Pacific markets more specifically?","Paul A. Jacobson ","If you think about our fourth quarter, four of the five points in Pacific year-over-year decline were based on yen currency. We\u2019ve seen really unprecedented decline in the yen. Despite that, we think that we will be profitable in our Japanese operation in 2015 and so if you think about as we continue to restructure and become less reliant on Japan, we were very pleased with the one point decline which means that there was a lot of core strength in a period of the year. It is not really peak demand.","Operator","Your next question comes from Helane Becker \u2013 Cowen & Company.","Helane Becker","I thought I heard that you said you were thinking about reducing domestic capacity growth in March and I was just kind of wondering would the thought process there is that that you\u2019re not seeing demand in those markets, or are you concerned about demand in those markets, or what\u2019s the thought behind that?","Richard H. Anderson ","We\u2019ve been taking a very prudent yield strategy and clearly we have our advanced yields in the domestic network up significantly over the next several months and so as we came through January and saw the actual demand patterns of these higher yields, we took some capacity out. That\u2019s just a normal business process and it doesn\u2019t say anything about core demand.","Helane Becker","But do the yields then? Do the yield outlooks say something about the demand outlook?","Richard H. Anderson ","The yield outlook is very positive and we would like to keep it there and so we\u2019re adjusting the lower demand flights downwards.","Edward H. Bastian ","Just to be clear, we\u2019re still going to be growing domestic, we\u2019re just reducing some of the growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Two questions, just a follow up on Helane\u2019s question Ed, I think the forecast was 3% domestic growth for 2015. If we incorporate the contemplated adjustments at the end of March or starting in March, where does domestic shake out? Is that more closer to 2% for the year?","Edward H. Bastian ","It\u2019s too early to say, we\u2019re in a calibration. As we have always said, as we get into the year we start to make tactical adjustments. Somewhere in the 2% to 3% range is probably still pretty good guidance.","Michael Linenberg","Then just my second question, I believe there\u2019s been a decision made to at least not retire one of the 747s that was going out in the fourth quarter, it looks like it\u2019s going to be back in the schedule starting, I think, in May? How much of the lower fuel price played a factor in that decision, and if it did, are there other sub fleets where maybe it makes sense to fly those aircraft a little bit longer, maybe potentially put back on the order book a bit? Are there opportunities out there or are those decisions not made until you see fuel prices down at this level on a sustained basis?","Glen W. Hauenstein ","We did retire all the airplanes that we had contemplated. The activation of the 74 was a swap so it was not a net new airplane to the system and we saw the opportunity, which is a great opportunity with our partners at China Eastern, starting in April we will be able to be co-terminus with them. We\u2019ll be able to reduce our MCTs in Shanghai and we had the opportunity between some time it sat in LA and a new maintenance facility we were opening in Shanghai to create the airplane to fly that and that\u2019s really a long term decision that we\u2019ve been waiting for the right opportunity. It was in the five year plan. With the China Visa extensions we see a huge increase in demand and with the opportunity that\u2019s presenting itself in China with our partner China Eastern we really saw this as a onetime opportunity that was not in the normal course of our business, but given the events that had happened with the relaxation of the Visas, given the opportunity we had to relocate, it was really the right time.","Michael Linenberg","Anything on that second part of the question?","Glen W. Hauenstein ","We haven\u2019t changed our fleet plan by one airplane since fuel has come down. So, could you? Yes. Have we? No.","Paul A. Jacobson ","The total shell count for 2015 will be down about 10 year-on-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","I was wondering if I could sort of follow up a little bit on what sort of Bill was asking earlier about this windfall use of cash and where we should think about the incremental cash flow going? Richard, at the analyst day you made a comment about taking net debt down to zero, I know you\u2019ve got to get to five first and you don\u2019t want to talk too far ahead here, but is that the real target or is that sort of a if this current operating environment continues and you guys are generating a lot more cash than you ever thought you would have, that becomes something that is more of a near term realistic possibility or is it kind of let\u2019s just get to five first and see where we are type of thing?","Richard H. Anderson ","I think it\u2019s a good question. In fact, I think it\u2019s a great question from the long term shareholder perspective because this year we budgeted $3 billion in free cash flow and we got well above that. So, there\u2019s just a natural tendency that it\u2019s going to flow against net debt because we\u2019re pretty disciplined about not wanting to take up our aircraft cap ex and we already have the 50 wide bodies ordered and we\u2019ve got 717, 737, 8321s coming and on the margin they\u2019ll be a few more airplanes as we hit 30 years of age on some of our domestic fleet where we\u2019re going to have to make some purchases but I don\u2019t see the cap ex commitment changing from where we\u2019ve been. ","So, there\u2019s two places it ends up going just naturally, one is higher cash returns to our shareholders probably in the form of share buyback and second, is just cash accumulating against net debt. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve said that our target is really zero, we want to get to $5 billion in net debt but the cash is going to accumulate and we\u2019re going to have to be careful to be certain that we steward it wisely for long term owners.","Hunter Keay","Glen, can you talk about how you\u2019re strategically managing the inventory on basic economy right now? You highlighted in the prepared remark it was something you were clearly very excited about at the analyst day presentation. Can you talk about how you manage the inventory in terms of not competing against yourself like, if I were to go on Delta.com I was always going to go on Delta.com, how do you manage the risk of me not seeing that basic economy fair right next to a normal fair, if you want to call it that and me buying that? Are you going to restrict the inventory very tightly, are you going to roll it out in a few test markets to see how it goes? Also, how this factors into the OTAs with the full content agreements that you have with them?","Glen W. Hauenstein ","Really, the basic economy is not a lower fare it\u2019s just the lowest fare we have available. So, if you think about where it\u2019s used today in the 75 markets, it\u2019s primarily used against the ultra-low cost carriers when we have inventory we want to sell and we want customers to buy a competitive product. So, as we think about fares moving forward we want to be less commoditized. We want people to buy the products and services they want and this is really not about lowering fares but allowing people to select what features that Delta offers that they want. ","As you know Delta has by far the best industry record for on time performance for baggage and the highest net promotor score of any of the major three carriers so how do we continue to decontent that and continue to offer best in class for whatever customers want to buy from us, and this is really one of those vehicles.","Paul A. Jacobson ","Just on the OTA question, the OTAs we\u2019ve reduced the number of relationships we have in that distribution channel and in many instances we don\u2019t really have full content agreements so much of this product is really through our website, or through a second point of sale at the airport. The prominence of the OTAs is really diminished particularly as investments in Delta.com have driven very high levels of customer satisfaction. Overall, the OTAs just play a much smaller role in the distribution strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","I appreciate your flattish RASM commentary for the March quarter, I guess 2% growth in total unit revenue. I wonder if you could give a sense for what you expect that to look like by region, or if not by region just maybe what you\u2019d expect domestic to be relative to that flat?","Richard H. Anderson ","I think the trends you saw in Q4 are probably continuing to take hold in Q1. The international RASMs are being pressured on a continued basis by even an accelerated level of dollar strengthening and domestic is really solid. Our corporate revenues are strong. Current year is kind of off to a very good start in month of January, our corporate revenues in the month of January is up 7% so we see domestic holding up well and we continue to make the adjustments we\u2019ve talked about with some of our international entities.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Just on hedging for 2016, I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to make that decision for you but maybe you could just talk about the thought process, what do you need to see to begin to hedge that out? What is it that you\u2019re looking for that would suggest these prices may be the lowest?","Paul A. Jacobson ","As we\u2019ve talked about and as we\u2019ve mentioned at investor day, we\u2019ve taken a little bit more of a narrower view in terms of the time versus what we\u2019ve historically looked out at. 2016 is in our radar now. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to jump and do anything extreme, I think we\u2019re going to continue to manage our program as we see it going forward. We have to keep in mind that there is some steepness in the curves so you can\u2019t hedge in the 40s in 2016 and we have to take that into account.","That being said, we\u2019re in a position where we could get some good year-over-year improvement. Again, as we see continuing \u201914 to \u201915 and \u201915 to \u201916. All that weighs in but we are committed to our program and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see anything materially different from us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julie Yates \u2013 Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates","Just to continue on Duane\u2019s question on unit revenues and maybe just taking a step back and thinking about \u201915, I realize you only give guidance for one quarter but can you give any perspective in light of the changes that are going on in each of the geographies on how we should think about the progression of revenue performance throughout the year and whether we should see improvements maybe from some of the capacity reductions into Asia and the restructuring and the actions on the Trans-Atlantic with Virgin?","Richard H. Anderson ","I think the domestic entity is going to be solid throughout the year. We see no reason why we\u2019ll see any tail off of our domestic performance. Internationally, as we mature and lap a significant amount of the Latin investment that we\u2019ve made and as we lap the Venezuelan capacity reduction, we should see the Latin unit revenue progression start to improve by the second half of the year. In the Pacific we have talked a lot about the changes we\u2019re making with the 747s. I think it really depends on a currency play with what\u2019s happening with respect to the Yen. In the back half of the year for the Pacific we see some fundamental improvements but that\u2019s factored based on the Yen holding where it\u2019s largely at.","Julie Yates","Then just maybe on the Trans-Atlantic?","Richard H. Anderson ","Our JV with Virgin is going very well. I mentioned that we expect to post a net $200 million profit for the year and our performance in Paris and Amsterdam were also quite strong in Q4. I think our unit revenue performance to those two markets were in the 3% to 5% year-over-year range of improvement and so we would expect 2015 to see continuing strength.","Paul A. Jacobson ","2015 in the AFKLM JV we\u2019re expecting significant contribution improvement in the joint venture with Air France KLM. We\u2019re seeing a lot of the fuel price advantage obviously [indiscernible] the long haul. ","Edward H. Bastian ","One last comment just on the global demand scene, we see really good core strength with just one exception and that is Africa, Middle East, and Russia and so we will be adjusting our capacity in those key markets as we move forward through the year. But all kind of different events, Russia being more political, Middle East being related to the oil, and Africa being related to the perception of Ebola because we really don\u2019t fly to Ebola affected areas. ","Julie Yates","Then lastly, internationally where are you starting to see pressure to remove fuel surcharges?","Edward H. Bastian ","We never comment on forward pricing initiatives so we\u2019d like to just continue that policy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan.","Jamie Baker","First question as the labor drama played out in recent months at American Airlines, I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s been any impact or sort of change in the tone of dialog between Delta management and its pilots? Does it remain a goal to try and settle before the amendable date and how confident are you that even with new economics you can succeed in keeping the consolidated ex fuel CASM under 2%?","Richard H. Anderson ","I think the answer to the first question is no change in our great relationship. We have made a commitment with our pilots to finish on time or ahead of schedule and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to be able to maintain our cost structure over the long term.","Jamie Baker","Ed, I don\u2019t want to get bogged down in semantics, the team seems to be speaking rather enthusiastically today about the impact of lower fuel, but I\u2019m still getting inquiries from investors about that statement in the release about the quote unquote headwinds from lower fuel. Even if you only participate in 50% of the savings, how exactly is that a headwind? Were you just referring to the headwind from the hedge book?","Edward H. Bastian ","No, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s a correlation as fuel prices come down there\u2019s an industry supply macro that you need to think about so we weren\u2019t talking about any specific headwinds other than the fact that as fuel prices come down you can expect to see some pricing pressure broadly.","Paul A. Jacobson ","There\u2019s a subpart to that question if you think about the effect of lower fuel prices, it\u2019s affecting some of the economies around the world. It\u2019s a huge boon to the American consumer. There\u2019s never a better time for Americans to go to Europe or to travel around the world. But, when you think about the effect that it has in places like Brazil, Glenn talked about Russia, there are a lot of OPEC economies the cartel was collecting rents that they aren\u2019t collecting anymore and you see it in Venezuela, you see it in a number of carbon producing economies that will have some impact on the foreign point of sale. But, the US it is a huge boon to the US economy.","Jamie Baker","If I could just squeeze in a third housekeeping question, I know you reserve the right to modify the profit sharing program, I didn\u2019t see anything in the release to suggest the 2015 break points would be any different, is that correct? ","Richard H. Anderson ","That\u2019s correct.","Operator","Your last question comes from Joseph DeNardi \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.","Joseph DeNardi","Paul, I think you were the one that mentioned the pilot retirement wave upcoming over the next couple of years and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve looked at that pretty closely. Is there any way you can quantify what the impact or benefit to your cost structure you expect from that?","Richard H. Anderson ","It was Richard talking about the pilot staffing constraints and what it takes to grow capacity. I think the normal flow through that we see in the ranks is built into our cost structure and I think we don\u2019t expect that to result in any big unit cost pressures.","Joseph DeNardi","I guess wouldn\u2019t it be a tailwind at some point as the retirements start to accelerate?","Paul A. Jacobson ","Not really, it\u2019s not a seniority based pay per say. There is a little bit of training cost associated with it, but from a wage benefit salary standpoint it\u2019s negligible.","Joseph DeNardi","Then just a housekeeping, the first quarter is that PRASM that you expect to be flat or total RASM?","Paul A. Jacobson ","That\u2019s PRASM.","Jill Sullivan Greer ","That\u2019s going to conclude the analyst portion of the call. I\u2019m not going to turn it over to Kevin Shinkle, our Chief Communications Officer.","Kevin Shinkle ","We have about 10 minutes for questions from reporters so please limit yourself to one question and one brief follow up. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jack Nicas \u2013 Wall Street Journal.","Jack Nicas","You just were talking about the fact that when you do see significant declines in the price of oil there\u2019s going to be some industry headwinds such as pricing pressures. Can you discuss whether you\u2019re seeing any of that now and if so, can you characterize it a little bit and talk about what it is?","Edward H. Bastian ","Jack, given the results we just posted with our unit revenues improved and given that we\u2019ve got a flat outlook on a growing supply base into the first quarter 2015, I think that will tell you what we see in the revenue cards.","Jack Nicas","Are you seeing at all \u2013 could you say that any competitors are cutting fares or anything like that?","Edward H. Bastian ","We can\u2019t talk about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Koenig \u2013 The Associated Press.","David Koenig","This may be a bit of a follow up to that, I keep getting the question all of the time when are fares going to go down because fuel is down so sharply and there was no mention of that on the call? There was mention of how you might spend the fuel, if you want to call it, windfall. Anything new that Mr. Anderson, you can say about the impact of fuel on fares?","A - Richard H. Anderson ","I think we covered it pretty thoroughly there in the call. I think Ed addressed it pretty forthrightly. Over, the cycle you do have some pressure from fuel price and particularly in the foreign point of sale where economies are significantly affected if they had been relying upon oil price payments from the US.","David Koenig","Would it take some sort of a drop off in load factors and how much before you might see some difference in fares?","Richard H. Anderson ","There\u2019s always differences. The marketplace is incredibly competitive and there\u2019s always differences in fares in a competitive marketplace.","David Koenig","I guess I meant reductions. ","Richard H. Anderson ","I think we covered it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ted Reed \u2013 The Street.","Ted Reed","I would like to hear Glenn explain why you\u2019re adding a flight from Los Angeles to Shanghai given capacity increases in the Pacific and the buildup in Seattle. I would just like to hear why you feel that flight is necessary and how it can make money?","A - Glen W. Hauenstein ","I thought I just answered that on the analyst side in pretty good detail. The one thing that\u2019s happened in the last few months is the extension of the Chinese Visa program. That was unexpected and so we\u2019ve seen a significant increase from China. The second thing was a long awaited co-terminus move with our partner China Eastern and we\u2019re already connecting about a little less than 200 people a day to Shanghai and points in interior China and starting in April we\u2019ll be able to reduce our minimum connect times and we\u2019ll be able to better connect to those points in China. ","So we saw that, the opportunity, combined with the dramatic increase in Chinese visitors and the Chinese economy just came out today and the 73 with the Visas we see really strong demand in China materializing in the second and third quarters. This is something that was in our five year plan we just saw an opportunity to accelerate it given some exogenous events that all seemed to sync up at once.","Paul A. Jacobson ","Overall Pacific capacity should be down in 2015 about 4%. ","Ted Reed","That makes even Los Angeles viable for you?","Glen W. Hauenstein ","Absolutely. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Sasso \u2013 Bloomberg News.","Michael Sasso","Yields in Latin American given your rapid growth there over the last year or so?","Richard H. Anderson ","As we mature that growth and lap that growth we will see certainly some improvements in our overall unit revenue performance. Any time you\u2019re expanding in international markets it generally takes 12 to 24 months before the market starts to fully develop for you and you will see some natural improvements as we temper our capacity additions. The other factor is Venezuela which had an outsized level of unit revenue performance. With the currency changes we decided last year to pull down our frequencies and as we lap that there will also be a benefit to our Latin unit revenues in the second half of this year.","Paul A. Jacobson ","Just a last comment, on a fairly significant increase in capacity in the fourth quarter absent Venezuela, our yields would have been flat.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffery Dastin \u2013 Thomas Reuters News.","Jeffery Dastin","To clarify Paul\u2019s earlier comment that you will not do anything extreme with the hedge book, does that mean Delta is not looking to lock in lower fuel prices for the long term with new hedge contracts?","Paul A. Jacobson ","What we do is we manage the book usually inside of an 18 month time horizon but primarily focused inside of about a 12 month period so the comment was intended to mean that we\u2019re just going to continue to look at the program as we\u2019ve been running it. 2016 is coming into view, but we\u2019re not looking to make material changes in how we manage the program. It doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t be hedging in 2016.","Operator","Your next question comes from Elliot Blackburn \u2013 Argus Media.","Elliot Blackburn","Obviously, the refinery had a good quarter last quarter. I was curious if you guys could talk about what you\u2019re seeing there if the rail, [indiscernible], and crude that you worked to secure, if that\u2019s still competitive there or if you\u2019re finding more opportunities for the waterborne imports at that facility?","Paul A. Jacobson ","We\u2019ve obviously seen some compression in the spread between domestic and foreign sourced oil which has made foreign a little bit more attractive. But what we\u2019ve seen at the refinery is that crack spreads and margins on products have actually gone up while prices have gone down and that\u2019s contributed to the profitability so we had a great fourth quarter. We expect pretty healthy profit at the refinery in the first quarter as well on the strength of those higher crack spreads which is helping to serve as a bit of a hedge, if you will, on widening spreads on a lower crude price for the airline.","Elliot Blackburn","Are you guys expecting to be able to run full out for the year or do you have some planned work at that refinery this year?","Paul A. Jacobson ","Nothing other than just ordinary maintenance, but there are no planned major shutdowns.","Kevin Shinkle ","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Your last question comes from Edward Russell \u2013 Flight Global.","Edward Russell","I wanted to see if you could elaborate a bit on the plans for maintenance facility in Shanghai? Will you be moving any maintenance there from elsewhere and what kind of aircraft will you be maintaining there?","Richard H. Anderson ","It\u2019s just purely a line maintenance facility so it\u2019s overnight line checks, overnight planned work, just like the line maintenance facility we have in Amsterdam, or Sao Paulo, or Paris, or Tokyo, so it\u2019s not heavy maintenance or engine maintenance. ","Edward Russell","Approximately what is the expected investment that you plan to make in that facility?","Richard H. Anderson ","We\u2019re talking about a dozen mechanics and an allotment of spare parts. I think maybe you\u2019re misconstruing the idea of putting line maintenance in Shanghai into being something more than that. It\u2019s 12 people so you could do it out on the ramp, we won\u2019t have a hanger.","Kevin Shinkle ","Thank you. With that, we conclude our call for today. Thanks everyone for listening.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. "],"7267":["Delta Air Lines, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Jake. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our March quarter earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session.","Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta\u2019s financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flows.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Earlier today, Delta reported an $832 million pre-tax profit, or $0.96 per share. The core business performed well and we saw nice upside from our contract renewal with American Express. We grew our earnings per share by 28%, expanded our operating margin by a 150 basis points and delivered an after-tax return on invested capital of 14.5% over the last 12 months.","This performance demonstrates how we are translating our unique brand, unmatched competitive advantages and pipeline of initiatives to drive earnings growth, margin expansion and solid returns for our owners. This also underscores our confidence that we have in our future, which is one of the reasons why we accelerate our share repurchases, returning $1.6 billion to our shareholders this quarter.","We achieved 7.5% top line growth, as demand for our product remains strong. Our Ancillary businesses delivered double-digit growth and we extended our leadership in delivering great value for our customers. This starts with industry-leading reliability as the world\u2019s best run airline. We delivered the best March quarter completion factor in our history at 99.06% despite a very difficult winter weather.","Reliability in our culture of service underpin the strength of our brand and allow us to build lasting customer relationships. Domestic net promoter score has averaged 50% this year, up 7 points versus last year. This is the reason we sustained the best revenue premium in the industry, and it\u2019s not just our customers who noticed. Earlier this week, Delta topped the airline quality rating and was the only airline to improve in all categories.","Just as important, we continue to execute on cost discipline. Non-fuel unit cost declined slightly, marking the third quarter in a row of cost performance below inflation and giving us good line of sight to achieving our full-year non-fuel unit cost expectations of 1%.","The combination of revenue momentum and cost discipline drove a one point improvement in our pre-tax margin, a successful step in our path to improved margin performance for the full-year, and our earnings per share growth of 28% in the March quarter should be in the top 10% of companies in the S&P 500. At the heart of this performance are the Delta people, their hard work and focus on the customer is what sets Delta apart and I want to thank them and say congratulations for starting the year with $220 million towards next year\u2019s profit sharing.","During the quarter, there were exciting developments in loyalty, our maintenance, repair and overhaul business and fleet that ensured we build on our earnings momentum, strengthen our strategic advantages and further diversify our revenue streams. 55% of our revenue now comes from premium products and non-ticket sources, up from less than 40% in 2011. The growing revenue streams from loyalty and our MRO are major component of the $3 billion to $4 billion in free cash flow that we except to generate this year.","Our long-term agreements give us better visibility and even more confidence in the sustainability of this level of cash generation. Importantly, they are decoupled from air fares and provide stability in any economic environment.","Last week, we were pleased to announce the contract renewal with American Express, extending our agreement through 2029. Delta and American Express are two great consumer brands and our shared passion for service and innovation is at the foundation of our long-term partnership. Our American Express partnership is our most important commercial relationship, and I appreciate the confidence that Steve Squeri and the rest of the AmEx team places in Delta.","While our AmEx contract wasn\u2019t set to expire for several years, the early renewal accelerates momentum by providing certainty in a platform for mutual growth and investment. We except the new agreement to enable substantial growth in the Delta SkyMiles credit card portfolio, setting the stage to create not just the industry\u2019s most valuable co-brand program, but one of the most valuable consumer co-brands on the globe.","Delta\u2019s benefit is expected to grow to $7 billion by 2023, up from $3.4 billion last year and just $1 billion at the start of this decade. This growth trajectory demonstrates the strength of the Delta brand and the growing attractiveness of our value proposition to our customers.","As the largest MRO in North America, we also expect to generate double-digit growth, reaching more than $800 million in revenues this year, and we are growing this business by developing new capabilities and securing long-term partnerships.","During the quarter, we completed construction on the world\u2019s largest engine test cell. The test cell opens the door to new larger engine testing capabilities, including those in our agreements with Rolls-Royce and with Pratt & Whitney. As we continue to invest in and grow our maintenance business, we expect the MRO top line to reach $2 billion over the next five years.","And finally, we continue to transform our fleet. While we have made substantial enhancements to our fleet over the last number of years, we expect substantial efficiency benefits are still ahead for us, supporting revenue growth and contributing to Delta\u2019s sustained margin advantages. With more than 80 new deliveries this year, 2019 will be an important year for this initiative.","We had a milestone this quarter with the first flights on our state-of-the-art Airbus 220. This innovative aircraft sets a new standard for the domestic narrow-body product. Our customers love it and we\u2019re finding them booking specifically to be on the Airbus 220. We have 90 deliveries of this product alone scheduled over the next several years.","So 2019 is off to a real solid start. The core business performed well during the quarter, which combined with the upside from the American Express renewal, gives us increased confidence in our full-year plan of strong top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. Business has momentum and there are significant opportunities ahead of us.","We have a strong foundation with our strategic advantages, which are our culture, our leading operational reliability, an unrivaled network, our loyalty program and relationship with American Express and an investment-grade balance sheet. These advantages combined with a great brand powered by the very best professionals in the business provide the engine to drive long-term value for our owners.","Before I turn the call over to Glen and Paul, I\u2019d also like to take a minute to introduce Tim Mapes, who will become our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer starting next month. Tim has more than 25 years of experience with Delta and has been a leading force behind the Delta brand. Tim is assuming this role, because our good friend Ned Walker is heading off to a well-earned retirement. Ned, you leaved behind an incredible legacy of leadership and service to Delta and the industry, and on behalf of the entire Delta family. Thank you.","And now, I will turn the call over to Glen to discuss the revenue environment.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to start by thanking the Delta team, the unmatched service they provided is the foundation for our increasing customer satisfaction. This enabled us to generate record revenues of $10.4 billion in the March quarter, up 7.5% over last year. We made good progress on our long-term priorities to drive top line and earnings growth by leveraging our network, premium offerings, our co-brand agreement with American Express and our Ancillary businesses.","Starting with our top line, corporate revenue remained healthy, increasing 8% for the quarter. In our most recent Corporate Travel Survey, 90% of travel managers expect to maintain or increase their travel spend in the second quarter. This is a record for our June quarter survey.","During the first quarter, 55% of our revenues came from premium products and non-ticket sources. Premium product revenues were up 8% to more than $3 billion in the March quarter on a 4% increase in premium capacity.","Looking forward, premium revenue growth should accelerate through the year as we introduce more aircraft with the full suite of products and improve our ability to sell all of our premium products on delta.com, as well as in external channels. Cargo revenues declined 5% in the quarter similar to what you\u2019ve heard from freight companies, we are seeing challenges from softer volumes and currency headwinds.","Our MRO business is performing well with revenues up nearly 40% on new customer volume and heavier work scopes from existing customers. The growth rate will moderate in the June quarter, but will still be up double digits over prior year.","Total loyalty revenues grew $1.2 billion, up 21% with a little more than $100 million of the improvement driven by the new contract with American Express. Demand for SkyMiles as a currency is stronger than ever. Mileage redemptions grew 12% in the March quarter as we provided customers more opportunity to use their miles.","Enhancing customer loyalty and trust is at the heart of our business, and we are finding innovative ways to reward our customers for their loyalty. Increasingly, customers are using miles for products and services beyond just award tickets as we expand miles as a form of payment.","During the quarter, we rolled out miles as currency to mobile, offering SkyMiles members the opportunity to upgrade to a more premium experience through our app. We saw an overwhelmingly positive response with revenue in the March quarter already exceeding our regional full-year estimate. On average, there are already 4,000 customers upgrading with miles every day, with more than half of those transactions coming via mobile. This drove nearly 4 points of redemption growth in the quarter.","Our goal is to provide customers the ability to use miles for products and services across the entire spectrum of Delta ecosystem. We plan to deliver significant additional functionality as we move through 2019.","Our close relationship with American Express is a source of true competitive advantage. The co-brand credit partnership provides a unique revenue stream to Delta by extending our engagement to a broader consumer spend, not just travel on Delta. This is reflected in a new quarterly record for acquisitions of SkyMiles American Express cards.","Our partnership with American Express is an increasingly important driver of our business that is growing faster than the core airline. Co-brand card spend continues to outpace the industry with double-digit growth.","In 2019, our total contribution from American Express relationship will be over $4 billion, up from the $3.7 billion we previously expected. Over the next three years, we expect continued solid growth with a more significant step up starting in 2023 that will drive our total contribution to nearly $7 billion, double what we achieved last year. We expect the revenue benefit to Delta in 2019 will be approximately $500 million, driving about 1 point of unit revenue impact for the year.","Turning to specifics on unit revenues. Unit revenue grew 2.4% on 5% higher capacity. Our record completion factor added 1 point of capacity in the quarter. While this was very good for our customers, our brand and our profitability, the additional capacity weighed on unit revenues by roughly 0.5 point.","Even with that pressure, we are above the midpoint of our initial present guidance and the new American Express agreement has another point of benefit. Passenger unit revenues grew 0.6%, but were pressured by higher capacity, currency, Easter timing and the government shutdown. Despite these headwinds, we expect to maintain a healthy unit revenue premium to the industry of more than 110%.","Domestic revenues grew 6.9% in the quarter on a roughly 1% improvement in PRASM. Growth in the business revenue outpaced leisure in the quarter with corporate revenues improving 10% on strong volumes and a 2% improvement in corporate average fares. Leisure trends were choppy, but improved as the quarter progressed.","Atlantic unit revenues fell 2.6 with a 2 point headwind from currency and the Easter shift. We saw pressure on Europe, midpoint of sale leisure demand, which weighed on main cabin performance. Corporate and premium revenues were both up over prior year.","In the Pacific, unit revenues declined 2.8% as strong demand was not enough to offset a 9% increase in stage and a 1 point currency headwind. Korea posted the best performance with a 2% improvement in unit revenues as our joint venture synergies continue to ramp with Korean.","China revenues grew by more than 25% on a 30% higher capacity moderately pressuring unit revenue growth. Our capacity growth to China will decelerate in the second-half of the year, as we annualize the additional flights added to the market during 2018. In Latin, revenues grew 2.4%, the second consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth, driven by improving demand and yield trends in Mexico and the Caribbean.","Looking forward, June quarter total revenue is expected to increase 6% to 8%, including 1 point of benefit from the agreement with American Express. We expect unit revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5% on a 4% to 4.5% higher capacity. In domestic, corporate demand is strong. Leisure continues to strengthen as we approach the second quarter peak demand. We expect Atlantic to return to unit revenue growth as demand shifts to U.S. point of origin in the summer season and corporate trend remains strong.","In the Pacific, currency capacity growth in stage will continue to pressure unit revenues in the June quarter, but we see profitability continuing to improve as we execute on our long-term vision for Asia. Our fleet is becoming more efficient, our product is improving, we have the right partners and with these building blocks in place we have returned to growth for the first time in seven years. Performance is on track or exceeding our expectations.","Latin is expected to remain the best performing entity as strength continues in Mexico, the Caribbean and Brazil improves. We expect Brazil to show year-over-year RASM improvement in the June quarter for the first time in the year. Sequentially in the June quarter, we expect a 1 point improvement in passenger revenue per ASM with sequential improvement in all entities. On a traveling basis, however, this improvement will be somewhat tempered by other revenue pressure due to lower growth rates in Ancillary business.","Importantly, our passenger unit trajectory in the back-half of the year, the rate of domestic capacity, I\u2019m sorry, excuse me \u2013 importantly, for our passenger unit revenue trajectory in the back-half of the year, the rate of domestic capacity growth is expected to decelerate by approximately 2 points. This gives us increased confidence in our full-year unit revenue trajectory.","As we think about our network opportunities, we have leveraged our first mover advantage to build our number one or number two positions in our coastal gateways. Later this year, we\u2019ve been begin refocusing our growth into our higher-margin core hubs to more efficient, larger gauge aircraft. We continue to increase our scale while maintaining our revenue premium and improving our margins.","With about a point of incremental capacity driven by our record operating performance and increased gauge and stage length, we now see our full-year 2019 capacity outlook to be in a 3% to 4% range. However, we\u2019re always mindful of our operating environment and we will take the necessary actions we see, we need to do, if we see sustained higher fuel prices or economic uncertainty impacting our margin expansion.","The slightly higher capacity combined with $500 million in additional revenue from benefit from American Express renewal support total revenue growth of 5% to 7% in 2019, up from the 46% initial guidance given at Investor Day.","In closing, the strength of the March quarter results and the contract renewal with American Express further reinforce the confidence and conviction we have in both our near-term and long-term strategy.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to my good friend, Paul.","Paul Jacobson","Thank you, Glen, and good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. At our Investor Day, we reiterated our commitment to consistently delivering superior financial results. For us, this is about creating value through top line growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation through prudent capital allocation.","Our March quarter results provided a solid start to the year across each of these priorities and give us increased confidence in our full-year outlook. This is the first quarter we have expanded margins on both in operating and pre-tax basis in nearly two years. Our March quarter operating margin of 10% is a 1.5 higher than last year and flat to 2017, despite market fuel prices that are approximately 20% higher this year.","For the March quarter, our non-fuel unit cost declined 0.1 point, marking another quarter of strong cost performance. This was better than our initial guidance due to record operations that resulted in about a point of additional capacity, some shifts in expense timing to the second and third quarter and continued good cost control momentum throughout the organization carrying forward from the second-half of last year.","Fuel prices are trending higher, so maintaining a disciplined cost trajectory is a top priority for us as we continue to drive to full-year margin expansion. I want to thank the entire Delta team for their continued commitments in this effort.","For the June quarter, we expect non-fuel unit cost growth of 1% to 2%. It is important to note that with the efficiency gains we\u2019ve made through our fleet transformation, we expect to accelerate the retirement of our MD-90 fleet. Our June quarter cost guidance includes about a point \u2013 about 0.5 of impact for this decision. Our results combined with our ongoing fleet transformation and work through One Delta keep us on track to achieve our target of 1% non-fuel unit cost growth in 2019.","This year is important for us in our fleet transformation journey. We are optimizing how we deploy our existing fleet through One Delta, continuing to retire older aircraft with nearly 40 MD-88s exiting the fleet this year and introducing next-generation engine technology with two new aircraft types. These new aircrafts generate substantial efficiency benefits and enable revenue growth, both through higher premium seat mix, as well as improved customer satisfaction, supporting our industry-leading revenue premium and margin advantage.","In February, we launched the A220. By the end of the year, we will have 28 of these aircraft, growing this fleet to 90 aircraft by 2023. A220 deliveries enable retirement of smaller regional aircraft, the least efficient and highest-cost aircraft in our fleet. We are also the North American launch customer for the A330900 Neo. This aircraft will join our fleet this summer, enabling more efficient flying in the Pacific with a best-in-class product that is expected to generate a 5 to 10 point margin improvement versus the aircraft it is replacing.","New engine technology aircraft also give us the ability to structurally shift our cost curve down, while gaining benefits from higher gauge and a better product. Our order book allows for replacement of 35% of our mainline fleet through 2023, allowing us to continue to optimize as simplification and efficiency benefits drive further margin improvements.","Total fuel expense increased $87 million in the quarter versus prior year. Refinery profits were pressured due to lower gas crack spreads driving a loss of $34 million, or about $0.04 per gallon in the quarter.","For the June quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to be $2.10 to $2.20 per gallon, in line with last year and up modestly from the March quarter. These results include a slight profit at the refinery for the quarter. Importantly, our re-fleeting and One Delta initiatives drove a 2.1% improvement in fuel efficiency during the March quarter, doubled the rate we saw in the same quarter last year and indicative of the efficiency we expect to generate in 2019, furthering our environmental sustainability goals and lowering our costs.","Non-operating expenses for the quarter were $69 million higher than prior year due to pension pressure and lower equity partner earnings, each of which are expected to repeat in the quarter.","Looking to the June quarter, expect the top line growth of 6% to 8%, combined with 1% to 2% growth in our non-fuel unit costs and a slight moderation in fuel prices over prior year supports our expectation for continued margin expansion and another quarter of double-digit EPS growth.","We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.35, up more than 20% versus prior year at the midpoint and well above S&P earnings growth expectations. This equates to a pre-tax margin of 14% to 16%, compared to last year\u2019s results of 14.1%.","Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet, we generated $2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, with improvement over prior year on higher profits and timing of our voluntary pension contribution. We reinvested in the business with $1.3 billion in CapEx, resulting in free cash flow of $760 million.","The March quarter result and incremental benefit from AmEx give us increasing confidence in achieving the high-end of our full-year free cash flow guidance of $3 billion to $4 billion, compared to $2.3 billion last year. In fact, we expect to produce nearly that level in the first-half of this year alone.","For the full-year, our free cash flow conversion is expected to approve to around 80% of net income, with tailwinds from strong top line growth included the \u2013 including the added benefit from American Express and an improved cost trajectory. This is up 33% from an average of around 60% each of the last two years.","Our strong cash generation and a healthy balance sheet enable us to consistently return cash back to our owners. With the confidence this management team has in the sustainability of Delta\u2019s earnings power, market volatility created an opportunity to accelerate our buyback plans within the year.","We repurchased $1.3 billion in stock at an average price of $50.55, retiring 26 million shares in the quarter, while also paying out $233 million in dividends. Our repurchases were funded by a $1 billion seasonal working capital loan, $300 million of which we have already repaid. The remainder is expected to be repaid by the end of this year.","We still expect to return approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2019 through dividends and buybacks, and remain staunchly committed to returning 70% of free cash flow to shareholders annually.","In the first week of April, we contributed $250 million of our voluntary pension funding for the year and we expect to contribute the remaining $250 million later this year. Leveraging our strong balance sheet, we recently refinanced $500 million of scheduled debt maturities. The completion of our $500 million EETC, refinance is approximately one-third of our 2019 scheduled maturities at a 3.2% blended rate, saving us approximately $9 million annually on our interest expense.","With debt levels comfortably within our leverage ratio target of 1.5 to 2.5 times adjusted debt to EBITDAR, we will continue to utilize a variety of funding sources to refinance debt maturities or take advantage of market conditions and refinance higher cost debt.","Our after-tax return on invested capital on a trailing 12-month basis is 14.5%. This is up nearly 200 basis points over prior year on improved profitability and tax reform benefits. We are on track to deliver a 15% after-tax ROIC in 2019, consistent with our expectations at Investor Day.","Looking forward, we have solid momentum and are on track to deliver strong top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth for the full-year. This performance is a validation of our commitment to reinforcing the Delta difference. The combination of our powerful brand and our unmatched competitive advantages continue to deliver industry-leading results and will drive long-term value for our owners.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Paul. Jake, we\u2019re ready for questions from the analysts. If you could give them instructions on how to get in the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will hear first from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi","Hey, good morning. Ed, in 2018, you guys received $3.5 billion in cash from the selling miles and reported about a $1.5 billion in marketing fee. You\u2019re on track for $2 billion in 2020. If you can get to $7 billion in 2023, you\u2019ll be doing $3 billion to $4 billion in marketing fee. How could you possibly not break that out as a separate business unit, not talking about spinning it or selling it, just segmenting out. What are your thoughts there?","Ed Bastian","Well, my thoughts are it\u2019s a good problem to worry about, Joe. We are \u2013 first of all, we\u2019re pleased and thrilled with the new renewal. AmEx is an awesome partner, and our two brands line up so well strategically and with our customers and our people.","As we grow our loyalty program, you\u2019re right, there will be a question of disclosure in terms of providing better insight from an ownership perspective and a governance perspective into the drivers of our profitability into the future and whether that\u2019s in a segment or whatever disclosure form, I\u2019m not sure what it will take. But it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been giving greater disclosure to as you know, and we will continue to consider that.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Glen, just \u2013 or Ed, if you could just talk around some of the assumptions behind getting to the $7 billion, it seems to imply continued really strong growth in card acquisitions and spend on the card. So what gives you the confidence that you can continue to do that? And then Glen, you mentioned there\u2019s another significant step up in 2023. So I mean, can you talk about what the total value of the agreement could reach by the end of it?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, we continue to see it grow significantly beyond 2023. And really one of the great reasons that we have for accelerating the renewal of the contract is that we can continue to invest in new products and services for consumers that we think will make the card relatively more and more attractive and drive continued acquisition. And that was really one of the main reasons to go ahead and do that at this point in time.","So we are excited about the future of that. As I pointed out in the earnings call, we did have another record acquisition in the script. We had another record acquisition quarter in the first quarter. And as we start up the second quarter, acquisitions remain very strong, and I think if we can continue to provide the kind of value to customers that they want to acquire the card, which we have a great plan for with American Express we will meet or exceed those expectations by 2023 and beyond.","Joseph DeNardi","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll now move to a question from Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse.","Joe Caiado","Hey, thanks very much. Good morning. Ed and Paul, you\u2019re generating a lot of cash flow this year, that was already the case prior to the renewal of the AmEx agreement, the outlook for cash flows now even better.","Two-part question here. I know you\u2019re committed to returning 70% of free cash flow to shareholders, but you\u2019ve also gone above that level periodically. So I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about prioritizing the deployment of that incremental cash flow that you\u2019re getting this year?","And then the second part of question is, Ed, since you talked about the confidence this gives you and the sustainability of your cash flow I\u2019m curious if you have a target for annual free cash flow conversion going forward?","Paul Jacobson","Well, good morning, Joe. I\u2019ll start with that and Ed can follow-up. Obviously, the American Express agreement provides us with increasing confidence about our performance throughout the year and in part helps to convey that confidence through my comments about coming in at the top-end of the free cash flow range for the year. It is still early in the year and we are facing increasing prices and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about that.","We have said with the announcement of the first quarter buyback acceleration that we maintain the optionality to give back more. So consistent return of capital back to shareholders is obviously a big priority for us, and we expect to continue that into the future.","Ed Bastian","Joe, to add on to Paul\u2019s comments, I agree with him. I think it\u2019s a great start to the year. We\u2019re excited with how the first quarter came, but I think it\u2019s still early to be raising full-year expectations whether it\u2019s in guidance or for profitability, EPS or cash flow. We do face a lot of volatility in oil prices. And while demand has been solid, I\u2019d like to at least get through the second quarter before reassessing those full-year expectations.","So from my perspective, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. We\u2019ll be in the top half of the guidance range that we gave you, both on EPS, as well as on free cash, but we\u2019re not ready to raise those ranges or expectations right at this moment.","Joe Caiado","That\u2019s fair, I appreciate that. And then I have \u2013 second question if I may for Glen. I just want to get your thoughts kind of big picture on the booking curve and what you\u2019re seeing. It feels like perhaps we\u2019re seeing some more heavy discounting on longer-dated bookings, but better close and offsetting, just love your thoughts there? Thanks.","Glen Hauenstein","I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what we see at all. As a matter of fact forward yields for every month out through the second quarter are in positive territory on higher bookings. So we see relatively robust leisure demand as we enter the second quarter.","Joe Caiado","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Good morning.","Ed Bastian","Good morning.","Hunter Keay","Hey, Ed, putting aside the issues Boeing\u2019s current issues of the MAX, how does the potential aftermarket work and your relationship with the engine OEMs factor into how you\u2019re thinking about buying the NMA?","Ed Bastian","Well, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s premature to be speculating on the NMA. It\u2019s \u2013 Boeing has not even approved the release of it for sale. So I think we\u2019re a little early here. We are \u2013 we consider all components of the aircraft and the revenues and the opportunities that it brings.","As we evaluate a new fleet family, it was an important consideration in making decision on the 321 Neo, which product we went to with the Geared Turbofan, as well as the MRO benefits that provided. It will certainly be in the consideration side as we think about the NMA, but I think trying to get down to that level of speculation probably is way too early.","Hunter Keay","Okay. And then how does the AmEx agreement factor into how you view the lifecycle of the customer? Is there a construct where you\u2019re willing to subsidize a few years of price sensitive consumption of fares or even losses or low margins to potentially strategic customers in exchange for like a 25 to 50-year long-term relationship with increasing spend as that customer builds wealth?","Ed Bastian","Well, I \u2013 yes, that\u2019s a question obviously for AmEx, as well as for us. We are \u2013 when we think about AmEx and our relationship, we think for the very long-term, we don\u2019t think in terms of contract periods and renewal extensions. AmEx \u2013 one of the real attractive components to AmEx is the presence it has and the opportunity it creates in some of our high-value segments.","So, yes, if you\u2019re asking, \u201cDo we invest in acquiring high-value potential customers early in their life?\u201d Absolutely. And it\u2019s one of the reasons, I think, our brands aligned so well, because we have similar strategies in terms of how we think about our brands and how we think about consumers.","Hunter Keay","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","And I will hear from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just to come back to AmEx for a second, can you comment on the underlying drivers of that $7 billion contribution by 2023. How much of that is contractual rate? How much of that is customer spend, and how much of that is new customer acquisition, if you would?","Ed Bastian","Duane, we are under contract confidentiality obviously with American Express that you can appreciate. I can tell you with all of the above. And as we get further into the new contract, I think, some of those \u2013 your questions will start to answer themselves.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay, we\u2019ll wait for that to be revealed. And then, Glen, you touched on mobile briefly. Can you talk about mobile more broadly? What does it represent as a percentage of your bookings today? How large is that revenue stream, and how quickly is it growing?","Glen Hauenstein","Mobile is by far the fastest growing, and it\u2019s about 20% of our direct bookings \u2013 20% to 25% of our direct bookings. And it seems like every week and every month it moves on, mobile becomes a bigger and bigger chunk of total bookings. So that\u2019s really the place that we see an incredible amount of growth and that\u2019s where consumers are seeming to want to go in order to book delta.com, they will book directly with Delta.","So very exciting and we have lots of great new releases coming this year, which we think will continue to enhance that customer experience with more and more utility that you can have in the palm of your hand.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you very much.","Operator","Helane Becker with Cowen will have the next question.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the time. Just on the MRO business, you said it was $800 million in revenue this year and you want to grow it to $2 billion over some timeframe going forward. Can you just talk about the CapEx that you need to get to that level, or with the new large test cell, is that built out now?","Ed Bastian","Well, Helane, the good news in that is a lot of the growth that we need is now contractually provided for with our relationships with Rolls-Royce on the Trent, as well as on the Pratt & Whitney in the geared turbofan. As those products come to market, the geared turbofan is still early in its introduction, as well as the new \u2013 from the new trend products, you will see that the revenue ramp towards the back-end of that period at a higher clip than you\u2019ll see in the front part of that five-year period.","This year, we\u2019re doing well. We\u2019re looking for double-digit growth top line, as well as margin improvement from the MRO, but it really starts to take off pardon the pun over the next couple of years.","Helane Becker","Okay. That\u2019s really helpful, thank you. It\u2019s okay I get the puns, too. Just as \u2013 when you think about solo \u2013 I want to ask this question, but you\u2019re not going to really answer the whole question, because your \u2013 you started negotiating with your pilots. And when you think about your go-forward CapEx and the growth of the airline, the replacement cycle and so on, how do you manage their expectations in terms of growing the non-ticket revenue or main cabin revenue, that\u2019s 45% of your total revenue with what their demands are for what they expect their future income to be?","Ed Bastian","Well, you\u2019re right. We\u2019re not going to talk about our discussions with our pilots. We have just begun and it\u2019s going to take quite sometime to reach a productive conclusion. When we think about our company, we think about all the constituents that are important to our company; all of our employees, not just our pilots that they will create the opportunity and the value that we\u2019ve already created and as well as the future.","We think about the investment needs that we have to make, continued in our product, in our growth. We think about the investments we need to make in our customers, investments we need to make in our communities, as well as the investments we need to continue to make in our owners. So in that context, I\u2019m certain we\u2019ll reach a good and fair conclusion of our pilot negotiations, but it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not going to do it publicly and it\u2019s more premature to even begin to speculate on any construct there.","Helane Becker","Okay. That\u2019s totally fair. Thanks for your help. Have a nice day.","Ed Bastian","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon","Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe Glen or Ed, could you just kind of talk in simple terms like what Delta actually needs to do to get this incremental sort of $3.5 billion of revenue? Is this just a function of pricing on a mileage basis, the new card issue? Could you kind of break through the drivers of what actually Delta needs to do to kind of secure this revenue benefit?","Ed Bastian","Dave, it\u2019s a good try. I\u2019ll give you the same answer I gave last time. We\u2019re under confidentiality and we can\u2019t give you those specific drivers in terms of \u2013 but it is all the above. Obviously, we\u2019re going to be investing alongside AmEx in new cardholder, not just acquisitions, but development in terms of spend and portfolio size and range and the opportunities to expand in that regard. Economics of the card obviously have improved itself in terms of coming back to Delta. So let\u2019s say, those are a couple of the main drivers.","David Vernon","Yes, I mean, I guess, its just trying to \u2013 it\u2019s hard to sort of handicap the certain new looks to put in \u2013 put that number to a model without really kind of understanding the drivers of kind of\u2026","Ed Bastian","Let me \u2013 yes, let me suggest that we have pretty good optimism on getting to the $7 billion in that timeframe we gave.","David Vernon","Okay, all right. And maybe just as a follow-up topic on a different subject. Transatlantic, when you mentioned that Europe is looking like it\u2019s firming up a little bit as we get into the summer months. There\u2019s a lot of speculation that there\u2019s going to be some new capacity added into that Transatlantic market. Can you talk a little bit about kind of Delta\u2019s experience in \u2013 on the yield curve when other sort of low-cost entrants maybe kind of came into that Transatlantic market and help us think through what some of the puts and takes for Delta could be if we do hear an announcement that another carrier maybe flying the Transatlantic soon?","Ed Bastian","Well, as you know, we\u2019ve faced and have faced significant competition from low-fare and ultra low-fare carriers in the Transatlantic for quite sometime, so this is not something new. And we\u2019re sitting in a very good position we think with our partnerships in the Transatlantic and with our core products and services that will continue to improve over the next months and years, so we feel very secure.","And as you look at Transatlantic capacity, there are always new entrants coming and there are always entrants leaving, if you will. So we\u2019ll see what the supply and demand balance is, but we\u2019ve had a very good couple of years in the Transatlantic and we expect that to continue.","David Vernon","But did you see material impact as sort of maybe Norwegian came into the market a few years ago or was it sort of part of the noise?","Ed Bastian","As you know, last year was one of the best years we\u2019ve had in many years in the Transatlantic, and this year is shaping up to be another great year. So I think the data points would suggest that we\u2019re in a very good spot.","David Vernon","All right. I appreciate the added color. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Hi, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Glen, sort of an arcane one to start. Could you give us a summary of interline agreements with U.S. and Canadian competitors? I realize it\u2019s a small part of the business. But to the extent that MAX cancellations continue, it would help to understand which airlines can send passengers over to you also if and when somebody does, is the fare you receive what the passenger paid fare was or is it something more akin to like a ID75 off your full fare?","Glen Hauenstein","Yes, I don\u2019t think we want to disclose the details of our interline agreements with our partners. But it is not the fare that the customers paid, we\u2019ll say that and we do have interline agreements with the two major US carriers that are our competitors and that\u2019s \u2013 two or the three that are experiencing those small cancellations.","Jamie Baker","Right.","Glen Hauenstein","I think now most of them have taken those out, so they are trying to get proactive and get way ahead of the re-accommodation, so we don\u2019t expect a significant number of day of departure re-accommodations from them.","Jamie Baker","Okay. And second, probably for Ed or Paul, on AmEx, how far ahead of the industry curve do you think that Delta is with the new terms, or actually \u2013 no, no, no, I\u2019ll scratch that, because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll answer, let me try it differently. If you were to rank the contributions to your margin premium, so if you rank the contributors to the margin premium and I gave you the categories of loyalty economics, domestic RASM premium, MRO, fleet and CASM, would those be the top 5? And what would be descending order of contribution be? Again, those categories are loyalty, RASM premium, MRO, fleet and CASM, you have 30 seconds.","Ed Bastian","It sounds like a 30-minute game show, Jamie. Listen, we are \u2013 we were clear in our comments that we \u2013 this contract extension will lead us to our goal of being not just the most valuable card in the industry, but one of the most valuable cards in consumer cards in the world. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re number one at this moment.","As we sit here within our industry, though I certainly expect over the next \u2013 the next few years, we should be number one. Relative ranking, I\u2019d have to give some thought to how you\u2019d want to \u2013 what kind of cost you like to allocate to all those revenue categories that you gave us.","Jamie Baker","Okay. I guess, we\u2019ll send you home with the home version of the board game then. I appreciate the answers all the same. Thank you, everybody.","Ed Bastian","Take care, Jamie.","Jamie Baker","Take care.","Operator","Now, we\u2019ll move to a question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Linenberg","Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, just two quick ones here. Hey, Ed, on the MRO, I recall a time, it was a few years back when Delta used to provide on a segment basis the profitability of your MRO, and I think the margins \u2013 operating margins were in the mid-teens. Is that consistent with the profitability of that business today?","Ed Bastian","Yes, it is.","Mike Linenberg","Okay, great. And then, just my second question and Ed, this is back to you. Just the headlines out about, possibility of tariffs on Airbus equipment. Would there be a distinction, if you know, for Airbus or aircraft may be narrow body aircraft coming out of Alabama, you know, that are built by American workers, any thoughts on that? I know it\u2019s early.","Ed Bastian","Well, I don\u2019t know, Mike. You know obviously, the aircraft that we\u2019re going to be taking next year out of mobile, you would think would be \u2013 should be exempt from a potential tariff issue.","Mike Linenberg","Yes.","Ed Bastian","But we\u2019ll wait and see.","Mike Linenberg","All right. All right, great thanks.","Jill Greer","Okay. We\u2019re going to have time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","And that question will come from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan McKenzie","Okay, good morning. Thanks guys. You know going back to the use of free cash flow this year, you know, Delta has done strategic investments really well. And without comment to what you may or may not do, I wonder if you can at least comment on whether there are any interesting opportunities that you\u2019re currently evaluating.","Ed Bastian","Such as?","Dan McKenzie","Strategic investment perhaps and, you know, another partner or at least a bigger investment in an existing partner?","Ed Bastian","Dan, as you know, we\u2019re not going to speculate on future strategic investments on the call. The one that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s out there that we have indicated we\u2019re discussions with is Alitalia and I \u2013 you know, I\u2019ve confirmed that several times publicly that we are talking to the rail system of Italy FS, as well as with the Alitalia.","Leadership in the Italian government about potentially making an investment, but it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not the size that I think we\u2019d wanted us to, you know, getting into a discussion of what that means for our use of free cash flow. I think that will \u2013 that will be an investment that\u2019s somewhat limited and we\u2019ll spend \u2013 we certainly haven\u2019t made a decision in terms of climbing on that.","Dan McKenzie","Understood. Second question is, you know, regarding the move to probably maintain the full-year EPS, you know, there is some macro noise around Brexit partly and some lower growth worries out of Europe, and, you know, I appreciate the positive revenue commentary on the Atlantic, you know, but on the UK piece of this, you know, what are you seeing today and, you know, can you just remind us what the UK component is to the overall revenue pie here just, you know, given the JVs?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, UK is about 20% to 25% if you include the virgin piece, and much less for us, and what we\u2019re seeing is actually fairly decent summer travel to the UK both in business and in coach, so we have \u2013 the second quarter, we\u2019re expecting UK unit revenues to be flat to up slightly. And so, while we have waited for years for the impact of Brexit on air travel, it has not yet materialized, and we\u2019ll keep a close eye on it and if we have to make adjustments, we will, but, you know, I think there is so much uncertainty around what it actually is, hard for us to action it at this time.","Ed Bastian","And to be clear on Glen\u2019s comments that 20% to 25% is [at the] Transatlantic JV not at Delta, so it was obviously a much smaller part of Delta.","Dan McKenzie","Yes, understood. Okay thanks for the time you guys.","Jill Greer","That\u2019s going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. Before we turn it over to media, I just want to say behalf of the entire IR team that you have been a fantastic partner for us.","Ed Bastian","Hey, thank you very much Jill.","Jill Greer","We look forward working with him and we\u2019d been lucky to work with and learn from one of the best. Now, we\u2019ll hand it over to the media team.","Ed Bastian","Great, Jill. If we could as we transition to the questions and answers from members of the media, if you\u2019d wouldn\u2019t mind just repeating the instructions and the reminder that we just like to keep the questions themselves as succinct and short as possible with one follow-up to allow us to get to as many of these as we possibly could.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll hear first from David Koenig with The Associated Press.","David Koenig","Hi, thanks for giving me this chance. I did have a question and a follow-up to one of the analyst questions on the Max cancellations and the interline agreements. Are those customers coming over on interline agreements? You know, how profitable are those? And I\u2019ll include my follow-up here, did you have any forecast status to how many additional passengers you might see because of Max related cancellations at your other airlines?","Ed Bastian","David, this is Ed. We \u2013 you know, it\u2019s \u2013 the Max, it represents a really small part of our industry\u2019s market share at this point, and we\u2019re not going to get into any specific details relative to the interline arrangements we have with some of our partners that maybe flying that product.","David Koenig","Does that mean you do not expect many passengers to come over on those?","Ed Bastian","I would expect the numbers are not going to be material to Delta.","David Koenig","Okay. Okay, thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll now hear from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters.","Tracy Rucinski","Hi, you indicated that the size any Alitalia stake would be limited. How large of a stake is Delta willing to take and what has held up a deal so far?","Ed Bastian","We are not going to speculate on either the size of our investment other than what we\u2019ve already said, or the time it\u2019s going to take to bring that to a conclusion.","Operator","Anything further Tracy?","Tracy Rucinski","No, that\u2019s it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Moving to Edward Russell with Flight Global.","Edward Russell","Yes. Paul you mentioned that Delta is accelerating the retirement of the MD-90s. Could you outline how \u2013 when does Delta plan to remove the MD-90 fleet?","Paul Jacobson","Well, what I mentioned in my comments is that we\u2019re considering that we expect to make that announcement in the quarter at which point we can provide more details on exact timing, replacement, etcetera.","Edward Russell","Okay. And then, a second question on premium products. What is \u2013 how is Delta viewing \u2013 I mean shrinking your business cabins on some of your new aircraft, the 777 200, I mean how do you view premium demand when you\u2019re \u2013 you know, for upfront cabin that are shrinking on these light bodies?","Ed Bastian","So, we don\u2019t look at it as reducing the number of premium seats because we\u2019re introducing an entirely new cabin on the airplane, so what we\u2019re trying to do is best match the consumer demand with the products and services that we have. So, if you look at the total premium seats on those airplanes, they\u2019re actually increasing as we introduce Delta Premium Select to the international marketplace and that will be complete, but on all of the international light bodies by 2021, and we\u2019re very excited with the initial returns that customers are selecting that.","I think when we look back at what customers wanted to buy from us years back, we had coach and then we had a flight bed and there were so many opportunities to satisfy consumer demands in between. So now having all five cabins available I think we feel very comfortable with the size of each one of those.","Edward Russell","Thank you very much.","Glen Hauenstein","Jake, we have time for one final question please.","Operator","And that last question will come from Elliott Blackburn with Argus Media.","Elliott Blackburn","Good morning and thanks. I squeeze in again. I just hope to get an update on the progress Delta has made on efforts to trying to partner at the Trainer refinery?","Ed Bastian","Sure. We -- you know, as we as stated in January, we continued to work through that. That is a \u2013 it\u2019s been a long process because it\u2019s been a complex one. We still do that. We have no update to that guidance at this point.","Elliott Blackburn","And I guess if there is any kind of outlook you can give on, you know, the role of that refinery within Delta going forward. Does it take on any greater or lesser importance as we see kind of forecast for higher distillate prices next year and kind of a general rising jet fuel environment? What\u2019s kind of your longer-term outlook on the facility?","Ed Bastian","Sure. The refinery has always been a strong asset for Delta and the process that we outlined was in an effort to try to find ways to strategically enhance that value to Delta.","But as we look at both the forward curves out \u2013 in the out years, the potential prospects of increased prices of jet fuel as it relates to IMO 2020, there\u2019s obviously a forward view of profitability at that refinery which will serve as a very effective counter effect to increasing fuel prices, not only the direct production from the refinery, but also the fact that we\u2019ve been able to use that production to lower our prices throughout the country and throughout all the sites where we purchase jet fuel has created a sustainable advantage for Delta and we don\u2019t expect that to change under any circumstance.","Elliott Blackburn","Thanks very much","Jill Greer","With that, I would like to close by thanking everybody for their time today, particularly thanking everybody for their time today, particularly thanking Ed, Glen, and Paul for their comments. I\u2019d add my personal thanks to Ned for his help during these weeks of transition and thank everyone again for your time and we will see you on July 11 for second quarter.","Operator","And everyone that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

My name is Augusta, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I would like to now turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Augusta. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. With us in Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta's financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flows. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.","And with that, here's Ed.","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Jill. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Earlier today, we reported our full-year results, including a December quarter pretax profit of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.30, both of which were at the top end of expectations that we gave you at the start of the quarter. Our top line grew 7% in the quarter. This solid performance combined with our best non-fuel unit cost result of the year offset a $500 million increase in fuel expense. The December quarter marked a successful step on our path to improve margin performance, with our pretax margin expanding over last year's even if excluding the one-time gain from our DGS transaction.","2018 was a successful year for Delta as we delivered strong results for our customers and our owners. Our earnings per share improved nearly 20% over the prior year, and we returned $2.5 billion back to our owners. We ended the year with a 11.6% pretax margin, and a return on invested capital of 14.2%. Notably, our $5.1 billion in pretax income was only 3% below 2017, despite a 30% increase in our fuel expense. The last time we saw a 30% annual fuel increase was 2011, and that year earnings fell approximately 25%. This really sums up the resiliency of our business and how different Delta is.","For our customers, Delta's operation is the best in the industry, and 2018 was another record-setting year. We ended the year with 143 days without a single cancellation across the entire Delta system, including both mainline and Delta Connection, exceeding 2017's full-year record of 90 days. For our mainline product alone, we had a record-breaking 251 days without a cancellation, delivering an on-time arrival rate of 85.7%. This exceptional performance by our operations team resulted in Delta being named 2018's Most On-time Global Airline by FlightGlobal for the second year in a row.","Running a great operation is the foundation for high customer satisfaction. When combined with the great service our employees provide and the investments we've made in our product, we're creating some of the most loyal customers in the airline industry. We drove improvement in net promoter scores during 2018 in every region of the world. Our domestic net promoter score has tripled over the last decade and reached an all-time high in September of over 50%. All of these results were a reflection of the incredible work of the Delta people, and I'm pleased to recognize our employees' outstanding performance this year with over $1 billion in profit sharing for the fifth consecutive year.","As we move into 2019, while fuel volatility has been a major story in the last few months, prices now sit almost exactly where they were a year ago, and by the way where we thought they would be. This, coupled with strong non-fuel unit cost control should position us well for cost stability in the New Year. The revenue environment remains solid. After 8% top line growth last year, we are assuming a modest reduction in global economic growth rates for 2019. We expect top line growth to be 5% this quarter, a rate we are also anticipating for the full year as we communicated last month at our Investor Day.","Our revenues to China, a market that's driving some trade and travel concerns, grew 27% in the fourth quarter, and we expect a similar level of growth this quarter. Most importantly for Delta, the domestic revenue environment, which accounts for approximately 70% of our total passenger revenue, continues to do well. Corporate revenues grew 8% in 2018, and recent bookings show this trend continuing.","Now, with respect to the government shutdown, we are seeing some pressure on our business. On the revenue front, we're experiencing about $25 million per month in lower government travel. The bigger impact is on our operation; with non-essential work at the FAA shutdown, our Airbus 220 start date is likely to be pushed back due to delays in the certification process. This is also hampering our ability to put seven other new aircraft deliveries into service, but it's our customers who are seeing the biggest impact, with longer lines at airport security.","We are working closely with TSA on any steps we can take to minimize these delays, including mobilizing Delta employees to perform nonessential aspects of the security process. We strongly encourage our elected officials to do their very best to resolve their differences and get our government fully open as quickly as possible.","In summary, 2018 was a strong year for our customers, owners, and employees. We experienced significant top line demand growth for our product, our operational reliability was record setting, and our brand has never been more healthy. Despite a $2 billion fuel headwind, we generated double-digit margins, topping $5 billion in profits for the fourth year in a row, and we expect 2019 will build on these strengths and deliver a great year of returns for our stakeholders. The demand environment is solid, and our cost base should be stable, resulting in improved earnings and cash flows for our owners, and while we're certainly mindful of the challenges that exist, macro trends, currency headwinds, and extended government shutdown, our team has built a great foundation for our business, and Delta is well positioned for success in 2019.","And now, I'll turn it over to Glen to discuss the revenue environment.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks, Ed, and good morning everyone. 2018 was a strong year for Delta. Demand for our product and the affinity for the Delta brand has never been higher. I'd like to thank the Delta team for delivering record revenue and operational results this year, and our customers for their continued loyalty and support. For the full year, revenue grew 8% to nearly $44 billion on unit revenue growth of 4.3%, with a record revenue premium of 112%. Passenger unit revenues improved in all entities for the first time since 2012, with demand strength in both Corporate and Leisure segments throughout the year. Corporate average fares improved 5% and returned to 2016 levels. Non-ticket revenue streams were strong as we diversified our revenue base. Cargo revenue grew 16%, and MRO was up 19%, both producing double-digit margins.","Our close relationship with American Express is a source of competitive advantage. In 2018, we drove $360 million of incremental value for a total contribution of $3.4 billion. During 2018, we set a new record with over 1 million co-brand acquisitions, and spend across the card portfolio grew double digits. In the December quarter, revenue grew 7% on a 3.2% unit revenue improvement. Corporate revenues grew 7% in the December quarter on both volume and fare improvements with growth across almost all sectors. Revenues from premium products were up 10% in the December quarter on a 4% increase in premium capacity.","On December 7th, Miles as a Currency launched, allowing our customers to redeem miles for post-purchase upgrades. Initial customer response has been strong, with over 30,000 flight upgrades purchased within the first month, driving a 2.5 point increase in upsell on Delta.com. Miles on Mobile will roll out later this month, and we plan to deliver much more additional functionality as we move through 2019.","Turning to specific entity performance in the quarter, domestic revenues increased 7.7% on 2.6% higher unit revenues. Both business and leisure revenues grew 8%, and we continue to set records for domestic revenue premium. This is noteworthy given an industry-leading increase in both stage length and gauge. Internationally, we saw the revenue growth of 4.8% on 2.3 points higher unit revenues. Our Latin region returned to positive unit revenue growth of 1% in the December quarter. The Caribbean was the best performing sub entity with 5% unit revenue improvement, and we are really pleased to see recovery taking hold on Mexico, where we posted a 3% rise in growth.","In the Pacific, unit revenues were relatively flat year-over-year, with significant increase in stage and currency headwinds offset by strong demand. Japan and Korea saw mid to high single-digit unit revenue growth, with Korea posting the strongest performance. Transatlantic unit revenues increased 4.1 points, but we started to see some cautionary signs in the quarter, in addition to more pronounced currency headwinds. The strength of our absolute performance was unfortunately overshadowed by the 1 point miss to our guidance midpoint. This was attributable to two main factors. First, we gave guidance near the peak of fuel prices, and expected fuel recapture initiatives did not materialize.","Second, the early Thanksgiving in 2018 created the longest possible calendar period between the holidays, and revenue during these weeks, while strong, was not as robust as expected potentially due to consumer fatigue during this extended period. Retailers have reported seeing similar trends. Good news here is that January traffic and yields have returned to pre-holiday levels, and demand is back on plan. Looking forward, March quarter total revenue is expected to increase 4% to 6%, with adjusted unit revenue growth of flat to up to on a 4% higher capacity. The two-point sequential change in unit revenue from the December quarter is due to a half-point impact from Easter shifting to late April, a half-point from the timing of JV settlements, and a full point of trends in Europe currency and the government shutdown.","We are optimistic about domestic performance for the March quarter. Leisure and corporate demand remain healthy, with strong bookings for the upcoming MLK and President's Day holidays, as well as the spring break period, and the overall outlook for corporate travel is positive. In our most recent survey, 90% of travel managers expected to maintain or increase their travel spend into 2019. This is a two-point improvement over the last survey we did a year ago.","For January, on-hand corporate bookings are already up 7% year-over-year with both fares and passenger volumes continuing to improve. Domestic capacity growth for the industry and for Delta is moderate in compared to 2018, and we are seeing improved competitive outlook in Delta hubs. For the March quarter, Latin will be our best-performing international entity driven by the Caribbean and Mexico. Brazil remains challenging as Delta is committed to improving profitability by trimming marginal capacity.","With capacity plans down approximately 20% in 2019, we expect Brazil to become rising contributor as the year progresses. In the Pacific, stage length and currency headwinds will persist into the first-half of 2019. For the March quarter unit revenues are expected to remain flattish, but profitability will improve as we capitalize on cost efficiencies from new aircraft, upgraded products and services, and further integrate our Korean joint venture products.","In the Transatlantic, we see some cautionary signs in the March quarter. This is the entity expected to be the most challenged. We have seen leisure and corporate impacts in France due to the domestic unrest, and when you combine this with uncertainty of Brexit, a more pronounced currency headwind and the timing of the Easter, which historically impacts this entity the most, we expect modest negative unit revenues for the March quarter. While current trends are not as robust as what we saw in 2018, we are confident that the summer will be strong based on early bookings. We are watching this region closely given the uncertainty and are prepared to adjust capacity as we approach the next shoulder season.","In closing, a more diversified revenue base across geographies and products along with a continued pipeline of Delta-specific initiatives give us confidence in our plan of 46% revenue growth in 2019, delivering on this target while also expanding margins is a top priority for Delta.","And with that, I would like to turn to my good friend, Paul, to discuss the financials.","Paul Jacobson","Thanks, Glen. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Changing our cost trajectory was the top priority for the finance team in 2018, and I am pleased to say that December quarter non-fuel unit costs were down 0.5%. Importantly, our full-year unit cost growth of 1.4% marked an inflection in our cost trajectory, putting us back within our long-term target of keeping unit cost growth below 2%.","I would like to thank the entire Delta team for their hard work and innovative thinking. Our operating units are executing well on cost, achieving lower non-fuel chasm year-over-year, which is helping to offset overhead pressure from fleet and facility investments. Hats off Gill and the operations team for a job well done. Our 2018 performance and initiates underway, give us confidence in our path to 1% non-fuel cost growth in 2019.","In the March quarter, we expect non-fuel unit cost to increase 1% to 2%. Relative to the December quarter, there is incremental cost pressure for maintenance timing ahead of summer flying with about half of the full-year increase in maintenance occurring in the first quarter and creating approximately 1.5 points of pressure.","Despite this pressure and as evidenced by the midpoint of our chasm guide, we expect each quarter of the year to be 1.5% or lower, which this quarter is expected to be the high water mark and is consistent with our guidance at Investor Day. In 2019, we expect an additional $350 million of benefit from One Delta beyond the $150 million realized in 2018, and we'll continue to see benefits from re-fleeting as we replace aging narrow bodies throughout the year.","Turning to fuel, our total fuel expense drove $508 million of pressure in the December quarter. Our all-in fuel price of $2.42 per gallon was 25% higher than prior year. While market prices moderated significantly from the beginning of the quarter, inventory pre-purchases and the scheduled maintenance turnaround at the refinery drove a $0.16 headwind during the quarter.","For the March quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to be roughly flat to last year. Some of this is driven by a loss at the refinery of approximately $40 million due to lower gasoline crack. We currently forecast March quarter earnings of $0.70 to $0.90 per share, an approximately 10% improvement over prior year at the midpoint. This equates to a March quarter pretax margin in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% compared to last year's 7.1%.","Our full-year results in 2018 were impacted by two unique items, the sale of 51% of our Delta Global Services business, and early adoption of the new lease accounting standard. These two items together increased 2018 earnings per share by $0.14, adjusted for profit sharing, with the majority of that benefit coming in non-operating expense.","As we said at investor day, in 2019, in we expect non-operating expense to be $450 million to $500 million. This is $350 million to $400 million higher than 2018 primarily due to a lower pension benefit and the lapping of the gain from the DGS sale. And finally, our strong cash generation and healthy balance sheet allowed to Delta to execute on investment opportunities and consistently return capital to shareholders. During 2018, we generated $7 billion of operating cash flow, and invested $4.7 billion back into the business, resulting in free cash flow o $2.3 billion. In 2019, we expect to produce roughly $8 billion in operating cash flow, and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion, which is more than 50% higher than last year, and represents an approximate 10% free cash flow yield at our current stock price.","As outlined at investor day, we are planning capital spending of $4.5 billion in 2019 as we continue to replace our fleet and invest in our product and technology. 80% of this spend is fleet related, including the replacement of less efficiency narrow bodies. Our investments are transforming our fleet to drive margin benefits through higher customer satisfaction, increased premium seats, and significant cost efficiency gains. For the first quarter, we expect capital spending of roughly $1.3 billion as we take delivery of 29 aircraft in the quarter. We remain committed to consistent return of capital to our owners as well. In the December quarter, we returned $325 million in share repurchases and $238 million in dividends, for a total of $2.5 billion returned to shareholders for the year. We expect a similar level in 2019, in line with our target of returning 70% of free cash flow to shareholders annually.","Over the past five years, we have reduced our fully diluted share count by more than 20%, returning more than $12 billion through dividends and share buybacks, with a current dividend yield of nearly 3%. Importantly, we've done that while also reducing our debt and our pension liability, improving the health of our balance sheet. We are comfortable with the current level of debt, and as we highlighted in investor day, we have moved to a long-term leverage ratio target of 1.5 to 2.5 times adjusted debt to EBITDAR. This ratio was 1.9 at the end of 2018. Our targeted range should allow us to maintain investment grade ratings through a business cycle, and also includes the incremental lease liabilities recognized with the adoption of lease accounting.","At year-end, our pension funded status was 68%, with an unfunded pension liability of $6.4 billion. Our 2018 planned asset returns underperformed our target of 9% by about 14 points. This return shortfall will reduce our pension benefit in 2019, contributing to the year-over-year pressure in non-operating expense. Looking back on 2018, I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished at Delta. We successfully navigated challenges and have positioned the company for another year of solid top line growth, and more importantly margin expansion, which should drive double-digit growth in our earnings and free cash flow in 2019. As Ed said at the outset of this call, this performance is enabled by the Delta difference, our combination of the powerful brand coupled with our unmatched competitive advantages continue to deliver industry-leading results, and drive long-term value for our owners.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A.","Jill Greer","Augusta, we are ready for questions from the analysts, if you could give instructions on how to get into the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning everyone, and thanks for taking my question. So I guess Ed or Glen, I mean you guys mentioned challenges from European economies that look maybe a little bit slower this year, the government shutdown here in the U.S., maybe some lingering challenges in the Pacific and Latin. So, I guess when we look at capacity growth, I think scheduled right now in 2Q is about 4.6. What's the ability to take capacity down if some of these trends continue or even worsen from here?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, first of all, we're very encouraged by -- you kind of characterized this global slowdown as all the same, and I'd like to put some qualifiers on there. We're actually quite excited about the Latin trajectory. If you recall, this is the first quarter after two quarters of it being negative that it's returned to positive, and we see Latin accelerating as we move into 1Q and then throughout the year. We see very solid returns in the domestic. And remember, last year was a really great year for the Transatlantic, one of the best years we've ever had.","So being in the flattish in the off-peak season is really -- I wouldn't characterize it as something that we're fearful of, but we're going to keep a very close eye as we read all these papers and we read the current events, we see what's going on in France, the still uncertainty over Brexit finally coming to a head here, but we know the summer in Europe is going to be great with lower fuel prices, so we're really looking more towards the back-half of the year and do we need to make additional adjustments when we get past the summer peak, and we'll keep a close eye on that, and we'll report back to you.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay, I appreciate that, Glen. And I guess we've heard it from FedEx too that maybe Europe is incrementally slow from here, so that's why I asked. But thinking more broadly, if the market is really concerned here that the economy will slow, because it's not necessarily slowing right now, with 35% of your passenger revenue tied up in premium products, should investors be thinking that maybe the Delta business now is more cyclical than maybe it was in the past? And I think at the analyst day you guys tried to answer that and said, you said look, the spread between a premium ticket and the economy ticket actually isn't that far off, so we don't think so, but can you give folks maybe some additional ideas on why this may not be as cyclical as folks think?","Ed Bastian","Well, I think there's two things we should talk about in that question, and the first is the disparity between the higher ending corporate travel and the lower ending leisure. The spread between those, absent other premium products, is at an all-time low. If you think about what's happened over the past couple of years, leisure fares have continued to increase, and we've had very stubborn corporate yields. And while we return to 2016 levels, we're still far off the peaks that occurred many, many years back. So if you think about the last cycle or some of the big cycles, we had really big differentials in the realized fare from corporate versus leisure, and those at a macro level have never been closer if you were thinking how does the next cycle play out.","So, I think that's a very big issue we need to talk more about because that should make it, the whole industry, a lot less cyclical. And then in the premium products, I think if there was a tick down in demand, we're more than confident that all of the new products and services and the way we're distributing and the broadness that we're able to offer, including their Pay with Miles feature and things like that, we would be able to offset weakness in demand by bringing new ways to buy the product into the marketplace. So really confident on both those, and we should probably talk more about that as we move through the year. We hear a lot of your concerns about where we are in the cycle, and while we haven't really seen any weakness in domestic, we are mindful that we are many years into this expansion, and eventually we will face a recessionary or contractionary environment, and we're planning for it, and we'll tell you more about why we feel so confident that we will weather the next cycle so much better.","Brandon Oglenski","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Yes, hey. Two quick ones here; Glen, you had highlighted the headwinds on RASM in the March quarter, and I heard government shutdown in currency is like a point, Easter shift is a half-a-point. What was -- there was another thing you mentioned, another 50 basis points, what was that again?","Glen Hauenstein","There was foreign exchange and JV settlements.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, the JV settlement piece. Okay.","Glen Hauenstein","And that's really just a timing issue of when they come in and when they go out. That should balance out throughout the year.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. And then just my second question, there was commentary about how strong sales were to China, and then there was some positive commentary about Japan and Korea, and I noticed that the Pacific RASM was down a smidge. What was driving that? Is that more stage length? Is there another part of the Pacific, like Australia, where you're just -- you're seeing a lot of weakness?","Ed Bastian","No, most of that -- all of it is stage lengt,h because in China, as you know, we discontinued the Narita to Shanghai route, and replaced it with Atlanta to Shanghai, so the RASM, while it's lower, the profit potentials are significantly higher, and so that's what driving a slightly negative Chinese unit revenue, but all based on stage length.","Michael Linenberg","Great, that makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Hey, good morning. Just a clarification from Glen, on the domestic commentary you mentioned solid trends. So just outside of Easter and maybe kind of the government shutdown should we assume that the magnitude is similar at least at the core level?","Glen Hauenstein","Yes, I think we're very confident. We had that little blip in December, right around the holiday. But as January and everybody came back from work we are back on track. And the corporate trends and the leisure demand look very similar to what we saw in the earlier part of 4Q.","Savi Syth","That's helpful. And just a follow-up on the Trainer -- the color that you provided, Paul, that was helpful. Just trying to understand what's driving the loss in 1Q and how we should think about it as the year progresses?","Paul Jacobson","Sure, Savi. Good morning, and thanks for that question. There are two big impacts year-over-year with Trainer, one is the difference in gasoline cracks, they're trading at pretty historic lows right now, which is putting some pressure on the production at Trainer on a year-over-year basis. The second was we benefited last year from a slight revaluation of a RINs liability that we were holding from 2017. So with those lower RINs prices -- RINs have been traded relatively flat. We've satisfied our 2017 and '18 obligation to date, so that's a smaller impact, but it's primarily driven by those lower gasoline cracks, which we expect should reverse over the year, especially as we get in to summer season.","Savi Syth","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse.","Joe Caiado","Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. First question is for Paul on unit costs. I appreciate the color on the timing of the maintenance spend here in Q1 and the expected cadence for the year. But at a high level, can you just talk about where you see the biggest risks and opportunities in your cost structure to either materially outperform or underperform your 1% CASM-Ex target for the year?","Paul Jacobson","Sure. Good morning, Joe. We've come out of 2018 with a lot of momentum that we expect to continue into 2019, so I'm optimistic on our One Delta initiatives in particular as we continue to progress and get better at that enterprise level of thinking, but I'm also optimistic about the fleet efficiencies that we'll get. We'll take approximately 60 airplanes in the first-half of the year, and as that phases in over time we start to realize some of those efficiencies going forward. So again, I reiterate the optimism in conveyed at investor day, feel very confident about our 1% goal and the timing of maintenance was fully expected in that when we gave that guidance on a quarterly basis.","Joe Caiado","Okay, thanks. And then a question for Glen on cargo, I was curious if you could give us some more color on what you're seeing in the cargo operation, particularly across the Pacific, and what you're seeing there in terms of volumes and yields, and whether or not it makes sense for us to think of that as potentially being a leading indicator of what we might see in passenger demand?","Gil West","Yes, this is Gil West. Just a couple of comments on cargo; first, the cargo business had an exceptionally strong year in 2018, as you probably know, revenues were up over $100 million or 16% as Glen mentioned, due large part to the yield performance. So despite lapping some pretty challenging comps year-over-year, we're seeing yield performance continue to hold strong. We do see some volume pressures, some geography to that, as you allude to, that's occurring. But I will say revenue growth, while it's moderating, is still up single digits driven primarily by yield performance.","Joe Caiado","And should we view that as a potentially leading indicator of what we might see with volumes on the passenger demand side, or is that not the right way to think about it?","Gil West","I think you've got to think about what's going on with the tariffs in the more macro sense, and how people are trying to offset tariffs with it. They're using air or sea and I think we could always look at leading economic indicators, but we are very, very close when we look at that passenger revenue side, and we don't see the same trends translating into the passenger revenue side, and I think we don't try to get ahead of ourselves, we try and size what their revenue is going to be as quickly as we can, and then we make the appropriate decisions.","Joe Caiado","Understood, and appreciate all the color, thanks everyone.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew Didora","Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First question for Glen; now that you 're breaking up a premium product versus main cabin, now I did notice that growth in premium revenues did decelerate a little bit to up 10 in 4Q versus, I think, you're tracking like a mid-teens rate earlier in the year. What changed here, and really interested in Glen, getting your thoughts on you know, how -- what's your read on this? Do you view how this premium revenue bucket has a good read across for corporate spend?","Glen Hauenstein","No, I think you got one thing -- two things going on. One, is the base is increasing dramatically, so we didn't expect that we would be in the mid to high teens as the base continued to grow, and second is that the quarter had the least number of premium seats in it that we'll have over any quarter. So we were tracking at about plus eight on the premium seat count. This quarter was about plus four, and as we go into '19, that number will go back up to plus six. So your ability to sell premium is also related to the inventory you have and the 4Q number was the lowest inventory growth that we'll have for the next few quarters.","Andrew Didora","Oh, got it, that makes sense. And then my second question revolves around more on the government shutdown, and look I appreciate that this is a pretty fluid situation, but -- I know you guys called out a lack of corporate contracts on the government side traveling, but have you seen anything in your bookings, or conversations with your corporate travel managers that would indicate that maybe corporates might be beginning to delay travel given the crowding issues that have popped up at the airports, or is that not in the conversation, yet, thanks?","Ed Bastian","Andrew, this is Ed. No, we're not seeing any evidence that before looking at this extended shutdown as anything other than something that's going to be resolved hopefully soon.","Andrew Didora","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Well, go next to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Thank you. Good morning.","Ed Bastian","Good morning.","Paul Jacobson","Good morning.","Hunter Keay","Hey, Paul. Good morning. So Paul, that pension plan return of -5%, what happened there? I think you guys said in your 10-K you get about 40%, 50% of gross seeking assets. I'm wondering if that's what drove it, and how are you thinking about that pension plan asset allocation, given some of the comments you made about maybe some concerns you may be starting to having around global economic growth?","Paul Jacobson","Sure, Hunter. So as you know, the pension plan has a pretty long life, and with a approximate 9% expected return, we tend to be heavily weighted toward equities. It was a challenging year in the equity markets across the board, but particularly in global stocks around emerging markets, et cetera. We're always looking at ways to tweak that, but we do that through a lens of a long-term expected return matching that, that liability profile. So be careful not to overreact, but at the same time we want to manage that exposure prudently.","Hunter Keay","Okay. And then, maybe this is a question for Glen. Do you know how many seats, do you want to maybe take a stab at quantifying this, Glen, you know how many seats go unsold relative to your target, like maybe seven or 10 days before the flight today, and maybe how that's changed in the era of well, oil prices or higher industry capacity growth, and basically wondering if the industry is just a little bit more geared, particularly you guys, I should think, Delta, is just a little bit more geared towards that last minute, seven-day AP window than maybe you were five, six years ago? Can you provide any data around that for me?","Glen Hauenstein","Yes, I think when you look at where we have been going into each one of the months in 2018 and into 2019, we've entered the months actually ahead in load factor. So we've actually become a little bit less reliant on the very close end demand, and that's really where we want to continue to position ourselves in '18 as with a little bit less risk on the table as we head into each one of the months.","Hunter Keay","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","We'll go next to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thanks. Just with your commentary about aircraft induction delays, I think I understand that the A220 in certification process, but I think you mentioned some other aircraft types. Can you just expand on why this shutdown is driving delays?","Gil West","Gil. Of course, the A220, we've talked about, I think. There is some potential impact on some other fleets, namely, the A330900neos and it gets back into certification issues that we certify seats and crew rest and things of that nature, Wi-Fi systems that with the government shutdown become problematic for us. So there's not an immediate impact, but it certainly could have a impact, downstream, on us.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks, that's helpful, and then with the A220s, specifically, can you just remind us what aircraft types are those replacing? So in other words, are you going to be parking 717s, and are these delays part of what is driving maybe some maintenance pressure in the short run as you keep these older aircraft around?","Gil West","Duane, I think you're overthinking it. We're not expecting this to be an extended delay and the primary aircraft the initial 220s are replacing are really long range two class RJs of course, some MD-80s as well.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll go to next to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning, everybody, first one for Glen. I'm guessing the majority of your passengers that do fly in government fares have SkyMiles accounts. Can you give us a feel for how much these passengers drive in terms of non-government spend? I mean, for somebody in tech or finance, you know, their personal spend is a fraction of what their annual corporate spend probably is. I just don't really know how that dynamic looks for a typical government employee, obviously, trying to figure out the knock-on effect on leisure spend even if the government were to reopen tomorrow?","Glen Hauenstein","Right. We're trying to quantify that right now. As you might imagine, it's kind of difficult to figure out all of the implications because you have multiple dimensions there, but that's -- our estimate of $25 million includes all of those components. So it's not just\u2026","Jamie Baker","Oh, it does?","Glen Hauenstein","Yes.","Jamie Baker","But presumably, any reduced leisure spend by government employees in January wouldn't have manifested in January, I mean, you don't come back from vacation and then start working and then go on another vacation, right, so that's in your future -- somewhere else in the quarter in other words?","Glen Hauenstein","Exactly. I mean, we'll see how long\u2026","Jamie Baker","Okay.","Glen Hauenstein","We'll see how long this occurs, and we could revise that if it's long and expands, but right now that's what we're thinking, $25 million.","Jamie Baker","Okay. And second and probably for Paul, I mean, Ed answered the question about you know, at point A220 delays might pressure -- CASM, but is there any lingering impact from all the tariff noise, I haven't been paying close attention recently. Not sure, which plant you're taking the aircraft from, also have you figured out the network impact? Are these going to be spread far and wide eventually, or should we think of a 220 as, I don't know, or of a Boston plane or a Seattle plane, or something like that? Just wondering how they fit within the domestic network construct?","Paul Jacobson","I think you're right in your assumption that they'll be primarily focused on the coastal gateways as opposed to the interior hubs where we can drive more cost efficiency and higher volumes.","Jamie Baker","Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.","Paul Jacobson","Right. ","Operator","We'll go next to Helane Becker with Cowen.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much [technical difficulty]","Ed Bastian","Helane, we can't hear you, could you repeat your question?","Helane Becker","Oh, can you hear [technical difficulty]\u2026","Ed Bastian","No, we can't hear you.","Helane Becker","Well, Operator, can you open the right line?","Operator","There you are, Helane.","Helane Becker","Is that better?","Ed Bastian","Yes.","Helane Becker","Oh, good, okay. I think there's just a problem with me calling in from London, and my office calling in from New York. Just a question on TechOps, and that -- I didn't hear you talk about that, but could you just talk about the cadence for revenue growth in that business, and how that's shaping up your -- and maybe the first half of the year that would offset the other pressures that you're seeing in maintenance?","Gil West","Sure. This is Gil. So, our MRO business and TechOps, you know, again had a great year in 2018. They pushed a little over 700 million, up a 100 million year-over-year. We see a similar trend in 2019, a little more moderated growth, but still pushing probably close to 800 million. Longer term though, as you probably know, we've made investments in our capabilities, new engine shop, new test sell, all that as a foundation to introduce two new engine type fleets into our MRO that work the gear turbo fan Pratt Whitney engine and the Rolls Royce Trent series engine, and then longer term as that revenue ramps, we will see over a billion dollars a year incremental revenue from those two engine titles.","Helane Becker","From those alone not including the other business?","Gil West","That's correct.","Helane Becker","Great. Okay. Well thanks everybody. Thanks for being patient.","Gil West","Thanks, Helane.","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Helane.","Operator","We will go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi","Yes, good morning. Paul, the ROI of 9% is about as high in assumption as I've seen, can you just talk about the sustainability of that, what the knock-on effects would be, if you lowered it, and whether lowering it is contemplated in your earnings guidance for '19?","Paul Jacobson","Sure, Joe. Good morning. The 9% expected return assumption is at the high end of corporate plans, but remember that our plan is unique, not only to Delta in the airline industry, but to all corporate plans because of airline relief. So what we have done is taken an approach where we've proactively funded with a little bit more of an aggressive return profile, because we have the time to do that with airline relief with having fully met our minimum obligations through 2024. So, it has always been in our plans that we would work on reducing the risk in that portfolio as we get closer to fully funded, but what I would say is the long-term returns of that plan, as we've thought about it over the last 10 years have been wholly consistent with that strategy of trying to drive a better funded status through both contributions and investment returns, and that will change over time, but there's no change contemplated in the rate in 2019.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay, that's helpful. And then Glen, I just have a two-part revenue question for you; first is, I think your agreement with AmEx probably comes up in a couple years typically when both parties are happy though they'll extend that early, so can you just talk about the timing of that, and what sort of revenue opportunity that could offer you? And then whether you've changed the way that you guide based on kind of the challenge you've had over the past couple years of hitting guidance, whether first quarter guidance is different than it has been? Thank you.","Glen Hauenstein","Well, we don't comment on any potential negotiations. So I'll defer on the first one, but on the second one, we clearly have heard our investors that they want us to make sure that we hit our targets and we -- while we get hit inside the range, 3.2 is in the range of three to five we know that we lowered in order, and so we're examining that and I'd say we don't want to miss again, it's too painful for everybody.","Joseph DeNardi","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.","Catherine O'Brien","Good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. So, first question just on business travel, I usually think about business travel being booked within seven days, but I could imagine booking curves for international business travel could be slightly longer in average. So, could you maybe talk about the differences in the booking window you see between regions, and then is there a region in particular maybe where that that booking curve is longer or shorter, or you build in more cushion or less cushion to your forecast? Thanks. That's my first question.","Paul Jacobson","Sure, yes. You can kind of think of the booking curve related to how far the trip is. So, the further you go around the world, the earlier the general booking curve is. ","Very short haul things like Atlanta to Jacksonville, Atlanta to Orlando, New York to Atlanta have closing booking window as well. New York to China, or New York to Japan, or Atlanta to Japan, we have very long booking window. So that's the general rule of thumb. What was -- there was another part of that?","Catherine O'Brien","Yes, and then the second part was just keeping that in mind, do you build in more or less cushion, given some of these longer booking windows for international into your forecast than you might for domestic?","Paul Jacobson","Oh, of course, the way we build our forecast is really what's happening in the last few weeks versus what happened in the last few months versus what's happened in the last few years. So, it's a very complicated mathematical equation, and for those that have longer booking windows, we clearly take that into account.","Catherine O'Brien","Understood, and if I could just ask a quick follow-up on the government shutdown math. So, when you're saying $25 million a month, -- are you just in the march quarter guidance, are you just thinking that in for the month of January, or I know that you said, there's a point for your flowing government shutdown, and maybe FX, is the government shutdown most of that point or how should we think about that?","Ed Bastian","Catherine, this is Ed. We're not going to speculate what's going to happen with the government shutdown. We commented on the $25 million, so people can see what the current run rate is. It's one of the risks that we considered in coming up with our overall unit revenue guide, but I don't think we should get that level of precision into the guidance.","Catherine O'Brien","Understood. Thank you very much.","Jill Greer","I guess that we're going to have time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","And that will come from David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First question is really again a continuation of some of the government questions, but I guess [technical difficulty] so maybe baked into the one quarter guide associated with the shutdown or how long this thing would happen to go before you have to be worried about some of the cost guidance for the year?","Glen Hauenstein","David, we lost your first part of your question, could you repeat it?","David Vernon","Oh, sorry. The question was -- like trying to dimension whether or not there's any of the government shutdown cost associated with aircrafts delay, stuff like that in the guidance, and how long we would need to see this go before you'd be worried about an impact to the unit cost guide, either in 1Q or for the year?","Glen Hauenstein","We don't expect it to have a meaningful impact on the unit cost guide in either the quarter or the year.","David Vernon","Okay. And then Paul, maybe just as a quick follow-up, could you give us a sense for how non-op expense should look for the full-year?","Paul Jacobson","As we talked about, David, non-op expense is going to be pretty even throughout the year, that pressure from the pension gets spread evenly throughout the year. So, it should be pretty consistent.","David Vernon","Okay, thank you very much for the clarifications.","Jill Greer","That's going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll hand it over to Ned Walker.","Ned Walker","Okay. Hey, thanks very much, Jill. Good day, everyone. We will go ahead and begin the Media Q&A at this time. I'd like to ask everyone if they could ask one question with the brief follow-up. That way, we should be able to accommodate almost everyone, and Augusta, if you could review the process for asking a question, we'll go ahead and begin.","Operator","Thank you. Again, it is now the media portion of the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We will pause for just a moment.","We'll go first to Andrew Tangel with The Wall Street Journal.","Andrew Tangel","Hi, there. Wondering about the shutdown and long lines, can you give us some idea of how much you're seeing in a way of passengers getting delayed, missing flights, maybe missing connections at customs, if there are shorting stoppages, and what kind of financial impact is that having on Delta, and have you been able to measure that as a material in any way in terms of rebooking cost and so forth?","Ed Bastian","Andrew, this is Ed. We're not seeing a meaningful impact. The operations are running on schedule, on time, our team is doing a great job of working with the TSA to help the cues moving forward. I mentioned earlier today that the TSA published yesterday they had an unscheduled absence rate of 7% that compares to a 3% rate. They typically run, so it's in isolated airports we are having some longer lines, but it's not a system-wide issue at all, and to the extent that customers are impacted by delayed lines, we are re-accommodating them and getting them to their destinations in good manner.","Andrew Tangel","And just as a follow-up on the A220. You mentioned in your remarks that the shutdown is causing $25 million from government workers. But just wanted to know how much will you be leaving on the table as the launch is delayed for weeks and weeks? Is there a way you could quantify that?","Ed Bastian","We are not anticipating that outcome. That's probably the short answer. We are not leaving any money on the table. We are not going to be canceling routes or flights. We will just delay the introduction of that specific aircraft type.","Andrew Tangel","Thanks.","Operator","We will go next to Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein","Thank you. You talked earlier in the call about the dip in the corporate travel and the bookings right before Christmas and then how that rebounded. Can you talk just a little bit more on that in general terms on was it just the one week? Or, did that one-week extend into the start of the New Year and you've rebounded since then?","Paul Jacobson","I think it was really specific to the long period between Thanks Giving and Christmas. And it wasn't corporate. It was really just an across the board lull. As you know, once every seven years this occurs where the first day of the year is on a Thursday in November and creates the very longest possible period between the holidays. I think you are seeing a lot of people talk about this, not only in our industry where that long period probably is not advantage for airlines or retail. So, next year it moves again and it will move a lot closer. And we are not expecting that to recur. And yet, all the trends did go online right after the holidays.","Ed Bastian","And Mary, this is Ed, just to affirm, we had a great Christmas, all time record in terms of volume that we carry. So, it wasn't a lull. It was just the impact on pricing was a little softer than we anticipated, but it was a very very strong Christmas and holiday season for us.","Mary Schlangenstein","Great. And if I could just ask on the seven planes at that are being delayed into entry, does that include the A220s, and if so, how many? And then the other question is related that. Were others all A330 900s or were there some other fleet types in there?","Paul Jacobson","We are not going to get in all those details. It's primarily the Airbus 220, yes, but as Gil mentioned earlier, the 330neo could also be impacted here.","Mary Schlangenstein","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Leslie Josephs with CNBC.","Leslie Josephs","-- my question, I just wanted to clarify. It's $25 million a month in lost revenue or just January? And also on the shutdown, what else can you not do? I mean you mentioned the 330neo and then internet, can you launch new route. So what can you not do with FAA furloughed?","Paul Jacobson","On the revenue estimate, $25 million is what we are seeing in the month of January. Obviously if it was to continue, we think that's in order of magnitude number, but we don't know what those impacts could be, and we're not seeing any significant operational challenges. The introduction of new aircraft pipes for us is primarily is the Airbus 220 and 330neo. And that's where our concerns are limited to.","Leslie Josephs","Is there any issue especially on the TechOps with hiring mechanics with some FAA furloughed, or hiring on any aspects of the business?","Paul Jacobson","We're not seeing any meaningful change. Certainly, the on-boarding is delayed a little bit for any new hires in that space. But again, it's something hopefully that we are going to be moving through relatively quickly. We are not making any changes in our producers.","Leslie Josephs","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Tracy Rucinski with Reuters.","Tracy Rucinski","Hi, my questions have already been answered, but just one more shutdown-related question. You said that you haven't seen any impacts on bookings, but has been any rise in passengers canceling travel plans this month that can be attributed to the shutdown?","Paul Jacobson","We're not seeing that. The $25 million estimate we gave for the month of January is inclusive of all the above -- all those factors.","Tracy Rucinski","Oh, that's not just government contractors?","Paul Jacobson","It's government contractors and any knock-out effects that can we see that are related to that; the best that we can tell.","Tracy Rucinski","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Next we will hear from Benjamin Zhang with Business Insider.","Benjamin Zhang","Good morning, gentlemen. I just had a quick question about the 52% revenues from coming premium products in non-ticket -- sources. You guys mentioned there is a 14% or sorry double-digit increase in that. What do you foresee for 2018? Do you expect that growth to continue at that space?","Glen Hauenstein","Yes, we expect that we'll continue to grow in premium products and services more than we grow the base fare products. So, if you think about our total growth of 4% to 6% next year that would indicate that we are growing significantly higher on the premium product side. So, probably close to that 10% to 15% as we have in the past few years.","Benjamin Zhang","Great, thank you.","Ned Walker","Okay, I guess that we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Elliott Blackburn with Argus Media.","Elliott Blackburn","Good morning. Thanks for making time for me. You guys had a process late last year exploring a partnership options at the refinery. Just curious if you can give us an update on what you determined in that, or if it continues, and also curious just more broadly if Delta is looking at making any other non-maintenance investments maybe logistics to bringing crude from the Macon [ph] and that refinery to improve performance?","Ed Bastian","Good morning. We have continued with that process and have received some interest and having discussions with parties. There is no update on the strategy broadly as we articulated. We are looking for ways to enhance the value and the strategic value to Delta of the refinery through a partnership, and those discussions can be complicated, but right now, we are focused on running and operating the refinery as efficiently as we can. We just came out of a major turnaround investment that is done every five to six years. And the refinery is running quite well. So, nothing needed in terms of enhancing the performance.","Elliott Blackburn","Okay. So, you are satisfied with the access that you have to crude right now? You don't feel like you need to build anything on to that?","Ed Bastian","Absolutely. So, we take a wide variety of crude. Sometimes we swing domestically and some internationally, and we have the logistics to be able to take advantage of that as those opportunities present themselves.","Elliott Blackburn","All right, thanks very much.","Ned Walker","Okay. Thanks Ed, Glen, Paul, and Gil. And that does conclude our December quarter and full-year 2018 earnings call. We will back here again in April when we report our March quarter 2019 earnings. Have a good day everyone.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today."],"7347":["Delta Air Lines, Inc.

My name is Katie, and I will be your coordinator. (Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations for Delta.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Thanks, Katie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our December quarter call. Speaking on the call today will be Richard Anderson, our CEO; Ed Bastian, our President; and Hank Halter, our CFO. We also have our leadership team here for the Q&A, including Glen Hauenstein, Mike Campbell, Paul Jacobson, Holden Shannon, Ben Hirst, and Ned Walker.","Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance, and Hank will conclude with the review of our cost performance and liquidity. To get in as many questions during the Q&A, please limit yourselves to one question and a follow-up. I do have to tell you today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events.","All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause these differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted, and you can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at delta.com.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Richard.","Richard Anderson","Thank you. And thank you for joining us this morning. Today Delta reported a $379 million profit for the December quarter, beating First Call by $0.07. Our operating margin increased three points to 8%, as revenue growth covered more than $500 million in higher fuel cost. This is Delta\u2019s most profitable December quarter in its history. We are continuing our successful strategies to make this business healthy, strong RASM growth, fully covered fuel, capacity discipline, superior operations in customer service, healthy employee relations, debt reduction, wise capital budgets, and innovations across our businesses.","For the full year, we had top line growth of 11% with about 30 fewer airlines, generated a net profit of $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion of free cash flow, with $3 billion in higher fuel expense. This is the most important factor for investors because fuel cost increases were covered by revenue. Our CapEx came in below $1.3 billion. Our 9.1% return on invested capital represents the second year in a row that we have returned our cost of capital. And we have returned our extra cash flow to shareholders by reducing net debt to $12.9 billion.","During the year, we significantly improved our operations in customer service with our 2011 performance coming in at the top of the global airline industry for reliability, baggage and customer service. The Wall Street Journal Middle Seat column recognized Delta for its significant operational turnaround in 2011. At the same time, we continued to invest in our product and customer service, and we\u2019re pleased that we earned top honors from Fortune, Business Travel News and Travel Weekly. And most recently, PC World selected Delta as the Top Tech-Friendly Airline in the US.","These results would not have been possible without the hard work of the Delta people, and I congratulate them and thank them. They will earn $60 million in shared rewards during 2011 as well as $264 million in profit sharing to be paid out on Valentine\u2019s Day.","As we enter 2012, we are well positioned to build on our 2010 and 2011 performance and take advantage of solid demand. This momentum continues in 2012 and is reflected in the 1Q guidance we issued this morning, projecting a 2% to 4% operating margin in 1Q. Ed and Glen will provide more color on the forward demand as our unit revenues for January are up double-digit, continuing the trends of 4Q. We continue to see revenue momentum from corporate share gains and new merchandising revenues, which will be about $400 million incremental revenue in 2012, which when coupled with our revenue premium to the industry bode well for strong 2012 performance.","We are keeping a curt conservative stance on capacity with a planned reduction of 2% to 3% system in 2012. We will remain flexible with the ability to further reduce capacity if conditions so dictate. We are making needed facility improvements in our key hubs and we are on track to begin operating from Atlanta\u2019s new international terminal this spring, 12 new wide-body gates, and from our new world-class Terminal 4 in JFK in summer 2013.","We finally closed the LaGuardia slot transaction, and we are implementing our new schedule, which we will give Delta nearly 50% of LaGuardia departures and solidify Delta as the leading carrier at New York\u2019s number one business airport with over 250 daily departures by this summer. As part of our expansion, we are combining and renovating terminals C and D to create a 26-gate complex with the best facilities in operations for business travelers in New York City.","Our biggest opportunity in 2012 is to improve our cost structure and effectively manage our fuel expense. First, we will not use capacity to manage non-fuel unit costs. Second, we showed in December quarter with non-fuel CASM below 2% on a 3.5% reduction in capacity that we can reduce our fixed cost as capacity is full. It just takes a bit of time.","We expect fuel prices to remain at current levels or higher, and we will keep Delta\u2019s capacity in equilibrium with demand and fuel price. We will continue to pass along higher input costs in ticket prices while at the same time working to manage the volatility of our fuel expense. In 2011, our fuel hedging program generated $450 million in saving net of all premium costs.","On the non-fuel side, we have seen cost inflation over the last couple of years that we are structurally working on improving. We outlined some of these changes at Investor Day in December and we will continue to update you on our progress as we move through 2012.","So to conclude, we are committed to permanently fixing our business model, and our 2010 and 2011 results show that our plan is working. 2012 is setting up as another good year for Delta. We are committed to grow and diversify our revenues, cover fuel costs in our prices while taking a disciplined approach to capacity costs and capital spending. Our goal is to continue derisking the model while generating proper returns for our shareholders.","Thank you for your time today, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Ed.","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Excluding special items, Delta reported net income of $379 million for the December quarter or $0.45 per share, ahead of consensus estimates of $0.38 per share. These results are $221 million better than last year as we fully covered higher fuel prices with higher revenues.","Our operating margin was 7.7%, 2.6 points better than the previous December quarter. Special items for the quarter resulted in a $46 million net gain and included $164 million in mark-to-market gains on fuel hedges, which reversed the mark-to-market charge we took the last quarter; $43 million gain associated with the divestiture of slots at LaGuardia and Reagan National Airports; an $81 million impairment charge; and $80 million charge for severance and other items.","For the full year, Delta generated a net income of $1.2 billion, which was $250 million lower than the previous year. While there is more work to do, I consider these results remarkable and that Delta faced over $3 billion of fuel price pressure during 2011, which we were able to mitigate through strong revenue performance, capacity discipline, and a sound fuel hedging strategy.","I\u2019d like to thank the Delta team for their work in achieving these financial results. Together we are building a resilient business when they generate proper return for shareholders, positions the company well for 2012 and beyond.","Shifting to revenue, our December quarter top line revenue grew 8% or $610 million despite a 3.5% decrease in capacity. Passenger unit revenues increased 12% year-over-year and we again produced a unit revenue premium to the industry. For the month of December, our unit revenues increased 13%, continuing the strong performance we have seen all year.","Cargo revenues grew $20 million or 8%, driven by yield improvements. Other revenues increased $35 million, driven by a 24% growth in MRO revenues. And for the December quarter, our capacity and revenue initiatives combined to produce double-digit unit revenue increases across most of our business units.","Domestically, our unit revenues grew 13% on a 3% decrease in capacity. We saw strength in our core business markets. Our Atlanta and Minneapolis hubs in particular produced strong year-over-year unit revenue improvements and we\u2019re seeing nice improvement in the Transcons as well. The benefits of our capacity reduction are especially apparent in the transatlantic where we generated an 11% unit revenue increase despite a weak economic backdrop.","In the Pacific, our unit revenues for the quarter grew 14%, driven by a 20% improvement in yield on flat capacity. Nearly a year after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, we\u2019re now seeing US to Japan traffic that\u2019s close to pre-event levels. Our Latin unit revenues increased 6% against the 5% increase in capacity, with South America driving the largest increase in unit revenue.","Corporate revenues were strong in the December quarter, with total corporate revenues up 15% despite prior year \u2013 versus prior year despite the 3.5% decline in system capacity. We saw strength across many sectors. Financial services sector was up 18%, technology was up 15%, manufacturing was up 10%. Combined, these three broad sectors represent half of our total corporate revenues. Banking, which represents only 3% of our corporate revenues, was also up 5%.","In terms of our revenue outlook, overall system demand trends remain strong for the March quarter. And we are forecasting January unit revenues to be up 15% from the prior year. Our February trends appear largely consistent with what we are seeing in January. The comps in March get a bit more difficult as we start to lapse some of the fuel-driven price increases we saw last year, but we still expect a double-digit year-on-year growth that month.","Corporate travel bookings maintained solid growth rates in spite of our capacity reduction, and we anticipate seeing additional demand as a result of our expanded schedule in LaGuardia, which begins at the end of March. Our transatlantic unit revenues are up 17% for the month of January as compared to prior year as we see the benefits of our capacity rationalization we implemented after Labor Day and we continue to see strong trends in February and March as well.","In the Pacific, we are seeing steadily improving demand trends in both coach and business-only cabins. We\u2019re also experiencing improved market share in yields in markets where we\u2019ve implemented our flat-bed seating. And finally, our outlook for Latin remains positive for the March quarter with both loads and yields showing strength. Mexico is improving in both the beach and business markets, and South America continues to be solid.","Now turning to guidance, as you know, the March quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter of the year. However, despite that, we are expecting a positive operating margin of 2% to 4%. This is a substantial improvement over the $390 million pretax loss during the first quarter of 2011.","On capacity, we expect system capacity to be down 3% to 5% in the quarter. I\u2019d note that capacity would be an additional point lower if not for the inclusion of an extra day this quarter due to leap year. Domestics down 2% to 4% and international will be down 4% to 6% primarily driven by our 10-point reduction in transatlantic capacity. Finally, beginning with our January traffic to release, we will begin providing monthly unit revenue information and actual fuel prices to provide additional transparency for our investors.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Hank.","Hank Halter","Thanks, Ed. And good morning, everyone. Turning to cost performance for the December quarter, operating expenses for the quarter increased $360 million or 5%. Our oil and fuel price per gallon was $2.97, up 20% from prior year, which drove $515 million in fuel expense pressure, as fuel price pressure was offset by $150 million in settled hedge gains. The hedge gains came as a result of our decision to take advantage of a low fuel environment in September to lock in a substantial portion of our December quarter consumption.","Excluding fuel, our operating expenses were flat, as the benefits of our capacity reduction and maintenance savings were offset by higher revenue-related expenses and profit sharing. Consolidated non-fuel unit costs grew 1.8% year-over-year on a 3.5% decrease in capacity, driven by selling-related expenses and our Shared Rewards Program, which rewards employees from meeting operational goals. Non-operating expenses increased $37 million year-over-year, primarily due to FAS 133 gains in the December 2010 quarter.","Looking to March quarter cost performance, we anticipate March quarter non-fuel unit costs to be up 3% to 5% from prior year. And the main drivers of the March quarter increase are higher selling-related expenses; employee investments, including wage harmonization; strategic initiatives, including the implementation of the LaGuardia slot swap and the new Atlanta international terminal; and the impact of the March quarter 3% to 5% capacity reduction.","With regard to fuel and hedging, for the March quarter, we are 66% hedged between $3.00 and $3.25 per gallon. And for the June quarter, we are 58% hedged between $2.75 and $3.25 per gallon. As of Friday\u2019s curve, we are forecasting our March quarter all-in fuel price to be $3.16, which includes $0.05 of net hedged gains, and our June quarter at $3.10, which includes $0.10 of net hedged gains. We are primarily using collars and cost spreads as our hedging instruments.","Shifting to liquidity, we ended 2011 with $5.4 billion in unrestricted liquidity, which included $3.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.8 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $1.2 billion and free cash flow was $750 million. Operating cash flow includes $675 million of SkyMiles purchases by American Express in the December quarter.","Capital expenditures were $400 million, which included $230 million in aircraft parts and modifications. And during the quarter, we paid $725 million in debt maturities and amortizations, which includes $435 million in early retirement of debt. We ended 2011 with an adjusted net debt of $12.9 billion and we\u2019ve now achieved over $4 billion of our $7 billion debt reduction target. And as a result of our debt reduction progress, our annual interest expense is roughly $300 million lower now as compared to 2009.","And looking at March quarter liquidity, for the March quarter, we expect capital spending to be $450 million, and we have net debt maturities of $200 million in the first quarter, and we are forecasting an unrestricted liquidity to remain solid at $5.5 billion at the end of the March quarter.","So in conclusion, 2011 was a challenging year in many respects. But in spite of that, we were able to deliver solid results and generate $1.2 billion in profit. We reduced our adjusted net debt to $12.9 billion, a $4.1 billion reduction in two years, and we generated a 9.1% return on invested capital. We enter 2012 as a stronger airline. And I\u2019d like to thank the Delta team for their hard work and efforts, build a resilient and sustainable airline model, which is successful for our employees, our customers and our shareholders.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Thanks, Richard, Ed and Hank. Katie, we are not ready for questions from the analysts.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically, as stated by Ms. Greer. We will first take questions from the analysts and then from the media. (Operator instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Jamie Baker.","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan Chase","Hey, good morning, everybody.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Hey, Jamie.","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan Chase","Can you hear me? Great. Richard and Ed, I want to ask an M&A-related question in a way that hopefully you are willing to answer. So here it goes. First, on labor, do you think your relationship with ALPA is strong enough right now that they would have a seat at the table should Delta choose to pursue any further industry consolidation? Second, given the strain you went through on the slot swap, do you think that regulators, broadly speaking, are currently in a position where they are willing to negotiate with multiple parties, multiple airlines? And third, if every airline out there hypothetically was for sale, all of their hubs, all of their aircraft, etc., all of the international routes, where would you see the greatest need to beef up the Delta network? So again, labor, regulatory and beefing up the Delta network. Over to you.","Richard Anderson","Jamie, this is Richard. No comment on all three. Do you want to go ahead and reuse your questions?","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan Chase","It\u2019s so plausibly reasonable what I\u2019m asking now. What if we frame the last one, in terms of Delta\u2019s current network construct? Where do you see through organic growths, for example, a need to round it out in any way, shape or form? How about that?","Richard Anderson","Strike two. You can ask, but we\u2019re not going to make any comments on any of the speculation. So that\u2019s no comment. And if you want to ask a question on our earnings and the quarter or what\u2019s going on otherwise, we\u2019d be glad to entertain that.","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan Chase","Okay. Well, you can\u2019t blame me for doing what I\u2019m paid to do. I will turn it over to others because I thought you did a very thorough job with the guidance, good quarter. Thank you very much.","Richard Anderson","Thank you, Jamie. It\u2019s always a pleasure.","Ed Bastian","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Dan McKenzie with Rodman & Renshaw.","Dan McKenzie \u2013 Rodman & Renshaw","Hey, good morning, guys. Richard, you mentioned that the Delta is committed to growing and diversifying the revenues while taking a disciplined approach to cost and capacity. And Latin America remains a smaller part of Delta\u2019s network. Can you talk about the ultimate endgame for this region? How big do you need to be versus where you are today and how do you get there?","Richard Anderson","Well, we\u2019ve done well in Latin America. We\u2019ve (inaudible) the numbers and he can add to what I\u2019m going to say. But if you look at the investments that we made last year in Aeromexico angle and the Aerolineas position that we have through SkyTeam and look at the positioning of the Atlanta hub and our position in Florida, it\u2019s been a profitable operation for us and we have significant opportunity to grow organically.","Unidentified Company Participant","It\u2019s one thing [ph] I think we secured two great partners last year, which I think (inaudible). And if you take Aerolineas in Argentina and you take Gol in Brazil and you take Aeromexico, you need to have a partner footprint in Latin America to be able to grow that franchise over time.","Dan McKenzie \u2013 Rodman & Renshaw","Okay. And then I guess if I could just turn domestically here with a question on domestic capacity, Atlanta ranks as the 11th largest city in the United States, but it nonetheless ranks number one for capacity and it\u2019s a similar story nearby Charlotte. So, as I look at the industry domestically here, I see capacity of two nearby airports that has not been particularly the restructured versus just about every other larger market in the country. And so my question is, could Delta\u2019s returns be improved by readdressing capacity in this region?","Glen Hauenstein","Dan, it\u2019s Glen. Atlanta continues to lead the hubs in terms of its core profitability. And I think one of the things you have to look at is what\u2019s the \u2013 what are trends in the industry. I think five years ago or 10 years ago, you had 50-seat regional jets that were flying 1,100, 1,200 1,500 miles, which somewhat diminished the pull, if you will, of the geographic historical hubs, which Atlanta is well positioned in Southeast and it is by far the largest market in Southeast. So I think when you look at the core profitability, when you look at the region it serves and when you look at the industry trends, which do not supply 50-seat RJs in unaccounted markets of over time, you\u2019ll see that the hub\u2019s geographic pull becomes more and more relevant over the next cycle. I think that\u2019s why Atlanta is well positioned.","Dan McKenzie \u2013 Rodman & Renshaw","Okay, thanks. I appreciate that, Glen.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes, hi. Can I ask a question on the slot swap? We\u2019ve got to sort of think about how we model that in. Is there any sort of guidance or help you can give us in terms of thinking about the impact, the timing and sort of sizing it?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, it\u2019s big for New York. It\u2019s not that big in terms of our total network, and it really is about 100 departures, which are moving from underperforming assets in other parts of the airline to New York where we think they have much higher potential over the short to medium-term. Initially, there are a lot of markets that we found in the period of April or May and the beginning part of June by both carriers, U.S. Air and Delta, and that would probably be not the optimal situation, but that\u2019s the way (inaudible) transition the markets. And beyond that, when we get to the second phase, which is in July, we believe that it will be accretive from that point on. So a little bit of choppy orders during the transition in certain markets, but as soon as we get to July, we think that\u2019s going to be (inaudible) that the transaction becomes very accretive. And remember, it\u2019s only about less than 5% of our assets moving and they are moving from underperforming markets that they are in today.","Ed Bastian","And the other \u2013 this is Ed, Bill. The other thing to consider is that we\u2019ll put a little bit of incremental cost pressure in the current year as we build that capacity footprint out to LaGuardia.","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","But that was in your first quarter guidance?","Ed Bastian","It is. It is.","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then, Richard and Ed, back when we look at the Delta bankruptcy, there seems to be this sort of rule of thumb that a company goes in the bankruptcy and sort of cuts 10% of capacity. I actually think that was more of a domestic specific view for Delta. Do you think that that\u2019s sort of the right way to think about what happens to the companies? Was that your experience or is it sort of more the way we could then think about this? This is a post financial crisis world and the world is very different and the industry has cut enough of that. You\u2019re seeing this come through in the industry\u2019s results pretty clearly.","Ed Bastian","Bill, if you\u2019re trying to get our views on what Americans do, we just simply can\u2019t comment on that. For Delta, we had a very specific set of circumstances. We did \u2013 you're right. We did cut substantially the domestic network. A lot of it as coming out of the regional, the regional space, and we grew our international footprint going back over that time.","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks for the time.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Chase with Barclays Capital.","Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital","Morning, everybody. I have a couple for Glen, if I could. First, I wanted to just quickly see if you could differentiate for us the \u2013 how Japan is doing versus non-Japan Asia in the Pacific numbers, which you\u2019re obviously outperforming?","Glen Hauenstein","Okay. Actually we\u2019re very encouraged by both of those. And if you could think about Japan transpacific, that\u2019s a very stable environment. We\u2019re actually taking a little bit of capacity of ours. We put the flat-bed seats into their marketplace, which we think ultimately will be very accretive to the company. But the Japan transpacific has moved through the year since the events of 3\/11 and continued to gain strength. The older flights, which are non-stop US gateway cities into Asian markets, are doing quite well. They are absorbing the capacity and they have high-single digit, low-double digit revenue increases. And then the third component is the Asian beach markets, and that would be the Japan to Hawaii and Micronesian island. And there continues to be very strong demand as the Japanese are timely recovered and as the yen exchange rate is very favorable and continues to remain very favorable.","Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital","And then also in the prepared remarks I think Ed mentioned share gain. Wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on where that\u2019s occurring and what the catalyst for it is. What\u2019s driving that at this stage? It\u2019s going to seem like it would be merger synergies this far out.","Ed Bastian","The share gains we are talking about were in the corporate space, Gary. Is that what you\u2019re referring to?","Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yes, yes. Was that \u2013?","Ed Bastian","Certainly, yes, the merger continues to play a very important role in the product and the opportunities we offer our corporate accounts. We\u2019re seeing a \u2013 certainly in New York we\u2019re seeing a very substantial improvement in the share we\u2019ve been picking up, being able to bring some new Latin partners to the table and the Latin footprint is helping as well. So we \u2013 back a couple of years ago, when we did the merger, we talked about the revenue synergies, and I think we\u2019re all waiting for them to materialize. I know you guys were. And I think this past year we certainly have seen them show up.","Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital","Just wondered if there was like an identifiable catalyst that we should think about timing wise or it\u2019s just more ongoing process that you are \u2013?","Ed Bastian","I think the scale and the product and the technology and candidly the service of our people are making a very big difference in the marketplace and having a lot of impact.","Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Glenn Engel with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Couple of questions. One, just on the maintenance. I thought after the second quarter, you were looking to see second half drop about $250 million from the first half, and the drop was big, but it was only $175 million. That\u2019s a $75 million difference.","Richard Anderson","Glenn, part of that is because in the maintenance space, you got the MRO. We had growth in the MRO. So you\u2019d have to look at the net recurring maintenance, and we actually came in pretty close to the numbers we were expecting.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And how does maintenance look in 2012?","Hank Halter","Yes, Glen, it\u2019s Hank. Hey. The first quarter, we\u2019ll see a little bit higher maintenance expense that will be reduced in the balance of the year. And the March quarter is traditionally a high maintenance quarter because the planes are in there getting the visits before the busy summer schedule. So you\u2019ll see it trail off as the year goes, but the first quarter will be up just a bit.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And final one for Glen. If I look at the Latin RASM, it was up 5.9, but the industry was up around 10.5 for the quarter. Is there any mixed reasons why you would lag?","Glen Hauenstein","I think if you look at our Latin versus our competitive set, we have a very different Latin America. It\u2019s much larger gauge and it\u2019s much longer length of haul. And so when you look about at other carriers that have 50-seat regional jets going to short haul, we don\u2019t have that component. And so what we\u2019ve been growing have been the longer haul into South America. So you had a little bit of length of haul in there. And I think from a profitability standpoint, we\u2019re very, very excited about the Latin performance and the outlook moving forward. And while we continue to strive to improve all of our sectors, we\u2019re pleased with (inaudible) but we do think there\u2019s more in 2012.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much.","Glen Hauenstein","Okay.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes. Hey, everyone. I\u2019ve just two quick questions. Hank, back at the Investor Day, I remember you\u2019ve provided some color on the pension piece. Where \u2013 you probably have a better number now, now that you\u2019ve closed the books. For 2012, what should we be thinking about with respect to both pension expense and then your cash contribution to the plan?","Hank Halter","Yes. Hi, Mike. Pension expense for 2012 will be about $400 million. It will run about $100 million a quarter, which is almost flat to 2011. I think we\u2019re running about $85 million a quarter. And then in terms of funding for 2012, you can expect somewhere between $650 million and $675 million or so. And that is a bit up versus 2011.","Mike Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, good. And then my second question, this is actually to Glen. You\u2019ve done a great job on closing the revenue gap. In fact, you\u2019re now running at a nice premium relative to the industry. Glen, how does that compare in New York? In the New York market, are you at a premium or are you still lagging? If you are lagging, does \u2013 will the dual hub structure in New York, will that close that difference?","Glen Hauenstein","I think that\u2019s a very good question, and I think that is where we see a lot of our upside opportunity as we move through 2012 and beyond. Historically, we haven\u2019t had the position that we will have in New York. And I think if you look at the government data that was just released for last quarter, for the first time in Delta\u2019s history, it was really a neck and neck rates between Continental and Delta. And that\u2019s pre-united merger and pre-LaGuardia transaction.","So you really have two carriers operating in the New York space. One is Continental primarily based in New York and one is Delta primarily based in LaGuardia in Kennedy. And we think that is very synergistic that we will be able to capture the business traveler who wants to use LaGuardia in and out when they are doing business meetings with them when their travel takes them outside their perimeter for the long haul and for the international and they will use us on Kennedy. So that is the one area of our network that does not command a premium, but it definitely has continued to be reduced, and we think that the upsides of our P&L is just getting to parity in the short run and getting to a premium over time.","Mike Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And the JFK terminal, that comes on line, what is that, 2013 or 2014?","Glen Hauenstein","Before summer of 2013.","Mike Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Okay. Very good and a great quarter, guys. Thanks.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Crissey with UBS.","Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS","Thank you. Good morning. Wanted to ask \u2013 corporate travel seems to be have rebounded kind of normal cyclically. Wanted to talk about where you think we are in the overall cycle. I know oil and jet fuel prices have really changed what the earnings results look like in a cycle, but want to see if you thought we were just starting this cycle or are we kind of three years in with corporate travel having recovered nicely?","Ed Bastian","Kevin, this is Ed. I think we\u2019re clearly at a midpoint in the cycle. If you look at the strength we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years has helped pace what the industry broadly has seen and I think that contributed a lot of that to our merger. It\u2019s hard to say what the future is. You\u2019re looking at a pretty dim view in the Euro zone in a recessionary outlook, yet our transatlantic corporate revenues because of the capacity discipline we\u2019ve implemented had been pretty strong and the corporate base really hasn\u2019t shown much weakness on the European side. So it\u2019s clearly driven by the big US corporate as compared to the global corporates. And I think we have a pretty solid outlook for 2012. The GBTHs came out recently with their travel survey and they are expecting the corporate space to increase another 5% to 7% again this year. And I think that\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019re seeing though I think our number is probably a little bit higher given the some of the market (inaudible).","Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thanks. And thanks for putting out the traffic with RASM and fuel. Can you just give us what the capacity changes year-over-year look like by month, because I thought maybe February had less capacity cut than maybe the other months? That could be wrong.","Richard Anderson","This is Richard. On a system basis, our current forecast for February is down about 4.5% to 5.0% system.","Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS","Okay. So basically the change in capacity is relatively stable throughout the quarter. So we should \u2013","Richard Anderson","It is. Yes, it is relatively stable throughout the quarter.","Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS","Okay, sure. That\u2019s what I need. Thank you.","Richard Anderson","In February we have an extra day due to leap year.","Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Helane Becker with Dahlman Rose.","Helane Becker \u2013 Dahlman Rose","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Two questions. One, (inaudible) RASM increase your \u2013 just talking about for January. Do you have a base number that we should use? And my second question just related to regional jets. Can you just \u2013 I think you own most of the regional jets. So maybe if some of your regional providers aren\u2019t operating up to snuff, you can move those aircraft? So can you just talk about whether or not you would consider an RFP for regional feed at some of your hubs in the next few months I guess? And so that\u2019s my question.","Richard Anderson","I can take the last one, which is we are not considering any RFPs for regional feed at any of our hubs in the next few months.","Ed Bastian","And on your first question, Helane, you were looking for the January monthly RASM base. Is that\u2013?","Helane Becker \u2013 Dahlman Rose","Yes, yes. Would we know what the 15% compares to.","Jill Sullivan Greer","It was 11\/01.","Helane Becker \u2013 Dahlman Rose","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","So, assuming you hit the $10 billion net debt target by mid \u201913, what\u2019s the next strategic step? Because at that point, the business should be spitting up a good amount of cash flow. And assuming it is to buy a bunch of new planes and lever up again, which I don\u2019t think it is, would you consider turning to the pension plan, maybe overfunding it? I think a number of investors still consider that unfunded obligation to be debt when valuing the equity of the company. So how do you think about the next step to cash deployment as it may or may never relate to the pension plan in mid \u201913?","Ed Bastian","Hunter, this is Ed. Yes, we certainly would look at the pension plan as one place where we would make some incremental investments if we had that cash flow flexibility. We do believe we\u2019re on track for the $10 billion by 2013. And as you can appreciate, beyond 2013, we expect that net debt level to continue to decline as well. So it\u2019s not going to be a stagnant number.","Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay. Thanks, Ed. And Richard, I\u2019d love to hear your opinion on foreign ownership restrictions. I know it obviously requires an active Congress to change and this is deeply imbedded and it\u2019s a very, very sensitive issue for a lot of labor unions out there. Do you think there is an appetite to potentially address that in Congress? And if so, would you be supportive of that kind of a bill?","Richard Anderson","I don\u2019t think there is any appetite to address that in Congress. Number two, I believe through immunized joint ventures, the industry has found out the mechanism that allows us to organize transborder effectively.","Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Savi Syth [ph] with Raymond James.","Savi Syth \u2013 Raymond James","Hey, thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering just with the capacity cuts that we are seeing this year and you\u2019ve provided a little color on the maintenance, if you could just kind of provide a color on how you expect cost as you progress through the year?","Richard Anderson","Yes. Our cost will be up for the full year in the 2% to 4% range, which is consistent with what we talked about in the December Investor Day. The March quarter is particularly challenging because that\u2019s the time of year where we\u2019ve got the fewest ASMs. It\u2019s seasonally \u2013 the capacity is down. We also had higher maintenance expenses in that quarter. And then as the year progresses, you see improvement. And then certainly by the fourth quarter, as we have our strategic initiatives continuing to be implemented, that will provide further benefit to us for the back half of the year and then that will take us into 2013 with additional benefit.","Savi Syth \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, great. And another follow-up question. It looks like your \u2013the frequent flyer revenues, if you look at Delta\u2019s frequent flyer revenue, it comes to roughly about 5% of total revenue. But if you look at United or Alaska, theirs just comes to about 10% of total revenue. Just wondering why that discrepancy was and if there was potential for that to increase.","Richard Anderson","Yes. I suspect \u2013 I'm not familiar with the specifics of United, but I expect the differences in the deferred revenue accounting. Each airline has the specific values and that will impact comparability between carriers. While the treatment may be the same, it\u2019s unique for carriers. So I think it is somewhat difficult to try to match up the specifics, one carrier versus another.","Ed Bastian","We certainly don\u2019t think that our frequent flyer plan is any less revenue producing than any other carrier out there.","Savi Syth \u2013 Raymond James","All right. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Kauffman with Sterne, Agee.","Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Sterne, Agee","Thank you very much. A lot of my next questions have been answered. So I\u2019ll just ask two shorter ones. You talked a lot about what you see in corporate travel. What are you seeing on the laser booking window side right now?","Glen Hauenstein","This is Glen. The leader side seems very strong as well. We\u2019ve got a lot of traction eliminating some of the lowest fares that were unattractive in the marketplace as demand continues to show strength. And so we\u2019ve seen very robust increase in leisure deal, and that bodes well as we move into peak summer.","Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Sterne, Agee","Okay. The yields are moving up, but what are you seeing in terms of the booking windows right now?","Glen Hauenstein","The booking windows, we are booked ahead in total aggregate and we get up to March and beyond what we are seeing is primarily leisure. And we are ahead in all sectors as of today.","Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Sterne, Agee","Okay. That\u2019s great. And one follow-up. as we get more and more information on AMR\u2019s restructuring, whether it\u2019s the management ranks, whether it\u2019s what they are doing with the aircraft, which I think they are about to announce. Is this \u2013 might you rethink your capacity plan from what you laid out at analyst day or you pretty set on that, given all the capacity you have flowing the LaGuardia. So let\u2019s not worry about that.","Glen Hauenstein","We make our own independent decisions, Jeff, on capacity. That has no impact on our plans.","Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Sterne, Agee","Okay, very good. Guys, congratulations. Great quarter. Thank you.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Justine Fisher with Goldman Sachs.","Josh \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey, guys. This is actually Josh [ph] for Justine. Just wanted to see if we could get any more details on that $435 million of debt that you repaid early this quarter? And then going forward, how you are thinking about which debt to potentially kick out first if that option comes up","Hank Halter","Yes. Josh, this is Hank. Some of the debt, you may recall, we repaid the MAC loan, and that was at the end of the fourth quarter. We also had some senior notes that we repaid. But as we think about the acceleration of the debt, we\u2019re working towards that goal of $10 billion adjusted net debt. We look at what\u2019s most advantageous from a cost perspective. And obviously we\u2019ve got our scheduled amortizations and maturities, and then with the excess cash, we put it back on the balance sheet by continuing to reduce debt. And it\u2019s working. We\u2019re $300 million lower in interest expense this year versus where we were when we started the program, and we\u2019ll continue being aggressive to pay the debt down as quickly as possible.","Richard Anderson","We like to pay down debt that has high interest rates.","Josh \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. All right. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks, guys.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Katie, we\u2019re going to have time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Ray Neidl with Maxim Group.","Ray Neidl \u2013 Maxim Group","Yes. I just want to try and clarify one thing on the pensions. They are frozen, I take it, all the different times are frozen. I assume they are not accruing any more benefits. At some point, once they become fully funded, should that become a non-cost issue?","Ed Bastian","Ray, this is Ed. We\u2019ve got ways to go before they are fully funded. So I \u2013 that's \u2013 obviously one of the things that\u2019s been causing the liability to grow is the continued reduction in the discount rates. So, over time, as we do expect interest rates to eventually start to inflate a bit, you\u2019re going to see that liability also start to decline. So that \u2013 you should factor that into your calculus also.","Ray Neidl \u2013 Maxim Group","Okay, great. And the new policy of the government where you have to include taxes in your ticket price, customers won\u2019t see the government raising taxes and you get blamed for prices going up. Under this law, is there any way that you could show taxes separately even though you have to show the total cost of the ticket when you\u2019re advertising?","Glen Hauenstein","Ray, this is Glen. We do show the taxes separately today. And we distribute our product to a lot of different venues. So how the customer ultimately sees them depends on how that venue displays them. But true of all, all of the channels that we control whether or not it\u2019s our reservations agents or whether or not it\u2019s our online purchase, the taxes are broken down.","Ray Neidl \u2013 Maxim Group","Okay, great. So the customer will be able to make the decision that way then.","Glen Hauenstein","Yes.","Ray Neidl \u2013 Maxim Group","Okay, great. Thank you.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Thanks, Ray. Katie, that\u2019s going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. And so I will now turn it over to Ned Walker.","Ned Walker","Okay. Hey, thanks very much, Jill. And Katie, if you could go ahead and go through the process for queuing up for the questions for the media. And also with the media, if you could have one question and a quick follow-up, we should be able to accommodate mostly everyone.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Josh Freed with the Associated Press.","Josh Freed \u2013 Associated Press","Let\u2019s see. You mentioned that you\u2019re going to have some higher costs related to wage harmonization as you kind of finish the integration of the different labor groups. And then I know it\u2019s a big priority also to keep overall non-fuel cost down. So if you say a little more about how you do both of those at the same time and with capacity coming down a little bit also, it makes me wonder if you need to turn the workforce some more?","Richard Anderson","Well, it\u2019s a combination \u2013 this is Richard. It\u2019s a combination of actions over time. From an employee standpoint, we\u2019ve had a very firm policy of no frontline involuntary furloughs and that will remain our practices. But if we look at where the opportunities really lie in the inflation and the opportunities lie in our maintenance area and we placed an order this past year for 100 new 737-900s. There will be significant benefits that come from re-fleeting the airline, both in terms of maintenance, operating costs and fuel costs. Second, we need to get back to our historic productivity levels across the airline. And that will be part of leveraging technology and generating efficiencies across the business. Third is restructuring our regional carrier contracts and reducing the 50-seat lift as we up-gauge. And so all of those are part and parcel of a process to be certain that our non-fuel unit costs remain the best in the industry.","Josh Freed \u2013 Associated Press","Okay. So, no involuntary frontline furloughs still. How about corporate headquarters level?","Richard Anderson","Our efficiency in the corporate, our productivity and efficiency at the merit or corporate level is double-digit over the last several years.","Josh Freed \u2013 Associated Press","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Kelly Yamanouchi with Atlanta Journal Constitution.","Kelly Yamanouchi \u2013 Atlanta Journal Constitution","Hi there. I was interested in more detail about why the unit revenues in Atlanta are doing so well.","Glen Hauenstein","Kelly, this is Glen. Could you repeat the \u2013?","Kelly Yamanouchi \u2013 Atlanta Journal Constitution","I\u2019m interested in why the unit revenues in Atlanta had particularly good improvements. I think you mentioned Atlanta and Minneapolis.","Glen Hauenstein","Right. Kelly, in the last quarter or so, the unit revenues that (inaudible) continue. I would say the reason why Atlanta is doing so well is the Delta people. The Delta people are doing a great job (inaudible) coming through the record-breaking performance.","Ned Walker","And can I \u2013 Katie, if you could check one of mikes, it sounds like somebody is breathing heavily in \u2013","Glen Hauenstein","It's hard for us to hear in a way.","Richard Anderson","Thank you.","Kelly Yamanouchi \u2013 Atlanta Journal Constitution","Financial advantages of the operational improvements that you had in 2011?","Richard Anderson","(inaudible)","Kelly Yamanouchi \u2013 Atlanta Journal Constitution","Is there a way to quantify the financial advantages of the operational improvements that you had in 2011?","Richard Anderson","Well, I think our operational improvement is \u2013 we're clearly at the top in terms of customer service and operating performance and the Delta people has just done a phenomenal job. And I think that\u2019s an important factor in having industry-leading RASM.","Kelly Yamanouchi \u2013 Atlanta Journal Constitution","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mary Jane Credeur with Bloomberg News.","Mary Jane Credeur \u2013 Bloomberg News","Hi, gentlemen. I wanted to follow up where Mr. Baker left off and see if I could take a step back and try to come with that question a different way. Do you think there is another big airline deal left in the US industry or is the industry where it needs to be consolidation-wise?","Ned Walker","Hey, Mary Jane, it\u2019s Ned. We\u2019re just really not going to make any comment on any industry rumor or speculation on it. So, go ahead and if you want to ask another question, we\u2019d be happy to respond to another one off of that topic.","Mary Jane Credeur \u2013 Bloomberg News","Sure, sure. And this one is for Hauenstein. Glen, are you guys gaining any traffic since Americans\u2019 filing, anything notable in Fort Worth, DFW, New York, O\u2019Hare, key markets where you guys overlap?","Glen Hauenstein","I think that the customer has really become used to Chapter 11 in the US airline industry unfortunately. And so we did not see any immediate shift in travel patterns that would fall under that kind of filing.","Mary Jane Credeur \u2013 Bloomberg News","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","we\u2019ll take our next question from Jeremy Lemer with Financial Times.","Jeremy Lemer \u2013 Financial Times","Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. Apologies if this question has already been asked in different guises. I was pulled off the call to do something else a little while ago. But could you give a little bit of color on the sort of demand environment and whether macroeconomic concerns are filtering through into some slowdown in demand that travel in various segments, whether it\u2019s geographical or if you could cut it also by type of travel, that would be very helpful.","Glen Hauenstein","We actually see good demand across all of the regions we operate in. And corporate demand, in particular, is good as is leisure demand. So even though there is some concern about Europe, we\u2019ve taken pretty dramatic steps to reduce capacity in those markets and right-sized our capacity to demand. And so we\u2019ve seen good RASM performance in all of our \u2013Asia, domestic, Latin and the Atlantic, and we see those trends continuing into the first quarter of 2012.","Jeremy Lemer \u2013 Financial Times","Okay. And as a quick follow-up, what explains that (inaudible) that sort of we got down to lower the demand that is sort of essential, is it capacity discipline across the industry, is it other factors? How do you sort of explain this rate of resilience?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, I think, one, we have good equilibrium of capacity to fuel price to demand. So those are the three important factors. And second, around the world, even though there is difficulty in Europe, the economic outlook while that \u2013 the 4% to 5% range that you usually have in the US after the downturn of 2008, we are seeing solid GDP performance in all the other regions of the world.","Jeremy Lemer \u2013 Financial Times","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Darren Shannon with Aviation Week.","Darren Shannon \u2013 Aviation Week","Can you provide a monthly breakdown by region for your 1Q international capacity cut? And on the domestic side, what are your contingency plans should Pinnacle and Republic file for Chapter 11 and can you replace any or all of that feed?","Ed Bastian","Darren, we don\u2019t provide our monthly forward guidance, that level of detail international versus domestic.","Darren Shannon \u2013 Aviation Week","Okay.","Ed Bastian","We gave a broad \u2013 international down 4% to 6% for the quarter. And we\u2019re not going to comment in on any other speculation at any of our regional suppliers.","Darren Shannon \u2013 Aviation Week","Okay, thanks.","Ned Walker","Okay. Katie, we have time for one more call.","Operator","We will take our next question from Wayne Risher with The Commercial Appeal.","Wayne Risher \u2013 The Commercial Appeal","Good morning. I wonder if someone would talk about how the Memphis hub is performing for you at the reduced capacity levels there and where do you think Memphis is, basically right-sized for you or kind of close to what it needs to be? And whoever speaks, please tell me who you are because I don\u2019t recognize your voices.","Glen Hauenstein","Sure. This is Glen Hauenstein. And we have had a lot of success in the reshaping of the Memphis hub. New York revenues are outpacing the domestic US industry at this point, not dramatically but substantially. And so we\u2019re very pleased with the impact that we had in terms of our profit performance on a year-over-year basis. It\u2019s still not where we needed to be. And so we will continue with it to adjust capacity in the future as we need to.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I am pleased to turn the conference over to Jill Greer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on our March quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta\u2019s financial performance; Glen will then address the revenue environment; and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. We are also providing cost comparisons on a normalized basis as it better matches the retroactive expense we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 from our pilot contract to the appropriate quarters of 2016. You can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Ed.","Ed Bastian","Thank you, Jill. Good morning. Appreciate you all joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported a pre-tax profit of $847 million for the March quarter and earnings per share of $0.77, which compares to consensus of $0.75. We delivered an operating margin of 10.7%, a 23% return on invested capital and returned $350 million to our shareholders. While these results are lower than last year due largely to higher fuel prices, they still represent the second best quarter -- March quarter in Delta\u2019s history. Operationally, we hold ourselves to high standard. We had 64 perfect completion mainline \u2013 perfect mainline completion factor days in the first quarter ahead of last year\u2019s record of 58 days. And prior to April 5, we ran 18 consecutive days without a cancellation. However, last Wednesday, we had a major spring storm in Atlanta, which brought the airport to a full ground stop for most of the day requiring significant diversions. The storm hit our largest hub during spring break, one of the busiest weeks of the season, and it took us several days to fully recover the operation. We canceled approximately 4,000 flights as a result, which we expect will reduce our June quarter pre-tax profit by $125 million.","The good news is we are fully back up this week and indeed had another perfect completion factor day yesterday. It is our reliability and great service that have allowed us to improve customer satisfaction levels. Our strong customer satisfaction is why we are able to sustain our 109% revenue premium to the industry, and we never take that customer satisfaction for granted. To our customers, we apologize for the disruption to their schedules. These events always provide fertile ground for learnings and how to minimize these disruptions in the future, and we are actively engaged with our team on making significant improvements to our crew tracking and scheduling processes as well as our customer information systems. I want to thank the Delta people for working through some incredibly tough conditions to take care of our customers and get the operation back on track. You are the very best in our business.","Now, as we look ahead to the remainder of the year, the durability we have built in our business is evident in our ability to withstand an event like this storm as well as rising fuel prices and yet remain on track to produce the 2017 forecasted pre-tax profit that is similar to the $6 billion range we made in 2016, which would be our third year in a row at the $6 billion level. And while it took longer to get here than anyone anticipated, we are back to positive unit revenues and expect the revenue recovery to gain momentum as we move forward. This puts us back in the position of generating the top line growth necessary to offset the cost pressures we face and produce margin expansion in our business over the long-term. Nevertheless, we remain committed to keeping our capacity capped at 1% for the year as we believe this will help firm unit revenues and get us through this year on better footing and on the path to achieving our long-term financial goals. Next month marks our 10-year anniversary of the completion of our restructuring and re-listing on the New York Stock Exchange.","And as we look back, there are four key pillars that have driven the value we have created and that we are now leveraging to take us into the next decade of success. First, running the best airline in the industry, a safe, reliable, customer-focused operation which is made possible by the very best people in the industry. Next, enhancing our brand by investing in the products and services that customers value that\u2019s what drives our revenue and brand premium with strong customer loyalty creating a more durable top line. Third, becoming a truly global airline on which we made important strides this quarter, successfully completing our tender offer that will result in a 49% ownership stake in Aeromexico, and we expect to formally launch our transborder Mexican JV later this month, and we also signed a Memorandum of Understanding for a Transpacific joint venture with Korean, which has been a great partner of ours in North Asia for more than 20 years. This step will significantly enhance our strategic division across Asia and I believe is a real game-changer.","And finally, the steps we have taken to create a durable franchise allows us to invest for the long-term in our employees, in our product, in our balance sheet, and in our owners, because all of our stakeholders have to share in Delta\u2019s success for this model to work. Our fundamental change may be \u201cthe fundamental change\u201d to our business model as we now truly compete on quality and service, not just price. That\u2019s what successful consumer product and service companies do. Executing on these core pillars is what will position us to deliver consistent sustainable results through the business cycle. We look forward to recognizing the 10-year anniversary of our re-listing at the New York Stock Exchange on May 3, and we also look forward to sharing more details on our capital deployment plans for the next few years at our May Investor Day the following week.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Glen and Paul to go through more details on the quarter. Glen?","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. I want to start by joining Ed in thanking the Delta people for their efforts over the past week as we recovered from the storm in Atlanta. Your best-in-class service makes the difference to our customers and sets Delta apart in the industry.","Turning to the current environment, while the pace of the revenue recovery was a bit slower than what we had originally anticipated, we are continuing to see improvement in revenue trends across our network. Quickly recapping our top line performance, we reported total revenues down 1% on slight declines in passenger and cargo revenues. Our passenger revenue declined $74 million, including $20 million of lower hedge gains. Passenger unit revenues for the quarter came in essentially flat and we were better sequentially each month. In March, system PRASM turned positive marking the first year-over-year improvement since November 2015. The March quarter is the third consecutive quarter we have seen sequential improvement. RASM was 2 points better than the December quarter and 6 points ahead of the September quarter with better results across all regions.","We continued to drive value through our loyalty program in the quarter. Flight redemptions were up 10% year-over-year and we realized a $40 million increase in other revenue or 0.5 point not recognized as PRASM. Cargo sales of $160 million were down roughly 1% during the period, which was all currency-related. This is the best cargo result in eight quarters and we saw sequential improvement through the quarter with cargo revenues up 12% year-over-year for the month of March. Looking ahead, we have a good line of sight on positive RASM momentum.","For Delta, domestic accounts for roughly two-thirds of our revenue base, so it is critical to get the entity to positive RASM. Over half of our domestic network was positive in the quarter, and in the second quarter we are on track for two-thirds of the entity to reach this milestone. User yields and demand remain very strong as we head into peak summer. Peak business demand also continues to be solid and the outlook remains strong. 84% of our corporate travel partners are projecting their spend will be maintained or increased for the rest of 2017, up 1 point year-over-year. Business fares are moving in the right direction and further improvement in domestic business yields remains our top priority and opportunity.","To give some perspective, we saw double-digit declines in average domestic business fares from early \u201815 through last fall. Since then, fares have recovered roughly half of that lost ground, and getting business fares back to the levels achieved in early 2015 would provide significant additional revenue momentum. Our branded fare initiatives performed well with revenues up 10% for the quarter. We expect this growth to accelerate as we add the ability for our customers to buy up to Comfort+ and our first class post-purchase in this quarter. We also completed the expansion of Basic Economy to 100% of the U.S. and Canada and have started rolling out the product in our international entities. Basic Economy is now available in more than 25,000 markets. Overall, our branded fare initiatives are on track to produce over $300 million of incremental revenue this year.","Turning to our international performance, Latin [ph] unit revenues improved approximately 4.5% year-over-year on 2% capacity growth marking the third consecutive positive quarter for the region. Brazil momentum continued with RASM up nearly 45% driven by the country\u2019s improving economy, strengthening currency and our partnership with GOL. Monday, we received DOT approval to implement our JV with Aeromexico. We are looking forward to even deeper cooperation and driving incremental value for customers and shareholders through this innovative partnership. Looking to 2Q, advance RASM for the Latin entity shows accelerating momentum as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the entity\u2019s inflection. Between domestic and Latin, we now have 70% of our global systems delivering positive RASM, a very different place than we were at this time last year.","In the Pacific, our unit revenues declined 3.9%. Trends are moving in the right direction as well as this region was 5 points better than the December quarter. Alliance is crucial to Delta\u2019s success in the Pacific and we were pleased to announce our plan to implement a joint venture with our long standing partner, Korean Airlines. This arrangement with Korean complements our existing alliance into China with the China Eastern. Both alliances will play a greater role in our Pacific network, while providing premier gateways to key markets in Southeast Asia and China as we would continue to reduce our reliance on our Narita hub. As we move through the year, we should see continued improvement as we down-gauge our fleet and retire the many \u2013 remaining 747s we have in service. These older less efficient aircraft will be replaced with the A350, providing a best-in-class product, along with a lower cost of production. Last week, we won a Crystal Cabin Award for the highly competitive cabin concepts category for the Delta One suite that will be introduced on the A350 later this year recognizing this product for innovation, kudos to the marketing and fleet teams for this great recognition. Our Pacific restructuring has been a multi-year undertaking. We now have the right foundation in place to enhance our profit performance in the region moving forward.","Finally, turning to the Transatlantic, RASM fell 0.5 point with roughly 1.5 points of currency impact on a 4 point decline in capacity. We are offsetting some of the pressure from industry capacity and currency with a strategy of leveraging our strong joint venture positions in Europe and growing U.S. point of sale volumes. While we expect that it will take slightly longer to achieve positive RASM in the Transatlantic, this entity continues to drive strong margins and cash flows for our owners. Long-term, our plan to drive improved performance in the Transatlantic starts with more seasonal flying that better aligns our capacity with demand. Next, we will build on an improved cost structure by up-gauging our fleet as we retire our oldest 767 aircraft, which starts this summer and replace them with more efficient A330s. We will also continue to innovate with new products and services like Delta One suites, Comfort+, Premium Select and Basic Economy. And we will take delivery of new aircraft using new seating configurations to ensure we have the right mix of premium and economy seats in these markets. This platform we believe will allow us to compete effectively with the growth of the low cost carriers across the Atlantic.","Thinking about the network as a whole, we feel confident that have turned the corner on positive RASM and we will continue to stay conservative with our capacity levels to help firm the unit revenue trends. For the June quarter, our capacity will be flat to up 1% with approximately 2 points of domestic growth and roughly 1.5 point decline in international. Our unit revenues will be up in the 1 to 3 range for the June quarter, which is 0.5 point lower than our expectations were last week before the storms in Atlanta. This will be driven primarily by continued momentum in our domestic unit, which we are expecting to be up between 3% and 4%. We are seeing a good start to the quarter and the month of April may potentially still be positive, including a 2 point to 3 point negative system RASM hit related to the storm impact. And given what we are seeing in this quarter and further out, we feel that we are well positioned to deliver top line growth through positive RASM going forward. We are there in domestic and Latin entities and we have solid plans in place for the Pacific and Transatlantic.","And with that, I would like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul.","Paul Jacobson","Thanks Glen and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us today. I would like to start by echoing Ed and Glen and expressing my sincere thanks to the Delta family for all they do for our customers and importantly for each other every day. This culture is the foundation that really makes our business more durable and sustainable into the future. Looking \u2013 turning to our performance, fuel presented us with our greatest challenge in the March quarter as our fuel expense increased by 26% or $325 million from the prior year. Our all-in fuel price of $1.71 per gallon was up almost 30% as crude prices climbed roughly $20 per barrel from the first quarter \u201816 low levels. Our fuel price also includes $0.09 per gallon of losses from our legacy hedge book during the quarter. While increased crack spreads are also contributing to a jet fuel prices, at the same time, they improve our refinery\u2019s property, naturally hedging jet cracks improving one benefit of this investment. The refinery posted a $44 million profit in the quarter as evidence of this, lowering our all-in jet fuel price by $0.05 in the March quarter alone and we continue to expect that the refinery will contribute $100 million for the year and lower fuel prices. Looking to the second quarter, we are forecasting an all-in fuel price in the range of $1.68 to $1.73 per gallon, which is down roughly 13% mainly due to last year\u2019s hedging activity. While we expect fuel prices will begin rising again in the second half as we have seen in the last week or so, the year-on-year increases are expected to be below what we witnessed this quarter.","While fuel was the biggest headwind in the first quarter, we also faced some pressures in non-fuel costs, which drove our CASM ex-fuel up 3.6% higher year-on-year. This was driven by the timing of our maintenance spend, various products investments, employee pay increases as well as pressure from lower capacity during the quarter. We were able to successfully offset some of the pressure as we continue to drive productivity through initiatives like our Delta Material Services organization or our surplus part out strategy. Pension savings driven by our excess funding strategy and up-gauging. For example, we produced 1.6% higher domestic ASMs in the March quarter on 0.8% fewer departures and expect to see similar benefits from up-gauging going forward for succeeding years. Our maintenance cost pressures are expected to continue into the June quarter and we will see additional costs as our ground and flight attendant employees will receive a well deserved 6% increase on April 1. These factors are expected to result in non-fuel unit costs up 4% to 6% for the quarter. This includes about 1 point of pressure from last week\u2019s storm related cancellations.","But as we move on to the second half of the year, we expect to deliver approximately 2% non-fuel unit costs growth as maintenance spending tails off, we annualize product investments and lap the August technology outage. As a result, we remain on track to keep our full year CASM ex-growth in the 2% to 3% range consistent with our long-term cost target given this year\u2019s lower capacity levels. These cost expectations, when combined with our unit revenue outlook, are expected to result in a June quarter operating margin in the range of 17% to 19%, an increase over 2016\u2019s normalized 16.3% performance. For the back half of the year, while fuel prices are climbing, our CASM increases are moderating and our RASM trajectory is improving. So we continue to expect our margins to expand compared to the prior year on a normalized basis. While we expect that this will result in margins for the full year that are roughly 150 basis points below 2016 levels, all of that contraction will have already take place in the first quarter and we feel that we have good momentum building to continue to drive value for our owners through top line growth, margin expansion and prudent deployment of capital.","Turning to the balance sheet, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and our investment grade rating to proactively address our pension obligation this quarter. In a sign of our financial strength and durability for the first time in nearly 20 years, Delta issued unsecured investment grade debt. In the transaction, we issued $2 billion of 3-year and 5-year notes that have blended rate of just under 3.3%, my congratulations to the entire finance and legal teams for a job well done on this transaction. All of these proceeds have been put into the pension plan already. This contribution lowers our pension expense significantly in 2017 and is one of the initiatives we are using to achieve our CASM target this year. While the additional debt drives $70 million in higher annual interest expense in the near-term, the overall transaction will improve our free cash flow as we lower our pension funding from $1.2 billion to $500 million in voluntary contributions for each of the next 3 years. Additionally, this contribution completes all of our required minimum funding through 2024, creating additional cash flow flexibility for the future should we ever need it, although we will continue to focus on voluntary contributions to proactively address the obligation.","Our adjusted net debt increased to $8.8 billion this quarter driven by that debt issuance as well as seasonal liquidity. However, we remain committed to achieving our $4 billion debt target which the additional free cash flow will help us achieve. Excluding the accelerated pension funding, we generated $675 million of operating cash flow this quarter. We continue to focus on investing in the business for the future. In the first quarter, CapEx spending was $1.4 billion, which included $620 million for our strategic investment in Aeromexico as we successfully completed our cash tender offer. Core CapEx spending was approximately $800 million primarily driven by investments in aircraft, facility upgrades and technology improvements as we continue to drive towards our new data center. For the June quarter, we currently expect CapEx of approximately $1.2 billion, which includes about $175 million to exercise the derivatives necessary to complete our purchase for a 49% stake in the Grupo Aeromexico.","In the March quarter, we also returned $350 million to shareholders paying $149 million in dividends and $200 million in share repurchases. We remain committed to consistently returning capital to our owners and look forward to sharing more details on our capital allocation plan for the next several years, next month at our May Investor Meeting, which will mark our fifth consecutive spring Investor Day. In closing, with solid result we achieved this quarter has us on track to deliver on our commitments with a performance that is consistent with what we outlined at our December Investor Day. Producing a result similar to last year will be another testament to the durability of our business model and we remain focused on driving sustainable performance regardless of the challenges we faced. Jill?","Jill Greer","Thanks Paul, Ed and Glen. Jennifer, we could move to the analyst portion of the call if you could give the instructions for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, absolutely. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will hear first from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. Thanks. Good morning. Paul, on the second half on non-fuel cost gains of 2%, can you help us think through maybe third quarter, fourth quarter, because it feels like you will have a sizable decline in the fourth quarter?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning Duane. Thanks for joining us and thanks for your question. Obviously on a non-normalized basis, there is a significant lump in the reported earnings for 4Q because of that retroactive component last year, but as you look at the normalized results in the second half due to both a little bit higher capacity utilization in the peak summer periods and the second half of the year as well as lapping various product investments that we made beginning last year with meal service, enhanced snacks, etcetera, we start to see some of that CASM pressure wean and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving a higher pressure in the first half than the second half.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. And then on the advanced funding on the pension, can you quantify sort of the magnitude of that cost savings and when that kicks in, does that kick in now or does that kick in sort of on a 2018 basis?","Paul Jacobson","No, the savings of the pension were all pre-determined as amortized over all of 2017, so that run rate, which is in excess of $100 million of net savings to the company is already baked into 1Q results and will continue through the rest of the year.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you very much.","Paul Jacobson","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we will hear from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Mr. McKenzie your line is open.","Dan McKenzie","Yes. Hi. Thanks. Good morning everybody. Glen, there has been a number of media articles highlighting the move of U.S. banks away from London to other European capitals, Virgin Atlantic is now predicting a loss this year and you have talked about the fleet changes, you plan to make to help get back to positive unit revenues in Atlantic, but I am wondering how you are thinking about solving for London specifically, how much revenue could be at risk and what steps are you contemplating here, if any?","Glen Hauenstein","The declines and the reason for the decline and the forecasted profitability of Virgin Atlantic are more related to currency. And as you know, the British economy so far has held up better than anticipated post-Brexit. While we have heard a lot of noise about people moving and we respond to the demand, and I think we have a lot of levers should we actually see that materialize, but given that we haven\u2019t really seen demand declines yet, I think it would be premature for us to announce what we might do if demand declined. And I think what we have seen is, it\u2019s never been a better time to go to the UK or it\u2019s never been a better time to go to Europe for U.S. travelers. And we have seen an offset of UK point of origin, the U.S. point of origin has more than offset the decline in the existing UK weakness.","Ed Bastian","Dan, I want to add also that our Transatlantic business to London with Virgin Atlantic is solidly profitable. And you need to remember in the Virgin Atlantic result, there is also other parts of the world they fly to London outside of the Transatlantic and that\u2019s probably the area of core weakness, one of the areas of core weakness that they are experiencing, so we feel very good about our Transatlantic position at London.","Dan McKenzie","Yes, that\u2019s perfect. And I do see bookings to London actually are up quite strongly here for the second quarter, and to the UK just in general. And then I guess if I could just follow-up with a second question, I guess again for you Glen, the network investments over the past year \u2013 5 years actually have been pretty impressive and just given the JV arrangements that you guys have been able to ink out here and from where you sit today, are there other investments out there that you believe could be accretive?","Glen Hauenstein","Dan, we are not going to speculate on future relationships. The two big ones that we are looking at obviously is the Aeromexico JV that\u2019s going to be launching this quarter. And we are very excited about that. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the Korean JV, which will, in my opinion be a real game changer across North Asia, and we are excited about both.","Dan McKenzie","Understood. Okay. Thanks for the time guys.","Operator","And we will now hear from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Hi, good morning everybody, can you hear me?","Ed Bastian","We can Jamie, how are you?","Jamie Baker","I am well. Thank you, Ed. The first question to Paul, I am sorry to start with a modeling question, but it\u2019s an important one and I am getting pained by some clients looking for some clarification. When you talk about margin expansion, how exactly are you defining the baseline, is it simply reported margins from last year, in which case, The Street doesn\u2019t seem to embrace your third quarter guide or implications, but it does on the fourth quarter or is your baseline adjusted for the pilots that were out of period or captured entirely in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, I guess the easier way of asking is, what do you consider your second half 2016 operating margin to have been?","Paul Jacobson","So we will get back to the specific normalized. I don\u2019t have the margin calculation right in front of me. But we are looking at it on a normalized basis going forward, but for the second half of the year and certainly the full year results factor all of that out, because it\u2019s just a matter of timing. But consistent with what we have said going back to the fourth quarter results as well, the normalization is taking out, I think it\u2019s $390 million \u2013 $380 million out of the fourth quarter and just allocating it evenly across the first three and that\u2019s spread evenly across the full year.","Jamie Baker","So your second half adjusted is probably something in the low-16 range then, correct?","Paul Jacobson","I think that\u2019s about right. Yes. We will get back to you on the specific, it is the normalized results that we are looking to expand our margins.","Jamie Baker","Yes. And again, I apologize for starting up the call with modeling questions like this. Second one for Glen, you mentioned 84% of your corporate accounts expect to spend more on air travel, I am assuming that\u2019s a volume figure as opposed to being a corporations that account for 84% of corporate revenue, first am I correct. And second, for 16% the presumably expect to spend less, any color as to what line of the business they fall into?","Glen Hauenstein","The 84% is the survey of our corporate clients and it\u2019s the percent that are expecting to spend more. That is a first \u2013 is 1 point higher than it was last year and it is a first quarter record high. Really not a lot of color around the 16%, they do not but they are scattered around various industries. I think a couple of standouts that are very positive this year would be energy and banking and finance. So I think probably good reasons for both of those to be optimistic about travel for the rest of the year.","Jamie Baker","Okay, that\u2019s helpful color. Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate it.","Ed Bastian","Thank you, Jamie.","Operator","And we will move on to a question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Yes. Hey, two questions here. I guess first one for Paul, in the March quarter in the non-opt area, that $44 million miscellaneous loss, so presumably the 49% of Virgin is run through their March quarter, what percent of Aeromexico is actually that being run through the March quarter?","Paul Jacobson","There is actually none of it going through there at that point, because the tender offer wasn\u2019t completed until the end of the quarter.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. So then it\u2019s just the Virgin piece and the next quarter, we will have 49% of both Virgin and Aeromexico in the June quarter, is that the way to...?","Paul Jacobson","That\u2019s right, Mike. That\u2019s what we would expect.","Michael Linenberg","Perfect. And then just my second question is to Glen, if you are guiding to system \u2013 passenger unit up 1% to 3% Glen and I think you indicated that you anticipate that two-thirds of your domestic markets will be the positive PRASM in the June quarter, so when you think about domestic PRASM, is that going to be \u2013 is the year-over-year gain going to be running better than system average or is it going to actually be below system average, how should we think of it?","Glen Hauenstein","I think actually in the text, we gave a figure, we thought that the unit revenues domestically would be higher than that.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, very good.","Glen Hauenstein","It\u2019s \u2013 expect unit revenues to be up approximately 3 to 4 domestically.","Michael Linenberg","Great. Thank you.","Glen Hauenstein","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we will now hear from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks for the time. Just a question on the 2Q PRASM guide, what are you assuming on the CASM side as we go through the quarter, are you looking for earlier acceleration from 1Q and then maybe what you are seeing today and in April, excluding all the noise from the storm, obviously?","Ed Bastian","Well, Rajeev, we have very positive RASM for the rest of the quarter on the books for domestic in particular. And what we have seen in the past is as we move into the months, because the business fares were lower, those yields declined as you have got to the day of flight. We are seeing that taper off substantially from where we were just a few months ago and we are really just anticipating that the existing trends continue with just slight improvements over the quarter.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And another kind of related question, you touched on this a bit on your prepared remarks, but as Basic Economy for yourself is starting to get rolled out through this system and you are seeing others do it, how is that sort of coming into the market, how was it impacting some of the numbers, is it helping, is it not?","Ed Bastian","Well, the big advantage we have, I think with Basic Economy is the fact that when people are presented with the option of buying Basic Economy and for these are people who are buying the lowest available fare, when they are actually presented with what\u2019s the content of [Technical Difficulty], they are selecting something else. And that\u2019s the real value, is to be able to define a product and then be able to match that product to what customers want. And that\u2019s really how we have tried to de-commoditize the industry, is to demonstrate the people what the products and services are and separate them out because if we are not able to do that and we are only playing to the lowest common denominator and you wind up being commoditized. And I think when you think back to the frequent flyer program and how we used to give mileage based just on how long you flew and not how much you paid or what products you bought, we would really tried to reinvent the entire airline experience to be based not just on a seat and a fare, but the line of products.","Rajeev Lalwani","A quick follow-up there, so u7 are seeing that for yourself, Glen as it\u2019s showing up throughout this system as well in terms of just less fare dilution in terms not pushing it as a commodity as you noted?","Ed Bastian","We have been \u2013 as you know, we were the first major carrier to introduced Basic Economy. And other carriers have announced it and now have begun implementation of it. But they haven\u2019t really put it out broadly in application. So I think it\u2019s early for us to be able to communicate what their implementation is going to do to us.","Rajeev Lalwani","Very helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","And we will take a question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Hey. Good morning, just on the capacity growth, I know you reiterate overall capacity and I am just wondering if the plan still is similar to what you laid out at Investor Day, which is I think roughly 2% for domestic, flat for Atlantic, down 6% for Pacific and up 1% for LatAm, is that still the thinking on the regional basis?","Ed Bastian","Broadly, yes. I mean those are the numbers in total.","Savi Syth","Helpful. And then Glen, can I just ask on your comment, with the comment that the international \u2013 kind of the trends in the international segment should continue to improve modestly as you go through the year and I particularly, I am curious about the Transatlantic, because it seems like over the kind of the off-peak periods, there is a lot of good capacity discipline, but with the peak summer coming on, we are going to see high single-digit type growth in the industry, I am just wondering why that wouldn\u2019t maybe make things a little bit worse over the summer period?","Glen Hauenstein","I think in the prepared remarks, we said that we thought it would take longer to get to positive RASM in the Transatlantic than it would be other entities. But we are seeing very robust U.S. point of sale demand to Europe for the peak summer. And we are believing that for at least from our perspective that most of that will be absorbed by that higher demand. I can\u2019t speak for other carriers.","Savi Syth","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","And we will now move on to a question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Paul, does your 2Q margin guide factor in an adoption for the new FASB rule and pension accounting or you drop certain expenses below the line and if not, when will you do that and can you quantify the impact for us, please?","Paul Jacobson","Sure. Hunter, good morning, it doesn\u2019t reflect any early adoption as we will implement that in the first quarter of \u201818 as required by the adoption. And we will provide more details on that because there is going to be a lot of changes in 2018 obviously with revenue recognition and et cetera. So we will get into more detail on that later in the year.","Hunter Keay","Great. Thank you. And then maybe another one for you or really anybody, I guess. But Richard made some comments in the past about some industry over ordering in the wide-body side, I think he referred to it as a bubble, I am wondering if that\u2019s for still the Delta view on that. And as you want to turn that into a broader conversation around where you are stating with the order book on the wide-body replacement side, that would really be helpful too? Thank you.","Ed Bastian","Hunter, this is Ed. Yes, we continue to see excess capacity in wide-bodies as we look to the future for the industry as a whole. We continue to look internally as to what that means to Delta and we are in discussion with our OEM partners on what that means. And you could anticipate some reductions, I think broadly over the next several years.","Hunter Keay","Any potential comments on what you are thinking about may be issuing some RFPs for replacement needs?","Ed Bastian","We will comment on that when we actually issue the RFPs.","Hunter Keay","Alright. Thank you very much.","Ed Bastian","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we will now hear from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi guys. Thanks for the time. Glen, domestic industry capacity is growing about 4% which is greater \u2013 not just the greater than really GDP growth, but greater than nominal GDP growth, yet your domestic unit revenue has seen up 3% to 4%, so can you just comment on the extent to which you think the current \u2013 the current strength and the pricing environment is driven by just clawing back fortuitous discounts from years past that will sort of eventually run its course versus an actual real improvement in the supply demand balance and I guess I would ask that you characterize that by saying whether or not you need to see a reduction in industry capacity growth over the next couple of quarters in order for the trends that you are seeing right now in domestic unit revenue to hold? Thank you.","Glen Hauenstein","I will answer the second part of your question first. I think that we are comfortable that with the capacity that\u2019s available in the industry today, we can achieve significant positive revenue momentum through foreseeable future here. And the foreseeable feature for an airline is probably 3 months to 6 months. The first question, could you go back on that because I wasn\u2019t quite understood\u2026","Darryl Genovesi","Yes. I mean I guess I was just asking the same question on a two different ways, so I guess you broadly answered it, but what I had said was, we are seeing about 4% domestic industry capacity growth perhaps much more than that, which actually exceeds nominal U.S. GDP growth and I was just wondering what you thought formula was to get from domestic airline revenue, which is partly is kind of growing in line with U.S. nominal GDP to something that\u2019s essentially twice that this quarter?","Glen Hauenstein","I think that when you look at the macros, you could say it grows generally with the GDP. This cycle we have seen really robust leisure demand. So I think what you will see in the industry, this is just a forecast of when you get to third and fourth quarter, you will see that it\u2019s actually probably going a little bit faster than GDP, because the customers are \u2013 the customer base has grown and the fares required to now translate that into RASM are very nominal.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. Thanks for that. And then if I could just ask Ed. Ed, we have had this proposal from Governor Christie yesterday regarding overbooking, do you have any early thoughts on the states or the executive branch, the federal government\u2019s ability to regulate your ability to overbook without a wholesale change of legislation in the U.S. Congress?","Ed Bastian","Sure, Daryl. Overbooking is a valid business process. There is operational considerations behind that. It\u2019s not a question, in my opinion, as to whether you overbook, its how you manage an overbook situation. Delta, we have done a very, very good job of managing our overbook as we lead the industry in that regard. And interestingly, when you compare to an airline \u2013 to some airlines out there who actually advertise they don\u2019t overbook. And our numbers are 10x better in terms of involuntary denied booking spend, some of the airlines who advertise that they don\u2019t overbook, but clearly do in terms of having involuntary denials. So it\u2019s not about whether there is overbookings and our aggregate if you think about the full year of 2016, we had in total, 1,200 denied boardings for the entire year, that\u2019s 1 in 100,000 passengers. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a significant challenge for us. I think it\u2019s very much about giving our frontline the tools and the flexibility to empower them at the first point of contact and that\u2019s what we will continue to do.","Darryl Genovesi","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","We will take a question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi","Yes. Thank you. So Ed, two questions on loyalty program, 10 years ago, the idea of airlines looking to monetize their loyalty programs was discussed pretty openly, you said when you were CFO that monetizing, it could be an option, Glen made some similar comments, it seems pretty obvious that the market isn\u2019t valuing the programs now, so I m wondering if, Ed you can, if you agree with that assessment and if so, what you guys can try and do to show the market what it\u2019s worth?","Ed Bastian","Joe, we have no intent to monetize or spin-off the loyalty programs, if I am understanding your question properly. And I am not quite certain 10 years ago what was the \u2013 what was discussed back then, but we have never given serious consideration to actually spinning off the programs and monetizing them in that manner. I think the issues that have been discussed over last 1 year or 2 years as to providing a bit better color and transparency about the margins in the loyalty arrangement makes some sense and we are looking at that, but we have no intent to go down in a structural path.","Joseph DeNardi","Does it make sense for you and the Board to at least look into what the market may be willing to value the program that independently, I mean clearly there would be ways for you to monetize the program without spinning it off, you could sell a small equity stake in it just to show the market what it\u2019s worth, other airlines have done that, does it make sense to at least explore what the value could be, so you can make a more informed decision?","Ed Bastian","The loyalty programs in our view are the relationships we have with our most important customers. And we have never seriously considered actually monetizing or outsourcing that relationship. So I think the \u2013 there is value to what you are suggesting in terms of providing some better transparency and value that\u2019s embedded within our loyalty arrangements. But I don\u2019t believe we are going to explore an external infusion of capital into that.","Joseph DeNardi","Thank you.","Operator","And we will now hear from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Conor Cunningham","Hi guys. It\u2019s actually Conor in for Helene, just a little bit more on the Pacific, I know you have seen sequential improvement in your results there and there has been a lot of shipping capacity around that, but maybe you can just give a more defined timeline on when you expect an inflection in that market and maybe just like the mechanisms in which you expect will drive that improvement? Thanks.","Ed Bastian","Sure, I think the inflections are the down gauge of the airline from 747-400s to A350s and that occurs late this year or early in \u201818. And the bringing online of \u2013 and this can happen even before the JV. The JV with Korean probably will not occur until 2018. But there are steps that we will take that will bring us closer to Korean between now and then that should improve the connectivity of the Incheon hub. And Incheon is already the premier facility and operation in Asia connecting Southeast Asia to the U.S. And we will take another step forward this \u2013 late this summer when we being on the new terminal in Incheon, which will really be a state-of-the-art and probably the best terminal in the world and something we think very exciting for our customers, it gives us Asia to connect through.","Conor Cunningham","Great. Thanks. Actually, all my other questions were asked and answered. Thank you.","Jill Greer","Jennifer, we are going to take one more question from the analysts.","Operator","Okay, it sounds great. We will hear from Kevin Crissey with Citi.","Kevin Crissey","Thank you. Good morning. Can you hear me, right?","Ed Bastian","Yes.","Kevin Crissey","Alright, great. Thank you. Maybe Glen, can you talk about the 100% \u2013 I think you said 109% of industry RASM, I think there is a view in the marketplace that that\u2019s a temporary phenomenon, at least that\u2019s what I believe your multiples will suggest, can you talk about how you have taken it from, I believe it was in the 90-something percentile, up to the 109, what percentage of that is market share and that might be subject to natural reversal?","Ed Bastian","Kevin, this is Ed. We have been averaging in the 106 to 110 range of industry RASM for the last number of years. We continue to see it sustainable. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a temporary phenomenon. I believe it comes back to quality of service and product and delivery by the best people in the industry. It\u2019s not something that customers in the past have had experienced as well in this industry that they are now starting to experience better. And I think it\u2019s durable. I think it\u2019s sticky. We are not seeing any erosion in terms of overall corporate demand. And our share continues to be very strong. So we have heard this probably for about 8 years or 9 years, that Delta\u2019s revenue premium was somewhat at risk and every year we continue to go to market and improve that the Delta people are the best in the business and our customers value and pay us a premium for the services we provide.","Kevin Crissey","If I could have one quick follow-up, is there any change in philosophy of used versus new aircraft, there is a view out there that Richard was kind of the proponent for used, I want to see if there is any change in philosophy there?","Ed Bastian","The used versus new aircraft are always at the table. They weren\u2019t driven by any one person. Richard was a proponent as many of us were. And we continue to look at the best options for aircraft in the future. And now, listen, we bought a lot of new aircraft under Richard, too, so...","Kevin Crissey","Thank you.","Jill Greer","We are now going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call and I am happy to turn it over to our Chief Communications Officer, Ned Walker.","Ned Walker","Thanks, Jill. Appreciate it. Jennifer, we will go ahead and begin the media Q&A at this point. I would like to ask each of the participants if they could limit themselves to one question and a brief follow-up we should be able to accommodate most questions during the period. And with that, Jennifer, would you please review the process for asking the question, we\u2019ll get going.","Operator","Yes, absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And we will go ahead and take our \u2013 apologize one moment we will take our first question from David Koenig with the Associated Press.","David Koenig","Hi, this is for Ed, I guess. Wondered if you could address why a 1-day storm became a 5-day problem that had cost you $125 million hit to your pre-tax income? Are you simply understaffed to deal with unusual conditions and what are you going to do to avoid repeat?","Ed Bastian","Thanks, David. No, we are not understaffed. The storm that hit us on Wednesday was a \u2013 have the impact that, in my 20 years at the airline, we have never seen. It\u2019s not just a storm there were 7 different thunderstorm cells that happened over a rapid fire basis. Starting early morning to the evening, there were tornadoes in the region. We had a virtual shutdown of Atlanta for the better part of the entire day. And when you couple that with the very heavy period of travel, because we are right in the middle of the spring break travel period to peak, so we had limited capacity and seats by which that we could re-accommodate those disrupted operations. It really created a significant delay in terms of the challenges that we faced. We had crews that were diverted. We had crew rotations that were broken. We certainly understand and recognized the impact that\u2019s had not just on our crews, but also on our customers and we apologize as we did and we certainly take full responsibility for making this better into the future, but it was a function of the environment. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have a team that\u2019s focused on changes that we could need to continue to make in better crew tracking, better crew information and contact availability, we had crews calling in from all across the system that we are literally running the airline hour by hour in terms of where crews were and getting them piece back together. And it was a very difficult process for us.","David Koenig","Okay. Anything else that you are looking at or considering?","Ed Bastian","Well, as I said, the big changes we are making is around technology investment. And getting better crew tracking and this is an issue that\u2019s not just the Delta issue this is an issue for the industry as to how to minimize disruptions when they occurred. Typically, we certainly have had storms in the past, never in the middle of the summer with lack of warning that we saw. When we have snowstorms or snow events, we typically get out of the way and we let the weather past. We were not able to get out of the way. It hit us as we were right in the middle of one of the busiest travel periods of the year.","Ned Walker","Dave, this is Ned. I think also what Ed has asked is go us do a complete deep dive throughout the organization to find out lessons learned across all the different divisions and that process is going on as well.","David Koenig","Alright, thank you.","Operator","And next we will hear from Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News.","Michael Sasso","Yes, good morning. Can you just talk about your comments about wide-bodies? It was a little unclear whether you are talking about the industry itself might review orders that did sound as if you are saying Delta is going to review its wide-body orders. Can you just provide little more clarity on that?","Ed Bastian","Both, Michael. I think the industry, when you look at the overall demand environment, internationally obviously since you are talking wide-bodies with the level of capacity there is pressure in the environment. Supply is growing in many international markets in excess of demand. And with the amount of new wide-bodies and a lot of them by the way being triggered from the Middle East is going to create some really significant pressures on pricing in the wide-body market.","Michael Sasso","And just one follow-up, can you talk about what happened with regard to crew tracking during the storms? Was it an IT failure? I mean, was there a system that collapsed or was it simply \u2013 it worked properly just kind of got overloaded or something, how did the crew tracking kind of scheduling kind of breakdown?","Ed Bastian","It wasn\u2019t a question that the IT didn\u2019t work. It actually worked and it was worked as they designed \u2013 it got overwhelmed by the volume of broken rotations and cancellations and diversions. All of which needed to be put together on the fly at a level, an unprecedented level of volume that overwhelmed the systems a bit. So, the systems are working throughout. It was the size and the magnitude and the volume that we are experiencing that caused the delay.","Operator","And we will hear now from Chris Isidore with CNN.","Chris Isidore","Hi. Are you concerned about the publicity about the United case and to some extent, the problems you had last week prompting people and Congress to pass a law that would outlaw or severely restrict overbooking? You had said earlier that overbooking was a useful tool, if done properly. Are you worried about this becoming a new regulation or legislation restriction on you?","Ed Bastian","I don\u2019t think we need to have additional legislation to try to control how the airlines run their business in this space. As I indicated, it\u2019s a relatively small impact at Delta, while we \u2013 every single involuntary denied boarding, we take seriously and do our very best to minimize it. Our overall total number of involuntary denied boardings in the entire year of 2016 was 1,200 people, which was down 50% from what it had been in the prior year. It\u2019s 5x better than our big major carriers and 10x better than some carriers that actually advertised that they don\u2019t overbook. I think the key is managing it before you get to the boarding process and that\u2019s what our team has done a very effective and efficient job over. There are operational considerations, do wait balancing, weather delay, I mean, there is things that happened that create overbooking situations beyond just pure over sales.","Chris Isidore","Right. I guess, what I am saying is are you concerned that there has been talk by some members of Congress already about this and Governor Christie\u2019s remarks were referred to earlier. Are you worried that politicians will react to this story by placing more rules or regulations or are you confident that they will leave things legislatively the way they are?","Ed Bastian","All I can do is comment on how Delta handles it. And I am confident when or if people had an opportunity to look at how Delta has managed it, they would say Delta is doing a pretty good job of it.","Ned Walker","Okay. We have time for one more question, Jennifer.","Operator","Yes. We will take our final question from Edward Russell with Flightglobal.","Edward Russell","Hi, thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the 767 retirements that you said would begin this year? I mean how many aircraft will be leaving and which aircraft would you plan to pullout?","Ed Bastian","We were talking about the 747 retirements and the 767. We are initiating our 767 retirements. Three will be retiring this year. I don\u2019t know the tail numbers are in \u2013 I don\u2019t know that we do.","Edward Russell","Are these domestic Transatlantic aircraft?","Ed Bastian","These are Transatlantic airplanes. We have retired all of the domestic 767s already.","Edward Russell","Got it. Thank you very much.","Jill Greer","Okay. Thank you all very much. That concludes the March quarter 2017 call. We\u2019ll be back in 3 months with the June 2017 call. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"7262":["Delta Air Lines, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Ebony. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our December quarter and full year earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session.","Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta\u2019s financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings.","We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items, unless noted otherwise. We\u2019re also providing cost comparisons on a normalized basis as this better matches the retroactive expense we incurred in the fourth quarter 2016 from our pilot contract to the appropriate quarters of 2016. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the IR page at ir.delta.com.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed.","Ed Bastian","Well, thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining the call this morning. Earlier today Delta reported December quarter and full year results, including a December quarter pre-tax profit of $1 billion and an EPS of $0.96 ahead of consensus, which sat at $0.88. These rounds out the year with a $5.5 billion pre-tax profit and a 14.4% operating margin.","Operationally, the month of December presented us with several unique challenges, a significant southeastern snowstorm and the Atlanta Airport power outage. Together these events drove a $60 million impact and roughly 2,900 cancellations.","And thus far in January, our teams have persevered through the storm that hit the east coast earlier in the month and water main break at JFK this past weekend. I want to thank the Delta people for their incredible work in taking care of our customers, while recovering from these difficult events.","Once again, they demonstrated that our people and our culture are Delta\u2019s strongest competitive advantage. But it also reflects the importance of the significant airport infrastructure investments that we are a making to enhance the tools available to our employees to improve our customers\u2019 experience. For their outstanding work, we are pleased to recognize the Delta team with over $1 billion in profit sharing this year, which will be the fourth consecutive year of paying the $1 billion.","With our culture at the foundation, we are focused on the ways to improve our operational performance. We are running the best operation in the industry and ended 2017 with 242 days of no mainline cancellations, including a 50-day streak, 5-0, without a single mainline cancellation, while keeping domestic mainline on time arrivals at 85.4%.","We also had 90 days in 2017 with no system cancellations on the entire Delta platform or brand perfect days as we call them over 10% more than last year. The extraordinary work by our entire operations team resulted in Delta being named 2017\u2019s Most On-Time Global Airline by FlightGlobal. The first time a U.S. airline has earned this distinction. And in today\u2019s paper, we are pleased to see Delta named as the top airline of 2017 as determined by a thorough analysis conducted by the Wall Street Journal.","Running a great operation not only drives customer satisfaction but also cost efficiency. Our operating performance combined with the investments we\u2019ve made in our people, our fleet, products and facilities have driven a 2-point improvement in our net promoter score this year, including reaching an all-time high of 46.9% for the month of November. So while 2017 certainly had its challenges, it was a very successful year.","Customer and employee satisfaction remains strong, and we produced solid financial results, enabling significant investment in Delta\u2019s future. And as we laid out at Investor Day last month, we are entering 2018 with solid momentum. However, we are mindful of rising jet fuel prices.","Our fuel expense rose by nearly $350 million in the December quarter and current market jet fuel prices are 30% higher than last year. While higher fuel prices helped create greater stability for the industry over the long run, in the short-term it does take time for our business to recalibrate and recover those costs through our revenues.","But, with a solid demand environment and economic backdrop combined with the flexibility that we\u2019ve built into our business, we feel well-positioned to address this higher fuel environment. Glen and Paul will take you through the details, but I\u2019d like to spend a couple minutes on our path to strengthen our company and grow earnings in 2018.","First, we have to keep our topline growing. We\u2019re targeting a 4% to 6% revenue increase, while maintaining prudent 2% to 3% system capacity growth. We are currently seeing the best revenue momentum we had in five years and the December quarter was the first time all entities were positive since early 2013. We are gaining ground with our commercial initiatives and demand remains very strong. In fact, we set a new number one system and domestic revenue record on the Sunday after Thanksgiving.","Second, we\u2019ll leverage our international opportunities by our own growth, as well as through our partner relationships. After several years of shrinking our international capacity in response to economic weakness and the strong dollar, we\u2019re in good position to benefit from the improved global outlook. Our portfolio of investments is essentially complete and we have built a $2 billion asset that includes some of the leading airline brands around the globe. We\u2019ll drive enhanced value over the coming years through deeper integration of the Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic joint ventures, and we will be building out our JVs with Aeromexico, Korean, and WestJet.","Third, we must change the trajectory on unit costs and deliver on our zero to 2% non-fuel CASM growth guide for the year. It is the top priority for our finance team. Our decisions to invest in the business and restrain capacity in 2017 were the right ones, but they also contributed to unit cost growing over 4% for the year. This is not sustainable. With 60 new aircraft to be delivered this year, our up-gauging strategy is set to produce some of the greatest efficiency gains in Delta\u2019s history and will play a key role in returning our cost to a better level.","And finally, we are focused on making technology an improving source of competitive advantage. We are in the midst of a significant digital transformation, which will enhance our customer interactions and deliver more personalized service, further strengthening our brand and revenue premium.","With a pipeline of initiatives that we laid out at Investor Day supporting these themes, we have a path to grow earnings this year and now expect to produce $6.35 per share to $6.70 per share in 2018, an improvement from our earlier guidance based on the additional benefits from tax reform.","And as we think about the business long-term, we will continue to build upon and leverage our key economic moats, those competitive differentiators that will ensure our future success, our culture, our industry leading operational reliability, our unrivaled domestic network, our customer loyalty and brand, and our investment grade balance sheet.","Put together, these are Delta\u2019s unique advantages that provide the foundation to not only sustain our performance, but also improve upon our results. It\u2019s a powerful combination. It\u2019s why I have confidence and optimism for the year ahead.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Glen.","Glen Hauenstein","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. With the momentum we\u2019ve built throughout 2017, we are starting 2018 with a better revenue backdrop than we\u2019ve seen in many years. Revenues in the quarter increased 8% driven by modest capacity growth, broad-based revenue improvement and strong ancillary contribution. These results included a $45 million impact from Winter Storm Benji and the Atlanta power outage.","My thanks go out to the entire team for everything they have done this year to take incredible care of our customers, especially during the operational challenges it\u2019s truly our people who make the difference.","For the quarter, passenger revenues increased $527 million or 7% driven by strong demand and improving business yields. Our investments aimed at corporate travelers continued to gain traction as Delta was named Best Airline in the Business Travel News survey for an unprecedented seventh consecutive year.","Our fourth quarter corporate revenue growth was our highest since 2014, with both passenger volume and average fare improvements. Going forward, we expect corporate momentum to continue. Our last survey of corporate travel managers showed more than 88% project their spend will be maintained or increased in 2018. This is a 3-point improvement from last year\u2019s numbers and is the most positive outlook we\u2019ve seen in three years.","We also have continued strength in cargo and other revenues with cargo contributing a third consecutive quarter of double-digit improvement, up 14% in the December quarter. This caps off our first year of increases in the cargo revenue in six years.","Our partnership with American Express produced an incremental $19 million of value in the quarter. In 2017 we enrolled over 1 million new SkyMiles credit card accounts, a record for annual enrollment.","Co-brand spend was up 12% versus the prior year, outpacing the industry growth as reported through the third quarter. We expect another solid year of growth with an incremental 300 million from our American Express agreement in 2018.","Turning to unit revenues, 4Q system PRASM was up 4.2% with all entities closing the year in positive territory as we saw underlying improvements throughout the quarter. These results include about a 0.5 point from a one-time revenue adjustment.","The domestic entity delivered its third consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year PRASM with solid demand for both business and leisure, and for the quarter all hubs produced positive unit revenue results.","We continued to see improvements in business markets with now 81 of the top 100 business markets in positive yield territory up from 50% at the end of 3Q. Our domestic revenue premium stands at 117% of industry average and we expect to maintain this performance, while absorbing the industry\u2019s highest increase in stage length and gauge.","Internationally we saw improving trends with unit revenues again outperforming the domestic entity for the quarter. Foreign exchange was a 0.2-point tailwind to the system PRASM after three years of currency weighing on our international revenue performance we are positioned to benefit from a tailwind from foreign exchange in 2018.","In the transatlantic, unit revenues increased 7.4% on strong business class booking and foreign exchange tailwind. Our branded fare products led the industry providing customers a tailored travel experience with basic economy now selling in over 50% of European routes. We look forward to introducing our premium of select product in the transatlantic market in March.","Our Latin entity unit revenues grew 4%, the sixth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue. In spite of lingering impact from a particularly disruptive hurricane season, we saw strong demand trends across the portfolio and we are already making progress on our alliance integration with Aeromexico as we enter the first full year of the joint venture and we are excited about the upside opportunities.","The Pacific entity returned to positive PRASM for the first time in four and a half years. This is especially encouraging as these results included a 7% year-over-year increase in our trans-Pacific stage length.","We achieved several important milestones in the multiyear transformation of the region including approval by the U.S. DOT for joint venture with the Korean Airlines and the final retirement of the 747s with deliveries of six A350s within the quarter. The launch of the A350 has been very successful with strong demand and yields for both the award winning Delta One suite and Delta Premium select products. In the first quarter of 2018, the A350 will also be introduced on additional routes, including Detroit-Beijing and Atlanta-Seoul.","Our four core hubs have the best connecting structure to drive volume, I am sorry, looking forward, the global economic remains encouraging. Demand remains strong and we expect all four geographic entities to continue momentum in the first quarter.","With market fuel prices up 30% year-over-year, we must ensure that we recapture fuel through higher revenues. Based on the industry\u2019s historical recapture trends, we are confident that we will be able to cover this increase in the medium to long-term and our focus is to accelerate this process.","March quarter TRASM is expected to increase 2.5% to 4.5% by a 3% capacity growth, which includes 1 point increase in stage length and 2 point increase in gauge. We expect a solid demand environment combined with benefits from our initiatives will produce quarterly TRASM at roughly this level through the year, despite increasingly tougher comps.","As we shared at Investor Day, the outlook for 2018 is really exciting as we think about three platforms that will drive Delta\u2019s revenue and earnings growth. The first one is continuing to build more efficient and global airlines.","Our four domestic core hubs have the best connecting structure to drive volume, lower cost for employment, and enable continued up-gauging. This is the foundation of our domestic margin expansion for the future.","The pipeline of opportunity continues into the next decade as the A321neos that begin delivery in 2020 are 40% more fuel efficient than the current MD88s. Our -- we will have over 45% of our domestic seat departures in the most efficient large gauge, narrow body aircraft type by 2023.","The globalization efforts that we have been working on are coming into focus and fruition. In 2018, we are positioned to further leverage the partnerships we have in place, driving an expected $100 million in value with even greater upside to come.","Second, we will strengthen our brand and improve the customer experience. Over the next decade, we have more than $12 billion in an airport facility projects planned in Atlanta, LaGuardia, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Seattle. We are anticipating future travel trends and technologies to build the airport of the future as we strive to continue improving the Delta experience.","And finally, we will continue to enable customer choice as our fleet evolution continues to support our segmentation initiatives.","Branded fare has generated an incremental $200 million in the quarter. First Class upsell and Comfort+ revenues grew 25% to 30% for the quarter and post-purchase capability drove $80 million of revenue in 2017 following its mid-year launch.","In 2018, we expect $350 million in incremental branded fare contribution, up to $2.2 billion annually, driven by a 5% growth in premium seats from new aircraft deliveries and expanding basic economy.","With the favorable macroeconomic environment, international tailwinds and benefits from our commercial initiatives, combined with a great service of the Delta people, we have laid a path for solid topline growth in 2018 and beyond.","And with that, I am -- I\u2019d like to turn the call over to my good friend, Paul Jacobson.","Paul Jacobson","Thanks, Glen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019d like to start by echoing Ed and Glen in thanking the Delta team for all they\u2019ve done to take care of our customers and each other through some pretty unprecedented challenges in the last year.","For the December quarter, total operating expenses increased $1 billion, driven by a higher fuel and continued investments in our business. Non-fuel unit costs were up 5.6% for the December quarter and up 4.3% for the full year. This includes $85 million of accelerated depreciation, which hit in the back half of the year and pressured our full year CASM by about three-tenths of a point.","The investments we made in our product, operation, fleet and our people were important, and are already driving benefits. But as we mentioned before, we cannot sustain unit cost growth at this elevated level over time.","We expect the March quarter to be our peak cost growth of the year, with unit costs up 2% to 4%. The majority of our non-fuel expense growth should happen in the front half of the year and we are on a path to achieve zero to 2% non-fuel CASM growth for the full year.","In order to get there, first, we will lap costs we began incurring last year with a 6% April employee pay increase.","Second, depreciation expense will trail off markedly in the back half of the year, as we annualize the accelerated depreciation on our fleet and facilities. To give some perspective on this, depreciation for 2018 is expected to be up $250 million with $200 million of that increase in the first half of the year alone.","Finally, our maintenance expense has been weighted towards the front half of the year as we gear up for summer flying and some aircraft extensions that have been required as a result of the delays and deliveries of the C Series.","To meet our remaining cost targets we\u2019ll look primarily to our up-gauging and efficiency initiatives. As Ed said, the delivery of 60 aircraft in 2018 will drive some of the greatest efficiency gains in Delta\u2019s history with over $100 million in expected non-fuel savings this year alone.","Then, as I detailed at Investor Day, we have launched an enterprise level project to drive efficiencies across the organization and leverage our scale. We will be looking at things differently and changing the rules on how we manage the business. On a cost base of $27 billion, we believe $200 million of savings this year is definitely achievable.","For example, we\u2019re optimizing how we manage fleet complexity in our network. In January, markets with four or more equipment types have been reduced by 60% year-over-year. We will also have all MD88s based in Atlanta by this summer driving approximately $25 million in staffing and maintenance efficiencies alone.","Additionally, we have identified other opportunities in network scheduling, hotel spend and transportation. These are just some examples of the opportunities we have ahead of us and we feel good about where we are at this stage in the process.","Turning to fuel, our total fuel expense increased $349 million in the quarter, as market prices were 10% higher than the third quarter and 23% higher than prior year. Some of that pressure was offset by the refinery, which contributed $24 million in the quarter and $110 million for the full year. Importantly, the fourth quarter marks the last quarter of the legacy hedge losses, so we are really going to be able to see the benefit that\u2019s being generated by our fuel team.","Furthermore, our new aircraft deliveries will drive 2% in fuel efficiency gains in 2018. For the March quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to be $2.05 to $2.10, which includes the recent run up in fuel prices.","Now turning to EPS for 2018, our improved non-fuel cost trajectory along with the topline growth highlighted by Glen will allow us to deliver solid earnings growth this year, with further improvement from the benefits of a significantly lower corporate tax rate, as we discussed at Investor Day. This takes our full year forecasted EPS to $6.35 to $6.70, up 20% to 30% versus 2017.","However, the March quarter will see both the peak of our non-fuel CASM growth and the recent run up in fuel prices, which will impact our ability to grow earnings during the quarter. We therefore expect EPS in the range of $0.60 per share to $0.80 per share. This equates to a pre-tax margin of 6% to 8%.","And finally, our strong cash generation and investment grade balance sheet allow Delta to execute on our investment opportunities. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow for the quarter, which allowed for reinvestment in the business through $1 billion in CapEx related to aircraft, technology and ground. We also invested $450 million to purchase a 10% stake in Air France-KLM.","Looking at the full year, we expect capital spending in 2018 of roughly $4 billion and continue to target CapEx at 50% of our operating cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $435 million of free cash flow used towards the repurchase of $325 million of our own shares and to pay $216 million in dividends.","We remain strongly committed to shareholder capital returns and returned a total of $2.4 billion in 2017, the third consecutive year we returned at least 70% of our free cash flow to our owners and we continue to target that level going forward.","We also ended the year with $8.8 billion in adjusted net debt and our unfunded pension liability was $7 billion, down $3.6 billion year-over-year. With our pension funded status at 68%, that\u2019s our highest level since 2001, we are well on the path to achieving our pension funding target as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet and remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating that we worked so hard to achieve.","Looking back on 2017, we had a tremendous year for our people, for our customers, for our shareholders and the communities that we serve. We\u2019re poised to build on that success in 2018.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jill, so we can begin the Q&A.","Jill Greer","Ebony, we\u2019re now ready for questions from the analysts, if you could give them instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the questions. I guess, first, Glen, you have previously talked about how your -- I think, it\u2019s your corporate contracted business had fares, I think, roughly 20% below where they were in 2014. I guess, can you give us an update on where they stand now and how much of a benefit is in your 1Q PRASM guide for a return of business -- really a return of business travel demand stemming from the tax cuts?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, we are very excited about the potential for business -- increased business demand with the tax cuts. We haven\u2019t seen that materialize yet but we expect that to materialize in the first quarter and our guide does not have that, because we can\u2019t see it yet.","So the fare levels have stabilized and started to improve. But fare levels are only a few percentage points higher than they were in the trough. So, I think, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity moving forward as demand continues to improve.","Andrew Didora","Great. And then, second question is just for Paul, two on the cost side. I guess, one, what is your Brent assumption in your new EPS guidance and did that change from Investor Day? And then, secondly, just the timing of maintenance costs, why is 1Q different from other first quarters in terms of maintenance spend ahead of a busy summer period, are you just expecting to run the network harder or is there something else I am missing there? Thanks.","Paul Jacobson","Sure. Good morning, Andrew. Thanks for those questions. On the maintenance question, I would say, it\u2019s a little bit higher than traditional first quarters. As you know, the -- with the mitigation of the C Series delays that we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve got a little bit more work to do on the existing fleet versus expecting that the new aircraft we\u2019re going to deliver for the summer schedule. So I would say it\u2019s a little bit disproportionately weighted from that perspective and if you wouldn\u2019t mind, repeat your first question, sorry?","Andrew Didora","No. I just -- curious what your assumption for Brent was in your full year guide and did it change since your Investor Day? Thanks.","Paul Jacobson","Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that. We haven\u2019t changed the full year guide. It\u2019s obviously very early in the year. I would say we\u2019re slightly ahead of what our expectations were for 2018 in terms of the rapid pace of the price appreciation. But we have a long way to go and we know that, that is volatile, but we did assume the forward curve as we always do. But we feel okay about where it is right now, but we\u2019re obviously watching it closely.","Andrew Didora","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Yeah. Hey. Just a question to Glen, you talked about FX showing up in the international unit revenue having a positive impact. What about the return of fuel surcharges? It looks like that they\u2019re now coming back into the Pacific, are you seeing that, have they increased recently, can you just give us some update on that?","Glen Hauenstein","Yes. Clearly, internationally, we\u2019ve seen fuel surcharge increases due to the higher level of fuel and we expect that to continue if fuel stabilizes at this or higher level.","Michael Linenberg","Just a question to Paul, can you -- as I recall from the Republic bankruptcy, I believe you own a piece of that, what is the percent and is that being accounted for under the equity method?","Paul Jacobson","No. That all - all the changes in value there flow through equity, so it doesn\u2019t -- the ownership itself doesn\u2019t have an impact on the P&L.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. But you own -- what is it -- you own what 25% of that, I believe?","Paul Jacobson","Yes. Yeah. It\u2019s in the 20%-ish range.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Okay. That\u2019s just being run through the non-op. Okay. Great. Thanks, Paul.","Operator","And we will take our next\u2026","Paul Jacobson","No. Hey, Mike. Just to clarify -- yeah, I am sorry, operator. Mike, just to clarify that, no, it runs through the balance sheet, it does not run through non-op because it\u2019s not publicly traded.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Okay. No. Thanks. I appreciate that. That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Hey. Good morning, everybody. First, Paul, I know your trailing view on hedging, but as you\u2019re obviously aware, the market has returned to backwardization now for the first time in, I don\u2019t know, two and a half years, if memory serves. Just wondering if this might influence your thinking on this topic, the hedging topic?","Paul Jacobson","No. Jamie, thanks for the question. There\u2019s no change. I think the -- as I\u2019ve said, I am relieved to be able to say the legacy losses are behind us and we feel good about where we are competitively\u2026","Jamie Baker","Okay.","Paul Jacobson","\u2026especially the work that we\u2019ve put into the supply side of it, both harvesting the benefits of the refinery, but also looking across self-supply at multiple stations and feel good about where our position is and I think the industry is at a parity level on fuel input costs that it hasn\u2019t seen in quite some time.","Jamie Baker","Okay. And second for Glen, I thought Mike\u2019s question on fuel surcharges was a good one, they\u2019re not permitted domestically. I think it was the legion that took a stab a couple of years back unsuccessfully at that to potentially revise that. It does make me wonder and thanks, Mike, I only began to wonder this in about the last 90 seconds, given the current political and regulatory climate, perhaps, you would have a more receptive year in Washington on the topic of domestic fuel surcharges, is that anything we should be thinking about?","Ed Bastian","I think I am going to toss that to Peter Carter, our General Counsel because\u2026","Jamie Baker","Okay. Yeah. Perfect.","Peter Carter","And Jamie, hi. Good morning. I would say we haven\u2019t given that particular issue much thought, but there is no question that the Trump administration has been very open to the airline industry in general and I think, frankly, business. So interesting question and I appreciate it.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, gentlemen. Take care.","Operator","We will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Glen, can you expand a little bit on your comment about keeping unit revenue growth rates at the level of your March guidance despite a tougher comp, how do you see that playing out? And I wonder -- and sorry if I missed it, would you be willing to rank the geographies in terms of unit revenue growth rates you expect in the March quarter?","Glen Hauenstein","Sure. Let me start with the second one first because I think it\u2019s the easiest. I think we would expect the transatlantic to be number one, Latin to be number two, domestic to be number three and Pacific to be number four. So that\u2019s a pretty easy question and the second question was, what again, I am sorry?","Duane Pfennigwerth","I think you made a comment in the prepared\u2026","Glen Hauenstein","So our business plan is predicated on 6.5%, 7% total revenue growth or passenger unit -- passenger growth and that equates to a 2% to 3% capacity increase and around a 3.8%, right around 4% unit revenue. So we\u2019re kind of treading at the rate that we need to get to generate that revenue throughout the year.","And so we feel pretty good about where we sit today versus what we need to achieve to get to the business plan, which is very different than where we were last year when we started the plan, because if you remember, we were in negative territory last year when we had the same call, the fourth quarter call and we had to move that to positive momentum, but that was a much heavier lift than really just playing out what we had and as you go through the year then just keeping that baseline moving.","So I think we feel a little bit better, not that it\u2019s not challenging, not that there won\u2019t be a lot of things we don\u2019t expect between now and December of next year and we know that. But we feel a little bit better about the line of sight to getting from where we are to where we need to be versus last year and turning from a negative unit revenue growth to positive.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks, Glen. And if I could sneak one more in on Paul, your operating cash flow was up materially year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Looks like you had about a $700 million working capital benefit, can you talk about what drove that? Thanks for taking the questions.","Paul Jacobson","Well, it was a number of things, but I think it also bears mentioning that as a result of our investment grade balance sheet. We have done an initiative with the supply chain to go out and work proactively with our vendors to extend some of our payment terms and do other things to drive working capital in the business. So we were focusing on that very consciously.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Sorry. Can you guys hear me?","Paul Jacobson","We can now.","Glen Hauenstein","We hear you Hunter.","Hunter Keay","Sorry. I apologize for that. Are you expecting a headwind from the change in frequent flyer revenue recognition around the airline for the prevailing market rate or whatever it\u2019s called, I think, I had heard about $100 million, is that factored in to the EPS guide or is that a static number, can it change, how are you thinking about that?","Paul Jacobson","Hey, Hunter. This is Paul. So, yeah, as we talked about at Investor Day, we don\u2019t expect materially year-over-year changes from revenue recognition on the full year basis.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thank you. And then\u2026","Paul Jacobson","Yeah.","Hunter Keay","\u2026 on the 2018 guide, pardon, sorry, Paul, what?","Paul Jacobson","No\u2026","Hunter Keay","Sorry. On the 2018\u2026","Paul Jacobson","I was just supplementing that. Go ahead, Hunter, appreciate\u2026","Hunter Keay","Okay. I don\u2019t know if my phone -- I don\u2019t know if my phone is breaking up or I can\u2019t hear you. So, on the 2018 earnings guide, if you find yourself drifting out of the low end of the range for whatever reason, where do you think you have the most incremental opportunity to get back in it? Is it non-fuel costs, is it revenue or is it something else?","Ed Bastian","Hunter, this is Ed. I\u2019ll take that. I mean, it\u2019s really premature to be speculating how 2018 is going to be rolling out. We feel optimistic given the guide and our commitment to getting our non-fuel costs back to flat with zero to 2%, but you\u2019ve heard me say before, my expectation is closer to zero than 2%.","And the demand environment is the healthiest we have seen in years. And so, I think fuel is a little bit of a wild card there. We\u2019ll see how that plays out. It seems like the market has gotten overheated over the last few months. We\u2019ll see where that settles out. But we feel pretty confident that the -- it\u2019s roughly a 20% to 30% bump year-over-year on EPS is our best look and I wouldn\u2019t get into how do you manage some of the levers, it\u2019s way too early.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thanks","Operator","Our next question will come from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Please go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. At your Investor Day, you had suggested that perhaps if passed -- if Tax Reform were to be passed that there would be some incremental pension contributions. Is that something that you\u2019re looking at for 2018 or would that basically be on hold until 2019 when the cash tax savings kind of starts to appear?","Paul Jacobson","That\u2019s right, Darryl. We obviously are not going to see any cash savings in 2018 from Tax Reform since we weren\u2019t anticipating paying any taxes and we still don\u2019t anticipate paying taxes in \u201818. But as we become a taxpayer between \u201819 and \u201820, the reduced level of taxes that we ordinarily would pay, one of the sources for those proceeds would be to continue to fund and hopefully get as close to a fully-funded status in pension over the next several years as possible. So that to me would be high on the priority list.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, I guess, just on -- I wanted to ask you a little bit about aerospace manufacturer and supplier consolidation. It would appear that the proposed Airbus deal with Bombardier would benefit you in some way, but now you\u2019ve got media speculation that Boeing and Embraer are talking, and you\u2019ve already seen some suppliers get consolidated away over the last couple of years like glitch and the airspace and others. Is this, I mean, would you anticipate this being a problem for you in terms of how you\u2019ll manage your fleet costs over the next few years?","Glen Hauenstein","We don\u2019t anticipate that being a significant issue. As you mentioned, the Airbus-Bombardier deal we\u2019re supportive of and we think that will enhance the ability for the C Series to come to market.","With respect to further supplier consolidation within the OEMs, we have conversations with all those OEMs and we are certain that we set expectations around performance for them, and ensure that Delta is not harmed from any of that, and we\u2019ve received their commitments that this is actually only going to enhance their service levels to Delta, not put us in a competitive disadvantage.","Darryl Genovesi","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. So, Ed, I wanted to come back to one of your prepared remarks talking about how fuel can drive greater stability in the long run for the industry, I think you were saying higher fuel prices. But then, Glen, also talked about accelerating revenue recapture that the industry historically has done. So, I guess, it\u2019s not the same as Hunter\u2019s question, but we do know fuel costs are higher here, so what are some of the things that Delta can do specifically to help drive that revenue recapture and really push down fuel volatility for your investors?","Ed Bastian","Well, our ability to push down fuel volatility is, I think, that\u2019s a little outside our control. We do our best to manage the fuel environment that\u2019s in front of us. I think the biggest thing we have going in our favor in 2018 is a strong economy with a lot of optimism.","We\u2019ve got a significant list of commercial initiatives that are coming to fruition. We have a strong international environment, which we haven\u2019t seen in a number of years. So that\u2019s the main focus in terms of being able to recover and recapture fuel.","Historically, the industry has always managed spikes in fuel by offsetting reductions in capacity. I think it\u2019s premature and early yet to start to adjust our 2018 capacity plans. But we will look as the next few months unfold, as fuel prices continue on this tear, it certainly will have an impact and we\u2019ll be prepared to deal with that going forward, we know how to do that well. But I think the economy is the biggest benefit and I think that\u2019s the lever we\u2019ll be using to manage the fuel environment.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. I appreciate that. And, Glen, it might just be my phone is not too good here either, but you were talking about three platforms for revenue expansion. I think what I heard was up-gauging and airport investments, but maybe I am simplifying that. So can you come back to some of those longer term revenue initiatives and really focus us in on what are the keys there?","Ed Bastian","Sure. I think the key for us domestically is the continued up-gauge strategy and one of the benefits that that provides is a higher level of the premium products and services that have been so successful in the marketplace. If you think about where we started many years ago with selling First Class and then introducing the enhanced Economy products domestically, we\u2019ve come a long way since then and every year we think those products -- how do we continue to mature, well, in some ways they\u2019re very established now. They\u2019re still very young products. They\u2019re only in the marketplace three, four, five years.","And some of the things we have on the horizon which we think are really exciting are different ways to be able to buy those products and services. So, for example, if your company\u2019s plan -- travel plan doesn\u2019t allow you to sit in Premium, Economy or in First, this year we allowed you to buy that and a post purchase and we sold almost $100 million of that in the first six months of that being available to sale.","By this summer, we\u2019re anticipating being able to now also offer that post purchase in miles and if you think about how that opens the aperture to control your travel experience for people who want to buy those premium products and services, we think that\u2019s going to be key to our ability to drive revenues moving forward.","And the fleet itself just in 2018 alone provides for 5% greater seat availability by the end of this year in those premium products and services. So not only do we have the base but we now have the premium products and services and different ways to buy them at different points in the purchase path. And as we continue to work on our digital evolution, we could see expanding that so that we can actually market to you.","And those are things that we have coming in the pipeline in the next months and years that we\u2019re really excited about is not driving to the bottom end in the commodity once a year flyer, but to really the people who are discerning and who want to buy premiums in products and services.","And we\u2019ve been at the forefront of that for years. We have a very good view of how that\u2019s going to play out over the next couple years and that\u2019s really the cornerstone of our ability to continue to drive premium revenues at Delta. Is that too long?","Brandon Oglenski","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joseph Denardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Joseph Denardi","Yeah. Thank you very much. Glen, you talked about the strength of the AMEX partnership and record card acquisitions. I think you guys gave the $2 billion -- the $4 billion by 2021 target, I don\u2019t know, a couple years ago, is there upside to that at this point just based on how strong the trends have been recently?","Ed Bastian","Joe, this is Ed. I\u2019ll take that. I -- yeah, I think, there\u2019s potential upside too. I\u2019d say again, we got close to $1 billion to go to get there yet and we\u2019re having good success, and we\u2019ve got a great partner at AMEX who is fully committed to that trajectory as well. So we\u2019ll see over the next several years. But it\u2019s safe to say from when we did the deal a couple of years ago we\u2019re running ahead of expectations.","Joseph Denardi","Got it. Okay. And then, Paul, just on the guidance for the year, is there anything explicitly in the EPS guidance related to mark-to-market adjustments for your equity investments?","Paul Jacobson","No. That\u2019s all timing and out of period, so we wouldn\u2019t be putting that in.","Joseph Denardi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Ed, if I could ask you sort of a conceptual question about Tax Reform. I guess, the question I\u2019ve been getting a good bit from investors is around potential for this to get competed away over time. And so when you think about the P&L savings from the lower book tax rate related to the Corporate Tax Reform, how do you think about the airline industry potentially competing that away over the next several years and I would have thought given that most U.S. airlines are not cash taxpayers that perhaps it would take some more time to do that, but we\u2019re already seeing some of the airlines not Delta but others who are not cash taxpayers giving cash bonuses. So I am just curious to get your thoughts on the potential for this book tax savings get competed away over the next couple of years.","Ed Bastian","Well, Jack, we have no intent to compete away the tax savings. We will certainly use the tax savings to reinvest in the business to strengthen the balance sheet. I mentioned pension is one of the things that we\u2019re focused on. But the core of your question is right. There\u2019s very little cash tax being paid by the U.S. airline industry at this moment. So it\u2019s hard to compete away something you don\u2019t have.","I won\u2019t comment on the other airlines giving away cash bonuses to their employees. That\u2019s great for the employees and I am glad to see that. We have a sustainable profit sharing plan over the long-term that has been far superior to any cash bonuses that any of the others have given out and that\u2019s how we pay our employees. So I understand the question. I understand the concern. But it\u2019s pretty hard to compete what you don\u2019t have.","Jack Atkins","Yeah. No. That\u2019s definitely fair. One other high level question, would a U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA impact your partnerships with WestJet or Aeromexico?","Ed Bastian","I am not going to get into speculation. I don\u2019t know.","Jack Atkins","Okay. Okay. Thank you for the time.","Operator","We will take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Savi Syth","Hey. Good morning. Just on the entities, I was kind of curious if you could share, one, the capacity growth expectations by entity for the year, and then, two, with the JVs that have kind of recently been strengthened, when should we see that kind of start to flow through and drive more of the revenue upside?","Paul Jacobson","So, Savi, good morning. We don\u2019t give into the capacity by region on that detailed level. But on the JV benefits, we\u2019re seeing some of that building in now, you see it coming through both on the revenue lines with the sharing, but also inherent in the Delta P&L with the synergies that we get from the network. There\u2019s a ramp-up period, obviously, as we work through those issues. But I think the international team has done a terrific job and we\u2019ll start seeing those -- some of those benefits in 2018.","Savi Syth","Got it. And Paul, if I might just a quick question on the refinery, what\u2019s your expectations there for 2018?","Paul Jacobson","So, on the refinery, so 2018 is a turnaround year. We\u2019re currently expecting to have a similar year, but obviously, it\u2019s still very early in the year. But we\u2019ll have some down period especially towards the back end of 2018, but we expect a small contribution from it this quarter based on where cracks are and continue to provide that kind of $0.02 to $0.03 benefit quarter-by-quarter when it\u2019s running.","Savi Syth","Got it. All right. Thank you.","Operator","We will move next to Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Thanks, Operator. Hi, team. Thanks very much for taking the time. I have just two questions. One is when you talk about up-gauging, are you talking, is that 100% mainline aircraft that you\u2019re talking about or is there a percentage that\u2019s mainline and a percentage that\u2019s regional?","Paul Jacobson","It\u2019s mostly mainline at this point, Helane.","Helane Becker","Okay.","Ed Bastian","And not just that Helane, as you know, we\u2019ve been shrinking the fleet at the regionals, which has also contributed to that. If you think about the mix of where our fleet evolution, we had I believe almost 800 regional jets at one point in time and we\u2019re down less than half of that now. So it\u2019s not only growing the gauge at the mainline, but reducing the reliance of the regional fleet.","Glen Hauenstein","The big up-gauge that we\u2019ve got here in the next couple years is the retirement of the MD80s. We still have over 100 of those that we\u2019re flying and we\u2019ll be retiring them over the next -- by 2020 and bringing those all up to the 321s and 739s, as well as some MD90s as well. So that\u2019s where the bulk of the up-gauge is.","Helane Becker","Okay. Perfect. Yeah. I think at one point you guys were the largest operator of RJs in the world. And then my second question is with respect to air traffic control delays in the Northeast and maybe, Ed, this is a question for you, as you plan for the summer months, because I feel like that was the biggest problem last year here in our New York markets, are you thinking about adjusting capacity in this New York, maybe Boston corridor to allow for those delays that we get, what are they, ground stops on a daily basis?","Ed Bastian","We do, Helane, as you know we take our operational integrity incredibly important, it\u2019s at the core of what we deliver to our customers, as well as to our employees and to the extent the Northeast corridor continues to be problematic with respect to delays. We take that into account. It\u2019s hard to predict at some level when the storms occur.","But we work very closely with air traffic control and with all of our partners out there to ensure that we\u2019re getting the very best intel, transparency and through-put as we can. But it\u2019s a challenging environment. It will stay challenging for everybody up there for a period of time.","Helane Becker","Okay. Thank you very much for your help. I appreciate it.","Ed Bastian","Sorry. I can\u2019t be more optimistic.","Operator","Our next question will come from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Glen, a couple of questions for you on the international side, what gives you confidence that we\u2019re not at some sort of peak, I mean, I think, we\u2019re going to put in about plus 5 on PRASM. And then just relating to that, where do you have more confidence, is it more on the demand side or the supply side?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, I think when you read all the headlines about the synchronized global economic expansion, that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing manifesting itself. So we\u2019ve seen not only an uptick in the average realized fare of business travel in the international entities but we\u2019ve also seen an increase in core demand there as well.","And so I think that when you think about how the U.S. is probably still growing and still accelerating growth, and when you think about Europe, when you think about the economies in the Pacific, it gives you a lot of confidence that as we move through the year, this is going to continue to improve and our advances would substantiate that.","So we have a little bit more visibility on international, because it books earlier than domestic generally and so those two combinations give us a pretty good confidence level that it\u2019s accelerating rather than decelerating.","Rajeev Lalwani","And to the extent that tax reform benefits start to come through from a demand perspective, is it fair to say that the domestic side should do a bit better or do you think international would be able to keep up as well?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, I am bullish about international for this year, not the least of which, which I didn\u2019t mention in the earlier question -- answer is that foreign exchange becomes a tailwind this year. And we\u2019ve been fighting two or three years of arriving dollar and so now having that also running in our favor is also another great tailwind for international.","Ed Bastian","I think it\u2019s also fair to say, Rajeev, that the domestic business should certainly receive a benefit as consumers start to see lower paycheck deductions in terms of lower tax rates as corporations start to invest further to take advantage of the benefits U.S. corporations that the Tax Reform facilitates. I think it\u2019s fair to say that domestic should receive at least as much a benefit as international.","Rajeev Lalwani","Very helpful. Thank you.","Jill Greer","Ebony, we\u2019ve got time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Dan McKenzie","Hey. Good morning. Thanks guys for squeezing me in here. Glen, just a couple questions and these are kind of tied to some of the earlier questions, but I would have expected Delta to trim its full year outlook, and of course, that wasn\u2019t the case. So if I can probe just a little bit more on what if anything, has changed versus the Investor Day, and I guess, I am wondering is fuel surcharges and that also going back to your observation about global synchronous growth driving international demand, has there been an improvement in the outlook of your JV partners since the Investor Day?","Glen Hauenstein","I am going to turn that over to Paul because he is more in tune with the complete level of the guidance, so Paul?","Paul Jacobson","Yeah. Well, I think, we expect some good year-over-year performance from our partners going forward, not just from the synergies, but from their own appreciation. We\u2019ve spoken a lot about the improvement in the economic environment in Latin America in particular as it relates to GOL and to Aeromexico.","So they\u2019re a contributing piece to it. But, I think, overall as we look at the year going forward, as Ed mentioned, it\u2019s too early to hit the panic button on fuel prices. The revenue environment has a lot of momentum headed in the right direction. We feel good about where we can hit from the cost side. So it\u2019s a driver, but I think at the end of the day it really comes down to our ability to execute on the plan and continue to watch those external variables.","Ed Bastian","Dan, this is Ed. If I could weigh in for a moment, we as an industry have demonstrated our ability to cover higher fuel prices. Don\u2019t forget we were profitable with fuel well over $100 a barrel.","And I think over the medium-term, if the new level is at $70, the industry will adjust reasonably quickly to that level. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s three months or six months or nine months. But over time we don\u2019t adjust our capacity or start making short-term decisions based on where the fuel numbers hit on a week-over-week basis.","So we\u2019re optimistic, we\u2019re confident, we\u2019ve got all the levers within our control, the most important of which are the best employees and the best customer service in the business that\u2019s going to really cover fuel forever or us.","Dan McKenzie","That\u2019s great. Thanks for that, Ed. And then, I guess, just my second question here, just ties to the basic economy part of the business here. We seem to start the quarter out pretty clunky on this and since November was pretty bad, of course, that all changed pretty dramatically in December. And so as we look at the uptick in demand that occurred during the quarter, is it really as simple as increased consumer confidence around the tax cut or did the industry perhaps get a little smarter about how to market basic economy throughout the quarter?","Ed Bastian","We don\u2019t think basic economy, as we\u2019ve stated in the past, is a huge driver of the ancillary products and as a matter of fact, the three that we track, it is the smallest contributor to the incremental revenue base.","But we do see, as we continue to roll it out internationally, that there are significant benefits and as we move into selling and from selling into flying in the transatlantic, our lowest fares will now have baggage fees attached to them and that\u2019s really a first for U.S. carrier in the transatlantic market.","And so we\u2019re looking for that to drive some incremental revenues and really to be very competitive similar to how we are competitive with the ULCCs domestically, a great tool for us to be more competitive in terms of the fare itself with the ULCCs and the transatlantic. And we\u2019re very optimistic about how that will play out in the Consumer segment that we need to be and although, that\u2019s not where we\u2019re making our big investments.","Dan McKenzie","That\u2019s terrific. Thanks, guys.","Jill Greer","Okay. That\u2019s going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I am now going to turn it over to Ned Walker, our Chief Communications Officer.","Ned Walker","Hey. Thanks, Jill. Ebony, we\u2019re ready for the media Q&A. Would you please review the process for the media to go ahead as a question. Also for the media, we\u2019d request that you limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. That way we should be able to accommodate most of your questions. Go ahead, Ebony, please.","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from David Koenig with AP. Please go ahead.","David Koenig","Yeah. Hi. To clarify something that Glen said on the analyst portion about the tax law. So even though you think it\u2019s going to increase business travel that is not in your revised full year EPS guide and can you say anything more about how the law is going to help you since you don\u2019t pay cash taxes?","Ed Bastian","David, this is Ed. What Glen was talking about is we don\u2019t -- we haven\u2019t yet seen the evidence that there\u2019s going to be stimulated travel demand given that it\u2019s so early with the law just coming out over the last couple of weeks. But we at the same time are optimistic that the law will help us deliver on our revenue guide, and we do anticipate and we do have factored in our revenue expectations for the year seeing improvements from Tax Reform. The second part of your question that was around competing away the tax benefits, I believe or not seeing the cash.","David Koenig","Well, it is\u2026","Ed Bastian","What?","David Koenig","No. It was more just if there\u2019s anything else in the law that is going to help you, are you talking about the faster expensing or maybe something else in the other provisions in the law?","Ed Bastian","Yeah. I mean, the law in addition to providing a stronger economic outlook for our consumers, it\u2019s going to provide a much stronger economic outlook for Delta. We expect the benefit will probably be about $800 million a year at our current earnings level. We are not a cash tax payer today, but we will be a cash tax payer in the next couple of years and so you\u2019ll see that value ramp as we work off the last remaining NOLs that we have. So it will be a significant benefit for Delta and our owners.","David Koenig","Okay Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.","Michael Sasso","Yeah. Good morning. Yeah. Maybe this is for Ed. Can you tell me, I know there\u2019s some wiggle room in when you expect to take the C Series, but can you for your own -- what are some assumptions you\u2019re making for your own operations --can you tell me what the latest thinking is when you\u2019ll actually take the C Series?","And the second part is, what are all the impacts that you\u2019re doing, ways that you\u2019re trying to cope with not having that, are you having to delay or roll back certain routes that you had anticipated? I think Paul mentioned that it\u2019s boosting maintenance costs, just what are some of the impacts that it\u2019s having by having those delay?","Ed Bastian","Well, we\u2019re waiting to hear the results of the International Trades Council that is scheduled to rule before the end of January. So I\u2019d say, it\u2019s -- I can\u2019t really respond fully to your question, Michael, until we hear the results in which Boeing was expected to be able to prove harm. So I don\u2019t know what the actual tariff will be, if there is any at all and once we know what that is, then we will set our plans accordingly.","With respect to incremental impacts that we are already experiencing, yes, we do know that we will not be taking the C Series according to the current schedule, which we\u2019d be taking delivery this spring. And to that end we have had to invest in maintaining some aircraft, particularly MD88s to keep them around a little bit longer than we were otherwise anticipating.","Michael Sasso","And just follow, have you had to delay certain routes and is it just changing how you\u2019re flying that you had anticipated in the next year or two?","Ed Bastian","We will make those decisions once we know what the rules are.","Operator","Our next question will come from Susan Carey with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Susan Carey","Good morning, everybody. Two little questions, is it still true that your F -- your full year \u201818 EPS includes $1 for the tax cuts? And second question, there was some speculation that Delta was going to go after Georgia Power or the airport\/City of Atlanta for the power outage, is there any kind of new thinking on that?","Paul Jacobson","Your first question, Susan, yes, $1 is the current ballpark estimate on the value -- the benefit of the Tax Reform that we have rolled into the EPS. With respect to your second question, we are having very productive conversations with Georgia Power, as well as with the airport authority here in Atlanta and the City of Atlanta about, number one, making certain that we learn from the experience. We all persevered in December and ensure that never happens again and putting in the right design and structure, both in the short and long-term to protect our power source with respect to any compensation. It cost us around $40 million and we\u2019ll have the conversations at the appropriate time with those parties.","Susan Carey","Thank you.","Ned Walker","Ebony, we\u2019ll have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Alana Wise with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Alana Wise","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks so much for taking my question. So quickly I just wanted to revisit the question of the C Series. At this point it doesn\u2019t seem unlikely that the ITC won\u2019t recommend duties of some sort. So I was wondering would Delta, I know you\u2019ve said in the past that you\u2019re not willing to put the bill, but with Tax Reform having passed, I am curious would Delta be willing to use some of this tax savings to put some off the bill?","And secondly, previously Delta said that tax savings would not be used for share buybacks and I was just curious if that was still the case? Thanks so much.","Glen Hauenstein","The answer to your first question is, no. We are not using Tax Reform to pay tariffs and subsidies. We have no intent to pay any tariffs on the C Series.","And the second question is again, given that we are not seeing a cash benefit in the next couple of years from Tax Reform given that we have NOLs, there\u2019s no cash to go buy incremental shares with.","Alana Wise","Thanks so much.","Ned Walker","Final question, please, Ebony.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our final question will come from Edward Russell with FlightGlobal. Please go ahead.","Edward Russell","Hi. I was wondering if you could update us on the status of the Korean Air joint venture? Have you sought regulatory approvals in Korea yet and are you still on track for implementation this year perhaps?","Glen Hauenstein","Yeah. We received the approval from DOT to move forward and we\u2019re currently working\u2026","Edward Russell","Yeah.","Glen Hauenstein","\u2026 with the Korean authorities together with Korean Air. We anticipate receiving authority sometime hopefully in the first half of this year, is what our Korean counsel tells us.","Edward Russell","Okay. And then implementation before the end of the year or in 2019?","Glen Hauenstein","As soon as we get approval we\u2019ll move to implementation rapidly.","Edward Russell","Great. Thank you.","Ned Walker","And actually, Ebony, we\u2019re going to take a question from one more and that\u2019s from our local hometown newspaper, Kelly Yamanouchi.","Operator","Perfect. Kelly Yamanouchi with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Please go ahead.","Kelly Yamanouchi","Thank you so much for squeezing me in. I just wanted to check, on the impact from the airport outage and winter storm Benji, of the $60 million, so $45 million of that was revenue impact and $15 -- would it be $15 million in cost impact?","Ed Bastian","Kelly, this is Ed. $40 million was the rough impact of the outage and $20 million was the rough impact from the winter storm.","Kelly Yamanouchi","Oh! I see. Okay. And was most of the winter storm impact on the Atlanta hub?","Ed Bastian","On the -- no, it was in the Southeast, as you recall. But the Atlanta hub, obviously, took the biggest impact. We -- if we had 1,200 cancellations, most of which were in Atlanta that day.","Kelly Yamanouchi","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Ned Walker","Hey. Thanks, Ed, Glen, Paul and Peter. That concludes the December Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. We\u2019ll talk again in April. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate it.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

My name is Kyle and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jill Greer. Go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Jill Greer - Managing Director, Investor Relations","Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for the December quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are Delta\u2019s CEO, Richard Anderson; our President, Ed Bastian; and our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Jacobson. We also have the entire leadership team here in the room for the Q&A session. Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and liquidity. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted and you can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at delta.com.","And with that, I will turn it over to Richard.","Richard Anderson - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on this call. This morning, we cap off a successful 2012 by announcing a $238 million profit for the December quarter or $0.28 per share in line with first call consensus. Delta generated a 5.5% operating margin and unit revenues grew by 4%.","For the full year 2012, we grew our net income by 30% year-on-year to $1.6 billion, expanded our pre-tax margins by 100 basis points, reduced our net debt by over $1 billion, and produced an 11% return on invested capital. Our unit revenues for the year grew 7% and we have now generated a unit revenue premium to the industry for the last two years. These results would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the entire Delta team, and I would like to thank them for all of their efforts on behalf of our customers in our company and our shareowners in the past year. I look forward to being with them and recognizing them on Valentine\u2019s Day this year with a $372 million profit-sharing payout which will equal 6.67% of base pay for our frontline employees.","We entered 2013 as a stronger airline entering our fourth consecutive year of good profitability and free cash flow. Through a variety of initiatives, we discussed with you at our Investor Day in December, we will build on the success we enjoyed in 2012 by posting even better operating and financial results in 2013 as we execute on our commitment to sustainable and growing profitability for our investors. For our customers, we will again make targeted investments in our operations, products and facilities and couple that with consistent execution to make Delta the preferred airline in the world.","Last year, we made significant operational and customer advancements that placed Delta at the top of operational performance and customer service. The initiatives produced a 99.5% completion factor, an 86.5% on-time arrival rate, a 25% improvement in DOT luggage performance, and a 40% reduction in DOT customer complaints.","We are continuing to prudently invest in high-quality products, infrastructure, and our network. We have successfully launched Economy Comfort, enhanced our personal on-demand entertainment systems, revamped our LaGuardia terminal C and D building a connector between the two, opened a new international terminal at Atlanta, launched our new Delta website, and purchased a 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic. In addition, behind the scenes, we have and will continue to make significant capital investments in pricing, yield management, distribution, and business intelligence tools.","The investments in our people, tools, and capabilities and revenue management, pricing and distribution are critical to maintaining our long-term RASM premium. All these accomplishments have driven our revenue premium as we were recently recognized by the Business Travel News which awarded Delta the top airline in all categories. And the Wall Street Journal which gave Delta the number one ranking in its annual airline score card.","We cannot run a great airline and generate the operating results we have achieved without good employee relations and morale, and we are proud of the fact that Delta has the best employee relations in the industry. We value these relationships, so we have made investments to make Delta a great place to work, this important for our shareowners. For our shareholders we are focused on making Delta a high quality investment with an ROIC targeted return of 10% to 12% over the long run.","For the past few years we have focused on cash flows and on lightly investing in the business while reducing risk on the balance sheet. In addition to investments in our product, we have also made important long-term investments in our Win In New York strategy with the creation of our LaGuardia and JFK hubs. Our first mover advantage in our domestic fleet strategy, our equity stakes in GOL and Aeromexico, our agreement to buy 49% of Virgin Atlantic and our acquisition of the Trainer Refinery, in 2013 these important initiatives provide significant opportunity to continue to improve in a creative way our financial and operating performance.","While the investments we have made in the business have contributed to our margin expansion and two years of RASM premiums, they have not come without cost. For this end we will focus on disciplined spending and successfully implementing our $1 billion in structural costs initiatives. These initiatives will maintain our revenue generation while improving our overall efficiency.","Since 2010, we have generated $4 billion of free cash flow, 10% on return \u2013 a 10% return on invested capital and paid down over $5 billion in net debt. Our debt goal of $10 billion is with insight this year. As we approach that goal, we are getting ready to take the next step and move toward a balanced deployment of capital where our operating cash flow is divided between continued investment in the business further balance sheet debt reduction and our returning cash to shareholders. As I mentioned at investors day, we expect to announce more details on our capital deployment strategy before our annual meeting in June. We are in the process of working through our options and I will discuss those in further detail prior to the annual meeting.","So, to conclude we are pleased with our progress and have significant opportunity for improvement in 2013. We are currently forecasting further margin expansion of 2.5% to 4.5% in the March quarter of 2013 as we are projecting unit revenues to increase 4% to 6% in 1Q. We have the right initiatives in place, the right people and we will keep building a better airline for our customers, employees, and shareholders by being the very best in execution, the most creative developing business strategies and wisely deploying capital to keep Delta in the lead.","Thank you and I will turn the call over to Ed.","Ed Bastian - President","Thanks Richard. Good morning everyone. We appreciate you taking time to join us this morning. This morning we announced the December quarter profit of $238 million or $0.28 per share excluding special items. This was one penny ahead of where consensus had us for the quarter.","During the quarter we had $231 million in charges from special items which included $122 million in facilities, fleet and other charges, primarily related to our domestic fleet restructuring. $106 million charges related to early debt extinguishment. And a $3 million mark to market loss on fuel hedges. The December quarter results are quite solid when you consider over $100 million negative impact that super storm Sandy had on the airline operation and the refinery as well as $100 million in lower hedge gains on a year-over-year basis. This is proof that our core business remains strong and we look forward to continue margin expansion into 2013.","As Richard mentioned, we accrued $372 million in profit sharing in 2012 with $63 million of that in the December quarter. I would also like to echo Richard\u2019s comments and thank the Delta employees for all their efforts this year in taking great care of our customers, running an outstanding operation in producing top-tier financial results. There is no better way for us to show our thanks than with a profit-sharing check that will be delivering on February 14.","Shifting the revenue during the December quarter, our top-line revenue grew $203 million or 2% despite a 1 point decrease in capacity. Passenger revenues increased $215 million with unit revenues for the quarter up 4.3%. We saw a 2 point improvement in yield combined with a 2 point increase in load factor, proof that our revenue initiatives and prudent capacity deployment are driving results.","December marked the 21st consecutive month that we have produced a unit revenue premium versus our competition as the distance between our performance and our competitors increased in every month during 2012 and we expect to add to that advantage in 2013. We ended the year with strong holiday performance with 5 days in the quarter in the top 10 unit revenue days on record, including a new number one system RASM and revenue day on the Sunday after Thanksgiving.","We continue to see positive results in the domestic system with domestic unit revenues up 5% for the quarter. Our New York franchise is performing well and we continue to pickup market share. This is particularly encouraged and given that we are still in the early ramp-up period of our New York strategy. Despite the share strength, New York\u2019s performance was significantly impacted by Superstorm Sandy. The storm\u2019s cancellations and the subsequent slow recovery of travel demand to and from the Northeast resulted in a full quarter negative revenue impact of $75 million and a P&L hit of $45 million.","On the international side, we have managed our transatlantic capacity tightly. And with December being a seasonal low point in demand, we have reduced capacity in the December quarter by 7%. That strategy has paid off as we saw an 8 point increase in unit revenues for the region. Unit revenues for Pacific entity were flat year-over-year on 2 points of higher capacity. We saw some weakness driven by economic softening in Japan along with industry capacity growth and a negative impact from the weaker yen. This weakness, however, was offset by strength in non-Japan Asia routes, particularly in China. In Latin America, our unit revenues decreased 1 point driven by a 6 point decline in yield on an 8 point increase in capacity. Mexico and Central America had strong unit revenue growth. South America was flat year-over-year. And our Caribbean unit revenues were down with the 25% increase in capacity.","Shifting back to an overall system perspective, Delta continues to gain traction in corporate revenue due in large part to our investments and products, facilities, and our network. Our system corporate revenues increased 9% in the quarter with double-digit growth rates for transatlantic and Latin entities. We saw strong growth across most industry sectors topped by a 31% increase in revenue from the banking sector, the result of new contracts that were affected in the December quarter, then our buildup in New York.","In terms of our revenue outlook as we head into 2013, we expect to expand our competitive advantage and continue to outperform the industry as we reap the benefits from our investments in the business. Our new JFK Terminal 4 which will open in May will give Delta a world-class facility and we\u2019ll address one of the largest drivers of our traditional revenue underperformance in New York. We will reach 85% completion on flat-bed seat installation on international aircraft by the end of this year. This summer, 100% of our trans-Pacific flights and over 40% of our transatlantic flights will offer the flat-bed product.","We anticipate improved merchandizing revenue, including first-class upsell from the re-launch of delta.com and improved mobile apps. And we will benefit from our international equity investments. We anticipate strong traction from Virgin Atlantic, which will further enhance our position in New York. The initial customer reaction from the announced JV has been very enthusiastic. In short, we have a lot to look forward to and we are excited about our future revenue opportunities.","On guidance for the March quarter, demand trends remained positive and we are forecasting full quarter unit revenues to increase 4% to 6%. We are off to a good start in January with our unit revenues expected to be up 5% to 6% in the month. This is particularly encouraging giving calendar day of weak shifts in the month are costing us about 2 points in comparative RASM. February and March are also building well, albeit slightly lower growth rates. The domestic entity is showing strong yield trends largely attributable to continued corporate strength. Transatlantic yields and advanced bookings are holding up well as we actively managed our off-peak capacity, which will be down 8% to 10% from the prior year.","Our outlook for the Pacific is mixed. We are seeing positive trends for non-Japan Asia, which are offset by weaker Japan demand due to economic weakness, a softer yen, and industry capacity growth. However, the challenges in Japan are mitigated by our 2013 yen hedges, which will have \u2013 which currently have a mark-to-market value of $75 million. In fact, our full year 2013 net yen position is 90% hedged at \u00a580 to the dollar. So, financially, we will be protected this year from the recent yen sell-off. And as a side note, 2013 will be the first year that the majority of our trans-Pacific capacity will be outside of Japan as we continue to diversify our Pacific portfolio to the more rapidly expanding economies in the Pacific Rim. And in Latin America, demand remains solid moving into the March quarter, with Mexico and Central America showing strong year-over-year improvements.","Finally, with regard to guidance, we are forecasting an improvement over last year\u2019s March quarter with an operating margin expectation of 2.5% to 4.5%. On capacity, we expect system capacity to be down 2% to 4% with domestic capacity down 1% to 3% and international capacity down 3% to 5% driven in large part by our off-peak productions in the transatlantic.","And I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Paul?","Paul Jacobson - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ed. Good morning everybody. I\u2019ll start with our cost performance. For the quarter, total operating expense increased by $376 million as a result of higher fuels and salaries. Non-operating expense decreased by $43 million showing the continuing benefits of our debt reduction strategy.","Our non-fuel unit costs were up 5.7% for the December quarter driven by our capacity reduction, continued investment and wage increases, and investments in our products, services, and operations. We expect our non-fuel unit costs will be up 4% to 6% for the full year 2013 with the March quarter up 6% to 8%. March quarter costs, which are pressured by the year\u2019s largest quarterly capacity decline, will represent the peak of our cost growth for 2013. That growth should then moderate over the remainder of the year as capacity levels flatten out and the benefits of our $1 billion structural cost initiatives begin to kick in. These initiatives are designed to stem the rate of growth in our costs without jeopardizing the revenue production enabled by our network, product, and our service.","We are restructuring our domestic fleet and one of the key tenants of our structural initiatives is maximizing the benefit across our organization. To do this, we are actively replacing 50-seat regional flying with more efficient and customer preferred 717s, MD-90s, 737-900s, and CRJ900s. Recent agreements with SkyWest, Pinnacle and Bombardier have produced a clear path for us to eliminate more than 250-seaters and we will begin taking deliveries of the mainline aircraft and the CRJ900s in the September quarter.","We are also redesigning our maintenance program to improve processes and resource management as well as lowering materials expense by seeking out market and part out opportunities. We have purchase agreements in place for 23 MD-80 aircraft at very low prices, which will be used for parts on our MD-88 and MD-90 fleets and have already taken delivery of four of these aircraft. We are also capturing the benefit of our increased operational reliability, which is facilitating cost saving scheduling investments. And we are improving our distribution platforms to continue to move towards most cost effective and value-added channels such as delta.com.","Overall, we have seen an over 5-point share shift to delta.com since 2010 and expect further market penetration due to our enhanced platform. We anticipate beginning to see the benefits of this $1 billion cost improvement initiative in the second half of the year with continued program ramp up through 2015. Overall, we expect to achieve $600 million of benefit from these initiatives in the back half of 2013 and reach the $1 billion level in 2014.","Turning to fuel, our all-in fuel price per gallon was $3.24, which included $0.05 per gallon settled hedge gain as well as a $0.07 per gallon loss from our Trainer refinery. In November and December, operations at Trainer were negatively impacted due to Superstorm Sandy\u2019s damage to regional pipelines and terminals in the area, which created a reduction in available distribution points for products. This in turn forced Trainer to slow production and lower efficiency until the infrastructure recovered. These events were the largest drivers of the $63 million refinery loss during the quarter. However, refinery operations are recovering and we expect Trainer to be able to realize a modest profit in the March quarter.","We have also then entered into discussions to bring Bakken crude to Trainer, which will lower the overall total input costs at the refinery. Trainer will be receiving a shipment of Bakken crude this quarter and will be better able to evaluate crude sourcing options after this test run. In sum, based on Friday\u2019s market close, we are projecting a fuel price of $3.15 to $3.20 for the March quarter, which includes the impact from the Trainer refinery.","Turning to liquidity, we ended the year with $5.2 billion in unrestricted liquidity, which included $1.8 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. Capital expenditures were $600 million, which included $310 million in fleet investments and $70 million in improvements in turnaround to the Trainer refinery.","Our year-end adjusted net debt was down to $11.7 billion, which represented a $1.2 billion reduction from 2011. Additionally in October, we refinanced $1.7 billion in debt and undrawn revolving facilities, which are secured by our Pacific groups and slots. This refinancing will generate more than $30 million in annual interest expense savings. For the March quarter, we expect to generate $400 million of free cash flow.","To conclude, we are proud of all that we have accomplished in 2012. Our operational performance was stellar. We generated $1.6 billion of net income. We paid down $1.2 billion of net debt. And we generated a unit revenue premium to the industry every month of the year. This can\u2019t happen without the hard work and efforts and dedication of the Delta team in 2012 and I look forward to an even better 2013. Jill?","Jill Greer - Managing Director, Investor Relations","Thanks Richard, Ed, and Paul. Kyle, we are now ready for questions from the analysts. So, if you could review the process for asking questions. And again, we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question with a brief follow-up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from David Fintzen with Barclays Capital.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital","Hey, good morning everyone. Just a quick question adding in your comments, you mentioned sort of 2013 could be a year where you further expand your revenue premium, I am just \u2013 I am curious how to think about obviously that\u2019s happening to start, it seems to be happening to start the year, but I am curious how the up gauging as it phases in, in the back of the year, it starts to impact that. I mean, is that a case where we should expect it sort of mid-year and then start to come in or do you think you can continue to expand out your RASM relative to the industry even as you are getting into the bigger aircraft?","Richard Anderson","Well, the certainly the up gauging strategy on our domestic network will put some pressure on our unit revenues and thus our competitive RASM performance is certainly going to be a huge positive for our margins.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital","Right.","Richard Anderson","It\u2019s the most important measure that we look at. And as I think you know, we have already been seeing a fair bit of the up gauging over the course of the last couple of years, so driving both margin and RASM enhances.  And I think what the way we look at it is the product superiority of the aircraft we are up gauging to will more than compensate for any RASM dilution we might be seeing.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital","Okay, okay. And then just quickly on the Latin entity, you mentioned sort of the strength in Mexico and Central America, obviously there is a fair amount of capacity going into the deep South America, American markets, and if you sort of extract the competitive capacity dynamics is that how the sort of underlying demand trends sort of in those deeper, bigger South American markets vary?","Glen Hauenstein","David, this is Glen Hauenstein, how are you?","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital","Good. How are you doing?","Glen Hauenstein","Good, thank you. With the demand in deep South America is quite strong, and as you point out in the short run, the capacity might be outrunning it by just a tad, but as we move forward, we think that will catch up with the higher demand levels and we should be in good shape by the mid level, the mid part of this year.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital","Okay, great.  Appreciate the color guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Hey guys. I guess just a couple here. Just on the Virgin piece, I know that the plan is for the transaction that closed at the end of 2013. How soon now do you start code-sharing and maybe where are you on the application for antitrust \u2013 the application for antitrust immunity?","Richard Anderson","Well, Ben Hirst will take the antitrust immunity.","Ben Hirst","Yeah, I\u2019ll take the last piece. In terms of the process, we basically have three sets of regulatory approvals that we have to obtain. There is \u2013 there are competition reviews that are underway at the Justice Department and the EC. We will be filing probably by the end of the month for antitrust immunity with the Department of Transportation. And there is a review in the UK of the shareholders\u2019 agreement to ensure that citizenship and control remains with the EU citizens. We\u2019ve also filed with DOJ and we have begun meetings with DG Comp and the EC. So, the process is well underway, it\u2019s on schedule. And we are hoping that these reviews all come together within a six-month timeframe.","Glen Hauenstein","","And on advancing the code-share and frequent flyer reciprocity, we are working very hard on the systems side of that and expect to have that up and running in the second or third quarter, end of the second, beginning of the third quarter, with the desire of having those codes in place before we head into the winter iota season and fully functioned and active.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thanks, Glen. And then just my second question, I know given your NOL position, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going be many years I think before you guys are paying cash taxes, but at what point do you start incurring a book tax and I realized so many people or the market itself is fixated on EPS. Is that something that kicks in later this year or is that more a 2014 type phenomenon?","Paul Jacobson","","Mike, this is Paul. There is no hard and fast rule. We are working with the accountants on that and the reversal has to do with historical earnings and where we are on book tax differences. So, as we continue to work through that, that\u2019s something that could happen in 2013.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Okay, very good.","Ed Bastian","Mike, this is Ed. Let me just clarify Paul\u2019s comments he is right we are working through it, but I also \u2013 I don\u2019t think we are going see it in 2013. And I think what we are looking at is maybe by the end of 2013, we\u2019ll make that determination for 2014 looking forward.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Okay, very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Glenn Engel with Bank of America.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America","","A couple of questions, please?","Operator","Glenn?","Glenn Engel - Bank of America","Hello.","Operator","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America","Hi, sorry about that. A couple of questions. One on Trainer, I guess, I was seeing some reports about something wrong with the pipeline slurry and that the refinery was \u2013 the Trainer refinery was closed right now. Is that true?","Paul Jacobson","","No, Glenn, this is Paul. There was one unit that we have taken down briefly as a result of some of the slowdowns from the storm. That unit is expected to be up and running within a week, but we have not shutdown the refinery.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America","The ancillary businesses had revenues down about 15% from a year ago in the fourth quarter 185 or 216, what\u2019s driving that and will those businesses start to grow again?","Paul Jacobson","That represents a shift in our strategy from our MRO as we are starting to streamline to higher margin accounts and business and we expect to grow off that platform in 2013.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America","So, you\u2019ll start with a lower base, but start to grow from a lower base?","Paul Jacobson","","Yeah, with more profitable business?","Glenn Engel - Bank of America","And finally just an update on pensions, how much, what is the pension on funded liability now and what\u2019s the impact on earnings in 2013?","Paul Jacobson","The pension on funded liability is going to increase in at year end by about $2 billion. That has a minimal effect on expense based on where we are in amortization and the result of lower interest rate. And there is no material change in funding, because we have the benefits of the airline relief under the Pension Protection Act.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America","Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","Hey, good morning everybody. First question for Glen, the changes in the SkyMiles program are obviously relevant to passengers, I suppose an enthusiast I am somewhat interested, but usually Frequent Flyer issues kind of fly below the radar screen for me as an analyst in terms of what I obsess over on a daily basis. I am sure lot of effort went into the SkyMiles overhaul. But is this something where we should actually expect to see an impact either on the income statement or in terms of liabilities on the balance sheet in 2013?","Richard Anderson","I will talk \u2013 let Paul talk to the balance sheet implications. But from revenue perspective we are looking at the evolving SkyMiles to be better loyalty program for its customers and drive the type of customer behavior that we would like to encourage in the future. So, I think before we didn\u2019t discern between a customer that was a high yielding customer versus a low yielding customer and I think as we continue to evolve those programs, we will be continuing to favor the higher yielding customers over lower yielding customers.","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","Okay.","Paul Jacobson","And on your question about effectiveness, the change that we announced is not effective until 2014.","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","Correct, yeah that\u2019s a good point. From a brief follow-up while I have you Richard or for Ed the typical area of pushbacks that I get from investors is that Delta is under-investing in aircraft. Sure you are generating cash, but you are living borrowed time, you are going to face this massive re-fleeting bill somewhere down the road. And then normally I countered by pointing out that as you shrink capacity, fleet age actually doesn\u2019t rise very quickly and the company has a demonstrable preference for shall we say experienced airplanes that require far or less capital than buying new. I will admit this isn\u2019t so much a question as an opportunity, I guess for you to just kind of bring us up to speed on your thoughts as it relates to this issue, as it relates to capital deployment and the potential need for new planes down the road?","Richard Anderson","Well, first airlines and Delta in particular have to take the cost of capital into account with making investment decisions around the fleet. And what we have done at Delta is adopted a strategy of making sure that we use our shareholders\u2019 money, we use that money prudently to get returns from day one a fleet investment. So, we have the right mix going forward. If you look at our wide-body fleet the average age of the wide-body fleet is 13 to 14 years. And on our domestic fleet, we began this year with a significant number of new deliveries. So, we are always working to calibrate the right mix of new deliveries and used deliveries. Given the glut of narrow-bodies coming on the market right now, we think that there is going to be significant opportunities because residual values on eight to ten year old narrow-body airplanes are on a significant downward slide. And we will continue to be with the glut of airplanes there.","And you see our operating performance in terms of completion factor on-time and the like it\u2019s at the very top of the industry. So, we have a firm specific capability of being able to manage a stream of new deliveries, but at the same time making sure we are averaging down our cost of capital, so that we can always hit our 10% to 12% return on invested capital. These are very long-lived assets and a long-lived asset in order for us to able to hit our returns we have got to capture the residual value. And be certain that when we are making pricing and investment decisions that those pricing and investment decisions are properly taking into account the cost of our capital.","Ed Bastian","And I think this is the kind of disciplined approach that any capital intensive business must take.","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","I appreciate the color, it\u2019s a point that we have tried to make, but I think it certainly helps hearing it directly from you. Thanks again.","Richard Anderson","Thanks Jamie.","Operator","We will take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","Good morning everybody. Just a question on Pinnacle, I know historically Delta and Northwest have had in-house regional carriers that you have either sold or kind of shutdown. And historically the airline industry hasn\u2019t had a good track record of having a carrier within a carrier. And I was just curious as to what might be different with Pinnacle and maybe what the longer term plan is for Pinnacle?","Richard Anderson","Actually if you look at what we have done with Pinnacle it\u2019s really been \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a pretty revolutionary step because we actually for the first time have the right cost structure in place and the right fleet in place to be able to operate the most efficient 70, 76 seat operator in the industry. And the way the pilot agreement is setup, we don\u2019t end up with the seniority issues that have cost issues in that industry in the past. And it gives us the ability to provide a very high quality product at the most efficient returns on capital investment in that fleet. So, we\u2019re pleased with the opportunity and believe that it\u2019s going to drive a very significant advantage to Delta over the long run.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","Great, just a follow-up on that, do you have an idea of the timing or how many 50-seat retirements you will see in 2013 and may be 2014, how is that planning going?","Richard Anderson","Actually we are well down the path in the Pinnacle debt agreement and the agreement to bring them out of bankruptcy we have the right to retire the entire 140 airplane fleet of 50 seaters.  And if you recall the Bombardier transaction that we did earlier this year for 40 firm and 30 option, 76 seaters, they have facilitated the removal of 60 of those airplanes and we have a clear path to get down in the range of 100 to 125 within the next 18 to 24 months.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","Alright, great, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore Partners.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners","Thanks. Good morning. Just wondering with the Easter shift here in March, why would unit revenue by default decelerate from I think the 5% to 6% level that you\u2019ve outlined here?","Ed Bastian","Duane, this is Ed, we are not necessarily anticipating its going to decelerate, I think that the clarity that we have to January is obviously much better than looking out towards the end of March. So, we want to put guidance out there on a quarterly basis that we are comfortable on the balance, but we hope to do better. But with the bookings where they are right now, we see January very strong, we see every month in the quarter is strong. And our visibility to March isn\u2019t as clear, clear as it is currently here in January.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners","Okay, thanks for that. And then just on the structural cost initiative the $1 billion, my question is relative to what is that $1 billion, I mean it feels like at least based on the current schedules you go from pretty material capacity declines in the first quarter to modest capacity growth in the June and September quarter. It feels like these fleet initiatives you are going to the higher trip costs, but obviously lower unit cost, fleet mix, it seems logical that your CASM pressure moderates in the second half, just given us two factors, but what is the $1 billion relative to? Thank you.","Richard Anderson","What we said is that after the results of this $1 billion are fully baked in, we would expect to see forward-looking trends of flat to 2% CASM off of 2013 levels. So, it\u2019s a combination of 2012 base as well as anticipated growth in cost, but we are flattening out unit costs based on that 2013 level.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners","Sorry, what is the underlying capacity growth assumption in that flat to 2%?","Richard Anderson","Flat.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Hey, thanks a lot for taking my question. First, I was just hoping to ask about thoughts on the shareholder returns strategy. Of course, this is a decision that\u2019s going to happen later in the year and it\u2019s a Board level decision, but to the extent that you could just share your own preferences in so far as your sort of informing or advising the Board on what to do on dividends versus buybacks and how you think about that just be helpful to hear your thoughts?","Richard Anderson","John, I think that we should respect our Board processes. And we\u2019ll \u2013 I\u2019ll be certain to keep the investor base well informed as we move through this process.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Okay, thanks. And just another question Richard as investors tried to forecast the next couple of years, I think one of the big risks they focus on is the degree to which a reacceleration in capacity growth that large low cost carriers or may be a new entrant could force an end to the profit cycle for legacies. I know it\u2019s a tough question to answer, but how can investors be confident that your financials are more insulated from this threat than they have been in the past?","Richard Anderson","I would make two key points there. The first if you think back to airlines like Skybus $2 billion of capital is no longer available. With the new Basel rules and the rules in the U.S. on the requirements for banks and financial markets to keep capital in reserve, it\u2019s a much different situation in terms of capital in the marketplace. And the second piece of that is, Brent is at about $1.10 and that model is a very difficult model at these sorts of fuel prices. So, when you look at where the capital markets and how the capital markets approach financing airlines today and look at where fuel prices are today, I think we are in a very different dynamic.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","Hey, good morning everybody. When you talk about taking corporate market share, can you just explain what you mean by that? Are you talking about winning new clients? Are you talking about getting a bigger piece of the pie from say like a Fortune 25 company? And how has that mix contributed to the growth in share that you have gotten? And how are you going to think about that mix as it contributes to the overall corporate share that you have growing? How is that mix going to go forward between sort of opening up new clients and getting a bigger piece of the pie from existing ones?","Ed Bastian","Hunter, this is Ed. I think it\u2019s all the above. We have picked up over the last couple of years some very significant new accounts. We have improved our share substantially in a number of existing accounts and I would say the financial services and the banking sector is probably the most important there in terms of where we have been able to not just pick up new accounts, but also improve. We had a very, very large, one of the largest banks in the world that we just signed in the last six months a corporate deal with out of New York that we never previously had a corporate arrangement with.","And what they are looking for is they are looking for a career that can take them anywhere they need to go on the schedule and the frequency. It\u2019s a big part of the reason behind the Virgin Atlantic transaction, because the JFK-Heathrow market is the sector that those \u2013 the financial services firms travel \u2013 travel most, have the greatest amount of need for and schedule frequency for and we have been able to knock another thing off the list. They look for the product the investments in the new international product. The flatbeds upfront will be fully complete by spring of 2014 there. So, it\u2019s a combination of our geography, our schedule, our service levels, the great service our employees provide, which matters. That\u2019s all contributing here. And probably the easiest way to sum all that up is if you look at our fourth quarter, our total corporate revenues were up almost 10% against a marketplace that was pretty flat in terms of overall corporate travel spend in the fourth quarter of the year. That\u2019s a big number.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","Okay, thanks Ed. And Paul, a question for you on Trainer, you gave some color on the sourcing of Bakken, which I appreciate, but can you maybe feel about giving a little more, where are you in the process of overall sourcing crude? Where do you stand with say some of your supply relationships now that you have gotten a few months under your belt say some domestic versus international suppliers? Where do we stand with Bakken? You said you are getting a shipment this quarter, I mean, what percentage of the overall crude that you source to Trainer you think will come from Bakken now versus by the end of the year? Any other thoughts on sort of general crude sourcing would be helpful.","Paul Jacobson","Well, Hunter, our crude sourcing is handled by a multi-year agreement with BP that we entered into at the time of acquiring the refinery. So, there is no change in that. Bakken as a source of crude, it\u2019s a little bit early to tell as to what kind of volume we can run in it, but as we run this first shipment this quarter we\u2019ll have more colors to what the total potential is, but it\u2019s pretty significant.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Crissey with UBS.","Kevin Crissey - UBS","Good morning. Thank you for the time. Can you give us an idea of capacity by month, if your RASM, you gave January RASM 5% to 6%, what kind of capacity are we looking at January through February, I didn\u2019t know the 3% for the quarter?","Richard Anderson","We gave you the core, we typically don\u2019t give the forward months Kevin, but they are all generally in the range we talked about. I think February we might have a little more capacity out because of the leap year from last year, but it\u2019s they are all relatively consistent.","Kevin Crissey - UBS","Okay.","Richard Anderson","January and February with it being the highest months of capacity constraint as compared to March.","Kevin Crissey - UBS","Okay, thanks. And can you talk about and maybe it\u2019s gone, talk about Atlanta and any changes you are seeing competitive positioning there?","Richard Anderson","There is not a whole lot of changes to what you seen. We have AirTran\/Southwest down to about 170 departures. If you recall their peak was just under 300 several years ago, so continued rationalization of capacity on their part. And as we look forward that into the published schedule, that capacity rationalization continues.","Kevin Crissey - UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Jill Greer","We are going to have time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","Our next question will come from Basili Alukos with Morningstar.","Basili Alukos - Morningstar","Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the joint venture with Virgin Atlantic, I guess two questions. First given what happened with the TNT-UPS decision I am wondering if there is breakup fee in that contract. And then secondly, you have kind of mentioned where you are in the review process and finalizing the deal. I am just wondering if you can give us context in kind of other deals that you have done and if you would say you are at a similar pace behind, ahead where you would be for another M&A or a transaction deal?","Richard Anderson","In terms of the details of the contract, there is no material breakup fee involved in any of contracts. The pace of the deal we think is as we have expected where we are as I said earlier in the midst of three separate regulatory or kinds of regulatory reviews competition, ownership and control in the UK and the joint venture review at DOT. Our objective is to get those completed within a six months timeframe that can extend a bit. And there are some variables in all the agencies, but we think that\u2019s a realistic target. And we have made our filing at Justice under Hart-Scott Scott. We have made our initial filing at DG Com in the EU. And by the end of the month, we should file for ATI with DOT. We have had initial meetings with all agencies. We are on the basis of those reasonably optimistic about our timeframe.","Basili Alukos - Morningstar","Okay and then I guess I asked at the analyst day you guys hadn\u2019t decided as far as what plane size you were going to use or what gauges and I think you are still reviewing that with your pilots. I am just thinking about that decision which planes to you use and then kind of where you are in the process of having figured out what you\u2019re going to fly and more gates and routes in the context of capital discipline. I am just trying to figure both of those out I mean if you haven\u2019t just decided your planes is that something that\u2019s typical?","Richard Anderson","Well, we until we get all the requisite approvals, Delta will continue to make its route decisions and capacity decisions by route independently as will Virgin.","Basili Alukos - Morningstar","Okay, so the fact that I mean I have \u2013 discussions haven\u2019t started or haven\u2019t been finalized that\u2019s kind of a normal occurrence is not abnormal?","Richard Anderson","Correct.","Basili Alukos - Morningstar","Okay, great. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.","Jill Greer","Thanks. And that\u2019s going to conclude the analyst portion of the call. I am now going to hand it over to Ned Walker for the media section.","Ned Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer","Okay, hi. Thanks very much Jill. Kyle we are ready for the media Q&A, if you could go ahead and review the process for the media as to how to get in the queue for questions. Also I would like to ask the media if they could limit it to one call and a brief follow-up that way we should be able to accommodate most people. Thank you. We are ready.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Josh Freed with The Associated Press.","Josh Freed - The Associated Press","Hi there. Ed mentioned earlier some of the change in thinking around the incentives on the Frequent Flyer program. And my question is can you tell us a little more about sort of how far you are through that process and also if when that process is done whether American Express will still be your mileage card partner when this is all done?","Richard Anderson","Yes, American Express is our, I\u2019d say our most important commercial partner globally and we have got a long-term contract with them. And we are not going to be able to talk about any forward-looking changes to the plan as you can appreciate, we are always thinking about ways we can innovate for the future, but that\u2019s about as far as we can go.","Josh Freed - The Associated Press","Alright, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Kelly Yamanouchi with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.","Kelly Yamanouchi - Atlanta Journal-Constitution","Hi, there. I am interested in finding out a little bit more detail on how much in financial benefits you have seen from your operational performance improvements?","Richard Anderson","Well, I think its best summarized by two years of industry RASM premium.","Kelly Yamanouchi - Atlanta Journal-Constitution","Okay. Do you attribute that mostly to your operational or I guess what share of that premium do you attribute to operational performance improvements?","Richard Anderson","Kelly, we don\u2019t break those out independently. It\u2019s the coalescence of a great operation, great customer service by our employees, the phenomenal job by our sales and distribution organization, and a great job by our network planning. So, like everything in an airline, it\u2019s all a team sport and everybody is playing a really great role in making sure we deliver a premium product for a premium unit revenue production.","Kelly Yamanouchi - Atlanta Journal-Constitution","Great, thank you.","Ned Walker","Okay. Kyle, if you could once again review the process for getting into the queue to ask questions and with that, we will turn it over to the next question.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our next question from Mary Jane Credeur with Bloomberg News.","Mary Jane Credeur - Bloomberg News","Richard, there was a lot of talk at Investor Day and again today about how significantly Delta has changed its business model and how peers have had a lot of capacity discipline in the last couple of years. Is the airline industry model overall fixed and was Warren Buffett wrong when he said back in the, I think it was the early 90s that someone should have shot the Wright Brothers?","Richard Anderson","Well, I mean Mr. Buffett is a lot smarter than I am, so I would never open on his investment strategy. So, I will set that question aside. If we look at overall where Delta is and we can just speak from the perspective of Delta, 2013 will be a really strong year for this company and it will be a good improvement over 2012. And so it will be the fourth consecutive year of strong performance. And we look out across at our three-year strategic plan. We see continued strength in the business model. I think we have the obligation and the opportunity to continue to innovate to be certain that we approach this as a business and approach the deployment of capital in a rationale and prudent way. And if we continue to do that and we continue the kinds of innovations that we have undertaken here at Delta, we are confident about the long-term investment thesis for our enterprise.","Mary Jane Credeur - Bloomberg News","How much skepticism are you still hearing though when you are talking to big institutional investors who have been afraid of the space for many years and rightfully so, what\u2019s their biggest holdback?","Paul Jacobson","Mary Jane, this is Paul Jacobson. I think in our conversations with investors, I think there is meaningful consideration given to history of the business. And we believe that fundamental change has occurred, but we are in the early stages of consolidation which makes the industry more stable than it has been. And I think when you look at our recent performance over the last few years viewed against the lens of history I think the signs are petty promising. And we expect that continued improvement going forward.","Mary Jane Credeur - Bloomberg News","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Loyd with the Philadelphia Inquirer.","Linda Loyd - Philadelphia Inquirer","Thanks for taking my call. Other than the impact of Superstorm Sandy on the Trainer refinery, have there been any other unexpected costs or difficulties that you did not anticipate?","Richard Anderson","No, this is Richard. If you took Sandy aside completely and the effects it had on distribution in and out of the facility, everything has gone as planned.","Linda Loyd - Philadelphia Inquirer","And so you are still very satisfied with your business decision to buy a refinery?","Richard Anderson","Actually, since we have actually closed on the refinery and spent a lot of time in the turnaround process, we have become more certain of how prudent that investment is for our company.","Linda Loyd - Philadelphia Inquirer","Thanks very much.","Ned Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer","Okay, great. Kyle that will conclude the call and thanks to Richard, Ed, Glen, Paul, and Ben concludes the December quarter call. We will be back in three months for the March quarter. Thanks very much everyone.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Kelly Anne, and I'll be your coordinator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Kelly Anne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our December quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are Richard Anderson, our Chief Executive Officer; Ed Bastian, our President; and Paul Jacobson, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have the entire leadership team here with us for the Q&A session. Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and cash flow. [Operator Instructions] Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations site at ir.delta.com.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Richard Anderson.","Richard H. Anderson","Good morning. Today, we reported a $558 million net profit for the December quarter, closing out 2013 with a record $2.7 billion net profit for the full year. We earned $0.65 per share, beating consensus by $0.02. Our full year 2013 profit represents a 74% increase, or more than $1.1 billion, and a pretax margin expansion of nearly 3 points when compared to last year -- or compared to prior year. In addition, we generated a 15% return on invested capital, our fourth consecutive year above 10%.","Operationally, we led the industry for the year in on-time performance at about 85%, completion factor of 99.7, including 72 days this year with 0 cancellations and #2 in the industry for baggage performance. This operational reliability has been a key driver of the doubling of our invested Net Promoter Score. Customer satisfaction drives revenue growth and ultimately comes back to our shareholders. We have aggressive plans in 2014 to continue improving for our customers.","Across the board, this was an outstanding quarter and year. The credit for these achievements all go to the 78,000 Delta employees worldwide. We pride ourselves on having the best employee relations in the industry, which includes a commitment to our employees that we will share in Delta's success. I'm pleased to report that next month, on Valentine's Day, we will pay out over $500 million in profit sharing, or just over 8% of employees' pay, to recognize the critical role of our employees. This is in addition to more than $90 million in monthly operational incentives for the year. A great job by our entire team at Delta and congratulations for these accomplishments.","As we communicated to you at Investor Day last month, we've been on a path to fundamentally transform Delta's business model and our results this year show that we are a high-quality S&P 500 enterprise with consistent earnings, double-digit returns on capital and, most importantly, strong free cash flow, the ultimate measure of our success. Looking forward to 2014, we are focused on executing our business plan to significantly improve our financial results in 2014 when compared to 2013.","In addition, we will continue to improve our operational performance and customer satisfaction scores. We are off to a strong start in 2014, expecting a 6% to 8% operating margin in 1Q 2014. For our customers, we will continue to run a great operation and make prudent investments and quality products and services to enhance their experience. The key to our investment strategy is prudence. Paul will provide more detail, but we are reducing our CapEx forecast for 2014 from $2.5 billion to $2.3 billion. This investment strategy has consistently produced solid, sustainable revenue gains while we pay down debt and return cash to our shareholders.","On the operations side, we are focused on running a customer-focused airline and that means a consistent, reliable operation across all Delta products, domestic and international. This means completion factors of 99.7% and 85-plus percent on-time arrivals across the system. We will continue to make prudent investments in the fleet, especially with our domestic upgauging. We have begun deploying the 737-900s, 717s and large regional jets that will replace nearly 2\/3 of our 50-seat fleet over the next 2 years. These new airplanes provide a superior customer service while improving our cost efficiency. We're still in the early stages but have already seen solid margin improvement in the markets where these upgauged aircraft have been deployed. Our product is superior, our unit cost lower and we can keep our total aircraft count in check.","On the product side, the installation of flat beds on our international fleet will be complete this spring and we recently announced our plans to invest more than $750 million over the next 3 years to roll out Wi-Fi to our international fleet and refurbish the interiors of our narrowbody fleet. These investments allow Delta to avoid new aircraft purchases by extending the life of our existing fleet. In New York, we will build on last year's profitability at LaGuardia to bring all of our New York operation to profitability this year through our immunized joint ventures with Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic. We now provide direct service to all of the top markets between the U.S. and Europe, including 7 daily flights between JFK and Heathrow.","For investors, our focus remains on balanced capital deployment with continued investment in the business for high returns, reductions in leverage and pension expense and returns of capital to shareholders. Ultimately, our company must be measured on pretax margins; operating cash flow; and my personal favorites, return on invested capital and free cash flow.","After announcing our initial capital return program in May 2013, we have moved aggressively against our original timeline. We have already returned $350 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and we are targeting $700 million in total returns by May 1, 2014 to complete the first year of the program. We expect to complete the original $500 million buyback authorization by the end of June, 2 years ahead of schedule. At the direction of our board, we plan to announce our updated shareholder distribution policy before our next annual meeting.","We will significantly improve our profitability in 2014 when compared to 2013. While efforts are well underway to execute on our 2014 plan, we've also laid out our long-term goals. Our goal is to produce an annual operating margin of 10% to 12%, achieve pretax EPS growth of 10% to 15% and generate $5 billion plus in annual operating cash flow. To achieve these results, we will take continued commitment across the enterprise to deliver top-tier operational performance, top-notch customer service, strong financial discipline and continued innovation and creativity.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed and Paul to go through the details of the quarter. Thank you. Ed?","Edward H. Bastian","Thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we announced the December quarter net profit of $558 million, which was a $321 million improvement over the prior year. Our December operating margin expanded by nearly 300 basis points to 8.5% and our pretax margins improved by 320 basis points. Our full year 2013 operating cash flow was $4.8 billion. Our free cash flow for 2013 was $2.1 billion and net debt was reduced to $9.4 billion. Congratulations to the entire Delta team for an exemplary year of performance on all fronts. And we all look forward to paying out that record profit-sharing payout next month.","As our results show, our revenue performance remains solid despite the declining fuel price environment. Passenger revenues for the December quarter grew by 6.1%, or $451 million, on a 2.9% increase in capacity. Our ancillary products, which include first class upsell and Economy Comfort, contributed more than $635 million to our full year 2013 passenger revenues and were up more than 40% compared to last year. Domestic outperformed the other entities with a 5% improvement in unit revenues, driven by higher yields, strong Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday demand and particular strength in the New York markets. Improvements in New York led the domestic entity. Yields improved 10%, contributing to an 8% unit revenue gain with a 5.5% increase in capacity. LaGuardia led our New York entities with a strong 15% RASM gain in the quarter. Atlanta also did well, contributing a solid 7% unit revenue improvement driven by close in yield strength.","Internationally, our unit revenues improved 2% in the Latin region, even with a 16% increase in capacity. Our partnerships with Aerom\u00e9xico and GOL contributed almost $25 million of incremental revenues during the quarter, stemming from increased traffic loads in those markets.","In the trans-Atlantic, our unit revenues were flat on a 1.8% increase in capacity, with Amsterdam showing solid margin improvement during the quarter. New codeshare revenues from our Virgin Atlantic partnership generated $25 million of revenue over the last half of 2013.","In the Pacific, our unit revenues declined 2% on a 1% higher capacity as the yen devaluation and associated weakened demand negatively impacted revenues by $65 million, particularly in the beach markets. As you know, the 25% yen devaluation has significantly impacted our revenues all year, leading to a $250 million revenue hit in 2013. However, this impact has almost entirely been mitigated on our net profit results due to the yen hedges we had in place and savings from yen-denominated cost.","Turning to corporate revenues. Our ticketed revenues increased 7% compared to the same quarter last year, with double-digit gains in the banking, finance and the automotive sectors. Our recent survey of corporate accounts under 2014 plans indicates 90% plan to either grow or, at a minimum, maintain their spend levels in the new year, which is an encouraging sign for our business. So as we look ahead to 2014, we have a solid list of commercial initiatives to drive top line revenue growth and move us towards our long-term goal of 10% to 12% operating margins. These include capitalizing on our upgauging initiatives, leveraging our partner relationships, continuing to diversify and expand our global network, growing our corporate share and continued expansion of our merchandising of ancillary revenues.","To give an update on our upgauging initiative, we expect to retire almost 1\/3 of our 50-seat regional jets this year and replace them with a more fuel-efficient and higher-quality 2-cabin aircraft that will expand the product offering for our customers while generating higher margins in those markets. In 2009, we had over 500 small jets. We will end 2014 with less than 200. For 2014, we expect to grow our domestic capacity 2 points despite operating, overall, 20 less aircraft.","With regard to Virgin Atlantic, starting January 1, we moved into a full profit-sharing model that will allow us to leverage strength of our immunized joint venture. This relationship will now provide us significant presence in all of the top 10 U.S. to European destinations and together, we represent 25% of the seats between the U.S. and Heathrow. We have published our first coordinated schedule going into effect in April this year and we're also collocating our facilities in New York and in London to create a more efficient and seamless travel experience for our customers.","In the Pacific, our restructuring efforts are well underway as we're working to reduce the reliance on our Tokyo and Narita hubs and better utilize the gateways that we have in the U.S. compete in the major Asian markets. And we continue to aggressively manage the beach markets to mitigate the impact of the yen's weakness.","In terms of guidance, our January revenues have been solid led by continuing strength in the domestic markets and we expect unit revenues to come in between 3% to 4% improvement on a 3% increase in capacity. For the March quarter, our bookings are in line with the 2% to 4% unit revenue guidance we previously gave. We expect to produce an operating margin of 6% to 8%, driven by the combination of revenue growth and lower fuel prices. This represents 300 basis points of margin expansion. We expect to grow our capacity 2% to 3% in the first quarter. So as we look forward to 2014, we have a full pipeline of opportunities to grow our top-line revenues and deliver continued operating margin improvement, consistent with our long-term goals.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul to cover costs and cash flow.","Paul A. Jacobson","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. The momentum behind our cost initiatives produced another quarter of good results to end the year. Total operating expenses for the December quarter increased 2.2% on a 2.9% increase in capacity. Almost half of that increase was driven by $56 million of higher profit-sharing expense. Our nonfuel unit costs increased 1.4% for the quarter and 2.4% for the year, much better than our initial estimate of 4% to 6% increase for the year, outlined in Investor Day 2012. Across the company, the teams have rallied together to manage these cost pressures and we intend to sustain that momentum as we move into 2014. This should put our unit cost growth between 0.5% and 1.5% for the March quarter and below 2% for the full year.","On the fuel front, our all-in price per gallon for the quarter was $3.05. The Trainer refinery produced a $46 million loss for the quarter, but overall fuel expense for Delta declined $91 million from lower market fuel prices and nearly $60 million in hedge gains.","Turning to the balance sheet. We reversed our tax valuation allowance in the December quarter as we discussed at Investor Day, which resulted in an $8 billion increase in assets on a corresponding noncash gain in the P&L, which we have called out as a special item. The reversal of the valuation allowance reflects our confidence in our expected future performance. We do not expect to pay cash taxes for the foreseeable future as we have net operating loss carryforwards to offset more than $15 billion in taxable income going forward.","Starting in the March quarter, however, our net income will reflect a tax rate of 39%. Going forward, we will report both pretax and net results since we believe pretax results will provide investors the best comparisons of our performance, given our net operating losses. With the reversal of the tax valuation allowance, a $3 billion decrease in our pension liability driven by higher discount rates and our 2013 profitability, we now have a much stronger balance sheet. Our shareholders' equity balance was $11.6 billion at the end of the year and represents a $14 billion increase since the end of 2012. This puts our book debt-to-total capital ratio comfortably at 49%.","Turning to cash flow. The strong cash generation of the business continues. During the quarter, we produced a $1.2 billion operating cash flow target, which is net of $250 million of incremental pension contributions. On the capital side, our December quarter spend was $900 million with the majority spent on fleet investment. The resulting free cash flow was used to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders. As Ed mentioned, we ended the year with $9.4 billion of adjusted net debt. Debt reduction produced a $28 million interest expense savings for the quarter.","We also paid $50 million in dividends and bought back 5.5 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $27.39 for a total of $150 million. As we head into 2014, we are focused on managing costs and generating solid cash flows.","Over the last couple of years, our cost initiatives have helped to stem the rate of growth in our nonfuel unit costs. We expect to see the benefits from those initiatives continue into 2014. As part of our domestic refleeting and maintenance initiatives, we expect to avoid maintenance costs by $250 million through 50-seat retirements and other initiatives. This a key driver in achieving our goal of keeping unit cost growth below 2%.","On the fuel front, as of the January 17 forward curve, we are projecting a March quarter fuel price of $2.97 to $3.02 per gallon, including refinery and hedge impact. We expect to see only a modest loss for the Trainer refinery in the March quarter despite the pull-down of one of the main units for modifications. These modifications, as we've discussed, will allow the refinery to increase output of higher-value distillate fuels up to 40%. This is one of the major initiatives in improving Trainer's profitability for this year. For the year, we expect to see a modest profit from the Trainer operations, driven by the higher-value distillates and a significant increase in the supply of domestic crude. We expect to use approximately 50,000 barrels per day of domestic crude in the March quarter. Our domestic crude supply efforts will continue to ramp up through the year and we expect to average 70,000 barrels a day for 2014. This lower crude supply is expected to reduce our average crude cost for the refinery by $2 to $3 per barrel.","We are also well positioned with our hedge book. At current forward curve levels, we would expect hedge gains of $250 million in 2014 from our existing positions. In terms of cash flow, we are focused on driving more than $5 billion in annual operating cash flows and, as we've discussed, plan to reinvest roughly 50% of those cash flows back into the business. Our 5-year plan outlined in May called for capital spending of $2 billion to $2.5 billion per year. As Richard mentioned, our current 2014 projection of $2.3 billion is in line with that plan. Using our balanced capital approach, we will use our free cash flow to continue to pay down debt, address our pension obligations, return additional cash to shareholders. We're targeting our adjusted net debt target of $7 billion by sometime during 2015. We have already, this year, made another $250 million incremental pension contribution, which completes $500 million of the $1 billion outlined in pension contributions for the 5-year plan.","Finally, as Richard mentioned, we are on track to complete our buyback authorization by the end of June. Combined with our quarterly dividends, this would return an additional $350 million to shareholders in the first half of this year. One thing that remains unchanged is our ongoing commitment to keep taking this company to the next level. Our work to deliver and meet the expectations of our customers and shareholders continues and every member of the Delta team is committed to making this happen each and every day.","To close, I want to echo Richard and Ed in saying thank you to the entire Delta team for an outstanding year. It took an incredible effort by all of our Delta employees worldwide and we are eternally grateful for the hard work and dedication they put in producing these results. Jill?","Jill Greer","Thanks, everyone. Kelly Anne, we're now ready for the Q&A session with the analysts. If you could give the instructions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions here. I think, Ed, when you were going through your commentary, you talked about particularly -- you saw particularly the strength in the New York markets. What's behind this? And maybe this is for Glen as well. I mean, was this the start-up of the Virgin business? Is this the growth in corporate share? Is this LaGuardia really starting to mature now? What drove that?","Edward H. Bastian","Well, Mike, I think you answered your own question. It's all of the above, right? We've been investing in New York for the last 5 years and we're really starting to see the fruits come through. I'd say, one of the largest contributors was clearly the corporate share improvements that we're seeing, particularly in the banking sectors.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just my second question, maybe this is more for Paul. You talked about sort of where your fuel position was, your fuel hedge position in 2014. What about your yen hedge position? I know you were well protected in 2013. What does 2014 look like with respect to your yen hedge book?","Paul A. Jacobson","Mike, 2014 actually looks pretty similar to 2013. We have approximately 100% of our net exposure hedged, which equates to about 50% of our total revenue base, which is a similar position that we had in 2013. I think if you look forward on the total book, because we do have some hedges out to 2016, we're still looking at about a $200 million mark-to-market on that book despite what's been paid out in '13.","Operator","We'll hear now from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Kind of picking up on the same theme as Mike was asking, you've disclosed that LaGuardia is profitable on a fully allocated basis, JFK is not. What are the specific building blocks that get you towards JFK profitability? Is it simply the rising tide? Is it another 3 points of corporate share? Is it going to be up to what post-merger American does? Or is it something that's actually from this point forward under your control? Any thoughts?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Hey, Jamie, it's Glen. I think there are several components for that and not the least of which is fleet. We have been working very hard, as you know, with our fleet plan and the retirement of the 50-seat regional jets, which are really not the optimal airplanes for the feeder markets in JFK as they play a critical role on the profitability of Kennedy. Add to that the partnerships that we have with Aerom\u00e9xico, Virgin and with GOL and I think you'll see how those components all fit together. And then last, but not least, would be the transcons where we have taken a different path than the other 2 major carriers who have reduced their exposure to coach and premium economy. And so we are, by far, now the largest carrier in terms of the coach seating between New York and San Francisco and Los Angeles, which we think is going to be very profitable for us as we enter 2014.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Excellent. And as a follow-up, on a fully allocated basis, is JFK only -- is JFK, excuse me, your only unprofitable hub at the moment? And -- well, and as a follow-up to that, do you consider Seattle a hub in the stricter sense of the word? That's really what I'm really asking, obviously.","Glen W. Hauenstein","Jamie, we really don't comment on other hubs.","Operator","We'll hear now from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just to clarify, was the capacity growth in 2014 up 2%? And I was wondering if that includes -- like how much is the kind of capacity growth that we're going to get from this recent investment in the fleet, are we going to get in 2014 versus 2015?","Edward H. Bastian","Savi, at Investor Day last month, we said our capacity in -- improvement in 2014 is 0% to 2% and we're still in that range. It's a little heavily weighted towards the first part of the year.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so is a lot of the investments in adding seats then going to be more in 2015?","Edward H. Bastian","The seats, those are spread throughout the year as the 50-seat regional jets retire.","Operator","Moving next to John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Richard, when we think sort of about the long-term history of the industry, the last time that the legacy airlines saw sort of the peakiest margins was in the '90s. Now, the GDP environment was very, very different back then. But just with the benefit of sort of a long historical perspective, do you feel like the combination of structural change in the industry and conservative capacity trends, is that enough to make up for sluggish GDP and take us back to peak over the next few years? Is that the environment that we should be thinking about?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, structurally, the changes that have taken place in the industry provide the right industrial organization for a network business that requires a lot of capital to be able to make sustainable investments over the long term. And it's clear now, we have 5 strong years of history at Delta that, in fact, that's the case. The second big factor is the fulcrum of fuel versus unit revenues. And when you think back in the '90s, the fuel was really playing the role that it played today because back in the '90s, fuel was $20 a barrel or $20 a barrel refined and deplaned at its peak. And today, you have a very different capital environment in a very different fuel environment, in a very different industrial organization. And when you take the combination of those 3 factors, so fuel no longer is the cheap part of the equation, it's the most expensive part of the equation. The industrial organization is correct in terms of big industrial businesses. And when you look at the interplay of fuel versus RASM, the interplay has worked very well. And we now have a model where, regardless of where the GDP is, we can capture the cost of fuel in our pricing model.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. And if I remember correctly, during the Investor Day, when the team was talking about sort of revisiting the shareholder returns plan, it was characterized as more of a June 2014 event. I thought I heard you say before June of 2014. I'm not sure, Richard, if you're trying to communicate that perhaps, if trends are good, it could be revisited much sooner than June or if that was just a nuance in the language.","Richard H. Anderson","It was a nuance in the language. What we said in the earnings script, call script, is that we would make a decision prior to our annual meeting, which is usually the last week in June. Prior to that, we have a board meeting in April and the board will undertake to analyze where we are in April as we update our outlook in 2014. We'll have 4 months of progress on 2014. And we would expect some time between that April time frame and our annual meeting that we would update our investor base on our plan, our new plan to return cash to shareholders.","Operator","And Glenn Engel with Bank of America has our next question.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the people side, you have a big increase in headcount because of Endeavor. What would just the mainline headcount look like year-over-year? What is the pension savings? I think you've estimated $270 million in December, so an $80 million savings from the change. Has that changed very much? And finally, can you just tell us how many planes do you plan to retire, both from the mainline and the regional side this year?","Richard H. Anderson","Glenn, let me take the employment, the FTE matter. There are a number of -- if you just go right to the mainline, we operate the mainline airline with about 73,000 FTE, 72,000 to 73,000 FTEs, because, remember, we have other businesses in there. We have Delta Global Services, we have Endeavor, we have Delta Private Jets and we have our MRO business. So when you look at what the core of what it takes to run the Delta that we operate today, it's about 72,000 FTEs.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And that compares to what last year, on a like-for-like basis?","Richard H. Anderson","It's flat year-on-year.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the pension, is it any different than what you thought it would be back in Investor Day when you thought it would be $270 million versus $350 million.","Paul A. Jacobson","Glenn, this is Paul. Our current view is that it'll be pretty consistent with what we outlined at Investor Day.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then finally, I know you've got 717s coming in and new planes. How many mainline planes are actually going to be leaving? And how many regional jet planes are actually going to be leaving in 2014?","Edward H. Bastian","Glenn, this is Ed. We can give you the specific details. It's at a high level. On the mainline, we're going to end the year 2014 with 30 more overall planes than we start the year and we've got some movements between the 717s and 73s and 75s coming out. We can give you the specific details. And on the regionals, we're going to end the year with 50 less overall regional planes. We'll be increasing the CRJ900 count by about 28. And the small jets, we're going to have, I think, close to 80 retirements of small jets over the course of the year.","Operator","We'll move on to Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I just had 2 questions. One, kind of a maintenance-related question. Your maintenance costs were up about 18% in the quarter and I was just kind of wondering if that kind of run rate is what we should be expecting or if there was something special in there. And the other question I had is with respect to maintenance. Are you comfortable that you have enough maintenance personnel to handle what your fleet needs over the next -- or really over the foreseeable future?","Paul A. Jacobson","You want to start, Richard?","Richard H. Anderson","I'll take the question on maintenance capability. I think Delta has a firm specific capability and knowledge that's unusual among global airlines in the sense that we have a deep capability to operate a large and diverse fleet with the very best reliability in the industry. And that is a strength that we will continue to leverage because it gives us the ability to take 717s and MD-90s at much, much lower capital costs, much higher levels of customer satisfaction and superior operating performance to all of our competitors. And we continue to expand that capability and we have no problem at all with attracting the kind of talent we need, both in our hangars but also among engineers, reliability analysts and the other staff that we need to continue this investment strategy.","Paul A. Jacobson","Yes, I think -- Helane, this is Paul. When you're looking at expense, too, you're always going to see a little bit of lumpiness based on the timing of certain events. The fourth quarter happened to be a heavy quarter for airframe checks, specifically. But as you look at 2014 versus 2013, I think the operations team has done a phenomenal job and we expect maintenance expenses to be up slightly to flat for the year.","Operator","We'll hear now from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just wondering on a couple of impacts on the March quarter. If you think about the holiday shift to the second quarter, which is a drag and then we're also beginning to lap the impact of the sequester, how do you think about the impact of these on a net basis? And it feels like the June quarter represents a much easier revenue comparison for the industry and for Delta, specifically. Is this fair?","Edward H. Bastian","Duane, this is Ed. I think the -- certainly, in March, we're going to be impacted by the Easter shift. Our view is it's not necessarily going to be a significant shift. We're looking at, for January, a 3% to 4% unit revenue growth. And as we forecast, over the balance of the quarter, we think that's a run rate that we can largely sustain heading into February and March and that does factor in the impact of the sequester, as well, which should be a positive for us, offset somewhat by the calendar shift. For June quarter, I haven't looked carefully enough at what calendar items we have other than Easter going on in June. But at the macro level, realize that we still have a very small percent of our bookings in for the June quarter at the present time. I think on a macro level, everything feels relatively solid, particularly on the domestic part of the business. And the international entities, early indications are they should do quite well in the summer.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. And then just on Virgin Atlantic, I wonder if you could comment on the fourth quarter, how this contribution would have looked like year-to-year on a pro forma basis? Would you have seen net improvement there? And then how should we be thinking about the seasonality of Virgin's contribution to Delta going forward?","Edward H. Bastian","Well, on the second part of your question, seasonality will look very much like our European businesses. So very, very strong. Second and third quarters, seasonally weaker in particularly in the first quarter of the year. Virgin is on a run rate for -- on a go-forward basis to be profitable, is our expectation in 2014. And that is in our plan. We are already starting to see some pretty significant revenue benefits coming from the initial part of the codeshare. And then as we get into the JV for 2014, we think those -- that revenue stream will start to kick up. I think we're looking at somewhere about $50 million of run rate improvement coming out of synergies, primarily on revenue for 2014.","Operator","And Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs has our next question.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you just give us a sense of what you anticipate industry capacity for trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific during the course of the year and how you're seeing the pricing environment on those 2 routes?","Edward H. Bastian","Sure. In Europe, we see a little bit more capacity than we like and we think that capacity will probably exceed GDP rates between the eurozone and the U.S. Having said that, that capacity -- or pieces of that are really in place now. So if you look at the capacity that's in the winter schedules, it's running a little bit further ahead than it had in the last few quarters and it's already ahead of GDP forecast for the first quarter -- or the fourth quarter for Europe and the U.S. And under that environment, we've been able to continue to grow unit revenues. So we're pretty satisfied with the results we're seeing come out of the low season in Europe. And hopefully, as we get to the high season, those trends will continue. In the case of the Pacific, we see a much better capacity balance in terms of what the industry is offering, particularly in Japan. And as you know, Japan accounts for about 35% of our -- or the trans-Pacific Japan part of our network accounts for about 35% to 40% of our total trans-Pacific. In that case, for the first time in 3 years, we actually see capacity being offered by the industry down into the peak summer months. Combined with the fact that the yen should stabilize -- or we believe the yen would stabilize here at about 100 to 105, that would provide some very good tailwinds as we head to the summer in Japan. And the rest of Asia, it really is -- it's country by country, what's being offered. But I think Japan is really where our heavy concentration remains.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And if I could just ask a follow-up on the Virgin side. Is the increase in the non-op expense attributable to the Virgin? If we can get a little bit more color in terms of what would be driving the year-on-year increase in the non-op expense, that would be helpful.","Richard H. Anderson","Yes, if you're talking about the first quarter of '14, that's correct. That's the weakest quarter of the year for all the trans-Atlantic entities and Virgin is no different.","Operator","We'll hear now from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick question on the seasonality of margins going forward. I mean, you're obviously now putting up, what, 10 years ago, were extraordinary margins in sort of the off-peaks and another 3 points of margin expansion in the first quarter. I mean, should we be thinking about the bulk of margin expansion now coming in these off-peaks to kind of balance the year off a little bit more? Or should we be sort of extrapolating it for more margin expansion into the summer months? Just kind of curious how you think about an improved industry structure mean for the seasonality in margins?","Richard H. Anderson","Yes, David, we're seeing it in both the peak as well as the off-peak, but I think you're probably right. The biggest opportunity for us has been to manage the off-peaks better and we're doing, I think, a great job of that. But we're also expecting to see a strong second and third quarters, which you should see expansion there as well.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe a quick follow-up, probably for Glen. As you're getting the regionals in and the upgauging is sort of -- is carrying through, just any thoughts around sort of the RASM dilution that you might be seeing? Obviously, it's margin positive.","Glen W. Hauenstein","We monitor our unit revenues very carefully. And we're 2, 2.5 years into the upgauge and what we've seen is we've been able to maintain our mainline North America premiums. And so we're expecting that to continue through this year. And I think what you're seeing is we're able to offset with the demand for a better product. And with demand for the increased connectivity that we're able to provide, we're able to offset the increase in gauge.","Jill Greer","Kelly, we have time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","That will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Glen, what is your mix of local and connecting traffic in Seattle? And where do you want it to be at the end of this year and maybe longer term?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Well, right now, we're primarily local because we're not connecting very much, but I expect that we will see increased connectivity as we continue to add the international feed that we have loaded in the advanced schedules for the summer.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. So I mean, is it fair to assume that like less than 10% of your traffic there is connecting? Some very small, miniscule number?","Glen W. Hauenstein","10% to 20% today.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, appreciate that. And maybe one for Paul. Kind of curious to know, you're planning on financing and paying for these upcoming aircraft deliveries, the A330s and the A321s. A, are you planning on buying them with cash? B, if you're planning on financing them, should we think about maybe an LTV that's a little less customary than the, say, typical 80-20 finance debt\/equity split when airlines take delivery of planes? I mean, obviously, you've done such great work keeping debt off the balance sheet. Is it maybe fair to assume that if you do think about financing some of these planes with debt, it's really more maybe of a 50-50 type LTV?","Paul A. Jacobson","Well, I think, Hunter, when you're looking at our cash flow performance that we have currently, we're generating enough cash to be able to pay for these airplanes. I think the financing decision is one that really comes about at the time of delivery in terms of looking at the balanced capital structure and how we think about that. The A330 and the A321 deliveries are still pretty far out there as we look out on the horizon. So we'll take that as it comes.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. So if you're looking at an interest rate environment, that's like north of 5%, 6%, 7%, you would potentially theoretically consider if you have the capability of doing it or the bandwidth of doing it, just buying -- just writing a check for a widebody plane?","Richard H. Anderson","Absolutely.","Jill Greer","And that concludes the analyst portion of the call. I'm now going to turn it over to Ned Walker, our Chief Communications Officer, for the media portion.","John E. Walker","Okay. Thank you very much, Jill. Kelly Anne, if you could once again review the process for asking a question. [Operator Instructions] Thanks so much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Josh Freed with the Associated Press.","Joshua Freed","In the release, the quote is attributed to Ed talks a little bit about ramping up merchandising efforts going forward and I was wondering if you could say a little more about what you have in mind with that, specifically, what it is you're looking to do more merchandising on and time frame, that kind of thing.","Glen W. Hauenstein","Sure, this is Glen Hauenstein. What we're trying to do is we're trying to get closer to what consumers want. And I think for some consumers, all they want is basic transportation to get there on the most reliable airline the country. And that goes all the way up to people who want to travel in first class and have a first-class experience. And historically, we have been not very good as an industry in terms of being able to offer different experiences to different people. And I think that's really what our focus was centered on over the next 2 years as being able to offer the best in category, whether or not you just want to buy a seat and get there on time or whether or not you want to buy a lot of the other amenities that we're able to offer these days. And so we're working very, very hard to try and figure out what consumers want to buy from us so we can then sell those products to them.","Joshua Freed","So it seems -- it sounds like you're headed in a direction that is sort of further splitting out services from the base fare. I mean, can you give us any ideas, specific ideas where you might be headed on that?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Well, I think we will announce when we're ready to announce them, but I think right now we're working on a lot of research that says what our customers really want to buy and how do you judge which customers would like to buy what products and then what would they also not only like to buy at the time of the sale but what would they like to be offered after the sale itself. And like any other merchandising model, I think airlines have been slow to the party in terms of being able to match what customers want to pay with what we're offering.","Operator","We'll hear next from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein","I just wanted to ask quickly on the status of your 787 orders that you just ordered out to 2020 and 2022. Are those the same status? Or have you made any changes to those pending orders?","Richard H. Anderson","This is Richard. Those are same status and under certain conditions, we have the right to cancel those orders. But they remain in our Disclosure Statement unchanged.","Operator","And we'll move next to Kelly Yamanouchi with the Atlanta Journal Constitution.","Kelly Yamanouchi","I just wanted to ask about a little more detail on what is driving the close in yield strength for Atlanta that you mentioned during the narrative.","Richard H. Anderson","We couldn't hear you. Could you repeat the question?","Kelly Yamanouchi","Sorry. I just wanted to ask about what in Atlanta is driving the close in yield strength that's driving the unit revenue improvement.","Glen W. Hauenstein","Kelly, I don't think we specifically called out Atlanta in the close in yield strength. What we're seeing is close in yield strength across the entire domestic system and that's really because business travel is actually fairly robust right now. And so we're hoping that continues on for the year and it looks as though from all the forecast for 2014, that we should expect that.","Edward H. Bastian","Hey, Kelly, this is Ed. We did -- just to correct one, sorry, we did mention Atlanta as one of the contributors. New York was -- had the greatest strength. But we did mention that we did have some nice close in yield strength in Atlanta as well. And Glen was absolutely right, it was strength of the corporate marketplace that was driving that.","Operator","We'll go next to Karen Jacobs with Reuters.","Karen Jacobs","I wanted to ask a question about the Virgin Atlantic joint venture, which is now up and running. Do you -- have you seen increased interest from corporate customers in the wake of the venture starting in earnest?","Richard H. Anderson","Yes, we have. We've seen significant interest in corporate customer -- in our corporate customer base, particularly from the banking community in New York because now we have a competitive shuttle product between JFK and London-Heathrow.","Karen Jacobs","And I also have a follow-up question about the Trainer refinery. Are you expecting a modest profit for the refinery in the first quarter? I just want to make sure I didn't misunderstand from the call.","Paul A. Jacobson","Karen, what we said was that we expect a small loss in the first quarter but a modest profit for the full year.","John E. Walker","Did you have a follow-up on that?","Karen Jacobs","No. That's it for my question.","John E. Walker","Kelly Anne, can you review the process once again to ask a question to see if there are any other media who would like to ask a question to the group?","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","John E. Walker","And at this point, it appears we concluded that. So Richard, Ed, Glen and Paul, thank you all very much. That concludes our 2013 December quarter call.

My name is Jake, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call will be recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Jake. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our September quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are Delta\u2019s CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session.","Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta\u2019s financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with the review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. And you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investors Relations page at ir.delta.com.","And with that, Ed.","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today.","Demand for the Delta product is as strong as ever, and our powerful brand unmatched competitive strengths and pipeline of initiatives are driving earnings growth, margin expansion, and solid returns for our owners.","Earlier today, Delta reported the September quarter pretax profit of $2 billion, which is up $350 million from last year. Our EPS increased 30% to $2.32 per share with operating margins expanding by 2.5 points. Importantly, we\u2019ve already generated $4 billion in free cash flow year-to-date. Our employees continued to deliver the very best operational reliability and service for our customers, even against the summer\u2019s backdrop of record passenger volumes, airport construction projects, and difficult weather.","We\u2019ve now had 123 days without a single cancellation across the entire Delta system this year, a 23% improvement over last year\u2019s record performance. This unprecedented level of reliability combined with great service from our team continued to drive higher customer satisfaction and growing brand affinity for Delta. Year-to-date, our domestic net promoter score has improved more than 5 points over the prior year, and we\u2019re also seeing positive momentum in international net promoter scores with opportunity for further improvement as we continue to upgrade cabin interiors and enhance our customer experience.","Stronger customer satisfaction is translating into higher revenues. Revenues grew 6.5% to a record $12.6 billion in the quarter, and we now expect to achieve approximately 7% top-line growth for the full year.","I want to thank the entire Delta team for producing one of the best quarters in our history. You are the force behind the Delta brand. And to recognize your efforts through a challenging summer, we have accrued another $517 million towards next February\u2019s profit sharing. This brings the total for the year to nearly $1.3 billion. In addition, we\u2019re making important investments in our people, including improvements to benefits in the 4% base pay increase that went into effect last week for ground employees and flight attendants. ","Beyond investments in our people, we are continuing to improve the customer experience through a record number of new aircraft deliveries, airport terminal projects, and technology innovations. These investments support long-term growth, industry-leading profitability, and strong cash flow. In many ways, 2019 has been a transformational year for our Company.","We\u2019ve firmly established Delta as the largest airline in the world, both on revenues and profits and are solidly on track to produce our fifth straight year with pretax profits in excess of $5 billion. We have the world\u2019s most valuable airline brands, one that is mentioned not just among the best global airlines but alongside top consumer brands. And we\u2019re building out our portfolio of industry-leading partners across our business.","Just two weeks ago, we announced a new strategic partnership with LATAM Airlines. The agreement adds geographic diversity in a fast growing continent, adding 100 new destinations to our map and significantly improving our position in South America. Once approved, our proposed JV will move Delta from current number four position in South America to a combined number one position. We expect this partnership to translate to $1 billion in new annual revenue over the next five years and improve returns in the Latin entity. Along with our existing partnerships with Aeromexico and WestJet, we\u2019re creating a true carrier of the Americas with the ability to connect travelers as never before.","American Express is another important long-term partner, and the combination of our two brands has created an industry-leading co-brand credit card portfolio. Our recent contract renewal provides a diverse, high-margin revenue stream that we expect to grow to nearly $7 billion by 2023, with further growth through the end of the decade.","Last week, we announced the major relaunch of our Delta SkyMiles American Express Card portfolio. We are providing our customers with more ways to earn miles and new benefits that deliver an even better travel experience. The investments we\u2019re making in our people, product, service, and partnerships are diversifying our revenues and will grow the earnings power of our business for years to come, important steps on our path to being the world\u2019s leading airline.","Demand for our product has never been higher. We\u2019ve grown our revenues by 15% over the last two years. And to ensure that we continue to deliver the very best product and returns in this industry, we need to continue to invest in our people and our service. This volume growth coupled with challenging weather patterns has added costs in the back half of the year and will add about 1 point to our CASM-Ex fuel run rate in 2020. I'm confident that these are the right investments for the health of our brand. And with the productivity still to come from our fleet, facility and technology investments, we have the right platform to mitigate this cost inflation over the long term. With that said, it is important to note, our overall fourth quarter unit costs all-in are expected to be down 1% due to the drop in fuel prices and our margins should expand once again in Q4.","In closing, we are on track to deliver very strong results in 2019. Demand trends remain healthy and our full-year earnings guidance is for more than 20% improvement over last year's earnings per share. We have built a durable foundation through our culture, leading operational reliability, unrivaled network, our loyalty program, and relationship with American Express and an investment grade balance sheet. These strengths combined with a great brand powered by the very best professionals in the business provide the engine to drive long-term value for our owners. I look forward to sharing more details on our strategic outlook and 2020 business plan at our upcoming Investor Day in December.","Now, with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Glen and Paul to go through the details of the quarter.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks, Ed, and good morning.","First, I\u2019d like to thank the entire Delta team for their hard work during our busiest summer ever. In the quarter, we ran record load factors and carried 3.3 million more passengers than last year, up 6%. The exceptional operational performance and unmatched service our people provide are the foundation for improving customer satisfaction and the reason why more customers than ever are choosing to fly Delta.","When combined with the solid demand backdrop and progress against our commercial initiatives, we delivered a record quarterly revenue of $12.6 billion, up 6.5% over last year. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of top line growth at a level more than 2 times GDP. We also continue to diversify our business with 52% of our revenue generated by premium products, loyalty, and other non-ticket revenue sources.","Premium product revenue grew 9% in the quarter to $4 billion on top of last year's growth of 13%. Momentum is expected to continue from the modernization of our fleet and improved ability to sell these products. Total loyalty revenues grew 16% to $1.2 billion, driven by double-digit increases in mileage redemptions, co-brand spend, new card acquisitions, and roughly 100 million benefit from the new contract with American Express.","Enhancing our customer loyalty and trust is at the heart of our business. And together with American Express, we are finding new and innovative ways to reward our customers for their loyalty. We are on track to achieve another record year of card acquisitions in 2019. Our redesigned card offerings will deliver rich rewards and support continued growth in our membership base in the years ahead.","We are making SkyMiles more valuable by offering members more ways to use Miles on Delta. Miles as currency launched last December and customer response has been strong. By the end of the year, we expect nearly 1 million customers will have used Miles to upgrade their experience. This revenue stream is projected to deliver over $100 million this year, ahead of our initial expectations. We expect this to continue to grow as we give our SkyMiles members more options to use miles anywhere they can use cash with Delta.","Corporate revenue was solid, improving 5% in the September quarter on top of the 12% improvement in the same period of last year. Domestic led with 8% revenue growth, offsetting a modest decline in international corporate revenue. In our most recent corporate travel survey, 86% of travel managers expect to maintain or increase their travel spend in 2020.","Leisure revenues remained healthy, growing 7% for the quarter with very strong demand during the peak summer travel season. Our MRO grew 9% in the quarter, and we are confident in our goal of roughly 20% improvement for the full year. Similar to the freight operators, we are seeing pressure on cargo revenues, which declined 17% on both lower volumes and yields. This is consistent with last quarter\u2019s decline.","Turning to some specifics on unit revenues in the quarter. Total unit revenues were up 2.5% at the midpoint of our guidance on 3.9% higher capacity. Passenger unit revenues were up 1.7% over prior year as strengthen in domestic and Latin more than offset headwinds from FX and pockets of non-U.S. point of sale softness along with the impact of lower fuel costs.","We continued to optimize our leading domestic network with revenues growing 7.8% on 3.2% higher RASM and a sustained unit revenue premium to the industry of nearly 120%. Revenue and margins grew in every domestic hub with revenue improvements of 10% in our coastal hubs and 6% in our core hubs. Boston performance led the system again with 24% increase in revenue and a 5-point improvement in margin.","Internationally, revenues grew by 1.1% as 3.1% capacity growth offset a 1.9% decline in PRASM including more than 1 point of currency headwind. Latin was our best performing entity with 3.6% PRASM improvement. In the Atlantic, we saw strong U.S. point of sale continuing to offset weakness in European point of sale as currency was a major factor during the quarter, driving nearly all of the 1.6% PRASM decline.","Pacific is the only entity where revenue was down over prior year. This was due to a decline in corporate travel driven by tariff impacts on the automotive and manufacturing sectors, and lower leisure demand to and from China. While Pacific is facing some near-term headwinds, we continue to see long-term opportunity for growth and profitability improvement.","Looking forward, December quarter total revenue is expected to increase more than 5% on unit revenues of flat to up 2%. We are seeing solid corporate and leisure demand with revenue growth driven by premium products, loyalty and MRO. Sequentially, December quarter TRASM is negatively impacted by the timing of JV settlements and Jewish holiday calendar shift. Excluding these items, underlying PRASM growth remains consistent at approximately 1.5% in both 3Q and 4Q. For the full year, we now expect to achieve approximately 7% revenue growth on full year capacity growth of 4.5%, while sustaining our 110% unit revenue premium to the industry.","While still in the planning stages for 2020, the strong demand environment and our commercial initiatives and our relaunch to service to India support our expectations for another year of revenue growth in excess of GDP.","As always, we remain mindful of the economic backdrop, changes in fuel price and the industry landscape. Our additional planning assumptions for 2020 call for 3 to 4 points of capacity, with a point of that capacity related to our relaunch of service to India. Generally, capacity growth will be focused in the areas of strength that support our long-term plans. This includes further optimization of our domestic network and growing our global presence in conjunction with our partners.","Our premium products and non-ticket sources like American Express and our MRO business are expected to continue to outpace our main cabin revenue growth into next year as we build on our strong 2019 results.","We will provide more details of our capacity growth and commercial initiative for 2020 and beyond in our upcoming Investor Day in December. In closing, a more diversified revenue base along with our pipeline of Delta specific initiatives, give us confidence in our ability to achieve the high end of our plan for 6% to 7% revenue growth in 2019 and sets us up nicely for another year of revenue growth in excess of GDP in 2020.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to my good friend Paul.","Paul Jacobson","Thanks, Glen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We\u2019re delivering against our Investor Day plan to drive top line growth, margin expansion and consistent returns to our owners. Year-to-date, our top-line has grown 8%, operating margins have expanded by over 200 basis points, and we\u2019ve grown earnings per share by 30%, driven by strong core fundamentals in our extended Amex agreement.","We\u2019ve also generated $4 billion of free cash flow, meeting our full year target in the first three quarters of the year, while also reinvesting in the business. Our investments continue to drive strong returns, supporting the long-term growth potential of the business. Our after-tax return on invested capital on a trailing 12-month basis is 15.9%. This represents more than 300 basis points of improvement since 2017, while our invested capital base has increased by nearly $2 billion.","Turning to September quarter results. We delivered solid performance in the quarter with pretax income of $2 billion and a pretax margin of 15.7%, 2 points higher than last year. Fuel was volatile during the quarter, but average prices remained below prior year levels. Total fuel expense decreased $249 million on 18% lower market fuel prices, including a $49 million benefit from the refinery during the quarter.","Our refleeting initiatives drove a 2.1% improvement in fuel efficiency during the quarter, keeping us on track to deliver a 2% fuel efficiency gain for the full year. While non-fuel unit costs in the quarter were up 2.4%, total unit costs were down 2%, as a result of those fuel prices.","During the September quarter, we announced a pay increase for eligible ground and flight attendant employees effective October 1st. This had a modest impact on the September quarter, and has about a 1 point impact on CASM-Ex in the December quarter. In addition to the pay increase, we\u2019re making investments in staffing and resources to ensure that our people can continue to deliver an industry-leading product for our customers in light of the strong demand. We expect these investments which provide the foundation for sustainable growth will add about 1 point to non-fuel cost in 2020. Our current plan assumption for 2020 is non-fuel unit cost growth of 2% to 3%. We\u2019ll provide more detail on that at our December Investor Day.","In the December quarter, we\u2019re also seeing an approximate 1.5-point impact to unit cost from the mark-up of liabilities related to long-term disability and retirement benefits. We do not expect there to be any impact from these adjustments on 2020 costs. Our investments combined with these accruals are adding approximately 3 points of CASM-Ex pressure in the December quarter and resulting in expected non-fuel unit cost growth of 4% to 5%.","Non-operating expenses for the quarter were $65 million higher than prior year, primarily due to higher pension expense consistent with our 2019 guidance. For the full-year, we continue to expect non-operating expense in the range of $525 million to $575 million.","Looking forward, we expect December quarter earnings to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.50 per share. This equates to a pretax margin of 9.5% to 11.5%, which is down from prior year as we lap more than $100 million of onetime gains, including the sale of Delta Global Services last year. Excluding this non-operating gain, our pretax margin is expected to improve over prior year and we expect our operating margin will expand by more than 150 basis points.","For the December quarter, we are forecasting fuel to remain below prior year levels, with all-in fuel price of $2 to $2.20 per gallon. We expect total unit costs to decline again in the December quarter as a result of this.","With the solid fourth quarter outlook, we are on track to grow full-year earnings per share by more than 20%.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the September quarter, adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 1.7 times at the low end of our target leverage ratio of 1.5 to 2.5 times. During the September quarter, we generated nearly $2.4 billion of operating cash flow, reinvested $800 million into the business, and invested $150 million to support our new strategic partnership with LATAM. This produced free cash flow of $1.4 billion, meeting our full-year free cash flow target of $4 billion in just nine months.","Our full-year core CapEx guidance $4.5 billion is unchanged, including the $100 million as part of our LATAM agreement to acquire 14 A350 aircraft. This recent transaction with LATAM is an exciting opportunity for Delta and as an example of how our balance sheet enables strategic moves that expand our competitive strengths.","We continue to consistently return cash to our owners in addition to investing in the future growth of the Company. During the September quarter, we returned $468 million to shareholders. For the year, we remain on track to return approximately $3 billion, in line with our commitment to return at least 70% of free cash flow to shareholders. Our consistent repurchase activity and 15% dividend increase in the third quarter demonstrates our continued conviction on the durability and sustainability of our business model.","We've been able to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders while maintaining low debt levels and improving the funded status of our pension as part of our commitment to maintain our investment grade ratings. These financials are a validation of our strengths, which continue to deliver industry-leading results and drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A.","Jill Greer","Thanks. And before we go to the Q&A, if we can just -- that time of year when we announce our December Investor Day this year, please mark your calendars for December 11th and 12th. We'll be back here in our hometown of Atlanta. For now, just mark your calendars, we'll send out more information as the date gets closer.","So, with that, Jake, if we can have the instructions for the analysts on how to join the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Hey. Thanks, yes. Hey. Good morning, everybody. I guess, maybe this is a question to Ed. If you can just give us an update on kind of where things, to the best of your knowledge, stand with respect to the tariff situation and the potential impact to Delta? And is it new aircraft orders; is it order aircraft as they deliver? Any color around this topic would be great. Thanks.","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Mike. It\u2019s aircraft as they are being delivered, which we have expressed our concerns that this is kind of a retrospective tariff on decisions taken in the past. That said, we\u2019re evaluating all of our options. We do not expect the cost to incur -- any cost of tariffs through the end of this year. We are expecting some deliveries out of Mobile in terms of 321s and those do not carry a tariff. And looking forward, we\u2019re examining our options next year to make sure that we mitigate any increase to the prices that we\u2019ve already negotiated with Airbus.","So, at this point, yes, we\u2019re looking at our options, and I am not going to into any details around the options since it\u2019s still pretty fluid at the moment, but we do not expect this is going to be a material cost to Delta, certainly not in the near term.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. And then, just a quick follow-up to Paul. I just -- I'm not sure if I heard it right. You talked about the CapEx associated with the LATAM A350s, and maybe that was just an amount that hits in 2019. Did you say $100 million or did I hear that right?","Paul Jacobson","Mike, you heard that correct. That\u2019s expected in the fourth quarter of \u201819.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Moving on to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thanks. So, just playing back the summer, it feels like you\u2019ve tried to flex up and respond to the environment, and that has obviously driven some expense, some over time, some airport costs. Can you comment on the quality of the incremental traffic that you picked up? Was it high quality or was it low yielding? And is this something that you plan to repeat in 2020? If not, why isn\u2019t it a tailwind to the 2020 cost outlook?","Ed Bastian","Hey, Duane. This is Ed. I\u2019ve said a number of times, second quarter as well as the third quarter, we certainly were a beneficiary of the MAX not operating. That said, we don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019ve got a significant amount of new incremental growth coming from that. The majority of the growth clearly was the strength of our own brand, strength of our product and services, which continues to outperform anything that we\u2019ve seen historically, and the costs that we talk about are not just due to the high demand. Remember, we ran a load factor of 90% from April all the way through August pretty much. But we also had an incredibly volatile weather pattern this summer that gave us very limited recovery option. So, the heightened load factor expectations, the fact that MAX was not out, the weather, all created an environment that we\u2019ve got to reinvest to make certain that next year, because I expect the share -- any share we picked up are going to retain going forward, we\u2019re better prepared to handle the volumes in 2020.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay, thanks. And then just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask you maybe a longer-term question about South Florida. How do you think about the growth prospects for that market longer term and potential connecting opportunities with the LATAM partnership? Is this about getting a bigger presence in South Florida for Delta or is it about building out from Atlanta to point South? Thanks for taking the questions.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks for the questions, Duane. It\u2019s a little bit of both. I think, if you think about improving the connectivity to the existing LATAM infrastructure in South Florida, there is a little bit we probably have to add to replace some of the flows that\u2019s existing today on American, but we\u2019re not creating a new hub; we're not creating a new giant connecting complex. We're doing selective adds. So, think of it, if you think about Miami as a hub and you think about our size in Dallas or Denver or Chicago, it probably looks a lot more like that to make sure we have key fleets that will go over Miami and then really work with LATAM once we get ATI to continue to develop Atlanta and our other U.S. gateways as the primary connecting points for the South America traffic.","So, I think we have a pretty good plan that takes the best of both, that\u2019s connecting complexes in the U.S. and best service within the local markets, and I think that\u2019s going to be a great platform for growth moving forward.","Operator","We will now move to the next question, and that will come from Helane Becker with Cowen.","Helane Becker","So, I think this might be a question for Paul. As I look at those actuarial assumptions you changed, you mentioned that it doesn\u2019t flow through to next year. But, I think you are also spending some money to bring your pension plans into closed or funded status. So, I was just wondering if it's possible for you to give us an update on that.","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Helane. Those two issues are somewhat unrelated. The actuarial changes relate to the long-term disability program, and this is actuarial tables that are updated every few years and we\u2019d seen a little bit of an increase in trends. So, we have to markup that liability one time. It hits that P&L, and that\u2019s why it's not expected to repeat this year -- or next year.","As to the pension, we continue to strive to target 80% funded status by the end of 2020. And so far, the assets are on strong trajectory this year with strong returns. Our pension expense, as we cited on in the prepared remarks is really a function of last year's returns as that gets spread over a full year. So, as we head into 2020 and we get those updates both on the funding as well as the investment returns, we\u2019ll have more detail at Investor Day on 2020.","Operator","We will now move to the next caller. And that will come from Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse.","Joe Caiado","Paul, maybe just picking off where Helane left off there on 2020. I\u2019m not asking for explicit cash flow guidance for 2020, obviously, but just hoping you could walk us through some of the puts and takes in operating cash flow for next year, things like cash taxes, you just touched on the pension there, but any other moving pieces that we should be aware of?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Joe. Not materially. Obviously, we see growth in the business, we see growth in the Amex portfolio as we continue to work our way up to nearly $7 billion by 2023. Those are some good sides in the business. We have articulated a belief that we\u2019ll be a cash taxpayer in 2020. That\u2019s not expected to be a huge headwind for us. So, we see consistent cash flow generation in 2020 at this point. And we\u2019ll provide those details at Investor Day as well.","Joe Caiado","Okay. I appreciate it. And my second question on free Wi-Fi, whoever wants to take this. It\u2019s obviously something that your business travelers demand. So, that\u2019s an important box for you to check. But, it also feels like it\u2019s a consumer data play. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about maybe the second derivative commercial opportunity from that initiative, if you will, just perhaps in terms of what it can do for merchandising or just learning more about every passenger and every seat. In other words, how do you monetize free Wi-Fi over time?","Ed Bastian","Hey, Joe. This is Ed. I\u2019ve again been vocal on this. I think, it\u2019s something that our customers not just demand but deserve. I think, the main benefit to me is the connection that they will continue to have to the brand and the strength of the brand and our selling proposition. But then, you\u2019re right, there\u2019s a second derivative order with respect to any commercial opportunities that we could create around that surface. We\u2019re not ready to talk into detail yet. We\u2019re still a ways off from announcing the exact start date. We\u2019re learning a lot on the technical capacity that we currently have and any additional changes we need to make. But, we\u2019re on the path to getting there and I'm excited by it. I think it\u2019s going to be a great new service to our customers when we get there.","Operator","And now, moving on to the next caller, and that will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi, you may be muted. Please unmute.","Savi Syth","Good morning. Sorry about that. I know it\u2019s early stages, but I was wondering if you could help me understand a little bit more on the 2020 cost outlook. It seems that you kind of -- it almost seems that you\u2019re indicating that you over-earned this year because the cost is about catching up your current market share, but you also had a lot of cost by paying kind of over time for your current -- for all your crusades to meet the capacity needs this time. So, kind of wondering how it adds that incremental 1 point and how should we think about that cost outlook for next year?","Glen Hauenstein","Good morning, Savi, and thanks for the question. The pressure that you cited and certainly what we\u2019ve called out going back to some conferences this fall was real. And as I articulated, we felt a little bit like bursting at the seams with all the passenger loads and some of the weather pressures that we saw. And undoubtedly, some of the staffing investments that we\u2019ll make will help mitigate some of that. But it\u2019s really about arming our people with the tools and resources they need to serve our customers in an expanding base. Our total revenues are up 15% over the last couple of years, and there is investments in that process that we need to continue to make in order to drive the quality that our customers are used to, to continue to earn that revenue.","So, it goes beyond that. And as we said, we\u2019ll give more details at Investor Day. ","Ed Bastian","Savi, this is Ed, if I could add to that. We\u2019ve given a long-term trajectory on non-fuel cost of being around 2%. And when we can go below that, we do as we\u2019ve been I think for the last couple of years. That means occasionally, it might be above that. But I think our long-term trend line is -- 2% is a good target for us.","I would not say that we over-earned this year. We certainly had that cost both in Q3 and Q4, related to the high volumes that we had. I think, this is about as much infrastructure investments that continue to better serve the growth, whether it be in airports and technology and in our people, and our service providers as it is dealing with the secure volumes of a very busy summer. So, this is a long-term investment that I\u2019m confident is going to have long-term returns.","Savi Syth","That makes sense. If I might just ask a smaller cost question on 4Q, just on Trainer, just expectations there? I might have missed it.","Paul Jacobson","Sorry, Savi. On Trainer?","Glen Hauenstein","Yes.","Paul Jacobson","Trainer is expected to have a slight loss for the quarter that\u2019s built into our fuel price guidance. We have some scheduled maintenance on a couple of units that\u2019s going on now that's expected to be completed in early November. But overall, the refinery continues to operate well.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll hear from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Ed or Glen, when we think back to simple fares in 2005, I\u2019m wondering why that failed. And at its core, this is really a loyalty question. Is there a thought to maybe trying something like that again, given such clear product distinctions between their types and the segmentation era?","Glen Hauenstein","Hunter, I think simple fares might have been too simple, and maybe as an industry we weren\u2019t ready for it. We didn\u2019t have the sophistication to really manage it well. And I think that\u2019s really the infrastructures we're putting in place now and how we see the evolution of pricing occurring over the next year. One of the things that you would have to admit about the industry in general is it\u2019s transactional and it's not really trusted very well. And I think we learned that because sometimes you go look and the flight you want to take on a Monday morning is $500 and sometimes it\u2019s $1200 and sometimes it's yet another number. And I think, what we're doing with all of the data that we\u2019re collecting is we're trying to bring more stability to that pricing model over time. And it's not really simple fares but it's more reliable fares. And it's not a revolution, it's an evolution.","So, we're on a journey on this and we're trying to be less transactional and more customer-driven. And we\u2019re not at our destination yet and it will take several more years for us to get there. But I love the question because I do think it's a sense of how do we become a better consumer brand. And I think one of the things that we have to do is to have trust from our consumers.","Hunter Keay","That's great. Thank you, Glen. And then, Ed, maybe for you. The third runway Heathrow, is that a done deal? And how can you leverage the airport work that you've been doing here in the U.S. with your ownership stake in Virgin and maybe have a seat at the table for how that extension -- how that looks over there as it happens? Thanks.","Ed Bastian","I don't believe it's a done deal. I think, it's certainly something that's needed. I think, there is a lot of work going into the termination of the cost, the long-term impact to the city. We're going to provide certainly through Virgin our perspective on a build there, but we are a relatively small share of overall Heathrow. So, I\u2019m not sure we're going to have much of a voice in that process.","Operator","Now, we will go to a question from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.","Jamie Baker","For Glen, the 10% PRASM premium, that's driven by about 20% domestically and basically flattish on the international, if I\u2019m correct. Why don\u2019t you think you get a RASM premium on international?","Glen Hauenstein","I think it depends on the entity. Of course, each international entity is different. We get a premium in the transatlantic. We have not gotten our premium historically in Latin America, and I think that's one of the reasons that we are so excited about the LATAM transaction as our offering really wasn't what it needed to be to drive revenue premiums being the number four carrier. So, I think that was one of the things that we thought we needed to have a structural improvement in our offering in Latin America in order ultimately to drive significant premiums. And I think we achieve that in the long run, not today, but over the long run by securing LATAM.","And then, in the Pacific, there is a lot of different -- it's a small entity for us and we have made significant improvements there. But, our stage length is really working against us. And I think, as we transition through to Haneda next year, we've told our investors we\u2019re on a multiyear transformation. And one of the things we'll talk about at our Investor Day is we\u2019re arriving at our destination finally in Asia, and that will give us the building blocks I think to drive premium with the products that will drive premium and with the introduction of the Delta One suites and the premium economy. I think, we're well-positioned to drive premiums in the Pacific as well over time.","Jamie Baker","And second on loyalty, maybe for Paul, maybe for Ed. I think, everyone recognizes that loyalty represents a moat around the business. But, it's not clear to me how some of your Amex assumptions, the path towards that $7 billion figure, how that gets altered by a U.S. recession? I've got all the data on what happens to air travel demand. But, what are your recessionary assumptions in terms of quarterly mileage sales, card openings, consumer spending? I mean, I know loyalty is more durable than air travel, but I still don't know how durable.","Ed Bastian","Well, Jamie, I'll take that. Obviously, we don't know what the economic outlook over the next five years. And the $7 billion number that we have disclosed is our target together with Amex, over this timeframe. It doesn't necessarily indicate that's recession proof. I mean, certainly, it's sensitive to spend, probably the single biggest element that we have in there. But, we also have modeled what happened in 2009 and how quickly spend did return. It's one of the reasons why we're creating not just greater loyalty through the card and the brand portfolio but also getting avenues for currency to be used as dollars, and the technology work that we have. And I think it's actually been one of the real nice innovations we brought to the market this year is that we're giving alternative use for currency, and people can spend and conserve cash.","So, I would say it's our target. Could there be bumps along that way? Certainly. It's not a flat guarantee. But, I think it's our best estimate together with Amex what we expect to see over the next five years. And at the same time, even through the process, this year while you have some economic concerns, I wouldn't say significant concerns in terms of consumer spend, we're still seeing growth on the card portfolio at double digits.","Jamie Baker","Is there a quarterly minimum in terms of what Amex is obligated to purchase in terms of miles or is there a scenario where spend was soft enough, they would have enough miles and they could just drop to zero for a period for Delta?","Ed Bastian","We're not going to get into any details of the contract, Jamie, as you can appreciate.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley will have the next question.","Rajeev Lalwani","Ed, Paul, a question for you. You've provided some good color on costs into next year. But, as we think about just over the next several years, how do we get comfortable with your ability to bring those costs back down to that target 2% or below level when you've got a pilot deal that's out there and you are likely going to be decelerating some of that capacity growth back to more normalized levels, if you will?","Ed Bastian","Rajeev, I'll take that. The 2% number is what we've given you in the past and we continue to see that hold. One of the -- we'll provide a lot more color when we get to Investor Day as to how we see the 2020 cost outlook. But, one of the pressure points we're also facing in 2020 is that our gauge in 2020 is actually going to be relatively flat year-over-year, and that's been certainly a source of productivity for us on unit cost. We expect to see that pick up again in \u201821. So, that's going to be another pressure that we're facing in the short term. But, we'll give you our perspective on that when we give you the details. But, we have faced our labor pressures in the past. We expect that whatever deal is cut with the pilots is going to be within the frame we talked about it.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And then, Glen, actually a follow-up for you. You talked about a pretty strong demand environment. The supply backdrop seems pretty favorable from what we can tell. At the same time, you're pointing to RASM that's nearly flattish, once you take out the card benefit. I know there are some puts and takes there. But, can you just reconcile those two dynamics they seem to be odds with one another?","Glen Hauenstein","I think, we were trying to get to that in the call. So, I appreciate the question that our lift PRASM, which is what's coming off the tickets, is really very flat between 3Q and 4Q at about 1.5%. So, the TRASM decline between 3Q and 4Q is really a previous year accounting adjustments, which didn't occur this year. And so, that's what we were trying to say in the call. I'm sorry if we weren't clear enough. But, thanks for the question because I do want everybody to understand that the revenue coming off the tickets themselves is positive, it's consistent at about 1.5 up between 3Q and 4Q.","Operator","Now, moving onto Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. And Joseph, please go ahead with your question.","Joseph DeNardi","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","I am sorry. Joseph, we\u2019re not hearing your question clearly.","Joseph DeNardi","Is that better?","Operator","Yes. Please continue.","Joseph DeNardi","[Technical Difficulty] at the Amex partnership a lot more that you used do. Analysts asked about it a lot more. I still think investor don't know what to [Technical Difficulty] on the valuation of the company. So, it suggests that [Technical Difficulty]. So, I'm wondering when do you think you'd be in a position to consider [Technical Difficulty] so investors can see profitability from a financial standpoint? Thank you.","Ed Bastian","Joe, you were still breaking up. If I understood your question, it's along the lines of, are we prepared to increase the segment disclosure relative to the American Express loyalty component of our business. Is that right?","Joseph DeNardi","Yes. That's right.","Ed Bastian","Yes. We're always evaluating how we provide the best insight for our investors into the drivers of our opportunities for the future. We've improved some of the disclosure. And certainly while we have to work within the confines of our contractual obligations to Amex, the confidentiality provisions, yes, I think it's a valid question, it's a fair question. It's something we need to continue to think about how we get greater visibility. It's an very important source of revenue for us today, it's certainly a growing source, probably growing faster than most other revenue components we have in the business, and it's certainly margin accretive. We can debate how you want to cost those miles, but it's certainly highly accretive to us. So, I think it's a fair question. I don't have an answer for you quite yet, but we're going to keep looking at.","Joseph DeNardi","And then, Ed, given the value of the Amex agreement and how valuable you think it can be, why isn't Sandeep's role a C level position?","Ed Bastian","Did Sandeep ask you to ask that question? Sandeep and the loyalty team are incredible contributors and highly valued. And I wouldn't go on title or definition. I've got great visibility to Sandeep and I see him just about every week on it. So, he\u2019s a great asset to the Company as well as his entire team.","Joseph DeNardi","Thank you.","Operator","And now, we'll move to a question from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.","Catherine O\u2019Brien","So, year-to-date, you've been seeing some nice growth in your -- some of your non-ticket revenue categories like travel related services and, of course, loyalty revenue with the new Amex deal. Could you maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes on these non-ticket revenue streams into next year? Is there still room left to add some more products or should we expect to see growth accelerate in some of your ancillary businesses? Thanks.","Ed Bastian","Well, I'll talk a little bit about premium products and maybe turn that over to Gil for some of the ancillaries like the MRO. Clearly, we see room for growth there. And that's been on a different trajectory than base ticket fares. And as you saw, we grew premium products by 9% in the quarter, which was above the, of course, average of the total revenue growth at 6.5%. So, we continue to see that moving forward. And it's really, we think, our ability to a, price those products, given the increasing demand that we see from consumers on them, but b, also continuing to increase the number of channels we distribute them through. And as you know, we've been working to do that more on our digital channels but also through -- there are travel management companies and our partnerships and through the OTAs. And we're seeing some great early results on that. But, it's got ways to go over the next years -- months and years. So, we continue to see that as -- being able to grow even through maybe a challenging economic environment.","Gil West","Yes. Hi. This is Gil. I would just add -- first, just a shout out to our tech ops team for -- I mean, they are the best in the business. But the MRO business for us year-to-date is up about $120 million year-over-year, about 23%. So, we're seeing strong growth in the current year. As you look forward, some of the investments that we've made in terms of capacity for new generation engines, in particular the Rolls-Royce Trent engine and the Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan, those volumes start to ramp next year as well, albeit those will mature in three or four years. But, we'll benefit from some of that tailwind as well in the MRO business as we move forward.","Catherine O\u2019Brien","That's great. Thanks. And then, maybe just one quick follow-up on costs. And I think, you already alluded to this Ed, but I just want to make sure I've got it right. In your 2020 CASM outlook, the 2% to 3%, there is a potential new pilot deal that is contemplated in that number. Is that correct?","Ed Bastian","Katie, I'll take that. We are not going to comment to pilot deal or in any nature. 2% to 3% is our best estimate where our cost will be next year. We're not going to get into the details relative to our negotiations.","Catherine O\u2019Brien","Okay, understood. Thank you very much.","Jill Greer","And Jake, we're going to have time for one more question from the analyst.","Operator","Great. And that last analyst question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein.","Ran Yang","Hi. This is Ran Yang speaking on behalf of David Vernon. So, just to clarify talk go back to the CASM-Ex guide into 2020. The one point step up, is that something that you can potentially offset with other cost initiatives, like One Delta?","Paul Jacobson","One Delta continues to pay big dividends for us. And while we expect the level of investment back into the product and the infrastructure as Ed articulated, we're always striving to find some of that productivity. And as we've said before, we'll detail more about the 2020 cost outlook at Investor Day in December.","Ran Yang","Got it. Thank you.","Jill Greer","That's going to wrap up the analyst portion of the phone call. I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Communications Officer for the analysts -- or the media portion.","Tim Mapes","Good morning, everybody, and thank you to the members of the media for holding on. We have a little bit under 10 minutes of time to take questions. I'll just remind everybody, as we said earlier with analysts, please if you would limit your questions to one and so we can get through as many of these as quickly as possible.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll hear first from Elliott Blackburn with Argus Media.","Elliott Blackburn","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Curious how the Trainer refinery is going to adjust to the higher renewable fuel blending requirements that the Trump administration is proposing begin next year?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Elliot. This is Paul. We are in a full compliance with our RINs requirements under the RFS standard and have done a good job of managing through that volatility that we've seen over the last several years. And I'm confidence that the team will be able to continue to address that. We continue to advocate on behalf of small and independent refiners that long-term solutions have to be identified. But, we\u2019re managing through that in the short term.","Elliott Blackburn","So, do you think that this -- it doesn't sound like you are concerned that this added cost is going to affect the refinery\u2019s kind of viability long term?","Paul Jacobson","We certainly think that it can result in added costs. We don't believe necessarily that it affects the full viability. But, it does have an economic impact to the region and our ability to continue to drive those results at the refinery.","Operator","And now, we'll move to the next question and that will come from David Koenig with Associated Press.","David Koenig","Hey. Good morning. This is for Ed. You gave a figure on TV for hiring this year and next year. Can you go over those targets and how many will be pilots for example? And then, overall, how much of that hiring is just replacing people who retire or leave and how much of it is actually pure growth?","Ed Bastian","Sure, David. We haven't given out the specifics by job classification for next year. But, we've been hiring at a rate of about 6,000 new employees coming into the Company for the last couple of years, and we expect again going forward, next year, at a similar level. Pilots are going to be increasing in numbers due to retirements. The retirement age really starts to ramp up in the next two to three years. And so, those numbers are going to grow as well as to accommodate some of the growth that we've seen in the business. And one of the things that we'll be doing a bit differently than we did this past year is we're going to be hiring earlier in the year and continue to keep the hiring going through the year rather than have it in more discrete period. So, we'll have all of our new hires in position hopefully ready to handle as much of the new volume that's going to be coming in next year, not the [indiscernible]. In total, I'd say the -- probably at least half of the 6,000 we're talking about are retirement, replacement of workers that are retiring, half to two-thirds; and then, there is kind of some growth as well.","David Koenig","Okay. I'm a little unclear about pilots. Will you grow the overall number of pilots, or next summer you'll have more? Okay.","Ed Bastian","We just haven't given the number, but we're going to be growing our pilot hiring too. Yes.","David Koenig","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Ted Reed with Forbes.","Ted Reed","I have two questions. First for Glen, if I look at what you're doing this quarter, it seems like you're growing at southern most major airport on the East Coast in Miami and then northern most in Boston. Is that a good way to look at it?","Glen Hauenstein","I don't think we've announced any plans to grow Miami yet. But, as I outlined in the earlier call, I think, we will add some key spokes into Miami. It won't be giant. But, I think we have had a successful growth in Boston. And as you know, this past quarter, we just took back our terminal. That terminal was constructed almost 15 years ago and opened, and this is the first time that we've occupied the terminal that was built for Delta. And I would assume that we will be the leading carrier in Boston in terms of revenue in 2020. So, yes, we've done a lot of growth in Boston.","Ted Reed","Secondly for Ed. As you look at the impact of the tariffs, is your response -- your ability to respond going to be based on Mobile and taking more production from Mobile? And do you have any priority in getting the production from Mobile?","Ed Bastian","Well, certainly Mobile is going to be very important for us going forward. And that's -- yes, that's going to be the focus of our domestic strategy to be getting our 220s, our 321s via Mobile as Airbus continues to ramp up that production capability. I'm not going to get into any longer term ideas we have because obviously it doesn't necessarily help you on the wide bodies. But, we're evaluating options there. And as I said, our goal is to mitigate any potential tariff exposure.","Operator","Now, Leslie Josephs with CNBC, we'll have the next question.","Leslie Josephs","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. This is about basic economy. I've been noticing the fare differences between main cabin and basic seem to be going up, I mean across various routes when you guys started -- I know you started a long time ago. But, maybe a couple of years ago, it was like $30, $40, now seeing sometimes $100. Is that kind of across the board? What kind of benefit are you seeing from that?","Ed Bastian","Well, basic economy is not something that we want to grow. It's not really a premium product. And as we've outlined before, defensive product against ULCCs, we want to have best-in-class product whatever people's needs are. And for people who only care about the lowest fare possible, I think, we have by far the best offering. And the differential between that and the main cabin, it hasn't been an intentional shift in separating those out. But, I think what we're testing in many cases is what are people willing to pay for that. And sometimes in business markets, it's a bigger differential. And I think maybe that's what you're looking. At a market basket level of all markets, the difference has only been a couple of dollars different. But, I think at individual market levels, it may be greater.","Leslie Josephs","Okay. When did that start, that larger gap? It was about $30, $40 just a couple of years ago.","Ed Bastian","Yes. I think you'd have to give us what markets you're looking at because each one of the markets is managed individually.","Leslie Josephs","Okay. Like transcon, for example.","Ed Bastian","All right. Well, again, I think, we can get back to you with some more details. But, the intent has not been to move up the ladder significantly.","Operator","We'll take our final question today from John Biers with AFP.","John Biers","Hi. Thank you for taking my call. We've seen a fair bit of data showing that there is weakness in the manufacturing sector in the U.S. right now. There is a strike that's been going on for weeks now in Detroit, which is one of your hubs. Are you seeing any weakness right now in your demand forecast looking forward for the U.S. in general? There's -- obviously we've had more talk about possible recession in the next couple of years. Any shift at all, any weakness compared with a few months ago?","Ed Bastian","John, this is Ed. No, not at all. We had a -- as we've mentioned a number of times on this call, we had record summer in terms of both volumes and revenues. So, all time high revenues for us. And the domestic system is what produced those records. Our domestic revenues were up 8% in the third quarter. And we continue to see advanced bookings, the domestic consumer being quite strong. We expect the holiday period to be a strong period. Looking ahead, we don't have a great view into 2020 since it's pretty early for us on our booking curve, but the -- our business is heavily levered to the U.S. consumer. And the U.S. consumer is doing quite well and is preferring Delta.","John Biers","Thank you.","Glen Hauenstein","With that, we'll conclude today's call. As has been mentioned earlier, we look forward to seeing everybody on December 11th and 12th here in Atlanta. And we're grateful for your time today. Thank you.","Operator","And once again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect."],"7327":["Delta Air Lines, Inc.

My name is Kyle and I will be your coordinator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jill Sullivan Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for our June quarter call. Joining us in Atlanta today are Ed Bastian, our CEO; our President, Glen Hauenstein and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Ed will open the call. Glen will then address our financial and revenue performance and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. And you can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.","And with that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Ed Bastian.","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Jill. Good morning. Thanks to everyone for joining us. For the June quarter, we reported a $1.7 billion pre-tax profit and we generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We grew our earnings per share 16% to $1.47 beating consensus by $0.05. Strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to offset a decline in revenues as we continue to face persistent unit revenue headwinds. In this challenging revenue environment, it\u2019s more important than ever that we differentiate ourselves on service. And in this area, the Delta people have truly risen to the top. We continue to run the industry\u2019s best operation. We delivered a 99.95% completion factor for the June quarter, including 71 of the 90 days with zero mainline cancellations.","More importantly, we had 23 days of zero system cancellations on any Delta carrier, nearly 6,000 flights a day or 1 out of every 4 days for the entire quarter. Our mainline on-time rate improved 1.5 points year-over-year to 86.9%. This operational result is contributing to continued solid increases in customer satisfaction. We have achieved all-time highs in our net promoter scores and our customer complaint rate has decreased by 14% so far this year. These high levels of customer satisfaction are widening our revenue lead relative to the industry with our system RASM index reaching 110% as of the March quarter. Congratulations to the entire Delta team and thank you. We recognize your outstanding efforts with another $324 million of crude towards our profit sharing program bringing us to $596 million accrued already this year.","Despite our strong results, we continue to face persistent headwinds on our unit revenues on a number of fronts that we are working hard to combat. Capacity is one of the biggest levers we have to move the needle on our unit revenue performance. In May, we announced that we plan to take one point of capacity out of the fourth quarter. That brought our second half capacity growth plan to below 2%. Now, with the foreign currency pressure from the steep drop in the pound, the economic uncertainty from Brexit and continuing yield pressures in the North Atlantic, we have decided to take an additional 6 points of capacity out of the UK for the winter IATA season. We have also been working closely with our partner Virgin Atlantic who will be making their own capacity changes. Combined, our overall UK capacity this winter will be down 2% to 4% compared to the prior year.","For Delta, these changes along with other network actions will take roughly 1 point of capacity out of the system and we now expect our fourth quarter capacity to grow by only 1% year-over-year. Glen will take you through the details. But I want to stress to you that the company is very focused on getting back to positive RASM growth. While admittedly, we have done a poor job forecasting when unit revenues will turn positive, we are working hard to achieve our goal hopefully by the end of the year. And even if ultimately it takes a little bit longer than year end, we are confident we are on the right path.","We expect July and August monthly RASM results to be weak. However, we are anticipating a market improvement in our September monthly numbers as we implement our capacity changes and see benefits from our domestic revenue management initiatives and easing of foreign exchange headwinds and an improvement in the overall pricing environment as we hit the traditional 9-month period that it takes for revenues to catch up to higher fuel prices that we began experiencing earlier this year. And if we are not seeing the right progress in our results as we moved through the fall, we are prepared to take additional actions as you saw us announced this morning. Because the reality is that the large year-on-year savings driven by lower fuel are now behind us, market prices are essentially flat for the third quarter and look to be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2012. All that said, our results for the third quarter should be a record as we expect to generate a pre-tax margin of 20%, consistent with what we posted a year ago.","Demonstrating the sustainability of our performance is key to delivering the margin, cash flow and return targets that we outlined for you in May. And as we look to drive that performance longer term for the business, we will continue to execute on the strategy that has already delivered tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. First, we will continue to strengthen our brand around the world. The strong brand improves customer loyalty while driving a sustainable revenue premium and higher margins. Second, we will maintain a rigorous discipline around cost and capital. This provides the solid foundation for the business, day in and day out. With our sustainable revenue premium, a solid cost foundation and modest capacity growth, we have the engine for consistent 15% plus long-term earnings growth. Finally, we will use our strong cash flows to reinvest in the business for the long-term, fortify our balance sheet through debt and pension reductions while also returning at least 70% of our free cash flow to our owners.","So to conclude, our second quarter results were strong. However, we need to get unit revenues back on a positive track and Glen and the commercial team are executing on our plan. Longer term, our revenue premium, solid cost base, balance sheet and cash flows provide the foundation for the earnings growth and substantial capital returns for our owners that we believe will drive value long into the future.","And with that, I am happy to turn the call now over to Glen.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. While the overall revenue environment continues to present challenges, we expect to outperform our network peers on unit revenues once again in the second quarter. This is truly a testament to our entire team who continue to provide industry leading revenues by delivering an unparalleled level of reliability and great customer service every day.","Turning to our June quarter performance, revenues declined 2% compared to last year, including roughly $65 million of pressure from currency. We continue to see closing domestic yield deterioration on stable corporate ticket volumes producing domestic corporate unit revenue trends that are down in the high single-digits. This pressure, combined with continued foreign currency impacts and supply demand imbalances primarily in the Trans-Atlantic and China regions, drove a 4.9% decline in system passenger revenues.","While we faced a number of headwinds in the quarter, the expansions of our ancillary revenue initiative remains a significant positive for us. Our branded fare initiative continues to see strong momentum. Total merchandising revenues for the quarter increased more than $40 million or 13% year-over-year. Comfort+ paid load factory increased by 15 points to 46% as we began selling this product in the purchase path in mid-May. We now expect Comfort+ to generate nearly $300 million of up-sell revenues in the second half of 2016 with further upside in 2017 as we begin the international rollout scheduled to be complete by the end of \u201817.","We now have rolled out our basic economy product to over 7,000 domestic markets or about 50% of our domestic revenue base. We anticipate that we will have full domestic coverage sometime in 2017. Our international rollout of this product has begun and we are now testing the product in over 50 international markets. Our intent is to have this in all international markets during the year \u201818. Our partnership with American Express produced $90 million of incremental value in this quarter and we expect over $300 million for the year. New current acquisitions are on a pace for another record year and have increased 30% year-to-date over our record 2015. A special thanks to the SkyMiles and American Express teams for the great success we have had in enrolling new members this year. We have a great partner in American Express and look forward to our continued efforts to provide the leading co-brand offering to our mutual customers.","While there are areas of the business that have great momentum, there are others that require additional work. Our entire commercial team has focused on changing the revenue trajectory and getting back to positive RASM by year end. Let me outline for you some of the major initiatives we have underway by region to ensure that we can achieve our goal. Domestically our unit revenues declined 6% on 5% capacity growth for the June quarter and while absolute volumes for business traffic remained solid, quite simply they didn\u2019t keep pace with sales growth. Yields were further pressured as traditional AP and minimum stay requirements were absent in many major U.S. markets. On the other hand, leisure yields are strengthening and demand remained strong, so going forward, our path to improving domestic RASM starts by moderating our domestic capacity growth. This will begin in our post-summer schedule that begins late August.","With continued strength and leisure demand and yields reduced capacity growth should allow us to position our inventory towards higher yielding, long AP leisure fares. This should provide a cushion for unit revenues that will more than offset stubbornly low business fares that are largely sold within the month. July and August will post strong domestic margins and cash flow as we run out the remainder of our summer schedule. We are confident that we will then see substantial RASM improvement in the September timeframe and may even achieve positive domestic revenue as early as September.","In Latin America, unit revenues were down 5% in the quarter. But June achieved our first positive unit revenue results in 26 months. This result was achieved as Brazil unit revenue declines moderated to just 4% on strengthening currency and capacity reductions. Delta has removed 25% of capacity in Brazil to deal with the economic crisis. Mexico continued to be strong for us on both leisure and business demand and RASM during the quarter was up 4 points. Caribbean demand remained solid and we expect favorable unit revenues beginning in 3Q as we lap our own and industry capacity increases. For the remainder of the year, our Latin capacity will decline 2 points to 3 points and we expect this entity to inflect in RASM, consistently as early as the September quarter on reduced currency pressures, strengthening demand and reduced capacity offering.","Moving to the Pacific, the 5% unit revenue decline in the June quarter was the result of a 4-point headwind from lower year-on-year hedge gains. Additionally, there were 2 points of negative impact from \u2013 negative fuel searches \u2013 surcharges, partly offset by the appreciation of the end spot rate. As the business practice, we hedge at least 50% of our net yen exposure in any given quarter. However in 2015, we have more significant positions in place at more favorable rates than we do currently. In fact, we expect to recognize a $5 million hedge loss in the back half of this year compared to a $90 million gain last year. $70 million of that headwind will occur in the September quarter alone, accounting for nearly 1 point of negative system PRASM and more than 7 points of impact on the Pacific unit revenues.","Excluding hedges, we achieved flat RASM in Japan in the June quarter held by our capacity adjustments, our focus on higher you yielding U.S. point of sales traffic and recovery in the Japan point of sale resort markets, driven by a stronger yen. The strength in Japan was firmly offset by yield pressures in China. Passenger growth in China was up 7% in the quarter and we continue to see increasing demand for connecting traffic with our partners China Eastern and China Southern. However, industry capacity to and from the U.S. increased nearly 25% in the second quarter, which pressured yields. This capacity is expected to continue in the second half. For the remainder of the year in the Pacific, we are accelerating our capacity reductions and expect to be down roughly 7.5% in the third quarter and 5% for the winter season. We expect the combination of our planned capacity reductions, along with the stronger yen to achieve positive RASM growth later this year, excluding the hedge impact.","Finally, in the Trans-Atlantic entity, Delta\u2019s second quarter capacity grew in line with traffic trends at 2%, while the industry increased capacity by 10% pressuring yields. Although this drove our unit revenues down 4.5% for the quarter, the Trans-Atlantic is still on track to produce one of the most profitable summers in history. That said, this area continues to be where we face the greatest challenge in our efforts to get back to positive RASM and we are now facing even additional pressures from Brexit. In our Continental European markets, customer growth nearly matched capacity growth of five, but double digit low cost carrier growth pressured yields. In the second quarter, Delta and Air France KLM began a code-share agreement with Jet Airways. We are very optimistic about this opportunity to feed Paris, Amsterdam and London going forward.","And given the contra-seasonal nature of the India market, we expect to have a positive impact on fourth quarter Trans-Atlantic revenues. In the UK, Delta\u2019s British pound denominated revenue is roughly 350 million on an annual basis. So when the pound devalued 12% versus the pre-Brexit levels, our revenues were reduced by 40 million from currency alone. Since the leave decision, we haven\u2019t seen a material impact on volumes, but as Ed mentioned along with our partner, Virgin Atlantic, we are taking additional capacity out of the UK for winter to address the headwinds of the region. The reduction is focused on UK origin leisure markets. These changes combined with other actions we are taking will result in our winter IATA scheduled capacity in the Trans-Atlantic being down for the second consecutive year. Even with these capacity actions, we do not expect RASM in the Trans-Atlantic to inflect until sometime in \u201817.","At a system level, with these plans in place across all of our entities and the trends that we see today for the September quarter, we are forecasting system unit revenues to be down between 4% and 6% on a 1% to 2% year-over-year capacity increase. We expect July and August to be at or slightly below the bottom end of that range with September markedly better than both of those months. Calendar placement creates noise between the months and will be a 2-point headwind in August and a 2-point benefit to September. Additionally, September should see benefit and as currency and fuel surcharge headwinds ease and the fall capacity changes begin to be implemented.","So to wrap everything up, while the current environment remains challenging, we continue to outperform our peer set. We have plans in place to address the challenges we face and are executing against those plans. Where we haven\u2019t seen the desire traction in our unit revenues, we are taking actions with revenue management strategies and capacity levels. And if necessary, we will take further actions to make sure that we maintain the momentum to achieve our goal of getting to positive unit revenue by year end and ahead of our network peers.","And with that, I would like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul Jacobson.","Paul Jacobson","Thanks Glen and thanks here to entire team. We all appreciate the efforts and the hard work that they are undergoing. Good morning everyone and appreciate you joining us this morning. Consistent cost execution again this quarter was a key contributor to Delta, delivering an operating margin that was within our initial guidance range before the 4-point headwind from the early fuels hedge settlements. While we continue to benefit from lower fuel costs, prices remain volatile as does the global environment and we must remain vigilant of those costs that we can control. At the same time, it is critical that we continue to invest in our product and enhance our performance and service to our customers.","Total operating expenses declined by roughly $300 million in the quarter, driven by lower fuel expense. Non-fuel CASM was essentially flat despite pressure from higher wages and product and service investments. Our strong operational performance, our up-gauging initiatives and the commitment across the organization to delivering productivity savings, drove our solid cost performance again this quarter. I would like to thank the entire Delta team for driving another outstanding result this quarter. We have the best employees in the industry and this strong performance was made possible by their contributions. We expect our non-fuel unit costs including profit sharing to be roughly flat again in the September quarter and increase less than 2% for the full year.","Turning to fuel, our total fuel expense declined by over $400 million as lower market fuel prices offset higher consumption and hedge losses. We made the decision in the quarter to early settle all of our remaining 2016 hedges, which brought in an additional $450 million of losses to the quarter. Our all-in fuel price was $1.97 per gallon, including $0.43 from those early settlements. The refinery lost a modest $10 million for the quarter and we expect a lower crack spread environment, which is a positive for Delta overall, will likely result in a modest loss for the refinery for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect an all-in September quarter fuel price of $1.52 to $1.57 per gallon, which is down 15% from the prior year. With the early hedge settlements complete, we don\u2019t expect to report any additional hedge losses in 2016.","Now, let me address our margin outlook. With another quarter of solid cost performance despite persistent RASM headwinds and a moderating fuel environment, we are forecasting a September operating margin in the 19% to 21% range, which is roughly flat to last year.","Moving on to cash flow, we generated $2.6 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We reinvested over $1 billion back into the business during the quarter, with spending primarily related to aircraft deliveries in modification projects. We expect capital spending will approximate $750 million in the third quarter as we now expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the fourth quarter. We will continue to take a balanced approach to the deployment of our cash as we remain focused on long-term durability and sustainability for the business model. This is what we are driving for with each dollar we spend whether it is going back into the business, the balance sheet or return to our owners.","We ended the June quarter with net debt of $6.8 billion, down from $7.1 billion a year ago. That debt reduction saved another $34 million in interest expense this quarter. With the additional $135 million we contributed to the pension plan this quarter, we have completed our funding commitment for the year. The progress we have made on de-risking the balance sheet and paying down our debt was recognized by Fitch in the quarter with an upgrade to BBB-. We are now proud that two of the three rating agencies have provided us with this strong endorsement of our commitment to the long-term stability and viability of our business model. With the $1.6 billion of free cash flow we generated during the quarter, we continued on the path of also increasing shareholder returns with $103 million of dividends and just over $1 billion of share repurchases.","As we announced at our May Analyst Meeting, our dividend will increase to $0.81 per share annually beginning in the September quarter. At current stock prices, this is just over a 2% dividend yield. In addition, we expect to complete our current $5 billion share repurchase authorization by next May, over 6 months ahead of schedule, which will represent our third consecutive authorization completed ahead of time. We expect to return nearly $3.5 billion to shareholders this year consistent with our goal of returning at least 70% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases.","In closing, I want to express my excitement about the opportunities ahead for our business. We are going to continue to stretch ourselves. We are going to continue to follow through on our near-term and long-term plans. Our performance is simply remarkable against any measure and we are focused on remaining a leading S&P 500 company. Jill?","Jill Sullivan Greer","And we are now ready for the analyst Q&A, if you could give them their instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Yes, hey. Just two quick ones. Can you just give us the breakout between domestic and international capacity growth for the third and fourth quarters?","Glen Hauenstein","For the fourth quarter which is the endpoint \u2013 so I will start there. We will be up about 2 to 2.5 domestic and about down 2 to 2.5 internationally.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. And then do you have that for the third quarter, Glen?","Glen Hauenstein","For the third quarter, I do not have that. I am going to estimate it\u2019s about plus 3.5 for domestic and minus 1 for international.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, that\u2019s perfect. And then just quick question on the Virgin Atlantic, the 49% stake, I know that runs to the non-op. In your June quarter, does that reflect their June quarter or is that a lag? I know sometimes with private companies, there is a quarter lag. I just want to clarify that.","Glen Hauenstein","Yes, that\u2019s current, Mike.","Michael Linenberg","So, it is the June quarter Virgin\u2019s numbers in your June quarter?","Glen Hauenstein","Yes, they can count just like we can.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew Didora","To the questions, Paul, just on the \u2013 given the 2Q CASM results and the 3Q guide, is there anything from a timing or maintenance perspective in 4Q that would prevent you from coming in significantly below your sub 2% long-term CASM goal this year?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Andrew. We are still \u2013 we haven\u2019t given any guidance on the fourth quarter. I would say that there isn\u2019t anything on the horizon in terms of maintenance that would cause us to deviate from that. I think we continue to run a great operation and manage through that. So, our goal is still to keep it below 2%. We are not going to give any forward guidance on 4Q.","Andrew Didora","Okay. And then I guess secondly, Paul, obviously, there has been a lot of movement in the bond market since the Brexit vote and the 10-year treasuries in your record lows. Are there any significant pension implications that could end up creating a bit of the CASM headwind over the next year or so or is it too small?","Paul Jacobson","Well, I think it\u2019s a little bit too soon to tell. Obviously, our balance sheet liability is impacted by rates. We have talked about that in the past. So, assuming rates don\u2019t revert back higher, we could see a higher balance sheet liability, but keep in mind that, that has little impact on expense and little impact \u2013 no impact at all on our minimum funding requirements for our strategy going forward, which is much longer term based.","Andrew Didora","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Glen, I wonder if you could playback for us what you were expecting to see with respect to the June quarter monthly. How that was different than what you expected to see and how that maybe is impacting your forecast here into the third quarter, because I thought the idea was peak demand July, August would sort of soak up those excess seats and fix the close-in yield problem, but now it sounds like we are dependent much more on September and maybe a return to corporate.","Glen Hauenstein","Yes. I think what we didn\u2019t expect in the beginning of the year was the continuation and acceleration of the declines in the business traffic sector. So, what we had anticipated is the strong demand leisure and that has borne out. The demand set for leisure is quite good and in line with our capacity offering, but it has not offset the close-in yield weakness that we have seen. And so that\u2019s how it played out and that leaves us with really no other choice, but to decrease the capacity levels moving forward, because we can\u2019t count on it to be as we have said in the earnings call, the stubbornly low close-in yields to go away. So, what we need to do now is not go into a month flat, because if we go into a month with flat RASM, we come out with a RASM that\u2019s in the minus 4, 5 range. So, we have to hit that up 3 to 4 to 5 as we come into the month knowing we are going to give away some of that yield within the month. So, that\u2019s kind of how it played out. And that\u2019s how we are looking toward September. Of course, when we planned the summer capacity that was back in the February\/March time period and while we are looking in a rearview mirror, it will be an incredibly profitable record summer for us. So, it\u2019s not as disastrous as some people are characterizing it, but it\u2019s really robust and we are going to take the necessary actions to fix it moving forward.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, could you give us maybe capacity growth by month? It looks like it\u2019s fairly similar right now in July, August, September. And then is there any implication for 2017 from that 1% year-to-year growth in the fourth quarter? Thanks for taking the questions.","Ed Bastian","Duane, we didn\u2019t give the monthly capacity. So we are not going to lay it out. But I think you can roughly estimate where we are at today as the July, August and then once capacity starts to take down as we get out this summer season, late August into September, the number start to inflect with the greater reductions. We haven\u2019t given 2017 guidance out. But again if you look at our Q4, up 1%, I would expect our Q1 probably to be in that same range. And certainly by the time we get through this planning for the spring, if conditions are the same, we are going to continue to take the same fact on capacity.","Duane Pfennigwerth","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Julie Yates from Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Glen, I just want to clarify on the PRASM cadence for the third quarter, you mentioned that July and August were looking weak and just to help calibrate expectations, should we expect to see July RASM worsen from June\u2019s down 5% and then improve steadily with September being the best month of the quarter?","Glen Hauenstein","I think that\u2019s probably exactly how you would read it.","Julie Yates","Okay, understood. And then just to reconcile, I mean domestic is now the worst performing entity and that\u2019s where capacity growth is still the highest, how do we get confidence on the level of sequential improvement we \u2013 that you need to see in order to write the PRASM trajectory to get to positive by year end?","Glen Hauenstein","Right. Well, I think that is also where on an absolute basis, we are decreasing our rate of growth the most. And so we are going to be coming down about 300 basis points to 350 basis points from where we are in peak summer versus international, which is going down about 100 basis points. So I think if we have to go further, we will, but this is the next step and seeing if we can get the numbers to where we need them to be to continue to expand our margin into next year.","Ed Bastian","And Julie, this is Ed. Just domestic is incredibly strong in aggregate. I realize the RASM numbers have been weak, but the bottom line results have been phenomenal. And the premium that we continue to generate versus the competition for domestic is about 1.20. So the team is doing a great job domestically. But we realize in order to get the RASM improvement to match the increasing fuel prices, we are going to be paying we need to be making the adjustments that Glen talked about.","Julie Yates","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane Becker","Hi, I just took some water, [indiscernible] I am okay. I just was wondering, could you update us on where you are with respect to aircraft retirements in the Pacific and how that affects capacity growth in that market for the back half of the year?","Ed Bastian","We still have six 747-400s that are flying in the Pacific that are off schedule to be retired by the year end of \u201817. We are trying to accelerate that closer to September. But that would likely in and of itself would have a negative bias on Pacific capacity and through the year and next year. It will also be a significant improvement to our P&L as we replace the aging airplanes with much more efficient equipment.","Helane Becker","Okay. And is that included in that system capacity guidance of down 1% that you are referring to in the comments today?","Ed Bastian","Well, I may have missed \u2013 you may have misinterpreted what I said. The last six don\u2019t come out until the fourth quarter of next year, not this year.","Helane Becker","Okay, got it, fourth quarter \u201817. And then on an unrelated topic, I am just wondering the tax rate was down, I think it was maybe guidance was 34% or somehow I thought it was going to be 34% and the actual was 33%, so is that \u2013 is there something special in there?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Helane. It\u2019s Paul. I hope you got your breath back there. We \u2013 during the quarter, we early adopted the set new FASB policy on stock compensation with a benefit to our tax rate for the quarter. But we still expect our full year tax rate to be 34%.","Helane Becker","Got it, okay. Thank you very much for your help.","Ed Bastian","Thank you, Helane.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Hunter Keay the Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Thank you very much. Good morning.","Ed Bastian","Good morning Hunter.","Hunter Keay","So Ed, I think the last year has proven out that investors probably care more about fundamental behavior from airlines rather than traditional business metrics like profit, for example, so as you think about \u2013 you have the long-term financial goals that you guys have laid out relating to ROIC, cash flow, debt and earnings growth, I am kind of curious why you still think earnings growth is a fact, you actually highlighted that and specifically in your prepared remarks, do your \u2013 the question is, do your investors tell you that that is something they still want, because it\u2019s certainly not something that other transport or industrial companies achieve or even strive for that\u2019s rated multiples that are much higher than airlines right now, so I guess the question is why is that one metric still included in the bunch?","Ed Bastian","I am not sure I follow entirely your question. Why are we focused on growing our earnings, is that your question?","Hunter Keay","Yes. I guess, well, let me put it in this way, 15% is a lot and inherent in that implies some degree of probable capacity growth to get there, so you think you talk about ROIC and debt and cash flow and people I think all appreciate that, but just like you guys will probably always be a value stock, so why focus on earnings growth, is that something you hear from your investors, is that something that\u2019s important?","Ed Bastian","Yes. We hear from our long-term investors that are continuing to improve all of our financial metrics whether it\u2019s our ROIC or our earnings potential, our top line growth are all important. We realize we sit in a volatile industry in a volatile space. But we are \u2013 our goal is to prove the sustainability and durability of the model. And we think earnings growth is important, yes.","Hunter Keay","Okay, alright. That\u2019s fine. And then Glen, you talked about corporate a little bit, we figured airlines talk about this issue of dilution as it relates to some of the closing price pressure I mean it\u2019s obviously, you said volumes are pretty good, so would you categorize dilution as sort of the biggest source of controllable factors contributing to some of the domestic PRASM weakness and if it\u2019s not that, what would you say it is?","Glen Hauenstein","I think we have talked about this before. It\u2019s more of the same. It\u2019s the way you are approaching the time value for time sensitive customers. And are you getting what people will be willing to pay for their time versus what the market was charging for the time. And if you look business barriers, as these quarters rollout with government, we can all look at it. But what I think you will see is that the business fares are well below where they have been historically. And in a lot of markets where there have been little capacity, even no capacity, even negative capacity changes over the medium term. So I hear your question. And I wish I had the best answer for why that is there. But I think like everything, it\u2019s a part of the cycle. I think it has to do with lower fuel. And I think as our fuel rolls through, everybody\u2019s P&Ls that there will be a lot more focus on that. But that\u2019s not \u2013 we are a small percentage in the industry. We represent less than 20% of the total industry. So we don\u2019t have that kind of power or predictions to be able to go out and say those things.","Hunter Keay","Okay, thank you.","Ed Bastian","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Hi, good morning everybody.","Ed Bastian","Hi, Jamie.","Jamie Baker","Glen, other revenue declined slightly from the first quarter, which seems a bit inconsistent with seasonality, I know there\u2019s stuff in that category other than ancillary revenue, I am just wondering what the moving pieces were that drove the decline especially since as you noted, Comfort+ turned on in the month of May?","Paul Jacobson","Hi, good morning, Jamie. It\u2019s Paul. One of the big items in that was lower year-over-year third-party sales from the refinery, so there is a piece of that, that has to flow through gross up revenues and net it out of expense. So with the lower crude oil prices, the product values are substantially down. So that was about $65 million of that number.","Jamie Baker","Okay, that makes perfectly good sense. Second, if we exclude the hedge impact in the second quarter, you essentially achieved 21% operating margin and you are guiding 19% to 21% for the fourth quarter, I would have to go back, I think it\u2019s 8 years now to find a time when third quarter margins were softer, potentially softer than in the second quarter. And look, I am not asking you to rehash the components of the guide, the currency disclosures were certainly helpful, but it seems puzzling to me that against an industry backdrop that is so much better today than in 2008, you aren\u2019t even able to achieve normal seasonality, is this just a blip or potentially a new normal in how we think about sort of the seasonal marginal \u2013 margin peaks?","Glen Hauenstein","Jamie, you asked a lot in that question and I have not gone back to check to 2008. 2008 to me is a blur going back in time. Listen, our guide is our best estimate to where we sit now. We do not think that we are at a \u2013 trying to forecast any type of inflection on the cycle or the margins if that\u2019s your question. It\u2019s really where we are. Fuel prices have bounced around a fair bit and fuel prices are up a bit in Q3 versus Q2, hedge aside. And we realized that we do have unit revenue weakness, particularly in the first half of Q3 that we are recognizing. So, I think that if you look at Q3 year-on-year, I think we are about flat, 20% pre-tax margin and I think that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s about all I can draw from that.","Jamie Baker","So nothing structural to suggest that in the long run you would not continue to be a third quarter airline so to speak, third quarter representing the absolute peak of the year?","Ed Bastian","Yes, I think the third quarter is the peak of the year. Candidly, it\u2019s this June, July and August, right? So, that continues to be our \u2013 that\u2019s our sweet spot.","Jamie Baker","Yes, okay. I appreciate the disclosures. Thanks, everybody.","Ed Bastian","Sure.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins","Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. When we speak specifically about the capacity actions that you are taking both those announced in May and those announced this morning, can you quantify specifically how those actions will impact PRASM? Can you sort of bracket that in terms of impacts?","Ed Bastian","It will improve RASM. How is that?","Jack Atkins","Okay. So, I guess when you think about your desire to get to positive RASM by year end, will you be willing to go to negative capacity growth year-over-year to get to that level?","Ed Bastian","No, that\u2019s not our plan.","Jack Atkins","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Ed, Glen, you both mentioned that you think fuel is the biggest driver of higher RASM on a perspective basis. And I guess I was just wondering how you come to that conclusion? Do you mean to imply that this move from the kind of $27 or so rent that we saw for a short period in January up to 46, 47 today is likely to have driven a negative profit contribution from some flying in the network, Delta or your peers and that\u2019s likely to drive a capacity reduction? I mean, is that kind of the thought process?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, if you look historically the trends that follow and we started with fuel around 100. We get all the way down to about 25 to 27. And then now we have been moving back up into the mid to high 40s. It\u2019s very, very high R-squared to go back and look at airline revenues with fuel over time and the lag time that produces the highest R-squared is about 9 months. So, that\u2019s over a very, very long period of time within the industry. And I think that\u2019s what we are counting on as that on the margin when fuel was $25 there were players who were pricing their products at the incremental marginal cost of $25 fuel. That marginal cost of production has gone up substantially since the low point. And normally, it would take about 9 months for that to flow through to airline revenues.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay and thanks for that. And then I guess just maybe to follow-up just on Hunter\u2019s question a little bit. With regards to the close-in yield weakness that we have seen, I guess I would have thought that by this point, assuming that problem isn\u2019t actually getting worse and maybe it is. But I guess I would have thought that at this point, the RM systems would be sort of calibrated and thus holding on \u2013 sorry that\u2019s not holding on to as much inventory for sort of late in the booking curve bookings. Is that not the case?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, late in the booking curve bookings even though their depressed are significantly higher than early in the booking curve bookings. So, you never want to turn out late in the booking curve booking away even though they are depressed on a relative basis.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. I mean I guess, I just it seems like \u2013 at least it seems like in some cases, some of these fares that are being offered very closed in are actually lower than what you can buy in it \u2013 for an advance, I mean obviously I have seen some of that myself and heard about it anecdotally and just wonder if there was any progress being made towards cleaning some of that up?","Glen Hauenstein","Yes, we can\u2019t comment on forward pricing. But generally close-in yields are significantly higher than long AP yields. And so that hasn\u2019t changed.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay, thank you.","Glen Hauenstein","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi","Hey, thank you. Glen, the flat PRASM or positive PRASM, is that being for fourth or the month of December? And then secondly, it sounds like the capacity actions you are taking today are entirely or exclusively focused on the UK and Brexit. If you are seeing weaker close-in yields domestically and softer corporate traffic domestically, why isn\u2019t domestic capacity coming down?","Ed Bastian","No, I think you misread that. Domestic capacity is coming down significantly. We are decreasing our domestic offering in the fourth quarter versus the current quarter by about 300 basis points, so a very significant decrease in domestic capacity coming from us.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then the RASM goal is that flat for the month of December or positive for December or is it for the full quarter?","Paul Jacobson","Yes, that\u2019s our goal, Joe. Our goal has been to try to get there by the end of the year. And when we get there, we will let you know.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. Does that year mean December or the fourth quarter? ","Paul Jacobson","We will take either.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then Paul, next year, a year when we should expect maybe a bigger step up in the FX agreement. Is there some sort of contractual amendment that\u2019s coming next year, any color there?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Joe. There is no amendment. As we announced in the Investor Day, we talked about it a couple year period from the overlap with the prior year agreement and then the new agreement beginning in 2017. So, we have talked about having some additional benefits occurring in 2017 going forward. We will have more of that probably at Investor Day.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Hey, good morning. Paul, if I may ask. Your \u2013 the core cost performance, I think if you adjust for kind of the labor increased pressures. It\u2019s been quite impressive and I am guessing FX is going to benefit about maybe 0.5 point. But could you talk a little bit more about what\u2019s driving the kind of \u2013 and I am curious, I mean this is the kind of basis that kind of the declines that we are seeing in contract carrier maintenance, I think landing pack services. I am just trying to get an understanding of \u2013 does that continue in the second half in 2017 or how should we think about these offsets that you have been driving?","Paul Jacobson","Sure. Good morning, Savy and thanks for those comments. The biggest driver of our cost performance has obviously been the continued upgauging and efficiency being created in the business through that. As we have talked about in the past, our upgauging has been accruing at about a rate of about 5% a year from 2012 through 2015. And we have, with our current fleet plans about a 7% upgrade \u2013 upgauge between 2016 and 2020. So clearly, that has had a material benefit on our ability to drive cost efficiencies in the business. That combined with the innovation of Gill\u2019s team and others across the operational sphere have been a huge, huge benefit for us going forward. And we\u2019 have got to continue to find ways to drive productivity in the business without impacting and in fact, enhancing the customer and employee experience, which I think the team has done a great job of.","Savi Syth","Alright, thanks for that. And then a follow-up question. And Glen, I hate to beat a dead horse on this, but I was just I am trying to understand on the close-in yields. If it deteriorated as you went through the quarter and the reason I ask that is, with the comment on leisure yields transcend. I thought it was kind of those lower fares that are putting pressure then on close-in yields and it\u2019s kind of the lowest fares and leisure fares strength and I am kind of surprised that we are not seeing at least no further deterioration in those close-in yields and so I am wondering is this maybe sort of actual weakness in corporate that we are seeing?","Glen Hauenstein","So, I think there are a couple of things that we just did a poll survey and maybe I will let Steve talk to that. Steve, you want to pipe in on.","Steve Sear","Yes. Our June corporate survey actually had an uptick year-over-year, but basically stable outlook on all of our top corporate accounts. So we see it really relatively flat demand throughout the entire year so far. So again, we see a little bit on that yield pressure.","Glen Hauenstein","And so that would say that the real component is that we have flattish corporate demand. We have corporate yields down on the five to seven category. And we have capacity that\u2019s growing in excess at the rate of growth of the corporate demand set, which is also putting downward pressure on the total RASM. And those are kind of the three components we see.","Savi Syth","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And just one clarification on the earnings growth over time, you are talking about EPS growth right and not necessarily just earnings?","Glen Hauenstein","We are telling EPS growth, that\u2019s right Savi.","Savi Syth","Alright. Thank you.","Glen Hauenstein","Thank you.","Jill Sullivan Greer","And we are going to have time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Dan McKinsey from Buckingham Research.","Dan McKinsey","Okay. Good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Glen, how is Delta getting to less capacity exactly from the reduced Atlantic flying, is it less capacity with the same number of planes, is it flying being redeployed to other markets as an optimization move or are some planes potentially being early retired here?","Glen Hauenstein","It\u2019s a little bit of all of the above. If you look at our fleet counts for summer of this year versus summer of last year, it is almost flat. I think based on about 1,500 flying airplanes, we were up about eight. So the increased capacity has been coming on the marginal utilization because of lower fuel and what we are seeing is we are not getting paid for that, so that\u2019s coming out. And we will be doing a lot of \u2013 more cancellations in the off-peak, more cancellations in the ad-hoc world, as well as gauge reductions. And may be we haven\u2019t committed to it yet but some markets will not make it through.","Dan McKinsey","Understood. Okay. And then Glen, in May, you talked about seeing some green shoots in the Latin America region and since then we have had a huge move in FX particularly to Brazil and just given what\u2019s happening with capacity and foreign exchange to the country and to the region, I am wondering if you can collaborate a little bit more in the revenue roadmap from here in this entity. And then tied to that, is there a revenue benefit potentially from Aeromexico that could be incremental in the back half of the year?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, I think we have mentioned in the prepared remarks that the Latin unit revenues were up in the month of June for the first time in 26 months. So those green shoots that we saw last quarter are actually coming in and again being driven by strength in Mexico and a lot of that strength may be related to the presence of Delta and Aeromexico together because it seems that we are getting a much higher share of some of the corporate travel to and from Mexico. And we have had historically even before our ATI enabled joint venture goes into place. And Peter Carter is sitting next to me, may be Peter can talk about the timing of when we believe Aeromexico will be approved.","Peter Carter","Yes. Good morning, Dan. We expect it to be approved in the fourth quarter.","Dan McKinsey","Understood. Thanks. And then just one final housecleaning Paul, has Delta been active in buying back stocks since June 30?","Paul Jacobson","Dan, good morning, we \u2013 as we talked about before, we are in the market every day, buying back stock. And this quarter is no different.","Dan McKinsey","Thanks for the time guys.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks, Dan.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Let\u2019s now wrap up the analyst portion of the call. And I will now turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Shinkle","Good morning. This is Kevin Shinkle. Welcome to the media portion of the call. We will have about 10 minutes for questions. So please limit yourself to one question and one brief follow-up. Kyle, will you please provide the instructions on how to register and ask the question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Jeffrey Dastin with Reuters.","Jeffrey Dastin","Thank you for taking the question. Might you breakdown why Trans-Atlantic flights will have one of their most profitable summers in history, is it countries and with which countries and which point of origin, leisure was corporate bookings, that sort of thing?","Ed Bastian","We don\u2019t provide that level of detail, Jeffrey. Trans-Atlantic for us historically has been a strong source of profit. And as we have expanded to the UK with our Virgin relationship, we have just built on that.","Jeffrey Dastin","Great. Thank you. And then the follow-up will be, how do forward bookings to the United Kingdom for the fourth quarter compare to how they were last year as in were bookings are faster in the capacity tweaks not just the currency?","Ed Bastian","The currency certainly has impacted the booking point of sale. And we have seen some strength in the U.S. point of sale to the UK as the talent has deteriorated. Likewise, we have seen some reduction in our UK point of sale coming to the U.S. And that\u2019s why we are making certain of the capacity adjustments combined with overall high levels of capacity in the North Atlantic, which is putting pressure on yields even before Brexit.","Jeffrey Dastin","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News.","Michael Sasso","Hey, good morning. I am just a little confused about the issue with close-in bookings, it sounds like demand is still okay, but that maybe some of the problem is too much capacity, is that what I am hearing, can you just explain what specifically is causing those close-in yields to be lower?","Ed Bastian","Well, industry pricing is lower year-over-year and that\u2019s probably the main driver of it. But when you have capacity growth and you have stable demand, that\u2019s also a negative impact to the total composition of your unit revenues, because corporate travel is of course the highest yielding piece of our yield curve. So it\u2019s a combination of too much capacity and too low fares.","Glen Hauenstein","Next question.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Koenig with The Associated Press.","David Koenig","Hi, I thought you might touch on this in the last answer in the analyst session, but should we expect you to drop any routes or markets entirely as part of your reduced planned capacity \u2013 hello?","Ed Bastian","Hello, we don\u2019t comment on future scheduled changes or future pricing initiatives as a general...","David Koenig","Okay. Yes. I am not asking you to name the routes or markets, I am just wondering if that\u2019s something we should expect as a possibility?","Ed Bastian","We evaluate them all the time and we add routes and delete routes from our network on a regular basis. So the answer is that we will adjust to market conditions as we see them evolve.","David Koenig","Okay, thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Kelly Yamanouchi with Atlanta Journal Constitution.","Kelly Yamanouchi","Hi there. I am wondering about the UK origin leisure markets that you mentioned the capacity cuts will be targeted at, I was just wondering what kinds of markets are UK origin leisure markets?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, clearly London has \u2013 is the biggest market in the UK. But London has a very, very high business component. As a matter of fact, London represents about 35% of the total business to and from the U.S. between U.S. and Europe. So what we are doing is we are taking potentially down frequencies in off peak days. We are down-gauging equipment into the regional cities. Manchester tends to be a perfect example of much higher UK point of origin market and that one because there is a lot of leisure travel coming out of Manchester. And those would be the types of markets that we would look at to reduce.","Ed Bastian","Kelly, this is Ed. We have grown substantially in the UK in the last several years, both we and our partner Virgin Atlantic. So I wouldn\u2019t be focused on it. This is more trimming from the overall growth. You have to look at this over a longer time horizon. And our capacity is up substantially to the UK over any period of time. So I think this is a normal part of the ebb and flow of supply and demand.","Kelly Yamanouchi","Alright, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ted Reed from The Street.","Ted Reed","A Brexit question, my impression from what you said was that more Americans are going to UK in the summer. And so there is good \u2013 very good summer travel, but in the winter, the UK travel to the U.S., the U.S. leisure destinations is what\u2019s declining. Is that fair?","Ed Bastian","That\u2019s our best estimate, Ted, yes.","Ted Reed","When you say leisure destination, does that mean Florida for the UK people coming in the winter, is that Florida?","Ed Bastian","Florida, Vegas, just broadly New York.","Ted Reed","Okay, alright. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Edward Russell with Flight Global.","Edward Russell","Hi, yes. On the UK cuts, I was wondering are those going to be seasonal just during the winter and the off-peak periods or are they intended to be permanent cuts?","Ed Bastian","They are just seasonal.","Edward Russell","Okay. And then second question, what does this mean for the new routes that you have announced for 2017 into the UK, Portland, additional frequencies from Detroit and Atlanta?","Paul Jacobson","There is no changes.","Edward Russell","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Linda Loyd with the Philadelphia Inquirer.","Linda Loyd","Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. With the Trainer refinery posting a loss for the second quarter, $10 million loss in the latest quarter and a $28 million loss in the first quarter, is the refinery still a benefit to Delta, are you still glad you bought it?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Linda. This is Paul Jacobson. Yes, the answer is absolutely. The Trainer refinery for us has been a huge success. And as we talked about the lower crack spread environment that exists for the entire refining complex is a tremendous benefit to the airline. So, as part of the integrated fuel management strategy, we are absolutely still very pleased with that purchase and that investment.","Linda Loyd","Is there a time you envisioned the refinery becoming profitable again as you look out in future quarters or this year?","Paul Jacobson","Well, I mean, certainly we have had profitable years with the refinery and that business is very cyclical. We certainly hope it doesn\u2019t come at the expense of significantly higher fuel for the airline. But you have got to remember that its part of that integrated strategy and we know we will have good times and bad times with that refinery, but we are absolutely committed to it despite \u2013 or irrespective of its profits.","Ed Bastian","Yes, Linda, this is Ed. Let me be very clear. We are very happy with the refinery. They are doing a great job. And yes, we expect they will continue to generate profits as they have historically for Delta over time.","Linda Loyd","Okay, thank you very much.","Kevin Shinkle","Kyle, we have time for one last question.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Elliott Blackburn with Argus Media.","Elliott Blackburn","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just building off that last question. Can you kind of go through, I mean, considering the fact that the refinery will be adding to your fuel costs it sounds like for the rest of the year. What does success look like more broadly for that refinery? How do you guys valuate that refinery as a contributor?","Paul Jacobson","Well, Elliott, the main purpose of buying that refinery as articulated in our \u2013 all of our commentary has been to still supply jet fuel and increase the supply of jet fuel, which we have done very successfully. We measured the success of that refinery based on how well it operates and the team that we have there has been performing extraordinarily well. From a cost basis, from an operational reliability cost basis, the refinery leads all comparable indices both in size and geography for its efficiency and its productivity. The absolute crack spreads and the economics of that, you have got to take into account the airline. And when crack spreads are down that puts pressure on refinery profits, but it\u2019s a huge windfall for the airline as well. So, we feel very good about that. And as long as it continues to operate the way it is, we view it as strongly successful.","Elliott Blackburn","But it seems like your peers that are also buying jet fuel benefit from that without actually having the risk of operating a refinery. So, I guess can you help me understand why the refinery itself is a unique benefit to Delta in light of that?","Paul Jacobson","Well, the fact that it may or may not be a benefit to our customers doesn\u2019t have any \u2013 or our competitors, doesn\u2019t have any bearing as to whether or not we view it as a success for Delta and we do things that are good for us and the refinery is a great example of that.","Ed Bastian","Don\u2019t forget, this was a refinery that was closed. And when we reopened it, we added 40% more supply, the jet fuel into the New York harbor. That alone was a substantial benefit for Delta. And to the extent it benefits our colleagues and industry all the better.","Elliott Blackburn","Thank you very much.","Operator","And that does conclude our Q&A session. I would now like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Ed Bastian","With that said, that concludes everything. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","And this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"7265":["Delta Air Lines, Inc.

My name is Lisa, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our September quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. The entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session.","Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta's financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted and you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.","Edward Bastian","Well, thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Earlier, we reported a $1.6 billion pretax profit in the September quarter and earnings per share of $1.80, which was at the high-end of our initial guidance. Our EPS was up 16% over last year driven by strong revenue momentum, tax reform benefits, and a 4% lower share count.","Demand for the Delta product has never been greater. Our revenues grew 8% to nearly $12 billion, a record level for the Company and now we expect to achieve 8% topline growth for the full-year. We have seen continued success in addressing fuel cost increases and offset roughly 85% of the $655 million impact of fuel cost for the quarter. Our speed in recovering these costs has never been better and gives us confidence that we can fully recapture fuel costs at these levels as we head into 2019 and start to grow our margins once more.","I'd like to thank the Delta people for running the best airline operation and continuing to raise the bar. We've now had 100 days without a single cancellation across the entire Delta system, both Delta Mainline and Delta Connection, already exceeding 2017's full-year record of 90 days. I'd also like to thank the team for the incredible job they've done with the difficult and challenging conditions of Hurricane Michael. We've had less than 100 cancellations over the last two days with minimal financial impact. We are the last operator out of the Gulf Coast stations and we\u2019re the first carrier to return to these stations today.","Our customers depend on Delta and we put our customers' needs and interests first. That's the Delta difference. This unprecedented level of reliability combined with great service from our team that is driving our customer satisfaction scores to new heights.","Our domestic net promoter score has averaged 44% this year, which is up three points over the prior year. This is the reason why our revenue per premium is at record levels and sustainable. In recognition of our employees' outstanding performance, we've added another $395 million toward next February's profit sharing payout. This is in addition to awarding a 3% base increase, which was effective October 1, for ground employees and flight attendants.","Later this month, we'll celebrate the 10th anniversary of our merger with Northwest, which was the beginning of the campaign to become the very best airline in the world for our employees, owners, and the customers and communities that we serve. In those 10 years, we've led an unprecedented transformation at Delta and our industry. We are financially stronger and able to withstand industry cycles like never before.","We have increased our global reach to 52 countries with an innovative strategy that includes over $2 billion in equity ownership of our airline partners. Through our commercial efforts, we have taken Delta from mid-teens NPS and a revenue deficit to the industry to a carrier with leading customer satisfaction and a sustainable revenue premium.","And through it all, we've shared that success with our people and at the same time, achieved an investment-grade rating and returned nearly $12 billion to our owners through dividends and share repurchases. Despite three significant upward moves in fuel this year, driving more than $2 billion of higher fuel expense, we still expect to deliver our fourth consecutive year of pretax profits over $5 billion.","This demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and the speed with which we are able to react to changing economic conditions. Even with oil now hovering above $80 per barrel, we are confident that we have the momentum to return to margin expansion in 2019.","We are never satisfied. We continue to set ambitious goals to improve the business and expand our profitability. We believe that Delta will sustain solid profits, margins, and cash flows throughout the business cycle. While still in the planning stages for 2019, we expect domestic capacity growth next year will decelerate by at least a point, partially offset by additional long-haul flying as we leverage our Korean joint venture.","At a system level, we are building a plan for growth next year in the 3% range, which represents seat growth of about 2%, which is below expected GDP output and a point from greater stage length. While this is our current assumption, we'll be monitoring fuel and our ability to recapture these higher price points to ensure that 2019 is a year of margin growth. That is our top financial priority and is a business imperative. We'll be ready to act if we see sustained higher fuel prices or economic uncertainty impacting our return to margin expansion.","In closing, we remain on track to deliver a very strong 2018. A $5 billion profit year, which is very similar to last year's results despite covering a $2 billion fuel cost increase. Our brand has never been healthier and the service from our team never greater.","As we look forward to 2019, we are confident in our ability to drive long-term value for our owners through topline growth, margin expansion, and prudent deployment of our capital. I look forward to sharing more details on our strategic outlook and 2019 business plan at our upcoming Investor Day in December as we lay the foundation for another decade of success.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glen and Paul to go through the fine details of the quarter.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking the Delta team for delivering another record revenue quarter. The revenue environment is strong with solid demand in both leisure and business and a healthy yield environment. We had our busiest summer ever as record numbers of customers chose Delta for our industry-leading service and reliability. This generated record revenues of nearly $12 billion in the quarter, up 8% over last year.","As a result, unit revenues grew by 4.3% as foreign exchange benefit of approximately one-half point was offset by the impact of Hurricane Florence. Storms are normally RASM accretive because flight cancellations drive ASM reductions. However, our in-house meteorology team and our OCC did a great job predicting the storm's path would avoid Atlanta and we were able to limit flight cancellations for our customers. We are maintaining our revenue momentum delivering a consistent mid-single digit unit revenue growth on a year-over-year and year-over-two-year basis despite much more challenging comps.","Importantly, the rate of fuel recapture has sequentially improved each quarter this year and we are sustaining record revenue premium of 110% or higher to the industry. This speaks to the strength of the Delta brand and the quality of our services as our increases in both stage length and gauge significantly outpaced the industry in the quarter.","We continue to grow the proportion of more stable and more profitable revenue, which is growing at a pace faster than ticket prices. Cargo, loyalty program, and MRO revenue were up double digits for the third consecutive quarter. This revenue momentum combined with better cost performance positions Delta to be among the first in the industry to expand margins despite the significant fuel price increases.","Corporate travel is a major part of this momentum. Our total corporate revenues grew 12% for the quarter on close-in booking strength and business yield improvements. September finished as our strongest month of fare recovery this year and for the quarter; we have now recovered nearly 40% of decline since 2014 with fares now back above the 2016 levels. September was the sixth consecutive month with month-over-month improvements in corporate fare growth, evidence that we are seeing acceleration in the corporate fare environment.","And our most recent survey, 90% of travel managers expect to maintain or increase their travel spend into 2019 giving us continued optimism that this positive momentum will continue. Domestic revenues grew 9% on 3% higher unit revenues driven by improved yields. The pace of improvement picked up in August and September driving the best quarter of domestic PRASM growth since the third quarter of 2014.","Our core hubs of Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Detroit delivered among the strongest performances. Domestic unit revenue growth improved sequentially by more than one point despite the headwind from travel avoidance in the Southeast as Hurricane Florence approached.","Looking forward, we see the continued momentum in close-in yields in the entity. Internationally, we saw improving trends with revenues up more than 6% on a 5% increase in unit revenues led by strong demand and robust revenue growth in our premium products.","Our foreign exchange benefit stepped down from the June quarter as the dollar strengthened and we expect it to become a roughly 0.5 point headwind in the fourth quarter. Transatlantic unit revenues increased 8% driven by yield improvement and strong demand environment. Joint venture synergies and strong premium seat performance drove improvements above and beyond a 1.5 point FX benefit.","In Latin, after eighth consecutive quarters of positive unit revenue, PRASM was down 3% driven by currency headwinds and political instability. We are making necessary adjustments by de-emphasizing capacities in weak markets to offset headwinds and return to unit revenue growth by early next year.","In the Pacific, our unit revenues increased 5%. This is impressive performance given that our network changes drove an 11% increase in stage length. Japan and Korea, both produced double-digit RASM growth and our China routes delivered a 9% RASM improvement on an 18% increase in capacity.","Delta's superior serviced and unmatched reliability drives our expectations for topline revenue growth of 8% in the December quarter on 3% to 5% unit revenue growth and 4% increase in capacity. While our full-year seat growth expected to be below GDP at 2.8% on flight departures, completion factor and stage length are expected to result in our full-year ASMs slightly ahead of our 3% guidance.","The revenue environment is the best we've seen in years and the Delta brand has never been stronger. We believe we are seeing the strong commercial momentum needed to fully offset fuel prices at current levels. Longer-term we are using our network, our brand and customer experience, and segmentation initiatives to drive revenue growth and margin expansion.","First on network, we are leveraging our domestic footprint and expanding our global capabilities. Our fleet evolution is focused on getting the right aircraft on the right routes. This will allow us to improve the customer experience, grow premium products while also benefiting our cost structure.","Over the next five years, we expect our share of domestic seat departures in the most efficient narrowbody aircraft category will grow to 45%. No carrier has as much opportunity to benefit from upgauging as Delta over the next 5 years to 10 years.","Internationally, the most significant change taking place is in the Pacific. In 2013 we laid out a vision of transforming our Pacific network. Since then, we have rationalized our footprint in Tokyo and Narita, developed U.S. gateways to the Pacific, replaced our 747 fleet with more efficient A350s, and enhanced our Transpacific alliances.","With the building blocks now in place, we are seeing the expected improvements in profitability. Premium cabin performance has strengthened as our product has improved. With now 10 A350 aircraft deployed in the Pacific, we are encouraged by the revenue trends in our new Delta One suites and Premium Select cabins.","Our joint venture with Korean is progressing well. Connecting traffic to Korea and beyond has more than doubled as we are building the best connecting complex in the Pacific. We will leverage this with our growth in the region next year.","Second is strengthening our brand and improving customer experience. The quality of our product, service, and operational reliability combined with the breadth of our network drives higher customer loyalty and strengthens the Delta brand.","Our commercial innovation has allowed us to deliver a differentiated high quality customer experience. This has resulted in more than a 20 point improvement in domestic net promoter score since the merger. This increasing customer affinity is reflected in record acquisitions of our co-brand American Express card, which is seeing double-digit; spend increases outpacing the U.S. card industry.","Our loyalty program revenue has nearly tripled since the merger as more customers than ever see increasing value from using their SkyMiles American Express card. And finally, we are enabling customer choice through our segmentation initiatives. We are offering our customers more choices in best-in-class products that are increasingly easier to buy across all channels.","We want all of our customers to be able to purchase Delta product how they want, when they want, and where they want. Premium product revenues grew 19% on a 3% increase in premium seats as upsell revenue continues to be a source of strength. We are excited to rollout additional functionality to allow post purchase mileage upgrades later this year.","Our success in selling branded products, growing our premium seats, and enhancing future functionality gives us confidence that branded fares will deliver sustained contribution to improve revenue generation.","In closing, it's been an incredibly eventful 10 years at Delta since the merger. Everyday, we think how we can make Delta better. We are giving our customers a high quality experience that they value and we will pay a premium for, improving that through innovation and service and continue to differentiate and expand on our commercial successes.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Paul.","Paul Jacobson","Thank you, Glen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I am pleased to say that the September quarter marked an important inflection point in our non-fuel cost trajectory. While non-fuel costs in the first half of the year were slightly higher than we expected, non-fuel unit costs were flat for the September quarter. This is a three point improvement from the June quarter and keeps us on track to deliver on our full-year guidance of 1% to 2% non-fuel unit cost growth.","As we outlined at our Investor Day last December, getting our unit costs back in check has been a huge focus for the Company this year and I want to thank the entire Delta team for all the work it's taken to get here. In the December quarter, we expect our non-fuel CASM to be slightly better at flat to down 1%. As anticipated, overhead pressures such as depreciation have begun to moderate in the second half of 2018 and we've seen productivity benefits from our fleet changes and our One Delta initiatives.","Our fleet transformation is still in the middle innings and will continue into the mid-2020s. As Glen mentioned, no carrier has as much opportunity to benefit from upgauging as Delta over the next five to 10 years. Airbus A320 deliveries start this quarter with entry into service in early 2019, primarily replacing high cost 50-seat regional jets, the aircraft least preferred by our customers.","A321 and Boeing 737-900s are replacing the MD-88 fleet through 2020, providing a nearly 15% improvement in seat cost, while also upgauging the fleet with a much better product for our customers. Then beginning in 2020, we start the next phase in our journey as we replace our older narrowbodies with larger new engine technology A321s resulting in even greater efficiencies than the classics. Our One Delta initiative is founded on the idea that better cross-company collaboration drives better cost efficiency.","It has been exciting to see the organization embrace this mindset as many of our large initiatives gain steam. One of our more substantial long-term opportunities is our network optimization initiative. This quarter, we opened a cross-divisional Schedule Coordination Center to provide a more holistic approach to our scheduling providing benefits to customers and employees while driving $300 million in annual run rate savings.","Our business units are executing well and achieved lower non-fuel CASM versus prior year helping to offset nearly a point of overhead pressure from fleet and facility investments. That cost discipline along with the incremental efficiency gains from re-fleeting and One Delta give us confidence in our ability to keep our non-fuel unit costs below 2% next year and beyond. Remaining disciplined with our unit cost is even more important to margin expansion given the recent volatility in fuel.","Our September quarter fuel expense increased by $655 million on 30% higher market fuel prices. We offset a portion of this through improved fuel efficiency from our new fleet and our One Delta initiative that reduced APU usage by 15%. While market fuel prices took a pause through mid-August, there's been a run up since then with prices testing new four-year highs.","For the December quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to increase approximately 30% over last year to $2.47 to $2.52 per gallon. Remember this includes a $0.05 headwind from the refinery due to the scheduled maintenance turnaround, which is progressing well and is on schedule to restart in mid-November. We currently forecast December quarter earnings per share of $1.10 to $1.30 per share, which keeps us on pace to achieve our full-year earnings guidance despite the latest increase in fuel.","This equates to a December quarter pretax margin in the range of 9% to 11%, consistent with last year's result of 9.8%. This is despite continued pressure from higher fuel costs on our own earnings as well as the earnings of our airline partners, Aeromexico and Virgin Atlantic, of which we recognize 49% through non-operating expense.","While 2018 has been challenged with over $2 billion of higher fuel expense, our belief in our ability to drive a fourth consecutive year of pretax earnings of over $5 billion speaks to the resilience of our business and the consistency of our performance.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we generated $1.5 billion of operating cash flow for the quarter, allowing for reinvestment in the business through $865 million in CapEx with nearly $600 million related to aircraft and aircraft modifications.","Our full-year CapEx is expected to be $4.9 billion. This is up from our prior guidance, reflecting our recent decision to purchase and finance $600 million of aircraft that were previously slated for operating leases. While our decision to finance the aircraft differently reduces short-term free cash flow generation, net cash flow will be improved as we will finance the aircraft at a substantially lower cost than the lease rates we've been seeing in the market. We remain committed to returning over $2 billion to our owners in 2018.","In the quarter, we generated $655 million of free cash flow and return $325 million in share repurchases and $241 million in dividends to shareholders. With consistent returns to shareholders over the past five years, we've reduced our fully diluted share count by 20% and returned nearly $12 billion through both dividends and share buybacks, with our current dividend yield of approximately 2.8%.","Over the same time period, we've also reduced our adjusted net debt by $700 million and our pension liability by an astounding $4.6 million at current market rates, dramatically improving the health of our balance sheet. Achieving this level of cash return and the balance sheet strength in just five years is another sign of how different our business is from the past.","Last month S&P reaffirmed Delta's investment grade credit rating, underlining the financial strength of the Company. An investment grade rating gives us better access to capital markets and the flexibility and the agility to better manage our business over time.","In closing, we delivered solid earnings for the quarter through revenue momentum and bending of the cost curve. Looking into 2019, I'm excited to continue this momentum as we drive the business back to margin expansion.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A.","Jill Greer","Thanks Paul. Before we go to Q&A, I'll just have everybody take a minute and mark your calendars as we will return to New York this year for our Investor Day on December 13. So more details we'll go out closer to that date, but in the meantime, hold that date for us.","So Lisa, if you could now give the instructions to the analysts for the Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thanks. So, really appreciate the breakout on passenger revenues that you provided in the release. It looks like your business in premium products drove about 70% of your passenger revenue growth in the third quarter. I wondered if you could just break out what's included in that and maybe not a criticism of Delta, but given that all the action is coming from premium, why does the industry spends so much time talking about basic economy. Thanks.","Edward Bastian","Well, Duane, I think we've been pretty articulate about why we put basic economy in the marketplace years ago as the industry was being commoditized at the low-end and we didn't really have a product that competed on a like-for-like basis with Spirit or Frontier.","I think that was a necessary thing we needed to put in the marketplace and as many people have written, ours was the most humane of all of those as we didn't try to charge for overhead baggage. But really for the commoditized sector, we had something that was well above what they were competing in the OTAs and in the low-end spectrum.","And that's when we also started to think about well, what did people want to buy from us that we weren't supplying and that's where we devised these superior products and services and brought them to market. And I think when \u2013 what we get really excited about is we still believe we're in the early innings on this. They are still not as easy as they need to be to buy; they're still not available in all channels with all forms of currency. And over the next years not only will we be expanding those products and services, but we'll make them be easier to buy for our customers and we think that will continue to fuel growth in those sectors.","Jill Greer","And Duane, the breakdown is fairly simple. It follows the cabin flown.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Sorry, I didn't understand that, Jill. Sorry.","Jill Greer","If you flew \u2013 if the customer travels in Delta One First Class, Delta Premium Select, or Comfort+, then it will be in that business cabin and premium product line.","Duane Pfennigwerth","That's great. I mean 19% growth on 3% seats so mid-teens RASM growth. That's great that you broke that out. And then Glen, wonder if you could just \u2013 sorry if I missed it, but do you expect domestic unit revenue growth to accelerate into the 4Q? How do we think about the relative regional growth into the December quarter? Thanks for taking the questions.","Glen Hauenstein","Yes. We're pretty excited about the current trends in domestic. December is going to be a bit of a challenge because we have a very long period this year between Thanksgiving and Christmas, but we're certain that will become a business period as we get closer to it. But the core trends on business demand and the yields on business demand are in a very good place as we exit this year and head into 2019.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","James Baker","Hey, good morning everybody. First question for Ed, you talked about the industry's ability to recoup higher fuel as never having been faster. I agree with that, but I'm curious as to what you think the driver is. Is it simply that the industry is largely unhedged? Have there been shifts in the booking curve? Are your systems simply better able to articulate schedule changes close?","And the reason I ask is that I wonder if it could ever happen faster than say I don't know five or six months. I mean the reason FedEx trade six turns higher than you is that they recoup fuel practically in real time. So, obviously any further progress you or the industry can make should only further bolster your multiple, any thoughts on that?","Edward Bastian","Sure, Jamie. Obviously FedEx has the ability to surcharge for fuel, which we do not. So, that's a fundamental difference and we've talked about that in the past, whether that ever becomes an opportunity, I don't know, but that's a regulatory issue not an industry-specific matter that we can control ourselves.","I think it's a little bit of everything you mentioned. I'm not \u2013 I don't know what the other airlines are going to report this quarter in terms of their pace of recapture relative to the improvement at Delta, I can tell you it's a number of things. Certainly the health of the business in terms of the brand and service reliability is strong and it gives us the pricing platform.","You can only price where you have demand for your product and we have greater demand than ever at Delta. We had our busiest travel quarter in our history and that certainly has given us an ability to make sure we can cover the cost of fuel.","I think part of it is the work we've done on the non-fuel side to be able to have zero non-fuel cost growth in productivity, the benefits of upgauging are meaningful, and that certainly helped us real time in terms of that recapture. Technology certainly is a point, the focus on premium product and business travel. Our corporate volumes are up double digits in terms of revenue year-on-year that that's been helpful.","So, I think it's a combination of all of the above. It's an interesting question, are we hedged? Is that having an impact on it or not? I don't know, haven't thought too much about that. But certainly it does create across the board of everybody's got the same incentive to make certain that we all are covering costs real time. So probably on the margin, that's helping as well.","James Baker","Okay. That helps. And second question for Glen, follow-up to Duane's question. I'm also trying to understand the revenue breakdown on the income statement a little bit better. On the business and premium category, if I buy a $300 main cabin ticket and then I get an upsell offer of $100 when I check in, do you then classify $400 in the premium category or just the upsell? I really just kind of want to understand the mechanics behind the 19% year-on-year increase. Also once I start using miles on my app to upgrade, does that potentially cause the momentum in that category to slow as I guess that would be captured in the loyalty category?","Glen Hauenstein","No. I think at the end of the day what we're trying to do is accelerate the usage of these products and services. And as we indicated previously, we are growing those cabins through the upgauge. And as we exit the MD-80s and as we bring on a 321 to substitute it, we generate 20% more premium seats.","So the answer is that clearly it comes through different line items, but the revenue is real whether or not you pay with cash or whether or not you pay with mileage. And that's one of the things that we're really excited about is being able to let you do that on your app on the way to the airport. And it doesn't matter to us how it comes through the P&L because it's real revenue either way and what we need to do is continue to have your affinity grow there.","And I think when you think about the ecosystem of the frequent flyer program, we want to give you more ways to burn your miles and control your experience, and that's really the key of where we want to take this in the next couple of years is be able to buy what you want from us and be able to supply it to you. And as these things fill up, there's nothing keeping us from making more seats in those cabins because they are the higher margin pieces of our equation.","James Baker","Look, I get all that. It's just my concern that as it starts to shift to loyalty when people start using miles, if there is a deceleration in that 19% rate, my concern is that people are going to look at that and say oh! business cabin premium is beginning to slow, which wouldn't necessarily be accurate. So again, when I'm using dollars for an upsell, does that reclassify everything into premium or just the incremental amount of the upsell?","Glen Hauenstein","So let me answer the first question is it's the entire amount, so the whole $400 would go because it's where you sat in the cabin.","James Baker","I think that's fair, cool.","Glen Hauenstein","Right. And we'll try and classify the loyalty by cabin as well because we will \u2013 Jill is looking at me like I'm crazy. But we can figure out how to do that by the time we bring all that online.","James Baker","I'm sure I have caused many eyes to roll, so I will turn it over to the next question. Thank you, everybody.","Jill Greer","Aspirational goals.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, nice quarter here. I got two questions here for Paul. Just in the rising rate environment, can you just kind of refresh us on what the change in the discount rate for the pension means; like 50 bps, what that means for the liability, number one? And then number two, just your composition of fixed versus floating rate debt, if you have that maybe as of the June or the September quarter here? Thanks.","Paul Jacobson","Sure, Mike. Good morning and thanks for the question. So as we've talked about before, every 50 basis points increase in rates on the pension lowers our liability by about $1.2 billion and that's been a good source of traction for us over the last couple of years especially as we have \u2013 we overfunded the pension plan last year with $3 billion of contributions.","And then secondly, that interest rate appreciation is actually a very good thing for us in the aggregate because when you look at our P&L, we are actually less than 10% floating rate exposure on a net basis when you take into account cash and the other floating liabilities. So we're in fine shape for higher interest rates and in fact we're a net beneficiary of them.","Michael Linenberg","Thanks, Paul. Thanks everyone.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just to follow-up on Mike's question there, Paul. You've talked about contributing $500 million to the pension plan next year; I know you used the word overfunded. How do higher rates and the impact on liability impact that decision to use that $500 million toward pension and can you answer that question in the context of how pension contributions impact the NOL if at all? Thanks.","Paul Jacobson","Sure. Thanks, Hunter. I probably used the wrong word there in terms of overfunded, funded above our minimum contribution.","Hunter Keay","Yes, that's what I meant.","Paul Jacobson","But the plan is, as we know, still underfunded overall. Our long-term strategy, the $500 million that we've earmarked next year as well as the $500 million that we've earmarked in 2020 has all been consistent with the expectations of a higher interest rate margin \u2013 environment over time, which gets us well above that 80% funded target. And as we've disclosed at prior Investor Days et cetera, couple of hundred basis points gets us much closer to being fully funded on that pension plan. So that remains part of our strategy and we'll continue to evaluate that as we see the rate environment continue to move.","Hunter Keay","Okay. And the NOL portion of the question, does that have any impact on it if you decide to fund more or less?","Paul Jacobson","Yes. So contributions to an underfunded pension plan are immediately deductible for tax, so it actually does extend our NOL marginally.","Hunter Keay","Okay, thanks. And then another one for you, Paul. As I think about this the sub-2% CASM-Ex number next year and the 3% capacity guide, how sensitive is that CASM-Ex number to that 3%? And I realize that it depends on the type of capacity that's removed, that's gauged, and whatnot and maybe I'm just asking about sort of like variable and fixed costs at the end of the day. But is there a rule of thumb that you've seen from Delta over the years where if you say take out X number of points of ASMs, that loosely translates to X percentage points of headwind in the CASM-Ex side or is it really different every time?","Paul Jacobson","It can be different. I think you answered your own question to some extent that it depends where the capacity is being added or taken out, upgauging effects that et cetera. So, I think there isn't really a rule of thumb. As we continue to look through our 2019 planning process, as I've mentioned before, we've got increased confidence about our ability to deliver sub-2% CASM next year and we feel good about those estimates.","Hunter Keay","Okay, thanks.","Edward Bastian","Hunter, this is Ed. I think one other thing that obviously is playing a role as we look to next year is the improvements we're seeing from the One Delta initiatives. We started to gain some real traction as the year progressed here in 2018 and you see that in the numbers and that's on top of the traditional network changes, upgauging, or the products that we've talked about in the past. And I think that number next year is going to be in the incremental hundreds of million of dollars over 2018.","Hunter Keay","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein Research.","David Vernon","Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the time. So Glen, it sounds like you guys are recovering the fuel cost increases quicker than you may be have in the past. I was just curious as to your thoughts on how we should expect the stickiness of that revenue to endure if we do end up in a period of maybe a little bit more moderate fuel price. Do you think you will be able to hold on to more of that kind of in the next lower fuel price environment?","Glen Hauenstein","I think if you look at the history the last time fuel rolled over, we were still hedged. So I think that the real opportunity is if fuel does moderate without a hedge here that we would be able to have a lot of that flow to the bottom line. That's what happened last time, it took a long time in the wind up and it took a long time in the wind down. So, I would expect that it is very sticky on the way down.","David Vernon","All right. And then, Paul, just curious on the cost guidance for \u2013 at least the preliminary cost guidance for next year of 0% to 2%. We're ending the year here kind of 0% to minus 1%. It sounds like the One Delta initiatives have traction. Can you kind of walk us through what the thoughts are there in terms of the expectations for a little bit of a step up into unit cost and where the opportunities might be in 2019?","Paul Jacobson","Well, I think the \u2013 as Ed mentioned, the opportunities sit in One Delta, they sit in the general productivity initiatives that we challenge ourselves to achieve every year. Keep in mind there's a little bit of wage pressure next year with a regular increase for the pilots on January 1 as well as lapping the increase that Ed mentioned on this call for the October 1 for the ground and flight attendant. So, those pressures are present every single year and as we work through those in our planning cycle, we can provide more detail at Investor Day.","David Vernon","All right. Looking forward to it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Daniel McKenzie","Hey, good morning. Thanks, guys. Paul, there has been a lot of bullish commentary around commodities not just today, but over the coming three to five years. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about this idea that there could be a permanent supply mismatch relative to demand and does it \u2013 really where I'm going with this is does it make sense just given Delta's balance sheet to secure some catastrophic insurance for potential fuel volatility here?","Paul Jacobson","Well, good morning, Dan. I think as we talked about it, we're not pursuing any hedging and think that we're in a very good position. I think it's important to note that as we've demonstrated this year, our ability to recover fuel costs in the businesses has accelerated over the past and that's the number one front line from that standpoint.","And I think what we've proven here or what we're in the midst of proving is the durability in the business model to be able to absorb that. We've been successful in high oil price environments; we've been successful in low oil price environments. Where it gets a little bit tricky and what you've seen this year is in the volatility, when that moves quickly in one direction or the other.","So, I think we continue to believe that we're on the right trajectory without hedging. Certainly, the refinery helps us as does our integrated fuel strategy in which we continue to deliver results that are materially better than the industry average to the tune of $0.07 to $0.10 per gallon.","Daniel McKenzie","Understood, okay. And then Glen, with respect to the average upsell rate, the industry started at $25 and I'm just wondering if you can provide some insight into what it was for Delta in the third quarter and what's driving the appetite of corporations to continue to support that buy up? And what I'm getting at is if corporations are offering road warriors more approach just given the tight labor conditions today?","Glen Hauenstein","Clearly that's been one of our advantages and Steve and the sales team have done an amazing job getting a lot of the premium products incorporated into the sales agreements that we have today. But we're really only scratching the surface there and we've got a long way to go. That gives us a lot of hope that we will continue to be able to improve there.","The other thing is since these are relatively new products as you pointed out. They were pretty coarse in the beginning in terms of our sophistication in marketing to people or ascribing differential in prices based on length of haul or competitive markets.","And so now that's what we're really focused on today is to provide much more granularity in terms of that actual upsell rate that will indicate the true value that customers are receiving. So for example on a long haul Transcon flight, it might be $100 each way for an upgrade to Comfort+, well worth that money. But on a short haul competitive market, it may be $5 or $10. And that's generating a higher average upsell rate because we're able to really tailor the offering to what the market is.","Daniel McKenzie","Understood. Thanks for the time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth","Hey, good morning. Paul, if I might ask, I know there was some news items about Trainer and looking for a strategic partner. Could you talk a little bit about what you're exploring there and what benefits a strategic partner might make? And just a follow-up on just Trainer in general, with some of this IMO 2020 talk is we're going to get refining margins that expand here, does that improve your kind of relative advantage that Trainer provides?","Paul Jacobson","Well, good morning Savi. Thanks for the question. As we've talked about over the years with the Trainer strategy, we've talked often about finding a strategic partnership to take some of the products that we don't need, particularly the gasoline and the diesel, and get us to \u2013 keep us focused on jet fuel and allow us to harness all the benefits while still operating that plant. So with the turnaround coming up, it was a good opportunity to start that process. I won't comment on the process itself, but we continue to work through that.","As it relates to IMO 2020, we spent a lot of time talking about it internally and I think the speculation is out there both that it could affect higher crude prices, but the preponderance seems to be that we would expect to see higher jet cracks. That's bad for the airlines, but less bad for an airline that owns a refinery because we produce about 30% to 40% of the refinery's production in diesel and jet fuel that can help offset any increases in jet. So, we would expect that it would continue to help our relative advantage and look forward to continuing to see the benefits of Trainer in the years to come.","Savanthi Syth","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins","Right, thank you very much for the time. Paul, just following up on your last point there on IMO 2020, I mean as you think about the broader expectation for pretax margin expansion in 2019, what are you sort of baking into your internal planning with regard to what crack spreads could do or just low prices could do next year as you think about the impact from IMO 2020?","Paul Jacobson","Well, thanks for that, Jack. We're generally expecting to see higher cracks especially as we get to the back half of 2019 and we'll be modeling accordingly based on \u2013 depending on where crude ends up as we go through our planning prices. But as a general rule, we tend to plan conservatively on fuel. That's tough when fuel prices are up $2 billion year-over-year, but we still expect that cracks are going to be higher especially as we go to the back half of next year. What there's more uncertainty about is what the crude environment looks like in 2019.","Jack Atkins","Okay. Thank you for that. And then as a follow-up question either for Ed or for Glen with regard to tariffs, our sense is that the tariff sort of war that we're seeing between the U.S. and China is beginning to have an impact on your Transpacific global trade flows. Are you seeing any change in corporate behavior in your booking trends either into or out of Asia and do you think the tariffs are having any sort of impact on demand at this point as far as you can tell?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, Jack, we really haven't seen any meaningful impact. We're watching it as everyone is. Our Pacific based revenues and China specifically have done quite well in the quarter especially given some of the added capacity that we had put into the market with our recent launch of Atlanta-Shanghai doing well within our range of expectation. So we haven't seen it.","Jack Atkins","Okay, great. Thank you again for the time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody. Thank you for the time. So I think last week, I want to say, Governor Cuomo talked about JFK expansion and I was just kind of wondering you guys have a really nice facility there right now. How will that program affect you both from a cost perspective and from operations perspective?","Edward Bastian","Hi Helane, this is Ed. We are obviously working with the Governor as we do with the Port Authority to figure out the long-term strategy at JFK. Right now, I think it's premature. A vision's been laid out. There's a long way to go between taking that vision and some of the initial commitments to actual documentation and deals.","Our goal is to unify Terminal 4. So the T2 facility will eventually be brought into Terminal 4 and we'll be building out some additional capacity for Terminal 4, which we're excited by. We don't have that in place with the port yet. We've been talking about that with them for the last couple of years and I support the Governor's vision, creating a more unified version. One of the big challenges at JFK as you appreciate is the alliances are generally not in the same airport facilities as the home carriers and I think over time hopefully, that will get resettled.","Helane Becker","Okay. And then does that in any way change \u2013 I think the last conference call you talked about $12 billion over the next decade in airport construction spend. Does that change that number at all?","Edward Bastian","Not meaningfully. A little bit of that's in there. We are anticipating that that build-out is not going to be a substantial amount.","Helane Becker","Okay. And then can I just ask one last question about looking ahead to the first quarter of 2019 when Brexit kicks in. Ed, you're pretty plugged into Washington. Have you heard anything about agreements being negotiated to continue uninterrupted air travel?","Edward Bastian","I don't have any inside intelligence if that's what you're asking me, Helane, I think we all have a vested interest in making certain our access to the UK market remains unfettered and I don't anticipate it's going to be a meaningful issue for us.","Helane Becker","Great. Okay. Thanks very much.","Jill Greer","And Lisa, we're going to have time for one more question from the analyst.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our last question from the analyst from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Glen, a question for you. On 4Q CASM \u2013 sorry rather RASM, can you provide just some color on the regional breakdown? I know you talked a little bit about domestic earlier. And then just how you're feeling about the international environment given FX, capacity, and so on?","Glen Hauenstein","I think that's a great question. We clearly see the impacts of a stronger dollar on the international arena and I think one of the changes that you'll see as we move toward 2019 is a reemphasis of U.S. point of origin travel over foreign point of origin travels as we reorient our network even further. The recent devaluation of the Chinese currency as well as the Brazilian currency all have an impact on us and so it tends \u2013 we tend to then favor places with high point of sale U.S. as opposed to places where there's higher foreign point of sale and that's I think something we'll be talking about at Investor Day.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And then just regionally?","Glen Hauenstein","As far as the regions go, I think from what we see now, we're sitting kind of at the bottom as we speak in terms of the Latin to look better than where we've seen in the last few weeks. So I think we're not calling the bottom of the trough, but I think we will start to see growth in Latin over the next couple of months and positioned well into 2019. The Pacific remains strong despite all the rhetoric that Ed just talked about.","It's core demand to and from and particularly in the business cabin is very strong. And then Atlantic we're facing some more FX volatility, but the core demand in the Transatlantic remains incredibly strong and we're looking for RASM through the winter to be quite positive despite the fact that there is a lot of capacity in the Transatlantic this winter and as we've talked about it.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks. If I can sneak one in for Paul there. Sorry for cutting you off, Glen. Paul, can you just talk about some thoughts on CapEx going forward just with higher fuel rates and whether or not you're considering pulling in spend, deferring aircraft and then maybe what's a good number of years over the next couple of years just getting all the moving parts with that what you're leasing and so on?","Paul Jacobson","Sure, Rajeev. I think our CapEx strategy of continuing to reinvest 50% of our operating cash flow back into the business is still intact. Obviously we'll be higher than that this year, but given the receptivity of fuel price recapture and what we've been able to do for the P&L, we didn't want to whipsaw the organization and make any short-term adjustments to what we saw as a temporary challenge in the business.","So, we're going to continue to march along that path and feel good about the guidance that we've given. The stepup that we talked about today really represents just a different financing decision for the same capital and that will save us tens of millions of dollars a year.","Rajeev Lalwani","Great. Thank you. And Ed, good luck with the run next month.","Edward Bastian","Thank you. I'm going to need it.","Jill Greer","Well, that is going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call and I will now turn over to Ned Walker, our Chief Communications Officer.","Ned Walker","Okay. Hey, thanks Jill, and welcome everyone. We'll go ahead and begin the process of the media Q&A at this point. I'd like to ask the media if they could limit themselves to one question and a quick follow-up. We shouldn't be able to accommodate most everyone and Lisa, if you could review the process for queuing up to ask a question, we'll get underway. Thanks.","Operator","Yes sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Tangel with The Wall Street Journal.","Andrew Tangel","Hi, there. Good morning. Wondering if you all could give us a breakdown of how much you all have raised Main Cabin fares versus business and premium fares so far this year and in the third quarter?","Paul Jacobson","We typically don't give that kind of kind of disclosure. Overall, our unit revenues were up 4% in the quarter and much of that was the pricing effect.","Andrew Tangel","Well. can you give us an idea of how much more room you've got down the road to raise fares later this year and next year given the inflation elsewhere we're seeing and where incomes overall are nationwide? How much more flexibility do you'll have to raise fares to recover fuel and other costs?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, we don't speculate on the upcoming pricing or fare environment. I can tell you that the economy is healthy, demand is very healthy for the Delta product and to the extent oil prices were to continue to rise, we expect to be able to pass along the cost of that.","Andrew Tangel","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kelly Yamanouchi with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.","Kelly Yamanouchi","Hey, there. I would like to ask what impact you expect President Trump's list of this summer ban on ethanol might have on the Trainer refinery.","Paul Jacobson","Well, Kelly, this is Paul. I think we are applauding the administration's efforts to help streamline the renewable fuel standards and improve the market trading of RINs. We have seen a significant benefit in the lower cost of RINs compliance for the refinery this year and applaud the efforts to try to find a solution.","Kelly Yamanouchi","Does it affect \u2013 does a change affect your strategic plans for the refinery in any way?","Paul Jacobson","No, it doesn't. Like I said, we realized a nice benefit in the lower RINs cost and the refinery is performing well.","Kelly Yamanouchi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today.","Dawn Gilbertson","Hi, good morning. My question has to do with basic economy. I'm wondering if you guys have seen any impact from Americans move beginning in September to allow a carry-on bag, your more humane approach as you described it?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, we have not. We don't sell an incredible amount of basic economy because most of our customer base chooses when they're presented with what those are and the modest amounts to sellup into Main Cabin or even better products, choose to sellup into the Main Cabin. So, it's a very small percentage of our total sales and we haven't seen a change in that with Americans new policy.","Dawn Gilbertson","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Leslie Josephs with CNBC.","Leslie Josephs","Hi, good morning. Could you tell me what the upsell rate is on from Main Cabin to premium economy for international and then Main Cabin main cabin for Comfort+ domestic? I think basic economy is something like 50% of passengers considering basic economy bought into Main Cabin. I'm just curious about the more expensive economy fares you offer.","Edward Bastian","Well, I think it's a lot based on the amount of seats we have available to sales. So, you're asking how many people who are presented with that offer take it, is that the take rate?","Leslie Josephs","Yes. Like if there's any gauge of what the percentage is of people that are buying up.","Edward Bastian","I think what we could tell you is that the load factors \u2013 the SAT load factors in these cabins are relatively good. We've gone from selling about 13% of the first class for example when we started selling first class to now selling about 60% of the cabin. The rest is available for upgrades.","Comfort+ runs a load factor in the high 60s now based on stage. And then Premium Select, which is our newest product and is only available on a minimal number of flights, but we're going to bring that to all of our long haul internationals over the next few years, is off to an amazing start. We're selling about 85% of those seats.","Leslie Josephs","Okay. Thank you. And is there any way to upgrade to Premium Select, do you offer that yet or if not, are you considering it?","Edward Bastian","Yes. That's what we're excited about in the future is the ability to control your travel and upgrade however you want to with whatever currency you want to use. So you want to \u2013 if your company buys you a coach ticket and you want to sit in the Premium Select cabin, we'll have an offer for you that would be 17,000 miles for you or it\u2019s a $170 in cash. So those kinds of offers are really where we're trying to go with all of that in making it simpler to buy or easier to buy and allowing you to buy it however you'd like to pay for it.","Leslie Josephs","Okay. That's available now or that's something that's going to be available?","Edward Bastian","Some are available now, some are available \u2013 generally cash is available now, dollars. Mileage will be available in the fourth quarter, but what we're really trying to get to is mileage on mobile, which will be early in 2019.","Leslie Josephs","Okay. Thank you.","Ned Walker","Okay. And we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Edward Russell with Flightglobal.","Edward Russell","Hi. Thank you for taking the question today.","Ned Walker","You're welcome, Ed.","Edward Russell","I wanted to ask about the performance in Minneapolis. Detroit is very strong in the quarter. However, I've seen some capacity reductions there impacting markets like Akakan and Peoria. Could you talk about the strength there and why you're pulling out some of those connecting markets?","Glen Hauenstein","We are growing Detroit. As a matter of fact, we have significant growth in Detroit. We're adding new markets, I believe in November we added Detroit to San Jose and last year we added Detroit to Santa Ana. And so we're trying to make our schedules more relevant to people in Detroit to places people in Detroit want to go, focusing on the top 50 cities that people in Detroit want to go. And to the extent that we are not making money into regional cities, we're rationalizing that capacity out of the network in some of those cities.","If you look at the number of people who went from Detroit to Peoria on any given day, it was probably less than 10 and there are alternatives in the region. So streamlining, making the network more efficient, and providing the people in Detroit with places they want to go and we're very excited. Ed last month announced the new services from Detroit to Honolulu. And so we are growing Detroit and we're really committed to Detroit and we're excited about 2019 because there's going to be quite a bit more service into Detroit.","Edward Russell","Great. Thank you.","End of Q&A","Ned Walker","Okay. Thanks, Ed, Glen, and Paul. That concludes our September quarter 2018 conference call. We'll see the analysts at our Investor Day in New York on December 13 and back on the fourth quarter and year-end results call back in January of 2019. Good day, everyone.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Delta Air Lines June Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. My name is [ph] Michelle (00:12), and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session, following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Michelle. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for our June quarter call. Joining us in Atlanta today are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session.","Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta\u2019s financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings.","We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. We are also providing cost comparisons on a normalized basis as it better matches the retroactive expense we incurred in the fourth quarter 2016 from our pilot contract to the appropriate quarters of 2016. You can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed.","Ed Bastian","Thank you, Jill, and good morning. I appreciate everyone joining us on the call this morning. Earlier today, we reported the June quarter pre-tax profit of $1.85 billion and earnings per share of $1.64, largely in line with consensus. This was the best June quarter in Delta\u2019s history. We generated an 18.4% operating margin, a 14% after-tax return on invested capital and returned $750 million to our shareholders. We also grew our topline by 3% this quarter. The first year-on-year increase we have reported in two years.","And the quarter could have been even better. We absorbed $125 million pre-tax loss from the operational disruption following severe storm that hit Atlanta in early April. While we can\u2019t control the weather, we can improve our recovery, we had accelerated technology investments and implemented process improvements for the summer that incorporate what we learned from the April event.","In true Delta form, our people bounced back to deliver the strong operations we\u2019re known for. For the first half of this year, we\u2019ve had 129 days of no mainline cancels and 35 days without a system-wide cancelation. This is an improvement of 8% and 13%, excuse me, 13%, respectively, to last year and substantially better than our competition.","The great work of our people, supported by the continued investment in our business was evident in the results from the recent J.D. Power survey. In that survey, Delta\u2019s customer satisfaction score improved 33 points to the highest level in our history and we narrowed the gap to first place to 7 points. It\u2019s truly an honor to recognize our employees with $338 million accrued in profit sharing this quarter and $70 million in shared rewards. They are the very best in our business.","Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, our unit revenues are improving and tracking in line with the plan we laid out at our December Investor Day. The same is true for our non-fuel cost. However, fuel prices are lower and this gives us increasing confidence in our ability to drive margin expansion in the back half of the year.","And while 2017 has been a financial transition year, as pricing catches up to the rest of the cost growth we\u2019ve seen, our performance is setting up well to achieve the lower end of the long-term targets that we updated in May. Specifically, in each of the next three years, we\u2019re targeting operating margins in the range of 16% to 18%, EPS growth of 15% and $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion of free cash flow.","Our financial path forward focuses on four key themes, first, delivering topline and unit revenue growth, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our network, our product and our partnerships for the future. That\u2019s what drives our revenue and Brand Premium, as well as strong customer loyalty to create a durable topline. Glen will spend more time on this in a moment.","Second, is maintaining measured and disciplined capacity growth. Strong financially healthy companies grow and we believe keeping our capacity at or below GDP over time is the appropriate level to ensure we can deliver consistent net revenue growth. This should allow us to balance capital investment, supply and demand, and ensure the momentum in the business continues.","Third, is driving cost productivity to keep our non-fuel cost growth below 2% over the long-term. This allows the bulk of the benefits of our commercial initiatives to fall to the bottomline, so we can deliver on the margin and cash flow targets.","And, finally, being disciplined about our capital allocation, our goal is to invest roughly half of our operating cash flow back into the business, while the other half being put towards achieving our balance sheet goals and targeted returns to our owners. Paul will spend some time on both our cost and capital initiatives.","Operating our business with this long-term perspective has proven very beneficial for all of Delta\u2019s stakeholders. It\u2019s allowed us to invest in our employees through wage increases each year since the Delta-Northwest merger, while paying more than $5 billion in profit sharing.","For our customers, we have invested $15 billion in capital projects in the last five years, including the replacement of nearly 25% of our total fleet, undertaken significant facility upgrades and enabled investments in new technology.","And for our shareholders, we\u2019ve returned over $8 billion since 2013, while reducing our debt by over $10 billion to create an investment grade balance sheet and our stock has recently hit all-time highs with a market cap of over $40 billion.","Our work over the last decade has produced a durable foundation. We intend to leverage in order to consistently produce strong and dependable earnings and cash flow growth through the business cycle.","I\u2019m incredibly proud of the great work of our 80,000 people that has established Delta as one of the strongest airlines in the global industry and even more excited about the future ahead for our business as we continue to execute on our long-term plans.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Glen and Paul to go through more details on the quarter.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, we produced a record total revenue of just under $11 billion, an increase of nearly $350 million or 3% over last year, with solid improvements across passenger, cargo and other revenue. This result includes $115 million revenue headwind from the April storm disruption.","I want to add my thanks to the Delta people for their focus every day on taking great care of our customers, that is what sets Delta apart from the industry. Our initiatives to give customers a more efficient global network and innovative experience, and more choice through segmentation are driving continued revenue growth, and premiums to the industry, which now stand at 110% through the first half.","Before I go through our future opportunities with these initiatives, let me quickly highlight the details of the June quarter. Passenger revenues increased 3% or $260 million, driven by improvements in business yields and our commercial initiatives with $100 million of this increase from Branded Fares.","Cargo sales were up 11% in the first year-on-year improvement in 10 quarters, Kudos to the cargo team for delivering this very strong result. Other revenue grew 4% ex-refinery driven by a strong 8% improvement in loyalty, partially offset by lower MRO revenues.","Our partnership with American Express produced $70 million of incremental value this quarter and we are on pace to deliver $300 million of incremental value in 2017, including another record year for card acquisitions. This tremendous demand for our co-brand card is a testament to the strength of our brand and great partnership with American Express.","Turning to unit revenues, the improvement in passenger revenue equated to a PRASM growth of 2.5%, including 1 point of pressure from the April storms. We saw particular strength in business yields, which improved 3 points versus the March quarter and drove our result to the high-end of our initial guidance.","Corporate revenues turned positive in mid-April as volumes increased year-over-year and yields continued to improve sequentially. Our recent survey of travel managers confirms this momentum, with 83% projecting their spend will be maintained or increased for the remainder of 2017, that\u2019s up 2 points from last year\u2019s survey.","Our domestic entity saw the greatest benefit from the business yield improvement. Domestic unit revenues increased 3% versus last year, up 4 points sequentially, with two-thirds of the entity now realizing positive unit revenue growth. We expect that to expand to 75% of our domestic network in the third quarter. Our PRASM result combined with a 2% higher capacity produced 4% domestic revenue growth for the quarter.","After two years of underperformance, we believe we can keep these revenues growing at or above GDP due to two factors. First, Business Fares, while improving, remain well below historical levels. Second, we expect Branded Fares will deliver an incremental $1 billion in revenue through 2019. With domestic accounting for roughly two-thirds of our revenue base, this type of performance is key to driving further topline revenue growth.","Turning to Latin America, we realized positive unit revenue growth of 11%, our fourth consecutive quarter of positive PRASM for the region. Brazil was again the outperformer, with RASM up nearly 15% driven by a stronger real, solid business demand and our partnership with GOL.","In the Pacific, our unit revenues declined 2%, a slight improvement over last quarter. Tokyo saw revenue improvements in Haneda and Narita on both load factor and yield versus the quarter, while China RASM declined 2% on a 2-point improvement sequentially. Strong business traffic offset softness in leisure demand driven by industry capacity increases. We are excited to have signed a JV agreement with Korean which provides our customers with an industry leading intra-Asian network and connectivity to over 80 destinations beyond Seoul.","And finally, in the Transatlantic, unit revenues declined 2%, including 1.5 points of currency pressure. RASM in the quarter was bolstered by a focus on U.S. point-of-sale, which stood at 70% this quarter, 4 points above last year. We also saw strength in business cabin, which offset pressure on leisure yields from high industry capacity levels. The U.K. was a bright spot achieving a 7% unit revenue growth and we see this strength continuing throughout the summer.","To summarize, we are very pleased with a healthy demand environment and progress we\u2019ve made on our commercial strategy. This drove our first positive RASM result since late 2014 and a solid 2.7% improvement in TRASM. And with three consecutive months of positive RASM and that\u2019s actually four, we\u2019re going to hold Ed to his deal and we will no longer be reporting our monthly revenue results.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect PRASM to be up in the 2.5% to 4.5% range. As for capacity, we are forecasting growth of about 2% in the third quarter. That includes a 0.5 point from last year\u2019s technology adage and 1 point from stage length. Seats in the third quarter will be up approximately 1%.","As we think about what\u2019s going to drive our commercial performance going forward, I break our initiatives into three broad categories. First, creating a more global and efficient network, making sure we not only have the right overall level of capacity, but also we\u2019re putting the right number of seats in the right aircraft at the places.","Our domestic growth is being driven by a multiyear upgauging initiative, which is producing over 70% of our incremental seats this year. In 2017, we will continue to add more A321s and 737-900\u2019s to replace older narrow bodies and take out additional 50 seat regional jets. With larger aircraft, we can offer more Premium product, supporting our revenue strategy, while being more cost efficient.","Internationally, we\u2019re focused on reorienting our network around our partners\u2019 hubs. In Latin, we\u2019re moving quickly to implement our JV with Aeromexico, optimizing our schedules to maximize connecting opportunities for customers via hubs in Mexico City and Monterey.","In the Pacific, between the Korean joint venture and our strong alliance with China Eastern, we have two partners with leading Asia hubs in Seoul and Shanghai, and soon we\u2019ll be adding a hub in Beijing. The combination of these partners in our wide body fleet initiatives will allow us to reduce our alliance on Tokyo-Narita and enhance our profitability in the Pacific moving forward.","In Transatlantic almost 60% of our capacity this quarter was deployed in partner hubs where efficiency and connectivity drive superior margins. We are also focused on increasing seasonal flying to better align capacity with demand and to that end we added five new seasonal routes for this summer and are encouraged by the solid margins we are producing.","The second broad group of initiatives is focused on providing an innovative customer experience, making sure that we\u2019re investing in products and services our customers value. This along with industry leading reliability and the best people in the industry is what drives higher net promoter scores and ultimately leads to sustained revenue premiums.","On board, we\u2019re investing in reliable high-speed Wi-Fi, upgraded interiors, in-seat entertainment and improve food and snacks. In our terminals, we have multiple projects across our system to bring the airport of the future to our customers today. And we continue to lead the industry on innovative customer solutions like RFID bag checking, biometric self-service bag drop kiosks and biometric boarding passes. We are focused on continuing to make our customers\u2019 flying experience better.","Finally, the third category is giving our customers more choice through better segmentation. Branded Fares drove 40% of the improvement in passenger revenues this quarter, as we expand it into more markets, improved our distribution and made products easier to buy.","We\u2019re adding more flexibility for customers to upgrade to Comfort+ and first class with both cash and mild options post purchase. We remain in the early stages of marking the value of segmentation and with 200 million customers a year, you only need small improvements in this category to drive material topline revenue growth.","When we combine the building blocks we have in place across our network with the unmatched style and service of the 80,000 Delta people worldwide, we are confident we can execute on our commercial initiatives. This will drive value for our customers and our shareholders, not only in the back half of 2017 but into the future.","And now I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Jacobson","Thanks, Glen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. To echo Ed and Glen\u2019s comments, let me begin by saying thanks to the Delta people worldwide for the great service they provide to our customers. Their hard work has built a durable business model that is delivering consistent results.","For the June quarter, operating expenses increased roughly $65 million, as lower fuel costs due to last year\u2019s hedge settlements, offset investments in our people, our customer experience and our fleet. These investments drove an increase in non-fuel CASM of 5.5%, which included about a point of pressure from the April operational disruption. Moving into the back half of the year, we\u2019ll see CASM headwinds ease despite continued pressures from wage increases and higher depreciation.","First, we\u2019ll lap the technology outage which drove about a 0.5 point of CASM in last year\u2019s third quarter. Second, our planned capacity growth for the year was weighted to the back half after keeping capacity flat in the first half of the year, which will benefit CASM. Third, we\u2019ll annualize higher levels of product, maintenance and technology investments from the back half of 2016, such as enhanced snacks and additional meal services that were added last fall.","Finally, our upgauging initiatives will deliver benefits at a slightly faster pace as compared to first half of the year due to our aircraft delivery schedule and into service. This initiative is already delivering solid productivity savings and in the first half of the year, we produced 1.6 higher domestic ASMs on 1% fewer departures.","As a result of these four factors, we expect unit cost growth in the September quarter to be up roughly 2% on a normalized basis, which puts us on the right trajectory to achieve our full year 2% to 3% non-fuel CASM growth.","Looking at fuel, while market prices increased by 10% in the June quarter, Delta\u2019s all-in fuel price declined by 16% as we lapped last year\u2019s early hedge settlements. We realized a $6 million profit from the refinery despite a significant increase in the cost of RIN\u2019s compliance. While fuel prices continue to be volatile, rent prices remain below $50 a barrel and are roughly 15% below the highs of February.","For the third quarter, we\u2019re expecting year-over-year market fuel price to be slightly higher than last year, though due to some hedge settlements in the quarter and are currently forecasting our all-in fuel price in the range of $1.55 per gallon to $1.60 per gallon.","For the second quarter, we delivered an 18.4% operating margin, up 1 point versus last year\u2019s reported 17.4% margin. We expect margin expansion in the back half of the year as the revenue recovery continues to gain traction, non-fuel cost pressures ease and full prices remain stable. For the September quarter specifically, we expect our operating margin to be in the range of 18% to 20% compared to last year\u2019s normalized 17.6% and reported 19%.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, our strong margins and profit performance resulted in $2.8 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, adjusted for the remaining $500 million in cash from the unsecured debt transaction we contributed to the pension plan in early April.","At the end of the quarter, our adjusted net debt was $8.4 billion and our unfunded pension liability was $6.9 billion together a reduction of $1.4 billion versus year end. This is solid progress as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet.","We spent $1 billion on capital expenditures this quarter, of which nearly $500 million was related to new aircraft and the remainder for fleet mods, facility upgrades and technology improvements and initiatives. For the September quarter, we again expect capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion, including $175 million to complete the purchase of 49% of Aeromexico.","During the June quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow and used that to repurchase $600 million of shares and pay $150 million in dividends. We also recently announced a 50% dividend increase, which will begin in the September quarter. This is the fourth consecutive 50% increase to the dividend since we initiated it in 2013 and as yesterday\u2019s closing price represents a 2.2% dividend yield. With this increase, our annualized dividend will be $875 million, which demonstrates our conviction on the durability and sustainability of the Delta business model.","In closing, we believe we are on track to deliver topline growth and margin expansion in the back half of the year, while we continue to be prudent with our capital. This will allow us to produce these durable earnings and cash flows, and unlock additional value for our owners.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A.","Jill Greer","Thanks Ed, Glen and Paul. Michelle, we\u2019re ready for Q&A with the analysts if you could give them instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan McKenzie","Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks. I guess, Paul, first question here is, just on the stock buyback in the second quarter and the first quarter. I think you guys have bought back $800 million in shares that the share count was flat, so this is kind of a house cleaning question. I\u2019m just wondering what drove the incremental buyback in the second quarter and if you could just help us understand what the share count is today?","Paul Jacobson","Sure. Good morning, Dan. Thanks for joining us. The share count as reported is a weighted average calculation and as we repurchased stock through the quarter, the weighted average was impacted by the fact that we had contributed $350 million of equity to the pension plan at the end of March. So if you\u2019re looking for the benefit of the buyback, if you look to the quarter end shares outstanding, it was actually down about 12 million shares. It was just a nuance with the weighted calculation due to the timing of that contribution.","Dan McKenzie","Understood. And then I guess the second follow-up question here for you, Glen. I know that Delta has a number of initiatives in the back half of the year to I think to drive or improve revenue on that particular entity. I\u2019m just wondering if you can just remind us what those initiatives are and how you think they might contribute in the back half of the year relative to the first half?","Glen Hauenstein","Sure. Great question. The -- we continue on the path and really it\u2019s not new initiatives. It\u2019s doing the initiatives we\u2019ve already announced in a better way and bringing them to a broader audience, and just within this quarter, for example, we expanded the ability in post purchase, that was in May, to actually buy a ticket and then say if you\u2019re a business customer and you want to sit in a different cabin then you\u2019re allowed to by your company, you can purchase that in a post purchase transaction. We\u2019ve seen about an $80 million uptick for that on an annual run rate basis.","Starting this month or this past month in June, we now for elites are allowing them to use their miles to sit in the cabins they want and we believe that will contribute another $50 million to $100 million on a run rate basis as we continue to expand those types of programs.","And I think there when you think about that these are new and innovative programs that require a lot of programming, because you have to distribute them through a lot of different means and our ability to continue to focus on bringing the products and services that we have in the market to a broader and broader audience is going to drive our ability to monetize our Premium products more in the next year.","Dan McKenzie","Thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move on to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Hey. Thanks. Good morning.","Ed Bastian","Good morning.","Hunter Keay","So you guys sound really, yeah, hi. You sound great. Ed, obviously, you feel like you\u2019re sounding better and better about how things are going. I know that you\u2019ve said that the initial guide for this year on margin was down about 150 basis points, but is it safe to assume that now the 16% to 18% margin target is in play for this year and maybe even step further, might we be looking at, putting aside this whole normalization stuff for a second, might we be looking at year-on-year margin expansion on reported margins from 2016 this year?","Ed Bastian","Is your question, Hunter, will we actually expand reported margins \u201817 over \u201816 essentially?","Hunter Keay","Yeah. Or if you don\u2019t want to answer that or are you going be in the 16% to 18% range this year, because I know you referred to it as the transition year and you originally you said you\u2019re going to be down, but obviously things are getting better by the day. So I was just trying to sort of categorize how you\u2019re thinking about full year?","Ed Bastian","Got it. Yes. We are, I think, I said such in my prepared remarks that we\u2019re anticipating being in the low end of that 16% to 18% this year.","Hunter Keay","Oh! Okay. Sorry. I must have missed that. Okay. And then let\u2019s talk for a second the international investment you\u2019re making and how you see these evolving over the next three years to five years. Is this sort of, a big picture question here, is this sort of a view on how you maybe see foreign ownership rules potentially being relaxed by other countries, maybe if you look at the success and stability of U.S. airlines here relative to the rest of the world? There might be some angle where foreign airlines which are far more volatile businesses might be interested in having maybe a majority ownerships from some of the more strong U.S. airline, Delta included. Is this just merely a JV play or is there something bigger picture down the road that you\u2019re thinking about cross border consolidation that you\u2019re setting up for today?","Ed Bastian","We\u2019re not angling to get in and control any of our foreign investors or vestees or partnerships. What we\u2019ve got here, Hunter is historically through the JVs and the partnerships they\u2019ve been contractual commercial arrangements and what we have seen is our ability to drive value is much greater once you get inside the boardroom than it is through a pure contract in terms of aligning ownership and driving value in a consistent manner and being able to invest truly for the long-term together. We\u2019ve seen that in Aeromexico, which drove the higher-level investment. We\u2019ve seen that in GOL. We\u2019ve seen that in Virgin Atlantic, certainly. And so I think over time, you might see us continue to go down that path, but no, I don\u2019t think in our future, certainly, not in the next five years to 10 years I don\u2019t see the foreign ownership rules changing dramatically.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thank you.","Ed Bastian","Yeah. Sure.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move on to Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane Becker","Thanks, Operator. Hi, team. Thanks for taking the question. Ed, I know that there\u2019s this proposal in Congress to privatize, I guess for lack of a better word or separate out air traffic control and I know Delta in the past has been opposed to it. And I was just kind of wondering if you guys are going to try to be involved in what goes on so that your views are clearly expressed in the process and that what works best for you gets actually implemented?","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Helane. Yeah. There\u2019s been a lot of work that\u2019s being done in Washington around the ATC reform topic and, yes, we at the table. We are working constructively with Chairman Shuster. We\u2019re not philosophically opposed to privatization for privatization sake. What we want to do is make certain that we have the proper governance, transparency and cost efficiency to drive the reforms needed in the next air traffic control system that gets modernized and we\u2019re in full support of the President\u2019s agenda to invest and modernize the systems.","Helane Becker","Okay. Great. Thank you very much and actually that was my only question.","Ed Bastian","Good.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move to Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.","Jamie Baker","Hey. Good morning, Delta. Question for, Glen, just a couple of demand-related issues. First on the Atlantic, after the summer peak, how profound a shift is there in point-of-sale? I\u2019m just wondering how the currency impact of that is potentially going to impact the trajectory of Atlantic RASM kind of going forward in the second half?","Glen Hauenstein","Jamie, I think I\u2019m pretty enthusiastic about how the first half of the year has shaped up relative to the capacity levels that are in the Transatlantic. And what we\u2019ve seen is really a higher demand in the business cabin on a year-over-year basis and it\u2019s not insignificant, it\u2019s a relatively significant increase.","So we read a lot about European business sector picking up and we\u2019re really seeing that in the travel to and from Europe. So we have a couple of things that are developing that are positive for us. The euro is at a multiyear high here. We have business demand and a very, very solid position.","As you know, July and August are not very big business months in Europe, so we\u2019ve been able to offset that with higher U.S. point-of-sale. But relatively encouraged at the trends that we see as we go into the fall that those should be quite beneficial, higher euro, higher business demand as you get into more business-oriented months.","Jamie Baker","Okay. That helps. And second, in terms of Basic Economy, I\u2019m wondering as your primary competitors rollout similar programs at a pretty rapid pace, has that had any impact on the returns that you\u2019re generating and also has there been any change since last quarter in terms of the, I guess, the percentage of your corporate accounts that all those fares off from employee use.","Glen Hauenstein","Well, I\u2019m going let Steve speak to the corporate sector and the other focus we have is not only to ensure that our customers are getting the right seats, but the corporations can sell up into Comfort+ and even first class and I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing a bit, even more success as we move forward and I\u2019ll turn the rest of that answer to Steve.","Steve Sear","Yeah. That\u2019s exactly right, Glen. You\u2019re seeing the -- at the individual level the capability to be able to buy into the Comfort+ cabin, which that new functionality is increasing the corporate revenue base. And we\u2019re also seeing more and more corporations from a policy perspective enable their traveler to also purchase those types of products. So you\u2019re seeing it both at the individual level and at the policy level.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Terrific. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Jamie.","Jamie Baker","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll move on to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hi. Thanks. Maybe I missed it, but did you say what your expectation was for domestic unit revenue growth in the third quarter?","Glen Hauenstein","Duane, we don\u2019t typically get that level of forecasting detail.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. Fair to say that you expect sequential improvement?","Glen Hauenstein","Yes.","Ed Bastian","Yes.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And sorry for a modeling question, but I think there\u2019s a little investor confusion on the normalization of non-fuel CASM. Can you talk about much we should be adding to 3Q cost of last year to normalize and then correspondingly, how much should we be subtracting from 4Q cost of last year to normalized, and is it clear that we should be thinking about 2% growth in the fourth quarter off of that lower cost base?","Paul Jacobson","Hey, Duane. It\u2019s Paul. Good morning. What we\u2019ve said is the normalization effect was about $130 million per quarter. So, give or take, so that if you assume that was all out there, you\u2019d be left with about $125 million to $130 million of cost remaining in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that this doesn\u2019t really impact the second half conversation, overall, we\u2019re just trying to take out some of the volatility between those two quarters, given the discrepancy in the retroactive piece.","Duane Pfennigwerth","So that implies CASM down sort of mid singles in fourth quarter.","Paul Jacobson","Yeah. No.","Jill Greer","No.","Paul Jacobson","No, no, no, no. On a reported basis...","Duane Pfennigwerth","On an actual.","Paul Jacobson","On an actual basis it would be down significantly because of the $475 million charge that we took in the 4Q last year.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll hear from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Yeah. Hey. Just two questions related to the Pacific here for Glen. So, look unit revenue has been running down in that region, better, obviously in the June quarter than March quarter, so we\u2019re seeing the sequentially improvement. But still on a sizable capacity decline, 10%, 11%, how much of what\u2019s impacting that, is it demand or is it structural or is it, you\u2019re transitioning from the 74s to smaller wide bodies, like at what point do we get to positive territory there, what are you seeing in that market?","Glen Hauenstein","That\u2019s a great question. And I\u2019d say that we\u2019re very excited about our 2018 results in the Pacific. This is the last real year of a multiyear transition and thanks to our Pacific team and Ed\u2019s direction, we\u2019ve got what we need in place now with the Korean joint venture to really produce a competitive and an improving Pacific operation over the next couple years.","So it was -- when you think about the merger with Northwest, 100% of our capacity was routed through Tokyo and Narita at the time of the merger. And now as you think forward is, we have a very diversified portfolio, we have multiple hubs and we\u2019re really at the endpoints of the restructuring and looking forward to very much improved 2018 in the Pacific.","Michael Linenberg","Great. And then, Glen, just you referenced the Beijing hub in your opening remarks, when -- presumably that\u2019s the new airport?","Glen Hauenstein","Yeah.","Michael Linenberg","When does that come online?","Glen Hauenstein","2019.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move on to Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew Didora","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just one question for Glen, obviously, 3Q will be four quarters in a row of accelerating PRASM. I know comps do get a lot tougher in 4Q, so maybe that streak could be broken. But is there anything you\u2019re seeing in your bookings or corporate demand right now that would result in PRASM not being positive in 4Q?","Glen Hauenstein","Nothing that would indicate that now.","Andrew Didora","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move on to Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Glen, you started selling Premium cabin fares I think for travel in the fall. Based on what you -- based on what you\u2019ve seen so far, does this basically look like your expectation based on your experience with Air France, et cetera?","Glen Hauenstein","We\u2019re very excited about that cabin and that cabin will be expanding, and yes, we are -- the fares are where we think they were in the business case and the demand is very strong for the initial. Remember, we really don\u2019t have very many seats available in that category on Delta, of course, we do in Air France and KLM and really, one of the big advantages for all of the programming work that\u2019s gone into being just able to sell that fare is we can better display our partners\u2019 offerings today and be able to offer Comfort+ and Premium Select in most markets now.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then you had provided a longer term forecast for Branded Fares at one of your Investor Days. It sounds like you picked up about $100 million or so this quarter or about $400 million on an annual run rate basis. First of all, are those the right numbers?","And then secondly, with the rollout of Premium Economy and the adoption of Basic Economy by some of your peers, would you expect that that Branded Fares revenue growth accelerates or decelerates or holds steady from here? Is there just a basic outlook on where that goes?","Glen Hauenstein","I think we -- what we\u2019ve said is we believe we\u2019re in the early stages of optimizing that, because when you\u2019re bringing new products and services to market, you have so many things you have to figure out through distribution, through pricing, through customer adoption. And these products are very young in the longer scheme of how airlines have sold tickets and we believe there are multiple years of continued upside opportunity for us that will accelerate at a different rate than base passenger revenues.","Darryl Genovesi","Great. Thanks very much. Appreciate the time.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move on to Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Hey. Good morning. Glen, maybe a question for you, as you continue to compete on product and you\u2019ve been ahead of your competition on operational reliability and things like that and you\u2019re seeing them starting to catch up, as you continue to improve the product, does at any point Delta\u2019s kind of older fleet start to hinder the competitive advantage or is this going to mix new versus mid-life something that can continue and not something that holds back from a customer appreciation standpoint?","Ed Bastian","Savi, hi. This is Ed. It\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s interesting, we -- while we do see the competition improving, which we think is a good thing. We continue to improve as well. So we\u2019re not -- the bar continues to get higher and one of the things that will drive continued improvement in Delta is the investment that we are making in new fleet over the next few years.","We\u2019ve replaced 25% of our total fleet over the last five years. We\u2019ll probably replace another 20% to 25% of our fleet in just the next three years coming as we retire the MD88s by 2020 and we start to reduce reliance on some of our older fleet types, 747 is going out this year as well.","So I think that is certainly something that we anticipate not just from a reliability perspective, but the financial performance of the new aircraft. We\u2019re bringing in the 321s, the 739s are at or above expectations and they will be a big source of additional margin contribution for us into the future.","Savi Syth","Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful, Ed. So, but I\u2019m assuming that sticks to still that you\u2019re going be able to do that volume less than 50% of your free cash -- your operating cash flow, which is around the current level of CapEx, is that right?","Ed Bastian","That\u2019s right.","Savi Syth","Okay. Great. And then if I might just ask a quick modeling question, is it the refinery -- has there been any change in outlook on the contribution there?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Savi. It\u2019s Paul. I think that we had said previously that the refinery was expected to be about $100 million for the year. That\u2019s probably down slightly based on the environmental compliance. I think we\u2019ve got about $30 million to-date. I would say it\u2019s probably going to be down slightly from that $100 million but we\u2019re still expecting it to be profitable for the rest of the year.","Savi Syth","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. I just I wanted to come back to some of the comments you were making on growth and margins. You\u2019ve obviously done a good job bringing margins to within targeted levels. With that occurring, what\u2019s the approach going to be on capacity relative to the cap that you put in place for \u201817 and beyond, obviously, as we look at the schedules beyond 3Q, it seems like you\u2019re going to maybe move above that 1% level but your thoughts would be great?","Ed Bastian","Sure, Rajeev. We\u2019re still operating with the plan we have in place for 2017 which is the overall 1% growth for the year. I know there\u2019s -- out in the schedules there\u2019s a little more capacity in the backend of the year that are going to continue to be refined as we get closer and you\u2019ll see some of that schedule firm up and some reductions take place.","But we\u2019re -- the plan is the 1% and that continues to be our goal for the year. And then when we get to the end of the year as we look at where our margins will be and we will anticipate being, as I said earlier, at the low end of the 16% to 18% long-term margin guidance, we\u2019ll evaluate the 2018 capacity schedule.","Rajeev Lalwani","Great. Thanks. And then, Glen, a question for you, on the international front there appears to be a bit more stability on the pricing front and your comments going forward to support that as well. Does that maybe change your growth priority to move from domestic to international or is domestic still where the focus will be?","Glen Hauenstein","We see more of the opportunities remaining in domestic for the short term and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the trends. The stability in the international marketplace is other than Latin which has actually been the most stable, is a relatively new phenomenon and so we\u2019re going to monitor that. And as we -- as Ed said, as we look at what we achieve in 2017 that will help guide what we set our objectives to be for 2018.","Rajeev Lalwani","Very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Glen, thanks for the color regarding the Amex contribution and the card acquisitions. I guess the question is you guys provide the expectation that Amex is going to contribute $4 billion by 2021. Problem with that chart is no one knows what that means, what to do with it, because it\u2019s quantified as value or contribution. So can you convert that to sort of EBIT number or cash, I think, it\u2019s pretty obvious that that value there is being lost as being currently communicated?","Paul Jacobson","Hey, Joe. It\u2019s Paul. I\u2019ll take a shot at that, too. I mean, keep in mind that that -- when we talk about that value, we are talking about it in a cash context. The noise comes about from how frequent flyer miles are recognized through the P&L where there\u2019s a piece that gets to come through now and a piece that has to be deferred over time.","That value is split between predominantly revenue from the sale of miles to third parties but also some in the cost side through efficiencies that we\u2019re able to get as a sizable partner. So I think we\u2019ve taken the point and we continue to look at ways to talk about that and disclose that a little bit more clearly in a balanced way, but the value is cash value.","Ed Bastian","Hey, Joe. This is Ed.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay.","Ed Bastian","Joe, if I could try one other thing. Yeah, I think the points you\u2019ve been raising over the last year are good ones and we need to continue to find better ways to communicate the sources of value that we drive, while we have to respect the confidentiality of our agreements with American Express, we can do a better job of laying out some of the value that we are creating and the sustainability of that value. So this coming Investor Day that we\u2019ll have in December, we\u2019re going to do a -- we are going to take a shot at that and hopefully that\u2019ll give us a good opportunity to get the message out a little more clear.","Joseph DeNardi","That\u2019s great. So, Paul, just to clarify, that $4 billion, that\u2019s an expectation that Amex is contributing $4 billion in cash by 2021?","Paul Jacobson","It\u2019s across all the programs but yes anyway.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. I mean\u2026","Ed Bastian","Hey, Joe. This is Ed.","Joseph DeNardi","Sure.","Ed Bastian","Just to add, that assumes volume growth, that assumes -- I mean there\u2019s a lot of stuff in there. It\u2019s not a contractual agreement. There\u2019s a lot of assumptions that go into making that up. So assuming we hit our plan and Amex hits their plan and that is what we\u2019re on a good path towards, that would be the end result.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. That\u2019s helpful.","Paul Jacobson","Yeah. And also just...","Joseph DeNardi","Yeah.","Paul Jacobson","\u2026 add, Joe, keep in mind too that that\u2019s both on the revenue and the cost line. It\u2019s not all coming through sale.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. Okay. I guess the second question is, the co-brand card market is getting quite a bit more competitive and it feels like over the past few years the strategy at airlines is to effectively devalue the currency. So it require -- you need more miles to buy a ticket, that\u2019s obviously beneficial to the economies of the program for the airline, but it doesn\u2019t make the currency demanded more by consumer. So how do you balance that conflict, Ed, between trying to structure the program to really maximize demand for that currency relative to what it means for the airline?","Glen Hauenstein","This is Glen and let me take a stab on that and maybe Ed would like to close if I leave any holes in the answer is, I think, the way that we look at this is the hard acquisitions continued to achieve record results without significant change to the program.","And I think there\u2019s been a lot of talk at other carriers who have announced fare increases, but we have been in a dynamic pricing environment now for multiple years. And I think that\u2019s one of the successes of our card in the marketplace is that there are incredible value propositions for customers out there who acquire and use our cards, and we have no intention to degrade the total value proposition.","We may adjust on the margin the valuation of peak seats versus off peak seats or particular days versus, but the value we\u2019re creating seems to be greater and greater and I think that\u2019s being recognized on the marketplace by -- really when you would think that the market was probably saturated with airline revenue cards that we have posted three acquisition record years in a row and we\u2019re on track to produce another this year.","So consumers are enjoying the products and services that we buy and they\u2019re continuing to apply at record numbers. And our team\u2019s done a great job and we have lots of innovation space coming in that space in the last half of the year.","Ed Bastian","And, Joe, this is Ed. The only other thing I\u2019d add to Glen\u2019s remarks are from an Amex perspective, I know we are the leading growth vehicle in their co-brand portfolios by a large margin and the partnership continues to be in a really great place. We issued more free tickets this year than any time in our history and I think the program\u2019s in a really solid position.","Joseph DeNardi","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Jill Greer","Michelle, we\u2019re going to have time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","Thank you. Next we\u2019ll hear from David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon","Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the time to fit in the question. I wanted to see if you could comment a little bit about the C Series and how that will implemented in the network, whether it\u2019s going to be put into upgauging existing sort of regional routes or whether you\u2019re also going be putting aircraft into markets that maybe you don\u2019t serve on a direct basis today?","Ed Bastian","The answer is a little bit of both. For high demand 76-seat long range RJ markets, we\u2019re going to -- that will probably be the first selection. That will free the two class RJs to replace 50-seat airplanes that are continuing to exit the fleet and then we\u2019ll certainly have a few new markets next year. We don\u2019t have a lot of new airplanes -- net new airplanes coming, but having 100-seat long range jet does open up some new market opportunity that we don\u2019t have today.","David Vernon","And as we think about maybe the first rollout of that, should we expecting it to be in more [Indiscernible] controlled airports where you can leverage that that upgauge benefit with at a [inaudible] fares, should we be thinking the newer market will be at the front end of the rollout?","Ed Bastian","Well, the first one\u2019s going to go to New York. I won\u2019t tell you where it\u2019s going go, but it\u2019ll start New York.","David Vernon","Makes perfect sense. Thanks a lot for the time.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Dave. That\u2019s going to conclude the analyst portion of the call and I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to Ned Walker, our Chief Communications Officer.","Ned Walker","Hey. Thanks very much, Jill, and good morning. Michelle, would you please review the process that members of the media can use to ask a question? Also, I\u2019d like to ask the media if they could limit themselves to one question and a brief follow up. That should allow us to get in as many questions as possible. Michelle?","Operator","Thank. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question we\u2019ll hear from Ted Reed with TheStreet.","Ted Reed","\u2026 taking the question. You guys noticed there\u2019s been a lot of controversy over the Qatar Airways CEO\u2019s comments about U.S. flight attendants and U.S. airlines. Do you have any reaction to those comments?","Ed Bastian","Ted, is this Ed. I was appalled to hear Akbar\u2019s comments about our people. I\u2019m told he has apologized, but I think that\u2019s locally inadequate. I think it goes -- there\u2019s a consistent theme there that he continues to want to skirt the rules and play by his own rules and I\u2019m glad the employee is not just of Delta, but of all the U.S. carriers spoke with one large voice to say that it\u2019s unacceptable, inappropriate. We have the best flight attendants in the world at Delta and I\u2019m very proud of them.","Ted Reed","Okay. Thank you. Second question for Glen briefly, you said that European business yields are up or the leisure yield is being affected by the explosion in low fare carriers to Transatlantic?","Glen Hauenstein","That\u2019s what we\u2019ve said in the comments, is that the strength in business demand has offset most of the leisure yield weakness.","Ted Reed","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move on to Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News.","Michael Sasso","Good morning. Can you just -- I heard someone say that there\u2019s, I think, a new policy of allowing Elites to use miles to pick their cabin. Can you just expand on that and is this the first quarter that that\u2019s taking effect?","Glen Hauenstein","Yeah. That\u2019s a very exciting new program and as we think about new ways for people to use their miles, we really don\u2019t want them to save them forever. We want them to control their own travel experience and find value in them today as opposed to just storing them away. And so for our highest Elites, we now offer that program. It\u2019s limited to reservations only now, but we\u2019re planning to bring that to the other distribution channels.","And when we say continuing to expand all of our products and services to as many distributions networks as possible, I think, that\u2019s indicative of how we see the value that we\u2019re going to create through these products and services expand over the next few years by bringing them to broader and broader audiences, and allowing people to control their own travel experience.","And so on a more broad perspective, we\u2019re actually excited about using miles for all ancillary revenues, not just for seat products, but for things like unaccompanied minor fees or pets in cabin and really make that currency come more and more alive to our customer base.","Michael Sasso","And one just follow up on unrelated topic, there was a report out of India a week or two ago about Delta being interested in Jet Airways kind of investment, were those reports accurate?","Ed Bastian","Mike, this is Ed. We don\u2019t comment on speculation.","Operator","And are you ready to move on to our next question?","Ed Bastian","We are.","Operator","Thank you. And next we\u2019ll hear from Alana Wise with Reuters.","Alana Wise","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks so much for taking the question. So I wanted to ask quickly about the Boeing-Bombardier spat that\u2019s going on and I\u2019m curious to know what impact of the decision by the ITC to impose tariffs on the C Series have on your order from Bombardier? And as a follow up, has Boeing\u2019s antidumping petition delayed or had any other impact on potential conversions, sorry, Delta for C Series options to confirm orders? Thank you.","Ed Bastian","Well, we can\u2019t comment on the dispute that\u2019s going on between Bombardier and Boeing. We\u2019ll let that play out. But what I can tell you is that we have no -- we do not intend to slow down any of the deliveries that we have planned for the C Series. We\u2019ll be taking our first this coming spring and we look forward to taking that aircraft and beyond that I\u2019ll let -- let\u2019s see how the dispute between those two parties comes together.","Alana Wise","Thanks so much.","Ned Walker","Okay. Right now we don\u2019t have anybody else in the queue for the moment. We\u2019ll pause a second to see if anybody wants to do a follow up. We\u2019ll pause just for a second. And if not, I want to say thank you, Ed, Glen, Paul, Steve and Jill. That concludes the June Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. We\u2019ll be back in October for the 3Q Earnings Call. Appreciate everybody\u2019s time today and hope everyone has a pleasant day. Thanks so much.","Operator","And that will conclude today\u2019s call.

My name is Kelly Ann, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Jill Sullivan-Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Kelly Ann. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our June quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are Richard Anderson, Delta's CEO; our President, Ed Bastian; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. We also have the entire leadership team here in the room with us for the Q&A session. Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and cash flow. [Operator Instructions]","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted, and you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at delta.com.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Richard.","Richard H. Anderson","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We recorded an $840 million pretax profit for the June quarter. We increased our earnings year-on-year by $255 million, grew passenger revenue by $63 million year-on-year, expanded our pretax margin by 2.6 points to 8.7%, generated operating cash flow of $1.3 billion and earned $0.98 per share, beating First Call consensus of $0.095 per share. We closed the Virgin Atlantic equity acquisition and ended the quarter with $5.7 billion in liquidity. The entire Delta team is executing well. Our results include $138 million year-to-date for profit-sharing, in addition to $45 million in year-to-date Shared Rewards payments.","I want to thank the Delta team for all the good work they do every day. Summer weather has been unusually difficult with repetitive thunderstorms around the country, and I want to particularly thank all of our flight attendants, pilots and airport personnel for providing fine service. We are aiming for a record profit-sharing payout on February 14, 2014, in recognition of the great job by all the Delta people. And we are on pace in our operations and customer service to have a full payout on Shared Rewards for 2013.","On the revenue front, we increased passenger revenues by about 1%, even though economic factors reduced fuel costs by more than 10% in the quarter, which resulted in almost $300 million in year-on-year fuel expense reductions. This is an important point. We increased our revenue base while fuel dropped $0.34 per gallon in the quarter. This illustrates the resilience of the Delta business model in a more rational industry environment. We intend to stay focused on closely managing our capacity to keep the fuel and revenue equation correct so as to expand margins. In that regard, Delta is consistently generating a revenue premium to the industry, with the June quarter at 108% of industry average. This is testament to the many initiatives we have underway to increase corporate share and to provide high-quality products, customer service and operations.","Our operational performance and customer service continues to lead the industry. We ran a DOT on-time arrival rate of 83%, a 99.8% completion factor, finished #2 in baggage performance and had the lowest number of DOT customer complaints for the month of May in Delta's history. On the cost side, the team has done a fine job accelerating the pace of structural cost initiatives. Our 2Q nonfuel CASM increase of 2.5% was a full 2 points lower than our guidance at the start of the quarter. We expect that positive trend to continue in our third quarter performance. We will continue strong execution on our structural cost initiatives as we recognize the requirement to maintain a unit cost advantage.","On fuel, operations at the Trainer refinery are going well. Our objective in purchasing the refinery was to reduce jet fuel cost for Delta, and the Trainer strategy is playing a role on the fuel savings we'll see this year.","We're also seeing significant benefits from debt reduction, which delivered more than $40 million in interest savings this quarter alone. We ended June with $10.4 billion of adjusted net debt, and we will achieve our $10 billion net debt target by the end of the year.","While these operational and financial results are among the best in our history, we will continue to expand margins and improve cash flows. We expect 2013 will be one of Delta's most profitable years ever. And for the third quarter, we are guiding our operating margin to 11% to 13%.","Beyond 2013, we have a number of initiatives underway to continue expanding our margins and cash flows that will continue to build a long-term sustainable franchise for all our stakeholders. We will continue to deliver new and innovative products, services and the best overall operation in the global industry, because running a consistently reliable operation with high-quality customer service is the most valued service we can bring our customers, particularly our important corporate customers.","As we look out on the remainder of the year, our forward revenue is strong and our cost management plan is ahead of budget, resulting in strong profitability and cash flow for 2013.","We will continue to manage our capacity conservatively as we've done over the past several years in order to prioritize profit margins and improving cash flows. The first half of 2013, our capacity was down overall, and we will be up slightly about 2% in the back half of 2013; for full year capacity, up less than 1%, below GDP growth. And we'll also remain disciplined with our capital as our track record on capital discipline can be seen in the $5 billion of free cash flow we've generated since 2010.","With our $10 billion net debt target in sight and a business that is consistently generating solid free cash flow, we announced our new capital deployment strategy in May. This plan follows a 5-year financial strategy and provides good benefits for our employees, customers and shareowners. Our shareholders will benefit from further debt reduction. Our new goal is a $7 billion net debt target. This will lower our interest expense to $500 million annually, take more risk off the balance sheet. Our employees will benefit from our deleveraging as we become a more financially stable and flexible company. This means industry-standard pay and benefits, along with excellent profit-sharing payouts and continued Shared Rewards payouts.","Our customers will benefit from the $2 billion to $2.5 billion annually or roughly 50% of our operating cash flow that we will invest back into the business. These investments will be made only for demonstrated returns with a minimum internal rate of return of at least 15%. Our board has also made the correct decision that the company is -- must again returning cash to our shareowners through both a quarterly dividend and a share buyback. With our $0.06 quarterly dividend beginning in September and a $500 million repurchase authorization, we expect to return more than $1 billion to our shareholders over the next 3 years.","So to conclude, we are looking at 2013 as a year of important goals obtained for Delta. We are on track to produce another record year of solid earning improvements. Our operational and customer service metrics are among the best in Delta's history and the top of the global industry. Later this year, we will hit our $10 billion net debt target and our return to -- and return cash to our shareholders. The plan is working, and we look forward to delivering more to our shareowners in the future.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed and Paul, and they can go through the details of the quarter with you. Thank you.","Edward H. Bastian","Thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Earlier, we announced a June quarter profit of $845 million, a $255 million improvement over the prior year. Our EPS was $0.98 per share, and our free cash flow in the quarter was $730 million. Passenger revenues for the quarter increased $63 million, with unit revenues flat on less than 1% capacity growth. Cargo revenues continue to be impacted by weakness in the global economy, with the yen devaluation contributing to a significant portion of that weakness. Our MRO revenues declined by $88 million from our decision to discontinue some lower-margin-producing contracts. Although this decision reduced revenues, it was margin accretive and a positive decision to take.","Our ability to increase passenger revenues against declining fuel prices is a sign of the strength of the demand environment that we are in and the success of our revenue initiatives. On the domestic front, unit revenues were down 1 point on slightly higher capacity. New York City yields and unit revenues year-over-year outpaced the system average, despite a 29% capacity increase from the LaGuardia expansion. Atlanta had solid performance for the quarter and generated 3 points of margin expansion compared to the prior year.","We're continuing to make good progress in increasing our corporate travel share. Corporate revenues increased 4% year-to-date and are up 8% in the last 4 weeks, driven by strength in the domestic market. The improving momentum we've seen throughout the quarter continues into our summer bookings. Banking and financial services have led all sectors in growth, posting double-digit year-over-year increases, proof that our efforts, especially in New York, are paying off.","On the trans-Atlantic, fares continue to improve, led by solid corporate share gains and growth in our hub-to-hub flying, contributing to a 2% unit revenue improvement for the quarter. Our Heathrow unit revenues led the pack by a sizable margin with a 10% improvement. And JFK to Europe unit revenues improved 4% for the quarter, outperforming all other hubs to Europe. Looking ahead, this performance level will build as we implement our Virgin Atlantic alliance.","Turning to the Latin entities. Load factor contributed a 1-point unit revenue growth against a 3-point increase in capacity. In Mexico, capacity rationalization, unit revenue growth in the beach markets and improvement in the business markets from our Aeromexico relationship contributed to a 6% unit revenue improvement. And revenues coming from our expanding GOL relationship continue to improve significantly year-over-year, despite a sluggish Brazilian economy.","Moving on to the Pacific. The 25% yen deterioration continues to negatively impact the beach markets, primarily in the Japanese point of sale, and we have proactively adjusted our beach capacity throughout the summer to offset this weakness. The yen devaluation and its impact on bookings negatively impacted the quarter's profit by a net $60 million, with an $85 million revenue impact net of hedges, partially offset by a $25 million benefit in expense. As we look into the fall in 2014, we expect to take further steps to rationalize Japanese capacity in light of the new economics of the weaker yen.","For the June quarter, our total unit revenues were at 108% of industry average, our ninth consecutive quarter of outpacing the industry in year-on-year improvement. That said, we still have a number of initiatives in place to build on that momentum going forward.","We closed on our Virgin Atlantic investment at the end of June and implemented the codeshare just a few days later. The codeshare has added 6 additional daily frequencies from New York to Heathrow, enabling us to fly our corporate passengers to the #1 destination between the U.S. and the U.K. We will also add nonstop flights between London and Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. And just yesterday, we announced plans to start service between Seattle and Heathrow starting in March.","Since the codeshare launched, more than $8 million in joint sales have been generated in just 3 weeks. We have made the antitrust immunity application needed to start a joint venture with Virgin, and we expect approval later this year, which will allow us to have the JV in place starting January 1.","The investment we're making in our international fleet is nearing completion. By the end of 2013, 85% of our international fleet will have flat-bed seating, and Delta will be the only U.S. carrier to offer audio-video on-demand product offerings at every seat on long-haul international flights. With the benefit of these and other product and commercial initiatives, we are committed to driving revenue improvements regardless of the fuel environment.","In terms of guidance, we're forecasting an operating margin of 11% to 13% for the September quarter, which would represent 2 points of margin expansion over last year. We've gotten off to a strong start to the summer season and had record revenue performance over the July 4 weekend, as the Sunday and Monday following the holiday became the second and fourth highest system revenue days in our history.","Corporate travel continues to be strong. In our most recent survey of corporate travel managers, 80% indicated their second half of the year spend on Delta will either be maintained at the same pace or increased on a year-over-year basis. We expect to post a 3% increase in year-over-year July unit revenues, with our improvements in August looking similar to what we've -- we're seeing in July. These gains are net of about 1 point of continuing weakness in Japan driven by the yen's devaluation.","On capacity, we expect the back half of the year to increase by approximately 2% compared to 2012. This growth is being driven by our upgauging strategy, which will allow us to produce these capacity levels with 16 fewer aircraft or about a 1.5% reduction in our fleet size. And despite this strong performance we're posting, we will remain cautious in our capacity plans, ensuring that our capacity grows at less than real GDP.","Before I hand the call over to Paul, I'll conclude by echoing Richard's comments that our results are a reflection of the hard work and dedication of our 80,000 employees worldwide. We truly have the best employees in the industry, and I want to thank them and congratulate them for a great quarter. Paul?","Paul A. Jacobson","Thanks, Ed and Richard. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us this morning.","As we laid out at our Investor Day in December, one of our major focus areas for 2013 was to address the rate of growth and our costs. The entire company has rallied around this effort, and our results show that we are successfully identifying opportunities through both our structural cost initiatives and tactical efforts to minimize cost growth and improve our margins. In addition, high completion factors, strong operational performance and a favorable mix of mainline and regional flying helped our June quarter costs, allowing us to both provide a superior experience to our customers while improving our unit cost performance.","Nonfuel costs increased 2.5% for the quarter, beating our initial guidance for the quarter by more than 2 points, driven by lower maintenance and savings initiatives throughout the organization. The positive trend in nonfuel unit cost performance is expected to continue in the back half of the year as our domestic re-fleeting begins. In the third quarter, we'll start taking delivery of 8 to 10 aircraft per month that will enable us to retire 14 mainline aircraft and more than 40 50-seaters by the end of the year. This will generate immediate savings in both maintenance and fuel costs by retiring these older and less fuel-efficient aircraft. This puts our nonfuel CASM growth for the back half of the year at less than 2%, 2 points lower than our original guidance. That also sets a solid foundation for our long-term goal of keeping cost growth between 0% and 2% annually beyond 2013.","Turning to fuel. Our fuel expense declined $290 million on lower market fuel prices and prior year hedge losses. Our all-in fuel price per gallon was $3.03, which included a $0.01 per gallon hedge gain and $0.05 per gallon loss at Trainer. Trainer's loss for the quarter was driven by the recent market volatility for RINs, which are required to comply with the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard, which impacts gasoline and diesel production. Without the higher RINs expense, Trainer would have broken even for the June quarter. We are working to mitigate this exposure on multiple fronts, including commercially and through Washington lobbying efforts.","There has been a change in fuel market dynamics since we restarted production at Trainer. Jet fuel is currently trading approximately $0.13 a gallon below diesel fuel compared to an historical premium. This change has partially been driven by an increase in the market supply of jet from Monroe's production, combined with other refiners' shift into non-RIN fuels. This has resulted in an overall reduction to our jet fuel expense, far exceeding our expectations and having a significant impact to our bottom line. We expect this market dynamic to continue, and we've also structured our hedge book to provide protection against significant market increases in crude while maintaining meaningful downside participation.","As of the July 19 forward curve, we are forecasting a September quarter fuel price of $3.05 to $3.10 per gallon, including the impact of the refinery and projected hedge gains. Looking ahead, the market dynamic between jet and diesel, coupled with the plans we have in place to receive 50,000 to 75,000 barrels per day of Bakken, means that there is more opportunity in store for us with our fuel strategy.","Shifting to cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and $730 million of free cash flow. Included in the operating cash flow is $500 million of pension contributions, including $350 million of accelerated payments. These contributions complete our required funding for the year.","Capital expenditures were $700 million and included the $360 million that we paid at the end of June to close on our investment in Virgin Atlantic. We expect CapEx for the September quarter to be $740 million, including the purchase of $140 million of aircraft off-lease.","We ended the quarter with adjusted net debt of $10.4 billion. We are on track to achieve our $10 billion target by the end of this year. Our interest expense for the June quarter was more than $40 million lower than prior year on lower debt levels and one we continue to improve as we continue to reduce our debt.","Our strong cash generation, combined with the progress we have made toward achieving an investment-grade balance sheet, allowed us to move forward with our new capital deployment plan and earned upgraded ratings from all 3 of the credit rating agencies. September will mark the initial return of cash to our shareholders with an approximately $50 million payment in the form of our $0.06 per share quarterly dividend.","We are proud of our performance during the first half of 2013. Our results have proven that we are focused on both the financial and operational aspects of our business, and that the same diligence we exercised in the first half will sustain us through the second half of the year. Thank you, again, to the entire Delta team for the efforts contributed across the system and for the performance that delivered the results this quarter. Jill?","Jill Greer","Great. Thanks, Richard, Ed and Paul. Kelly Ann, we're now ready for questions from the analysts. Would you please review the process for asking a question? [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First of all, I just wanted to follow up a little bit about the PRASM commentary. It sounds like sort of a very solid outlook for the summer. In the past, we've sometimes seen you add a little bit of layer of conservatism because of the uncertainty in modeling September this early. If you could just kind of speak to maybe what you're seeing to September to date, how the outlook looks. And is there some uncertainty or conservatism baked into the PRASM outlook, just to account for the natural volatility in that month?","Edward H. Bastian","All right. John, it's Ed. You're right, September is historically a fairly volatile month. I wouldn't say that we have a undue level of conservatism in the guidance or the forecast we provide you. But it is a month that's a little bit choppy. We have the holiday period, particularly in New York, that shifts the calendar around a bit. I'd say what we're seeing for September is very, very early and is very preliminary. It's encouraging. But the only guidance we can really give you with any concrete specificity is what we've said for July and August.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Fair enough. And if I can just ask a follow-up on capacity. Richard, I think last quarter, when we were sort of looking at a PRASM outlook that was a little bit less exciting at the time, you made the comment that you're prepared to make the necessary changes to the fall capacity in response to how market conditions evolved. Obviously, it seems like PRASM is tracking quite well. But I was hoping you could just sort of speak to how you see risk to capacity going forward, and give us confidence that we won't see kind of a surprise uptick in capacity growth in response to the great results that you're producing here.","Richard H. Anderson","Well, I think if you look at the history of our capacity management at Delta, we've always been pretty conservative, and that we have not changed our attack. I think as you look out, you can always expect that we will be conservative and well under in terms of capacity versus where GDP is. In the fall, we begin a pretty significant restructuring of the fleet, and the upgauging strategy commences. I think Ed commented or Paul commented on the significant number of 50-seaters that we have coming out of the fleet. And so the upgauging strategy will actually result in our having fewer airplanes over time in the total fleet. It's just our gauge is going to be up a bit. But that shouldn't be mistaken for any change in philosophy about how we manage capacity here. And I would just -- the last point I'd make is we have -- we still have a significant number of depreciated airplanes in our fleet. And so the marginal capacity is really easy for us to reduce pretty promptly in response to any conditions in the marketplace. So bottom line is, we are very focused on being certain that we're expanding margins, and capacity will continue to be one of the important levers in doing that.","Operator","We'll move next to Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a quick clarification on the pension piece. Paul, you talked about that you were done for the year. Now that doesn't include, I guess, it's up to what, $1 billion, but no more than $200 million per annum, that's still a possibility this year?","Paul A. Jacobson","Mike, when we talked about the additional opportunities for putting money into the pension plan, we're really beginning in 2014 and beyond. Hopefully, we believe that completes our contributions for the year.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the pension, just given the significant move in rates, if we were to look at where the discount rate is now, and I realize maybe this is rough, how much of an impact do you think -- a positive impact it has had on the size of the pension liability, just given that move over the past month or so?","Paul A. Jacobson","We estimate that the change in the pension liability, as a result of the discount rate changes, is probably $1.5 billion to $2 billion lower than it was at year end.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Perfect. And then just one last one, and maybe this is more to Ed, I believe you indicated that the margin improvement in Atlanta was 3 points better than a year ago. What's driving that? Is that -- is some of that a function of decisions and changes in the schedule by your competitor? Is some of that a change of gauge? I realize there's a lot of 50-seaters that have been moving out of the marketplace. I mean, that's a big move. How much of that is more structural or even competitive?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Mike, it's Glen. I think everything you just mentioned is going on in Atlanta. It's no surprise, and it's public information that our competitor continues to retrench in Atlanta. They're going to be down around 150 departures by the end of this year. Certainly, that's improved competitive environment for us here in Atlanta, as well as optimizing through the upgauge and through the reduction of our reliance on 50-seat equipment, which is first starting in Atlanta, primarily focused initially in Atlanta because of the flexibility we have here in terms of demand.","Operator","And David Fintzen with Barclays has our next question.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe one for Glen. Just -- I was curious sort of over the next couple of years, as competitors are working through integration and maybe the business, you're up against maybe a little more steady-state set of network competitors. I'm just curious how you think about the vulnerabilities in the network, so to speak. Or what are the parts of the network that you're really going to watch as the competition sort of evolves in the industry? Is it New York and L.A.? Or is it sort of corporate travel? What are the key places we should be watching as we're watching that play out?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Well, I think that each carrier has a different competitive environment they'll be facing in a consolidated industry. I think we're very excited about what we're facing with the integration of Southwest and AirTran. As that continues to move forward, [indiscernible] I guess somewhere around the first part of '15 is what they've announced. And the integration of American and US Air, we think all of that benefits the relative strength of us in the Southeast. And that's a very good tell [ph] of how we put ourselves in that region of the country. In New York, I think we feel very confident with the slots that we have in New York and the fact that we have a leading slot portfolio in New York, that we will continue to be -- will outpace the industry as we continue to improve our products and services in the New York City area. And on Detroit and Minneapolis, have been very, very steady over the past few years. We don't see any change to that and great profits in there for us. So as we look around our network, I think we're very excited about what the integration of other carriers will present to us in terms of opportunities. And that may not be the case for all of them. You'd have to ask them.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. No, I appreciate that color. And then maybe just a quick one, probably for Ed. The MRO business where you're getting out some of the lower-margin contracts, is that something we can expect to continue or is that pretty much complete now?","Edward H. Bastian","I think we've made the decisions we're going to take. So I think over the course of this year, you'll see some of that revenue decline. And then we're going to look, going forward, to selectively build back that operation.","Operator","And that will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of easy housekeeping items. Uncharacteristically, I can't actually find much to complain about this morning. Paul, you touched on the elevated price of RINs. I believe that phenomenon has only worsened in the last month or so. Can you give us some color as to what the anticipated expense in Q3 might look like?","Paul A. Jacobson","Jamie, we're not giving any guidance on the RINs. As you know, they've been incredibly volatile. [indiscernible] as much as 50x from the beginning of the year. We don't want to speculate where they're going to end up at the end of the quarter.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. Second question, how do you anticipate breaking out Virgin's contribution going forward? Any parameters that you could kind of put around them and their profitability would be helpful.","Edward H. Bastian","Well, we'll be -- Jamie, this is Ed. We'll be reporting our 49% ownership stake in the -- on a net basis. We haven't decided relative to what additional disclosure we've been making. As you know, Virgin is a privately held company, but we'll provide good transparency relative to Delta, the benefits we see from the relationship, both on the ownership level, as well as on the JV.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I'm going to try to sneak in a third since the first wasn't answered. Glen, any commentary on the state of relationships with Alaska Airlines right now vis-a-vis some of the capacity that you've added in Seattle? I certainly am not modeling for any sort of divorce in terms of the relationship there, though it's been suggested here and there that maybe both sides could, I don't know, enter a couples therapy in terms of trying to ease out some of the capacity issues. Any update on that?","Glen W. Hauenstein","We have a great relationship with our partner at Alaska Airlines. And we're so confident in it that we're continuing to build on our long-haul operations out of Seattle. And just yesterday, we announced that we would initiate nonstop service in conjunction with both Alaska and Virgin, between Seattle and Heathrow. And I think that really goes to the core of our confidence in our relationship with them, is that we're willing to continue to build our long-haul operations in Seattle where we see opportunities.","Operator","We'll hear next from Glenn Engel with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, to Glen. If I looked at the second quarter RASM, you outperformed on the Pacific by about 4 points. You underperformed on the Atlantic by 3 points. Can you talk about why the divergence? And touching on Seattle, can you talk about the strategy in Seattle and how that fits in with Tokyo?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Seattle and Heathrow? Well, I think in Seattle, what we're trying to do is...","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Seattle just in general, the hub versus the Narita hub.","Glen W. Hauenstein","Oh. Well, I think we've been very transparent that our Narita hub is really a great asset for Delta, and it will continue to be a great asset for Delta. But it is challenged by the environment that's around at the opening of Haneda. So I don't think we can count on that being our only way to get to Asia over the next decade or 2. So we've been proactively managing diversification of our Pacific portfolio over the last years, and we continue to do that. Not that Narita isn't an important destination, not that it isn't an important part of our network, but I don't think we should solely rely on that as that's really got some external factors that we may have to face at some point in time. So right now, we're flying about 50% of our trans-Pacific is not touching Narita. And you can consider that, that would be the opportunity for us to continue to grow in Asia, not to shrink Narita necessarily, but to grow the rest of Asia.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And the outperformance in the Pacific and underperformance at Atlantic versus the industry in the second quarter?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Quite honestly, given the fact that we don't report the hedge in the A4A data, I was surprised that given our reliance on Japan and the standpoint of sale, that our numbers went up in the Pacific. I think you have to ask other carriers why our numbers went up, really, given the fact that they're relying on the yen. And in the trans-Atlantic, we're dissecting that. We know that there were some out of periods on settlements, and we're trying to work with the A4A to clear that up so that it's easier for you and for us to understand, because we believe that the joint venture settlement should not be in the A4A results. They should be separate. We report ours separately. And I think we're working to get to some consensus so we can better understand how that works moving forward.","Richard H. Anderson","Glenn, we -- I just want to add on the trans-Atlantic. We were very pleased with our second quarter performance across [ph] the trans-Atlantic. So I agree with Glen. I think it's more of a function of some out-of-period adjustments. Some of the other periods may have had either in the prior year comps or in the current quarter as compared to Delta's performance. Our performance was very strong in the second quarter.","Glen W. Hauenstein","Very strong -- it was a great quarter..","Edward H. Bastian","We had some of our best margins on a combined basis with our JV partners that we've ever seen in the trans-Atlantic.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And 2 technical ones, regional capacity growth in the third and fourth quarter; and two, on the headcount side, is that distorted by adding Pinnacle? What would the mainline headcount look alone?","Richard H. Anderson","I don't have the regional headcount at furloughs [ph]. We can read that offline, and we can get back to you -- call you with this regional.","Edward H. Bastian","The regional capacity was going to be down.","Glen W. Hauenstein","Yes, regional capacity has been down, but we'll be -- we don't give typically that level of guidance dissected.","Operator","We'll move next to Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a question on Trainer real quick. I know that it's a small impact versus how much fuel has come down. But even without the RINs, you're breakeven, expected to be profitable. Is that just kind of short-term issues with spreads narrowing? And I think, in June, Bakken prices moved up, and how should we think about it going forward? I mean, is Trainer going to be kind of profitable net-net for the year or...","Paul A. Jacobson","Savi, it's Paul. We -- part of the Trainer performance, and when you look at the breakeven performance, is driven by the lower jet cracks that you've seen. This is and always has been a bit of a hedge against jet cracks as well. I think as we look at the WTI to Brent convergence that we've seen, we are still actively pursuing Bakken opportunities that we believe has a sizable opportunity compared to the import of the West African grades into the East Coast. So we do believe longer term that we can hit the profit objectives of the refinery overall. But we -- there's still a forward-view on gas cracks and the overall refining margin. Depending on what RINs do and crack spreads, we could see our way to breakeven performance for the year.","Edward H. Bastian","Yes, I think -- this is Ed, Savi. I think the volatility of RINs makes it pretty difficult to forecast a full term view looking at Trainer in isolation. But there's no question that this has served to be a great hedge on our overall jet fuel cost. And that's really what Delta looks at, our overall jet fuel cost. And with that, we've been quite pleased.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, that makes sense. On the breakout, regional capacity was down year-over-year, but your unit revenue was down as well. I was wondering what's happening there.","Glen W. Hauenstein","Well, we started to retire 50-seat equipment, and we're accelerating that as we get to the third and fourth quarter. That will -- the continuation, we will continue to have reductions in regional equipment. That is mostly being replaced by existing equipment. But as we get into the third and fourth quarters, we begin to take deliveries of the 717s. The 717s will start to replace a lot of the 76-seaters, which will replace the 50-seaters. So think of it as kind of a reverse cascade in terms of gauge. And as Richard mentioned and Ed mentioned, the actual fleet number despite -- will be down about 2% despite the fact that capacity is up 2%. And that will not only provide a better product for our customers, but some cost relief or cost assistance as the gauge continues to increase.","Operator","And Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research has our next question.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","I hate to beat the subject into the ground here, but on fuel, Paul, you said, in answer to I think it was Jamie's question, you didn't want to speculate on where RINs are going to end up. And I appreciate that. But should I take that to imply that the impact of that is not included in the fuel guidance of $3.05 to 3.10 for 3Q? Because I can't really figure out how you're guiding to such a low number, given where spreads are, given how you're hedged mostly in Brent. I'm just not getting that number with stock prices right now. Should I expect incremental upside risk to that after the calculation of RINs is included?","Paul A. Jacobson","Hunter, our expectations are built into that fuel price guidance, including our expectations of the hedge performance and the refinery for the third quarter. We can work with you on your model to figure out where some of your questions might be. But all of our expectations are built into that fuel guidance that we gave.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. So you're -- are you expecting hedge gains in 3Q in that $3.05, if you can -- we can take this offline if you want, but...","Paul A. Jacobson","Yes, sure.","Edward H. Bastian","Yes, we are.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And you answered Mike's question on pension in terms of the rate environment and the impact on the unfunded liability. But all else equal right now, can you help me quantify the impact it would have on CASM ex fuel on a full year basis? Maybe just -- I know there's a lot of moving parts, but maybe as you're looking to -- thinking about CASM and fuel in 2014, how much is the rate going to drive that down in the P&L?","Paul A. Jacobson","Hunter, the P&L for pension is set based on a full year basis at the beginning of the year. So any changes in the discount rate or interest rates would effect in 2014 and beyond.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Right. Yes. And that's been [ph] like if I were to take the rates right now and run a fully annualized basis, are we talking maybe like a full point of CASM-Ex or is it too early? I mean...","Paul A. Jacobson","No, no.","Operator","And Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research has our next question.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I'm wondering if you can talk a little further about Virgin. I guess, in particular, I'm just wondering where you're at with ramping up the JV and when the JV revenues might begin showing up in the monthly PRASM numbers? And I guess related to that, if the potential contribution from Virgin is included in your revenue and margin guidance, I guess, just given the London-Heathrow exposure, I'm thinking it has the potential to be a little material here.","Richard H. Anderson","Let me talk to the DOT process, and then Ed could go to the specifics. Our application for antitrust immunity with DOT was filed back in April. There were no oppositions filed by any other party. And we expect to get approval for antitrust immunity, which will be the basis of the JV, by the end of the summer. So that's proceeding apace. There have been no objections. And if you saw the approvals that we got from the DOJ and EU on the share acquisition, I think that really signaled the fact that from a regulatory perspective, it's very positive for consumers. So we don't expect any issues with respect to antitrust immunity application.","Edward H. Bastian","And to follow on what Richard was saying, Dan, this is that we're looking at a January 1 start date for the JV. That's our current expectation. And relative to revenues going forward, the Virgin revenues will stay within the Virgin financials. We won't have Virgin's revenue stream in the Delta consolidated revenue picture because we own less than -- less than 50% of that entity. The benefits from the JV will flow on the -- that flows to the Delta level [ph] will certainly show some improvements on our Heathrow numbers. And we'll also record the -- our net 49% of the Virgin earnings in our -- as a net line item within our P&L.","Paul A. Jacobson","It will be down and not up [ph].","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Understood. Okay, very helpful. And then secondly, I wonder if you can peel back the onion a little further on your corporate travel commentary. The stat, the statistic of 80% corporate travel spending, 80% flat to up. It sounds like the growth that you've seen over the past year is beginning to slow, but maybe that's a mis-read. I guess I'm wondering if you might be able to break that out on a same-store sales versus a share-gain basis. I know corporate travel spend has been getting -- bumping up or has been essentially lifted from the gains that you've made. Just wondering if you can help us peel back that onion a little bit.","Richard H. Anderson","Well, there's corporate share gains continue in our current quarter, as well as in our forward outlook. 8% growth is -- most of that is organic growth. We are continuing to pick up new accounts and new business as compared to the market growing at an 8% level. So we -- I don't think that I see any signs of slowing down relative to momentum. It's clearly choppy. So you've got some industries, such as our defense industry and the transportation industries that are actually down year-over-year, given what's going on in the their economies. We've seen great growth coming in the financial services and the banking sector. Technology in the current quarter is up double-digit gains. So we continue to be very, very encouraged by what we're hearing from our corporate travel managers, and it's a product in the operation. There are people providing us the real -- just the real story here.","Operator","We'll hear now from Helane Baker -- excuse me, Becker, with Cowen.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Just a question with respect to the new terminal at JFK. It opened in May, so you've had about 6 or 8 weeks, maybe 2 months of operations. And I was wondering if you could [indiscernible] how it's going, customer acceptance, and how CTB is doing in that terminal. One, for purely selfish reasons; and two, just because I've heard negative things about JFK overall. And yet, you have this fabulous new terminal, and I was wondering how it was going.","Richard H. Anderson","Well, I think, overall, it's going well. The -- we have very specific data from our customers about the experience through our email survey program, and then the use of that information to tailor our service and to tailor our operation, to be able to continue to improve customer satisfaction scores. And overall, the scores for the new facility are up significantly. I think the main challenge and candidly, I must say I think it's an embarrassment to our government that as much as we, as an industry, pay into customs and border patrol, that we have issues at not just JFK, but at Newark, at Chicago, at Los Angeles, where we cannot seem to get our government to perform the very basic service. And those of us that travel extensively around the world and go to countries like Japan and China and Europe, customs is a breeze. And in the U.S., despite all the investment that we make as an industry, we collect a fee from every passenger. We cannot get the kinds of levels of support that if we are going to grow our economy in the U.S., travel and tourism is an important part of that equation, and it's one that needs to be fixed. And that we're pursuing every avenue in Washington and in Congress to get this problem solved. The answer shouldn't be to outsource JFK to Abu Dhabi.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Right, right. I don't necessarily disagree. But still, CTB isn't doing its job. And I guess is that a job for the A4A to focus on, do you think?","Richard H. Anderson","The A4A is incredibly focused on it. Nick Calio is focused on it. We've actually gotten some appropriation language in Congress to increase the funding. And I think we -- the whole industry is -- has supported those efforts over the years. I participated in a Secretary of Commerce task force a couple of years ago that gave a whole series of recommendations in this regard to the Executive branch. And so far, we've -- our government's failed to provide the level of service that we should be providing if we want to see the third most important industry in the U.S., travel and tourism, continue to grow and contribute to a growing GDP.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate the analysis. Can I just ask one follow-up question with respect to Mexico and Aeromexico? I saw some comments they made yesterday in their press release for their earnings that they were building a hub in Monterey. And I was kind of wondering how you will participate in that, if at all.","Edward H. Bastian","Helane, this is Ed. You'd really need to go Aeromexico for that. We're really not at liberty to talk about their plans on our call.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Oh, okay. I was just kind of wondering how you guys were going to participate, but that...","Edward H. Bastian","We're not -- we don't have any plans to participate in that.","Operator","We'll move on to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just on your fuel hedge, sorry to come back to that. But refinery aside, can you just walk us through your hedge positions for 3Q and 4Q, and what the strike prices are on that?","Paul A. Jacobson","Duane, it's Paul. We don't give specific guidance as to the strike prices. I'd say we're generally about 60% hedged at current levels. And like we said earlier, we expect some hedge gains in the third quarter. Our level of hedge gains in the third quarter, Duane, are -- today's level is about $40 million net of premium, just to give you an indication.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just on the strong nonfuel cost performance, I wondered if we could dig into heavy maintenance a little bit. And specifically, has your approach on engine overhauls changed at all? And I'm not sure if you're willing to share this, but if we looked at maybe 2 buckets, engine overhaul expense plus engine CapEx last year, how do you view those 2 buckets changing into '13?","Paul A. Jacobson","Certainly. It's Paul. There are really 2 pieces to the engine maintenance strategy going forward. One, we have taken advantage of significant part-out opportunities. As we mentioned in our last quarter call, CapEx opportunities to acquire older airplanes and harvest them for parts has provided significant savings for us going forward in terms of a lower cost basis for the overhauls that we have. And secondly, as we talked about a part of our structural cost initiatives, we expect substantial savings as we -- we're basically no longer doing any engine maintenance on 50-seat engines for the foreseeable future as part of that retirement strategy.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","How big is that bucket, Paul, if you can help us? I mean, what was the magnitude of your expense last year on engine overhauls or 50-seat engine overhauls?","Paul A. Jacobson","Let me try to address it in a much -- we don't usually break down our specific P&L expense by engine type. But take it up a level and if you think about CapEx and what's required according to what the OEMs say, typically, the OEMs want a carrier to carry somewhere between 11%, 12%, 13% of spare engines versus what's installed. So if you had -- the OEM model is -- if you have 100 engines, they would expect you to own 112 engines. At Delta, because of part-out buying airplanes on the marketplace, our engine overhaul facility's turn times and cycle times, we have a target of a 5% spare ratio. So our goal is to continue to drive down the work in process and the investment, the overall investment in tech ops, parts and capital. And so it's a series of used equipment, PMA authority, cycle times in the engine shops are the best in the world now at Delta. And what that all results in is a significant reduction in the amount of spare engines versus the OEM model.","Operator","And that will be from Bob McAdoo with Imperial Capital.","Bob McAdoo - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","This is a quick one. Back to the issue of the regional carriers, I know what you talked about going forward. But can you explain why the RASM for regional carriers was down in the recent quarter?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Yes, Bob, it's Glen. It's really related to a significant upgauge as we take out 50-seaters and rely more heavily on 76-seaters. The margins actually expand. And as you know, when you buy the airplanes for long term, we're not buying them for day 1. But the fact that we were able to upgauge the regional fleet and achieve margin expansion, I think it's a testament to we're on the right path.","Bob McAdoo - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","So margin expand, but because of bigger airplanes, you got a few more discount [indiscernible]...","Glen W. Hauenstein","That's it. The RASM goes down slightly, but the CASM goes down dramatically.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Bob. Kelly Ann, that's going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. And I'm going to turn it over to Ned Walker for the media section.","John E. Walker","Thanks very much, Jill. Kelly Ann, if you could please review the process for asking questions, that would be very much appreciated. [Operator Instructions] With that, Kelly Ann?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Darren Shannon with Aviation Week.","Darren Shannon","I'm looking for some more guidance on the sector breakdown on capacity, both 3Q and 2H. If you could just give me mainline and regional, I'd be happy. But if you go deeper, I'd be very happy.","Richard H. Anderson","Well, I think the guidance that we've already given in the press release is as deep as we go in terms of forward-guidance.","Operator","We'll move next to Kelly Yamanouchi with the Atlanta Journal Constitution.","Kelly Yamanouchi","In terms of margin expansion in Atlanta, are there any particular markets where you've gotten the biggest gains? Is it a sign of more business travel gains?","Richard H. Anderson","Kelly, we don't break our margins out by specific route. I think suffice it to say that the employees at Delta are doing such a phenomenal job delivering great service to people in Atlanta that we see our gains across the board.","Kelly Yamanouchi","Okay, great. And is there any opportunity for significant capacity increases?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, I mean, we just stick to the capacity guidance that we've given in terms on a system level. And that's the extent of the capacity guidance that we give going forward.","Operator","And David Koenig with Associated Press has our next question.","David Koenig","Mr. Anderson, your yield was basically flat. And also, today, US Airways' consolidated yield was down 2.8%, kind of on a flip open capacity. But what does that say about the pricing environment that you saw in the quarter that just ended?","John E. Walker","David, it's Ned. We lost you at the very beginning. Could you restate the question? We were unable to...","David Koenig","Sure. Sure. I was just mentioning that your yield is pretty flat here. And the US Airways' consolidated yield was down nearly 3 points, 3%, now they did have a rise in capacity. What -- my question was what that -- what those yield figures say about the pricing environment that you saw in the quarter that just ended?","Glen W. Hauenstein","I think we're very excited about business travel. We're very excited about core demand, enthusiastic about it. Of course, there is a correlation to fuel, right? And when fuel goes up, airline ticket prices have do go up as well. And as fuel came down, airline ticket prices on the margins would go down a bit. But that had really nothing to do with core demand and margins expanded. So I wouldn't really correlate that -- those small yield declines to any kind of yield core deterioration in the long term.","David Koenig","Will the industry ever break that link with oil prices and fares?","Glen W. Hauenstein","I don't think we want to. It's a margin, Dave, so it's not an oil price to -- and that's what I think the industry's been able to achieve. And I think that's why we think it's a pretty good environment right now.","Operator","Our next question will be from Mary Jane Credeur with Bloomberg News.","Mary Jane Credeur","How long does Delta's contract with BP and ConocoPhillips for Trainer go? And are you able to adjust or renegotiate those terms at all because of the rising RIN costs?","Paul A. Jacobson","Mary Jane, this is Paul. When we announced the transaction, we said we have entered into 3-year deals with ConocoPhillips and BP around the refinery. We're not going to comment on any specific contractual provisions in our relationship between them.","Mary Jane Credeur","Okay. And could you elaborate a little bit more perhaps, Ed, on the underlying strength on domestic business? You talked about the core strength there. How much of that is -- what sectors are driving that, banking, tech? Is there any pattern to regions that are particularly strong, Northeast, New York area, et cetera?","Edward H. Bastian","You did a good job of answering your own question there, Mary Jane. Obviously, our growth in New York has contributed a lot to the strength we're seeing domestically. We've done well here in Atlanta. I'd say on an industry profile, technology, manufacturing has picked up in terms of our corporate revenues from our manufacturing base has been strong as high single digits. And -- but the overwhelming lion's share of the improvement is coming from the financial services and the banking sector.","Operator","That would be from Karen Jacobs with Reuters.","Karen Jacobs","My question was also about the revenue environment, which was addressed with some of the questioners already. I was just hoping you could expand on the revenue environment you're seeing, and if you could address the difficulty you've had in raising fares this year.","Richard H. Anderson","Karen, I'd say the revenue environment is really solid. We mentioned that our summer bookings are strong, our unit revenues are up 3% in July, and we expect a similar performance for August. So I'd say everything we're seeing in the revenue environment is solid and quite stable.","Karen Jacobs","Okay. And I mean, what's with fares now? Is it harder to raise fares these days?","Richard H. Anderson","We did not and cannot speculate on forward decisions with respect to our pricing of airfares.","Karen Jacobs","Okay. I only asked the question because I know the company has tried to raise fares this year about 5 times, but hasn't been successful with most of those.","John E. Walker","Okay. Hey, thanks very much again. Richard, Ed, Paul, Glen and team, thank you very much for your comments. And this concludes our June quarter conference call. We'll be back in 3 months with our September conference call. Thank you very much, everyone. Bye-bye.","Operator","Again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you, all, for joining us."],"7268":["Delta Air Lines, Inc.

My name is Jake, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Jake. Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our June quarter earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta\u2019s performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with the review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the IR page at ir.delta.com.","And with that, here\u2019s Ed.","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.","Our record June quarter financial and operating results demonstrate The Delta Difference in action. We\u2019re translating our powerful brands, unmatched competitive advantages and pipeline of initiatives to drive earnings growth, margin expansion and solid returns for our owners. Earlier today, we reported a June quarter pre-tax profit of $2 billion with earnings increasing 32% to $2.35 per share. We expanded operating margins by more than 2 points and generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow.","We continue to run the best operation in the global industry by far. To-date, we\u2019ve achieved 82 days without a single cancellation across the Delta system, a 26% improvement over last year\u2019s record performance. And for our mainline product, we\u2019ve already reached 153 days without a cancellation. This reliability combined with the great service our people provide is translating to more customers than ever choosing Delta. As a result, we ran the highest load factors in our history and flew a record 53.9 million passengers in the June quarter. And even with these record volumes, this was the first time in our history that Delta had zero involuntary denied boardings for an entire quarter. This strong demand drove an 8.7% improvement in our topline and total revenue of $12.5 billion, which marked the highest quarterly result in our history, and our momentum continues to build.","We experienced five of the top ten revenue days in our history just over the last 30 days. With our people consistently delivering best-in-class travel experiences for our customers, we are seeing our net promoter scores reach new heights and our brand affinity growth. We have the world\u2019s most valuable airline brands, one that\u2019s mentioned not just among the best global airlines but also alongside top consumer brands. The essence of our brand is a sign of the trust and preference we\u2019re earning from our customers through operational excellence and unmatched service.","Our people are the very best in the business and they are Delta's strongest competitive advantage. They keep climbing, improving year-after-year because our customers count on us to connect them to moments that matter around the world every day. And not only do they serve our customers, but they continue to get back to the communities where they live, work and serve.","Earlier this week, Delta was recognized by the American Red Cross as the number one corporate blood donor in the country for the second year in a row. This is a fantastic accomplishment. And I want to say congratulations and thank them for their service. So far this year, we have accrued $739 million towards next Valentine\u2019s Day profit sharing.","Across the business, we are harnessing Delta's strength and quality and innovation to drive improvements in the customer experience, stronger customer loyalty and profitable global growth. Delta's financial foundation and cash generation are allowing us to sustainably invest across the business at a level no competitor can match.","During the first half of the year, we generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, more than what we produced in all of 2018, positioning us to achieve $4 billion in free cash flow in 2019. We are investing for the future to ensure that our customer experience and brand continue to elevate while ensuring our employees have the right tools to continue to provide best-in-class customer service.","One example is the transformation of our domestic narrow-body fleet, which is exciting, and Glen will cover the substantial benefits we expect this to deliver to our customers as well as to our owners.","On the airport front, we'll invest over $12 billion in terminal facilities that are key hubs over the next five years. This fall, we will achieve a major milestone in New York as we open Concourse G, the first of four new Delta concourses included in our $3.9 billion project at LaGuardia. By taking control of the construction process, we've been able to build a more efficient facility focused on meeting the needs of our customers, and by utilizing our investment-grade balance sheet that facility will have a long-term competitive cost advantage.","We're also making meaningful investments in our customer-facing technology. Delta.com is one of the top e-commerce sites in the U.S. and we continue to add functionality, not only to our site but also to our Fly Delta app. These are our fastest growing distribution channels with the highest customer satisfaction as more customers are choosing to interact directly with us.","Our technology investments are helping us deliver more customized offers and enabling our employees to further differentiate our level of service.","Through our single view of the customer technology stream, we are increasingly personalizing interactions, celebrating milestones and engaging with our customers through their preferred channels as we deepen our customer relationships.","We're also continuing to enhance our onboard experience. We just announced that starting in November, we will launch an industry-leading, reinvented international Main Cabin experience that will make every customer feel even more valued. We are also taking steps to provide more options for spending time in-flight.","During the quarter, we took the first steps towards bringing free Wi-Fi to life by completing a two-week test, and we'll conduct more testing in the months ahead to create an experience customers prefer. We are committed to providing the best in-flight entertainment in the sky. It will be another point of differentiation.","And finally, as part of the foundation for a global franchise, we have built $2 billion equity portfolio of strategic partners. The most recent addition was our 4.3% investment in Hanjin KAL, a largest shareholder of Korean Air. We intend to increase our stake to 10%, pending regulatory approval. This investment supports the stability and growth of our joint venture with Korean, an important piece of our long-term Pacific strategies.","So, in summary, we\u2019re executing well, and we have confidence in our continued momentum. As a result, we are raising our full-year earnings guide to $6.75 to $7.25 per share, which is a 25% improvement over last year\u2019s EPS. We also announced the Board\u2019s decision to raise our quarterly dividend by 15% to $0.4025 per share. This is the sixth year in a row that we\u2019ve increased the dividend and this increase represents a 2.7% yield at yesterday\u2019s price. Importantly, it demonstrates the sustainability of the Delta business model and our shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. We\u2019ve also raised our total shareholder return expectations for 2019 to $3 billion on the strength of our free cash flow results and our expectations for the rest of this year. The business has positive momentum with significant opportunity ahead.","We have a durable foundation of strategic advantages, our culture, leading operational reliability and unrivaled network, our loyalty program and relationship with American Express and an investment grade balance sheet. These advantages combined with a great brand powered by the very best people in the business provide the engine to drive meaningful long-term value for our customers, our employees and our owners.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Glen and Paul to discuss the details of the quarter.","Glen Hauenstein","Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone.","I\u2019d like to start by thanking the Delta team. Exceptional operational performance and unmatched service our people provide are the reason why more customers than ever are choosing to fly Delta. Their hard work enabled a record revenue quarter with a $1 billion increase over the prior year. The 8.7% growth in the June quarter is the seventh consecutive quarter of topline growth of 7% or more, a level that is more than 2 times GDP.","Demand for Delta remains strong, both our onboard products and our SkyMiles currency. Our investment in products, airport service and reliability are reshaping customer perception and driving record satisfaction scores. This increasing brand affinity supports our revenue premium to the industry which remains at more than a 110%. Premium product revenues were up 10% to more than $4 billion, 7% increase in premium capacity. With more customers choosing these products and improved distribution, premium paid load factors increased by 3 points year-over-year.","The loyalty revenues grew 19% to $1.2 billion including a roughly $100 million benefit from the American Express contract renewal announced in April. Our loyalty program and relationship with American Express are key drivers of our business and remain sources of true long-term competitive advantage. New acquisitions of SkyMiles members this year are on track to increase at a rate double that of just three years ago, and more and more of our members are signing up for the SkyMiles American Express cards. But most importantly, customer satisfaction among our loyalty members is at record levels.","During the quarter, spend on our co-brand cards and mileage uses, both increased double digits. More customers are using Miles as currency to upgrade their experience post purchase. This new functionality has been very well received and is exceeding our expectations with over 0.5 million members using this option since launch earlier this year. Both leisure and business travel demand remained robust and have improved relative to the March quarter. The shift in Easter to April and peak summer travel season contributed to strong leisure volumes and record load factors.","Corporate revenues remained healthy, increasing 6% for the quarter. This was driven by domestic up 8% versus prior year. In our most recent corporate travel survey, 83% of travel managers expect to maintain or increase their air travel spend this quarter. This is consistent with last year as pockets of the international softness in the automotive and manufacturing industries are being offset by strength in healthcare, technology and financial service sectors.","Cargo revenues declined 17% on both lower volumes and yield as industry capacity continues to outstrip demand. We are actively implementing strategies to mitigate this impact, but are very cautious on the cargo outlook for the remainder of the year.","Turning to specifics on unit revenues in the quarter. Total unit revenues were up 3.8%, above our guidance on 4.7% higher capacity. Passenger unit revenues were up 2.9% over prior year, sequentially improving 2 points compared to the March quarter, driven by strong demand.","Domestic revenues grew 8.8% with 3.6% higher PRASM. This is the best domestic performance in nearly five years with unit revenue growth in every half. Boston led the system with revenues up 25% over prior year on a 10% improvement in unit revenues. Now with over 140 departures a day, Delta is increasingly the airline of choice for Boston travelers.","Internationally, revenues grew by 5.3% as we offset a 1.5-point currency headwind to increase our unit revenues by 1.1%. While Pacific revenue performance was softer than our initial forecast, we were able to maintain our margin performance versus prior year. We see opportunity for profitability to improve as we continue to execute on our multi-year Pacific restructuring. Additional commentary on the entity performance for the June quarter may be found in this morning's press release.","Looking forward to the September quarter, total revenue is expected to increase 6% to 7% on a 1.5% to 3.5% improvement in unit revenues. July is off to a great start with a new number one system revenue day -- last Sunday or this Sunday?","Jill Greer","This past Sunday.","Glen Hauenstein","This past Sunday. Okay. While underlying passenger demand remains strong, sequentially, we expect TRASM to see about 1 point pressure from the Easter holiday timing and a slight deceleration in the transatlantic. Domestic, corporate and leisure demand remains strong. Premium product growth should continue to lead to Main Cabin as we monetize the investments we have made in improving the customer experience.","In international, currency headwinds are beginning to moderate in the back half of the year as we lap U.S. dollar strength. Atlantic unit revenue is expected to be roughly flat over prior year as strong U.S. point of origin demand and stable corporate trends are offset by some softer European leisure demand.","In the Pacific, we expect unit revenue declines will be similar to the June quarter, but should begin to moderate later this year as we lap foreign exchange headwinds and as our comp ease.","Latin is positioned to remain our best performing international entity as strength continues in both Brazil and Mexico, and we expect system capacity to grow by 4% in the September quarter on modest decline from our first half run rate. Full year capacity is trending slightly above 4%, including additional capacity from higher completion factor, incremental joint venture flying to assist our partners with grounded airplanes and increased charter flying.","I'd like to congratulate our charter team on an outstanding quarter and strong year-to-date performance. As we think longer term, our opportunities lie in leveraging both our brand and our scale to grow our revenues, expand Delta's competitive advantages and differentiate the perception of Delta in the minds of our consumers. We're targeting our capacity and markets with the best growth potential, improving the efficiency and profitability of our core hubs though upgauging.","While the last 10 years were spent fundamentally transforming our domestic hub substructure, we are currently in the midst of the most significant fleet evolution in Delta's history. We are focused on getting the right aircraft on the right routes, allowing us to deliver leading customer service, focused products and services and expanding our margins. With over 200 narrow-bodies set to deliver over the next four years, we are building a more efficient fleet that best serves the scale of our network. These are larger gauge aircraft with a higher percentage of premium seats which help drive Delta's margin profile.","Our fleet transformation extends to the international entities as well. Not only will our fleet become more efficient with new deliveries, our entire international fleet will have upgraded interiors including Premium Select and Comfort Plus by the end of 2021.","The improved international products combined with efforts to create a more seamless experience for our customers flying within our partner network, gives us confidence in our global ability to continue to drive profitable growth. The scale of our global network, product investments and Delta's best in class service are the foundation for our revenue premium and underlie the improved economics of our recent American Express agreement; that agreement alone should drive a nearly $7 billion contribution by 2023, double to what we saw in 2018.","In closing, we expect strong demand to continue throughout the rest of the year. Our first half results and pipeline of initiatives give us strong confidence to again raise our revenue growth target to 6% to 7% for the full year. As pleased as we are with the record June quarter result, we're even more excited about our great runway opportunities.","And with that, I'll turn it over to my good friend, Paul. ","Paul Jacobson","Thanks, Glen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you again for joining us this morning.","Our results through the first half of the year show that we're delivering against our Investor Day plan to drive both, topline growth, margin expansion and continue to return consistently to our owners.","In the first half of the year, revenue has grown by 8%, our operating margins have expanded by 200 basis points, and we\u2019ve grown earnings per share by 30%. We\u2019ve also generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow, more than all of 2018 with $2 billion of that going back to shareholders.","Our after-tax ROIC on a trailing 12-month basis is 15.3% as the investments we have made are driving strong returns. These results give us confidence to raise full year revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance. For the full-year, we're on track to deliver 6% to 7% topline growth, at least a 150 basis points of margin expansion and 25% EPS growth. With results to date and updated expectations for the full year, we now expect to return $3 billion to shareholders in 2019. This is a $500 million increase above our initial plan outlined at Investor Day.","Turning to June quarter results. We set a June quarter record with pretax income of $2 billion. Our operating margin of 17.1% was 2.3 points higher than last year; our pretax margin of 16% was the highest we've achieved in two years. We\u2019re firmly on track to exceed our target for full year margin expansion and now expect at least a150 basis points of improvement versus 2018.","We continue to deliver solid cost performance with efficiency gains throughout our operations, fleet transformation and One Delta initiatives all contributing. For the June quarter, non-fuel unit costs were up 1.4%, in line with our guidance of 1% to 2%. This included approximately $60 million of pressure due to higher depreciation expense associated with our decision to accelerate the retirement of the MD-90 fleet by two years to the end of 2022. This impact is largely limited to the June quarter as 31 aircraft were permanently retired. We will retire another nine of these aircraft by year end and expect MD-90 depreciation to moderate in future periods.","One Delta is enabling a more efficient approach to our ongoing fleet transformation as well. The team has identified a number of opportunities to drive incremental efficiency gains as we transition aircraft into and out of the fleet, minimizing friction cost from operating small sub-fleets. We will continue to realize fleet simplification benefits as we reduce and exit another fleet type in the MD-90. And as we induct new aircraft such as the A330-900neo, we\u2019re streamlining entry into service to minimize unproductive time. This enables crew efficiencies through better training and scheduling management and drives incrementally higher ROIC through less idle time on the asset.","Non-fuel unit costs increased 0.6% in the first half of the year, giving us confidence in our full year CASM-Ex guide of approximately 1%. In the back half of 2019, we faced tougher cost comparisons from last year\u2019s performance as well as decelerating capacity growth.","While fuel was volatile during the June quarter, Brent prices remained below prior year levels. Total fuel expense decreased $35 million on 4% lower market fuel prices. Refinery profits of roughly $40 million were flat to last year. Our re-fleeting and One Delta initiatives drove a 1.6% improvement in fuel efficiency in the June quarter and we expect a 2% fuel efficiency gain for the full year. Non-operating expenses for the quarter were $60 million higher than prior year due to lower pension income and a decline in our equity partner earnings. For the full year, we now expect non-operating expense to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million. This is above prior expectations due primarily to these lower partner earnings.","For the September quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.40 per share, up 25% versus prior year\u2019s midpoint. This equates to a pretax margin of 14.5% to 16.5% comparing favorably to last year\u2019s 13.6% result. This includes an expectation for non-fuel unit cost growth of 1% to 2% and all-in fuel price of $1.95 to $2.15 per gallon. This is down from last year and similar to the June quarter. Our guidance includes an approximately $40 million contribution from the refinery this quarter, which is expected to benefit the September quarter fuel price per gallon by roughly $0.04.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. Adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR of 1.7 times is at the low end of our target leverage ratio of 1.5 to 2.5 times. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to proactively address our pension obligation with a voluntary $500 million contribution in the June quarter. We generated $3.3 billion of operating cash flow and reinvested $1.4 billion into the business during the June quarter. This produced free cash flow of $1.8 billion, bringing our first half free cash flow to $2.5 billion. This represented conversion of more than 100% of net income, nicely ahead of last year, benefited by both top-line growth and margin expansion. Our strong first half performance sets us up to achieve $4 billion in free cash flow for the full year and we expect the net income conversion of nearly 90%. This includes our expectation for full year CapEx of $4.5 billion, which is unchanged from initial guidance provided in Investor Day.","Our healthy balance sheet and cash generation enable us to consistently return cash back to our owners, while also investing in the future growth of the Company. During the quarter, we returned $497 million to shareholders. Including the accelerated buyback earlier this year, total shareholder returns are just over $2 billion through the first six months of the year. We funded our accelerated buyback in the first quarter with a $1 billion short-term loan. With cash flow running ahead of plan, we completed repayment of the short-term facility earlier than anticipated.","Since first announcing our capital allocation strategy in 2013, we have returned more than $14 billion to owners. We've reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 25% and increased our dividend for six consecutive years. But importantly, we've done that while also investing in our business and our people. Additionally, we're maintaining low debt levels and improving the funded status of our pension plans as part of our commitment to maintain our investment grade credit ratings.","Our consistent repurchase activity and 15% dividend increase in the third quarter demonstrate our continued strong conviction on the durability and sustainability of our business model. These results are a validation of our unrivaled network, our dedicated people and our powerful brand. Our competitive advantages continue to deliver industry-leading results and drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Paul. Jake, we're ready for questions from the analysts, if you could give the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will begin with Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Linenberg","Yes. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Yes. So, I have one and one follow-up. Just I guess the first one to Glen. You called out the strength in Boston. And I think over this last quarter, I think Boston was maybe officially announced [ph] as a hub. I think there was also some press out about maybe some other focus cities like Nashville and Austin. As we think about your domestic capacity growth in 2019, Glen, will more of it be allocated to these focus cities or newer hubs, or how should we think about the split across your system?","Glen Hauenstein","Great question, Mike. I think, Boston is a true focus city for us that we have commitments over the next year, year and half to take our departure levels up towards 200. For those of you who are familiar with our Boston operation, we have shared our terminal with various carriers over the years. And we will take over the entire terminal, starting late this summer, will allow us to continue to grow in Boston. And what we've been focused on is making our hubs more efficient so we can drive higher earnings and targeting those cities that are high growth. And Boston, Seattle, Austin, Nashville, Raleigh, all fit that profile of cities where growth and growth for air travel is significantly higher than they are across the system in general. So, that's really been our thoughts to continue to grow where markets are growing and to continue to make our existing hubs more efficient.","Mike Linenberg","Okay, great. And just then jumping over to Paul on the pension, the $500 million contribution. Is there any more -- are you required to contribute more this year? It sounds like maybe you went above and beyond what you were required to. And where is -- what\u2019s the funded status of the pension at this point, if you could? Thanks.","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. So, all the contributions that we made are voluntary. As we\u2019ve talked about at Investor Day with airline relief, we have fully completed all of our required funding through 2024. But we remain committed to try to achieve an 80% funded status by the end of 2020. Right now, we're in the low to mid-70s. The plan is performing very well, in line with equity markets globally, and we expect to be a good year on the return front.","Operator","We will now move to the next question and that will come from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.","Jamie Baker","Good morning, everybody. First question, either for Glen or for Gil; it\u2019s a hypothetical. If you had a substantive portion of your fleet grounded right now, from an operational perspective, what would be the most intelligent and profitable way for Delta to reintroduce aircraft in a manner that wouldn\u2019t prove detrimental to RASM? Simply hypothetical, how would Delta phase grounded aircraft back into its operation? Hopefully I'm asking in a way you're comfortable answering.","Ed Bastian","Hey. Jamie, this is Ed. Actually I\u2019m going to jump to line. I\u2019m going to answer it. We know what you are asking, and it\u2019s really not appropriate for us to be speculating as to what the other carriers ought to do. It's clear that Max has been a real -- it\u2019s had a dramatic impact on our industry. I think the reintroduction when the time comes is going to have to be carefully managed, no question. But in the interim, we're going to continue to watch and see the development there. But, I don\u2019t think we should be looking to second guess or call out the current or the expected actions of our competitors.","Jamie Baker","Second probably for Paul. So, you continue -- Delta continues to demonstrate that it's possible to grow revenue at a rate nicely ahead of that of capacity which of course lays ways to the long-held view that that wasn\u2019t possible. Similar to my question last quarter, could you rank order what drives this. I assume loyalty is probably the biggest driver, but we\u2019ve had significant consolidation. There's a phenomenon of segmentation, there is consumer shift from goods to services. I'm just trying to understand the drivers and better hopes of predicting the sustainability of this trend given that it is a new trend.","Glen Hauenstein","Jamie, it\u2019s Glen. I think, all those things that you just mentioned are contributors to it. It is not one thing. And it is, while we are really about the American Express transaction, that is not the key driver within the quarter but excellent performance. I think as much being able to charge for products, being able to understand where people want to fly, being able to put the right products and services in those markets and being able to charge customers to what they're willing to pay us for it. And I think it\u2019s a combination of everything you just mentioned.","Jamie Baker","Okay... ","Ed Bastian","Jamie, this is Ed. I\u2019ll just chime in on Glen\u2019s response as well. This is a growing business. I think for years people wondered whether it was a mature business. But, when you think about what consumers are looking to go, and whether it\u2019s as you, the millennial, impact of wanting experience versus ownership, whether it\u2019s the baby boomer segment that\u2019s looking to explore, I think technology has had a huge impact here. People are more aware of the world than ever before, people are more interested in seeing the world and connecting with the world than ever before. And as the best performing airline in a market that\u2019s growing a multiple GDP, we\u2019re really well positioned to see this continue to grow into the future. And all the other actions that you talk of more tactics in terms of how we continue to drive a greater value back to consumers, but I think the fundamental demand for this product in this business is very, very strong. And we\u2019re capitalizing on it.","Jamie Baker","And if I could just squeeze in a third question, since you deflected -- understandably deflected the first. Just getting back to Mike\u2019s question about Boston and reiterating a question I asked about 11 years ago, how do you define hub?","Ed Bastian","I think a hub is a place that we connect traffic. And an endpoint clearly is the opposite of a hub. And so, to the extent that we\u2019re beginning to connect traffic and more and more traffic over Boston, we would consider it hub. This year, we\u2019re connecting almost a 1,000 people a day from the U.S. to Europe over Boston for example with our partners started new service from Boston to Asia. Now, I think when you think about our ability to connect people through a city that\u2019s what we define as a hub.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Take care.","Operator","We\u2019ll now hear from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Good morning. Thanks for the time. Glen, I wanted to come back to some of your comments and I guess Ed\u2019s as well. But, in particular when you think about the divergence you\u2019re seeing in cargo and passenger; is that something you\u2019ve seen before as cargo, maybe a leading indicator of potential rollover? I'm just trying to get more and more comfortable with the demand outlook as we\u2019re looking forward.","Glen Hauenstein","Well, any of us could take that Rajeev. Cargo is not -- certainly not a big contributor to the total revenues. It\u2019s probably less than 2% of our total revenue base. The impact we\u2019re seeing in airfreight has been across the industry, not just the airline industry but the major freights and express companies are seeing those same impacts. I think a lot of the reduction currently is due to the big inventory build last year in advance of the tariffs and all the geopolitical trade tension that existed. And as a result, there is not as much demand for near in airfreight. So, shipping and other forms of transportation are probably getting a higher amount of volume. So, it\u2019s something that\u2019s important to us but at the same time I don\u2019t think it has really any direct correlation to what we see on our passenger base.","Rajeev Lalwani","That\u2019s helpful. And then, Paul, a question for you on the cost side. We\u2019ve obviously seen capacity pick up for this year. Is that not creating a tailwind on the CASM side, or is it simply offset by some of the D&A items you talked about? And then, just generally, how do you feel about keeping trend steady, i.e. inflationary cost curve going forward, given that where we\u2019re looking at, potential labor step-ups for you guys, for the industry and so on?","Paul Jacobson","Sure. Thanks, Rajeev. We obviously have enjoyed in the first half some of the benefit and we\u2019ve seen that in our results with our non-fuel CASM benefiting alongside higher completion factor and more consistent and better operational performance contributing to that, that has helped. We've been pressured a little bit by some of the revenue index. So, with revenue growing at more than almost twice the rate of capacity, we see some revenue index pressure around commissions and around merchant fees, et cetera. But, all that is good money to spend from that perspective. Last half of 2018, we had negative CASM. So, we got a little bit tougher comps going in, but we feel very comfortable about holding the line between 1% to 2% and delivering that 1% for the full year.","Obviously, the additional D&A from the MD-90 fleet, which we absorbed into our regular earnings has pressured that somewhat. But, we do feel confident. Looking forward, we continue to see really good progress from One Delta. It's contributed almost $200 million incrementally in the first half of this year over 2018 and we're on track to exceed $500 million total from the One Delta program through the first two years on track to our $1 billion number. We're going to need to continue to do that. Obviously, there is potential pressure on the horizon, but we are constantly diligent about it and we feel good about holding that below that 2% goal long term.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll now hear from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Hey. Good morning.","Ed Bastian","Good morning.","Hunter Keay","Couple of questions on loyalty. Can you hear me, by the way? Sorry.","Ed Bastian","Yes. We can hear you.","Hunter Keay","All right. Is there a point where you feel like your loyalty is so strong that you can fully remove yourself from the aggregators that commoditize for look and feel of air travel, airfare?","Ed Bastian","Our strategy has been to build something that consumers want to buy and let them choose how they buy it. And that's led to a continuation of a migration towards Delta direct channel and Delta loyal customers. And I think that's how we see the landscape continuing to evolve. The question is, do you want to do a more aggressive and say no to customers who might want to buy our product to a certain way or distributors, and the answer is we would never want to do that. We would just want to continue to focus on buying directly from Delta, and Delta flights as the better way to buy a Delta ticket.","Hunter Keay","Why not? I mean, southwest customers, a lot of those guys go straight there without price comparing. And I would argue that a lot of Delta customers now buy Delta airfare without price comparing because they feel like it\u2019s a good value. So, maybe this is a 5 10-year question. But, why not maybe say, if you are going to commoditize our product and sell in the way that's not representative of the value you're getting, we're just not going to do business with you.","Ed Bastian","Hunter, let me offer my thoughts here. We're going down that direction obviously. I\u2019d say, 10 years ago, about one-third of our tickets were sold over the online agencies. Today, we're down to somewhere around 10% to 15%. And probably, as you look forward, you're right, delta.com is going to take more and more of that traffic. So, I don't think we need to put a stake in the ground and say that we won't sell over those channels. But at the same time, the online agencies are aware that they need to provide a differentiated experience to our customers in order for us to continue to invest in them and together have our content on their sites.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thanks. And just one more quick one, just related to it. Do you happen to know maybe through survey work or whatever, how many customers book directly with you guys without price comparing?","Ed Bastian","We have no idea.","Operator","And our next question will come Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Just a question on the cost side. With the tariff, I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s having an impact on airport projects and cost, then what the implication for just airport cost in general and the LaGuardia project you're working on in particular, and the types of that. I think we're seeing a lot of just airport projects in general and a lot of funding related to that and wondering if we're going to start to see funding pressure and if that just may translate to higher airport cost for industry in general or if we might see some of these projects getting curtailed?","Ed Bastian","Good morning, Savi. Thanks for that. Certainly, we've seen some inflationary and tariff related pressure on structural steel and other elements. I would say actually a little bit of a bigger piece has been just general inflation in the areas of New York and LA where we're constructing. There is obviously a lot of infrastructure work going on and competition for labor is tight. That being said, both of those projects remain on target, on schedule and on budget. The work that the team is doing has been phenomenal on the ground in both places, and this is one of the strong benefits that we feel we have by controlling the financing and controlling the construction of these projects, being able to manage through these things and the teams have done an amazing job.","Savi Syth","So, any thoughts, and then as you look at other airports as well, it\u2019s a follow-on on if we're going to kind of continue to see this increasing cost of airport inflation or if some of these projects get curtailed actually as economy kind of slows down here?","Ed Bastian","I think, you're going to continue to see airport cost inflation across the board, there is a lot of infrastructure improvement happening, not just at our hubs but across the board. But all of these are customer enhancing and going to make the customer experience better, more streamlined with more features and more modern. So, we actually feel good about it. And those projects are all moving ahead. We feel comfortable absorbing that rate of inflation as we can deliver those products and in line with our general cost goals.","Glen Hauenstein","Savi, if I might take a stab at what I think you're getting to is, when you think about the trends in the U.S. aviation industry, the big cities tend to be getting bigger and the small cities tend to be getting a bit smaller. And if you look at Kennedy when we made the initial investment, during the first year or two, our CPE went up slightly. Sitting where we are today, by driving a more efficient, larger airplane through those facilities, which you couldn't have done with the previous facilities, our CPE is now significantly below where we were just a few years ago and even before the construction. So, really, these are the enabling projects for the airlines to become more efficient as well.","Operator","And now, we will take a question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Good morning, everyone. So Glen or Ed, I want to circle back to this idea of sustainably growing revenue above GDP. And I know, we\u2019ve kind of hit on at this call like the decommoditization of the products. But can you talk to, have you seen, like repeat purchases of these different branded fares or segmented products, or is it just like a novelty that could potentially wear off as consumers just go back thinking, hey, a seat is a seat? ","Ed Bastian","I think, it's become more and more sticky. And that\u2019s why I think we pointed out that every year, the paid load factors in the premium products get higher and higher and higher, and we continue to drive loyalty into those products and services. So, I think our ability to continue to grow those sectors, I think when you look back and say what was wrong with this industry five or ten years ago as we all thought that it was a race to the bottom and that the only thing that mattered to consumers having all is fare. What we really figured out when we did a lot of survey and results was that for most customers or 60% of the customers, they were choosing on something other than the lowest fare. And then when we dissected that even more that with 60% of customers that really 80% of revenue, and we weren\u2019t really geared towards being able to provide value. And that\u2019s the full genesis of this transformation of Delta and its premium products and services; it\u2019s been about providing people what they want to buy.","Glen Hauenstein","And Brandon, the other thing I\u2019d add to that is that we\u2019ve been growing our topline revenues easily the last two years in the high single digits level year-on-year, again multiple of where GDP has been. And the diversity of those revenue streams is powerful, whether it\u2019s loyalty and other components of that but the other thing is our net promoter scores were at their highest in record. So, not only are they purchasing these new products, they\u2019re even more satisfied than ever in the services that Delta is providing. So, I think it\u2019s quite sustainable and I think it\u2019s going to continue to grow at a pretty accelerated pace.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. Well, it makes sense because we\u2019ve always had travel options on hotels and cars. So, if I can, I want to ask one nerdy analyst question here. So, you guys are guiding to 6% to 7% topline growth for the year. Let\u2019s say capacity is around 3%, close to 4% for the fourth quarter. I think that\u2019s implying TRASM that would be close to flat. Is there anything in the guidance that suggests like a slowdown in the industry yields or maybe a bit more caution on the economy?","Ed Bastian","As I said -- so, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s a nerdy analyst question. No, we\u2019re not expecting to see any friendships in the numbers, we\u2019re probably just being a little conservative in our long-term topline guide.","Brandon Oglenski","All right I appreciate it.","Operator","And now, we\u2019ll hear from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew Didora","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Paul, I actually wanted to get your thoughts here as we head into the back half on, just on IMO-2020 and how you\u2019re thinking about that and the impact of jet fuel. Are there any ways to hedge this as what we see futures contract show kind of a meaningful step up from the end of the year into 2020? And does this maybe change your thoughts at all on the refinery?","Paul Jacobson","Andrew, good morning. Thanks for that. At the end of the day, as we said, the refinery, given its diesel and jet production will effectively serve as about a 35% hedge against that. So, we feel like we\u2019re well-positioned going into that. Certainly, we\u2019ve seen a little bit of pressure on the future\u2019s curve but it hasn\u2019t been near what the market had expected or at least thought in extreme cases that it would be. So, we\u2019re continuing to watch it and keep it close. The refinery is performing well. We\u2019ve seen some upward pressure on gasoline and other products on the profitability of that given the recent announcement by PES to shut down their refinery. And we feel like we\u2019re well-positioned to be able to continue to deliver those results.","Andrew Didora","Got it. That\u2019s helpful on the diesel and jet hedge. And I guess my follow-up question here just on the free cash flow execution, obviously has been excellent this year. Can you maybe talk a little bit on how sustainable you see this $4 billion going forward, particularly in the face of maybe some rising jet fuel, possibly slowing economy? And can you remind us of what levers you have to pull in case any of these scenarios play out? Thanks.","Ed Bastian","Well, sure. We always have the flexibility levers on voluntary spending and capital et cetera to be able to manage that, which is why our balanced capital allocation strategy is the right one, because it can be flexible and respond to changes. But, if you look at our cash flow conversion rates, they've been going up pretty steadily. And a huge contributor to that is the American Express deal. We\u2019ve talked about the loyalty program, the cash turn versus the deferral that we see. Some of that to the balance sheet is very strong and that's expected to continue to grow, which will enhance our operating cash generation going forward. This year in particular, we've lapped a couple of sizable increases in non-cash related expenses, principally the pension as well as depreciation and amortization. So, you see the cash efficiency of the earnings stream increasing and that should continue as well. So, the trajectory we're on we\u2019re confident about, and we feel good about being able to continue that performance into the future.","Andrew Didora","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from David Vernon. One moment, please.","David Vernon","Hey. Hello?","Operator","Go ahead.","David Vernon","Coming back to the theme of infrastructure for a second, Paul. If you think about the amount of money sort of Delta has been putting into airport projects for last several years, is there a point over the next several years where you start to get some free cash flow leverage off of that investment, because we're starting from a pretty low base in terms of airport quality around the network? I'm just wondering if there is a point in investment horizon where that non-aircraft CapEx could start to fall off a little bit.","Paul Jacobson","Well, thanks for that, David. We also, for the large projects that we are doing because we finance those in the tax-exempt markets or through general airport funds, are excluding those from investing activities, because they are on a standalone and we repay those over time. So, I think there is going to be a steady stream of investment across the airports whether it's driven by the airports themselves or by us. We\u2019ve put significant investment into our Sky Club and Lounge program for customer satisfaction. And clearly, those are paying dividends in the product scores and the revenue performance of the Company as well.","So, I don't see the non-large infrastructure changing significantly, as we go forward. But, those large infrastructure projects will be here for a little bit of time, and they will be great for the customers. And as Glen talked about, they create some significant operational efficiencies and scale benefits for us to be able to amortize those costs over higher loads.","David Vernon","And maybe just as a follow-up, Glen, that tie in as for kind of the cost advantages, creates for you as a bigger airline. As we kind of finish the development of the airport at LaGuardia, for example, how does that change sort of the competitive dynamic against the lower cost carrier in that market?","Glen Hauenstein","I don't think we want to speculate on how they're going to react to the new facilities. But, I do think that we know that in order to accommodate the growth of air travel in New York City, we have to have a bigger facility as if you\u2019ve used it, you understand how constrained it is. And that constrains our ability to put larger airplanes in there that can drive significant cost efficiencies and accommodate growth over time. I think we all realize particularly in summertime how constrained New York City aerospace is. So, there is really no way to be able to put more airplanes in there. So, we're going to have to put bigger airplanes in there that are more efficient, and those facilities are the key enablers of that.","David Vernon","Given your scale benefit, wouldn\u2019t you think that the higher cost per employment might be more relatively impactful for a lower cost carrier than it would be for you to absorb, or am I not thinking about that right? ","Glen Hauenstein","Clearly, our business model would be favored in a high CPE environment.","Operator","Now, we will take a question from Helane Becker with Cowen.","Helane Becker","One of the areas that you guys seem to be on the leading edge of but don\u2019t talk a lot about is what you are doing regarding environmental and sustainability efforts. And I think you're pretty big internationally and that seems to be where there is more focus rather than the U.S. -- from international investors more than domestic investors. But could maybe talk a little bit about how we should think about your efforts in that regard and whether you think they add to brand and so on? Thank you.","Ed Bastian","Sure. Helane, thanks. It\u2019s a very good question and you are absolutely right. ESG is going to become an increasingly important part of our responsibilities in our governance of our brand and how we operate in to the future. You are right that is probably a bigger point of emphasis in Europe today than it is in the U.S., but it's going to continue to grow here as well. We\u2019ve made a lot of commitments as an industry as well as in airline and I'm pleased to say that the Delta is continuing to meet its commitments in that. We\u2019ve made a commitment as a company as well as an industry to reduce our footprint by 50% by the year 2050, which requires that we need to continue to reduce our footprint by up to 2% per year and which is right in line with where we are today on fuel and emissions.","We\u2019ve made a commitment as a company to eliminate single use plastics from on-board our aircraft, as well as in our lounges, in our airports and we continue to make new announcements. I just saw the new amenity kits that we\u2019ve got for international that's eliminated the plastic. We're going to be taking the wrappers off the blankets here soon. Every day there is a lot of small efforts, all of which add up to a lot of big impacts. So, ESG is something that we are paying good attention to. I think, investors will increasingly pay more attention too. And it\u2019s going to be a point of pride for Delta people as we bring forth the lead in that effort as well.","Gil West","I would just add, this is Gil, that also sustainability goes hand in hand with efficiency because as the waste is reduced, right, there is a cost savings associated with that. So, whether it\u2019s fuel, as an example, fuel efficiency to be, but everything else associated with waste, we save money on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks and congrats on the strong results. I wanted to ask you about the accelerated retirement of the MD-90s two years early. Was there a corresponding new order to facilitate that? How far out does your current narrow-body order book take you? And have you considered any potentially opportunistic pricing on the Max?","Paul Jacobson","Hey, Duane. This is Paul. Thanks for the question. The decision to retire the MD-90s is part of the continued move and fleet simplification. Driving that through, we feel comfortable with our existing order book. There were new orders accompanying that decision as we thought about it. And we feel good with that balance on the trajectory that we\u2019re on to be able to drive to the benefits of fleet simplification, significantly reduce the complexity in the business, which is going to translate to better efficiency going forward.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And have you been tempted by any opportunistic pricing on the Max?","Glen Hauenstein","Duane, we are very focused on the narrow-body transformation that Glen talked about in his comments. We\u2019ve got -- we made a decision two years ago to invest in the 321. And I think that we\u2019re going to stay that course.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Fair enough. Thank you. And then, just for my follow-up, very strong Latin RASM, comps actually get easier, much easier in the back half. Can you just remind us what were the main drivers of weakness in the second half of last year, was it more Mexico, was it South America? Thanks for taking the questions.","Glen Hauenstein","It was both, Mexico and Brazil last year, which have had turnarounds in both those marketplaces that really -- those are at the centers of Latin turnaround.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Jill Greer","Jake, we\u2019re going to have time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","Thank you. And that question will come from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan McKenzie","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Both of my questions also tie to revenue sustainability. On corporate revenue, I\u2019m hope you can elaborate on underlying volumes tied to the larger managed accounts and the smaller unmanaged accounts. I'm wondering if there\u2019s been a change in velocity here. One of your competitors had some pretty substantial operational disruptions. And I guess, I'm wondering, to what extent there are new revenue pipelines getting turned on from potentially new accounts or is just the corporate revenue story more about getting the existing account, just to pay more?","Glen Hauenstein","So, it really isn\u2019t about the corporate accounts paying more. It\u2019s really the yield trends have been very stable this year both domestically and actually slightly down internationally primarily driven by currency headwinds. But it\u2019s really been a volume story. Volumes have been up throughout the year. So, we\u2019ve seen very robust volumes, particularly domestically with many weeks being up double-digits in terms of the volumes. So, I think we\u2019re relatively excited about the broadness of this. And clearly there are industries that are growing and there are industries that are scaling back. But in general, the trends have been overwhelmingly positive for volume.","Dan McKenzie","Glen, I thing that actually ties to the second question I have here. And that is just sort of kind of helping to clarify some of the revenue outlook for later this year. It sounds like the outlook is factoring in some impact from the Max is coming back and potentially from some elevated macro risk. And it sounds like you\u2019ve got some strong offsets to those headwinds, corporate volumes being one of those. Should we think about the offsets to some of these risks later this year as also being on the international side of the revenue equation ex-Europe?","Glen Hauenstein","I think, as we go through the year and really more in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re starting to lap the higher dollar. And as you know, international has a longer sale -- advance sale than domestic. So, the tail end of the fourth quarter should -- or the mitigation of headwinds should be better as we move through the year. And we're also looking at starting to lap some of the weakness in some of the sectors. As we have mentioned earlier in the call, automotive has been down. And as you might expect with a hub in Detroit and a very big Midwest presence, that had a pretty large impact on us. So, as we get to the fourth quarter, we're actually lapping those lower comps.","And so, that should actually improve. Hopefully, we can get back to a constructive environment in one of our biggest sectors. And so, we are really looking forward to a very strong close to the year.","Dan McKenzie","Very good. That's helpful. Good job on the quarter. Thanks very much.","Jill Greer","I think that's going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. We will hand it over to mates in our media team. Jake, if you could give the instructions to the media for how to get in the queue.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Leslie Josephs with CNBC.","Leslie Josephs","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Could you please update us on what\u2019s going on with Wi-Fi and those tests? You said you had a two-week test in the last quarter. Where are the tests this quarter and when you expect it to be free throughout the network? Thanks.","Ed Bastian","Sure. Leslie, this is Ed. We did conduct two weeks of test. It was on a limited scale. We learned a lot about the technical capacity challenges that you face when you want to open a Wi-Fi up free on with great broadband capabilities across our entire global network. We are now ready to announce when the next free test will come, but they will be coming certainly later this year, and we're on a path here. We think it's important that our customers stay connected. And entertainment is something I think that will continue to distinguish Delta in the sky.","Leslie Josephs","Thanks. And then, just one quick follow-up on the interview this morning, you said that about 65% to 70% of first class is paid in cash. That's first class purely or is that first in like Delta One business class as well?","Ed Bastian","That\u2019s essentially our first-class product, both domestic as well as international, our paid load factors in that 60% to 70% range.","Leslie Josephs","What was it last year\u2026","Ed Bastian","What's that?","Leslie Josephs","Sorry. What was it last year?","Paul Jacobson","Well, I can give you some of the details.","Leslie Josephs","Okay. Thanks.","Ed Bastian","Importantly, it's not cash. It's cash and frequent flyers using their mileage to upgrade into those cabins. And I think that's one of the real -- when we talk about continuing to increase the diversity and the ability for people to sit up here, we're trying to bring more and more ways to get there. And that's -- increasing the distribution has been one of the keys.","Leslie Josephs","Thanks.","Operator","And now, we will hear from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters.","Tracy Rucinski","Hi. Good morning. I'm interested in hearing a little more context on your Hanjin Korean Air investment. You mentioned your close personal relationship with the Cho family. Did anyone from the Cho family contacts out to ask for help in wording the activist fund, KCGI, and what role do you expect to have in Korean Air corporate governance?","Ed Bastian","Tracy, this is Ed. We do have a close relationship with the family as well as with the company. We are in contact on almost daily basis across our two companies. And I\u2019m not going to comment relative to investment, how we develop our investment thesis. But the investment that we made in Korean is consistent with the investments you\u2019ve seen us make in many of our main partners around the globe. So, I don't think there should be anything considered unusual at all about it.","Operator","We will now take a question from Ted Reed with Forbes. ","Ted Reed","Thank you. I have two questions. So, first is about the Max. When you guys decided not to buy the Max, what was the reason? Your competitors had it -- had ordered it, was it just cost or was the wait too long or something else?","Ed Bastian","Listen, the Max, is a good product. I\u2019m not dismissing, it\u2019s a very competitive tool that OAL has. We look at all aspects of performance. We looked at the customer view of product. We looked at the cost from the OEM. We looked at the engine. We looked at what we were able to do with Pratt and Whitney on the geared turbofan and the commitments that we\u2019ve received in the neo. So, it was a comprehensive review. It was a close call. We spent quite a few months analyzing and going back and forth. But the 321neo in aggregate carried the day for us.","Ted Reed","All right. Thank you. Secondly, I would like to ask about Boston. You said -- Glen, you said you get the 200. Is that going to be it for you, once you get to 200? And also you mentioned competitors are flying Boston to Asia, is that something you are interested in?","Glen Hauenstein","No. I said, our partners were flying from Boston to Asia. As you may know, our partner Korean launched Korea to Boston this year on 787 and it was an incredible success. So, they\u2019ve been doing quite well on that way. I think they will expand that service as we move into next year. We\u2019ve been working with our partners, we\u2019ve been growing our own hub. And I think 200 is kind of our medium-term objective here and we think we\u2019ll get there in the next 18 to 24 months. But beyond that, we\u2019ll see how the market grows. We think at 200, it\u2019s a very sustainable and very profitable franchise for us.","Ted Reed","Is it important to be the number one carrier in market share in Boston?","Glen Hauenstein","No. It\u2019s important to be the most profitable and most loved.","Ted Reed","All right. Thank you, Glen.","Ed Bastian","Jake, we have time for one final question, please.","Operator","And that final question will come from Elliott Blackburn with Argus Media.","Elliott Blackburn","Good morning. Thanks. I wanted to ask, you guys touched on this a bit and you bought the Trainer refinery years back in part to ensure continued fuel production in the New York market. How does the planned closure of the Philadelphia refinery change Delta's outlook for fuel supply and cost in that region?","Paul Jacobson","Elliott, this is Paul Jacobson. Thanks for question. That Trainer refinery was originally purchased for events just like this. As we saw supply contracting in the region through various closures back in 2012, we saw this as an opportunity for us to take a little bit more control over production and we've done just that. We've taken the refinery and used it in connection with our commercial operations to drive on average $0.05 per gallon benefit against our competitors using the benefits of the refinery and all the logistics expertise that we have. That means this translates to about $200 million per year. Certainly, we expect to see some rebalancing going on with the lost production from the PES facility. And we believe the Trainer refinery is well positioned to help us offset any increases in the region we might see.","Elliott Blackburn","Thanks. Do you guys continue to seek a partner at that facility or how is this also changing kind of your outlook for refining generally in that area?","Paul Jacobson","We\u2019re always looking for opportunities to enhance the return structure and the overall structure of how we manage that refinery. We went through the process, we found -- we\u2019ve got multiple investors and firms interested in talking to us. Ultimately, we weren\u2019t able to put a deal together that met all of our needs and have decided for the time being to remain at the status quo. So, we expect no changes in that structure and we\u2019ve put our pencils down on that process.","Elliott Blackburn","Thanks very much.","Ed Bastian","That will conclude today\u2019s call. We\u2019re grateful for everyone\u2019s time and look forward to sharing the great results that we will be talking about in October. Thank you, everybody.","Operator","Once again, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"7263":["Delta Air Lines, Inc.

My name is Eboni and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. ","Jill Greer","Thanks, Eboni. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our March quarter earnings call. Joining us today from Atlanta are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session.","Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta's financial performance. Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow up. ","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. ","We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. On January 1, Delta adopted several new accounting standards. All prior-year periods have been recast to reflect the adoption of those new standards. You can find more detail on this and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. ","Ed Bastian","Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today Delta reported a $676 million margin quarter pretax profit and earnings per share of $0.74, beating consensus by a penny. Our $9.8 billion in revenues were a record for the March quarter and we came in at the high end of our initial profit guidance as that strong revenue performance offset a $0.05 per share impact from severe weather. ","We just passed the one-year anniversary of last year's Atlanta storm, an event that we leveraged to improve our response and recovery to irregular operations. Though despite more impactful winter weather in the Northeast this year, we had 52 days in the quarter of zero mainline cancellations. We also had 19 days in the quarter without a single cancellation across the entire Delta system, which is better performance than the first quarter of a year ago. ","More customers than ever are choosing Delta because of the great service our people provide and the reliability of the product that we deliver. Not only are we seeing record numbers of passengers, we're also seeing solid improvements in our customer satisfaction scores.","We reached all-time high Net Promoter Scores in each geographic region in 2017 and recorded a strong 44% rating domestically for the most recent month of February. All these results are a credit to the dedication and determination of the Delta people.","Every day, they make a difference to our customers and they are truly our greatest competitive asset. And I want to thank them and say congratulations for starting the year with $183 million already made towards next year's profit sharing payment. ","With our people and our culture as the foundation, we outlined a path to grow earnings in 2018 at our Investor Day in December. And we remain confident that we're on track to deliver the key elements of earnings improvement that we laid out at the start of this year. Revenue driven earnings growth, changing our cost trajectory and leveraging our international partnerships.","Growing our top line is a priority and we have good momentum. In the first quarter, we delivered 8% top line growth and expect a similar result in the June quarter. Not only are we sustaining a strong revenue premium to the industry, we\u2019re also diversifying our revenue base and driving double-digit gains from other sources like cargo, loyalty revenue and Branded Fares.","Now I was also very pleased to see our international revenues grow at a strong pace led by 15% top line growth in the transatlantic. Of equal priority is changing our cost trajectory. Our nonfuel cost growth has been trending at an unacceptably high rate. We need to get that back to 0% to 2% this year.","This quarter we saw cost growth step down a couple of points from the December quarter and June will mark our third consecutive quarter of sequentially improving performance. With nearly 50 aircraft still to be delivered this year, we look to our upgauging to drive a lot of efficiency not only this year but well into the future.","Our One Delta project is another initiative that uses the learnings from last year\u2019s Atlanta storm for how we can collaborate better across the business. With better efficiency there will be cost savings and this is one way we\u2019ll continue to deliver a best-in-class place to work for our people, a leading product for our customers and top tier investment for our shareholders.","So while we still have work to do, we\u2019re moving in the right direction and setting a solid foundation to consistently deliver on our cost targets. Finally, leveraging our international partnerships. While the core of our strength today is the domestic business, we realize our long-term marketplace is the world.","No one better connects the world than Delta and today we offer more options than ever before, whether on our aircraft or via our international partners. This quarter we received final approval for our newest joint venture with Korean Air which is expected to launch May 1 and will offer customers world class travel benefits across one of the most comprehensive route networks in the Trans-Pacific market. ","We\u2019re also working closely with Air France KLM and Virgin Atlantic to finalize a single transatlantic JV. By taking our most established relationships to a new level and creating our first multilateral joint venture, which will be the industry\u2019s largest and most profitable, we can create even more value from these partnerships.","It was 10 years ago this week that we announced the Delta Northwest merger and the transformation of our company has been unprecedented. We are financially stronger, enabling us to consistently deliver and invest in a high-quality experience for our customers while still sharing success with our people.","We have started the year with solid momentum and we remain focused on revenue-driven earnings growth and the prudent deployment of our cash flows. And we will continue to leverage the strength of our culture, our industry-leading reliability, our unrivaled domestic network, our customer loyalty and brand, and our investment grade balance sheet to create long-term value for Delta\u2019s employees, our owners and the customers and communities that we serve.","We\u2019re off to a good start in 2018 and we look forward to maintaining that momentum over the balance of the year. And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to Glen.","Glen Hauenstein","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone. We are seeing our strongest revenue momentum since 2014 driven by improvements in all geographic regions, strong carpet results and double-digit increases in loyalty revenue. I\u2019d like to thank the entire Delta team for the great service they provide to our customers each and every day, which is what truly drives these strong results.","Our March quarter revenue was the highest in our history with 8% top line growth driven by strong demand across all entities and improving business and leisure yields. Corporate revenues also showed an acceleration across all regions, up 7% in the quarter. With domestic fares up 2.8% year-over-year, we have now recovered a quarter of the decline in domestic average corporate fares versus the peak in 2014.","We are confident these trends will continue. Our most recent travel survey, which concluded on March 16, noted that 86% of travel managers expected their spend to be maintained or increased in 2Q and beyond. Our revenue momentum is evident across all parts of Delta. Cargo sales were up 23%, our best first quarter performance since 2015, and other revenues grew 13% ex-refinery, driven by a strong 14% improvement in our loyalty.","Turning to unit revenues. TRASM was up 5% with all entities again posting positive year-over-year PRASM growth. Close in bookings for February and March showed strong momentum. As a result, we saw accelerating unit revenue performance each month throughout the quarter.","Domestic passenger revenue was up a strong 7% on a 4% capacity growth. The domestic entity delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement, with PRASM up 2.5%. All domestic hubs demonstrated unit revenue improvements, with the exception of Seattle, where RASM was flat on a 20% capacity increase during the weakest quarter of the year.","Business yields improved by 6 points in the quarter, inflecting to positive in mid-February. We are maintaining a record domestic revenue premium to the industry, despite absorbing the industry\u2019s highest increase in stage length and gauge.","Internationally, we saw improving trends with unit revenues up 7.6%, outpacing the domestic entity for the third consecutive quarter. Transatlantic unit revenues increased 12% on strong business class bookings and a 5-point currency tailwind. Strong business cabin performance, a robust summer demand outlook and currency tailwinds are expected to continue to drive positive trends for the entity into the next quarter.","In addition, we expect to see continued strength for our Comfort+ product, which we saw an increase of more than 40% in the first quarter versus 2017. Our payload in Comfort+ now exceeds 50%.","In close coordination with our JV partners, we are launching several new markets this summer that connect the strengths of our networks, and we are seeing encouraging forward bookings. In our Latin region, unit revenues grew 6%, the seventh consecutive quarter of positive unit revenues for the entity, driven by strong demand trends across much of the portfolio and continued alliance integration.","Caribbean performance is encouraging as the region recovers from last year\u2019s hurricanes. However, we are seeing challenges in Mexico as Open Skies drove increased capacity in business markets and travel advisories pressured demand to beach destinations.","In the Pacific, unit revenues were up 4% for the quarter on an 8% increase in stage length, the second quarter of unit revenue growth for the entity. We are especially encouraged by the rate of improvement in this region. We are currently seeing all Pacific markets with positive unit revenue momentum. The pricing environment has improved year-over-year as industry capacity growth has moderated.","We are seeing strong demand and revenue performance for the Delta One suite and Premium Select as we continued to expand our A350 service across the region. Based on current trends, we believe our momentum will continue to build through the year and allow us to produce positive unit revenues each quarter on increasingly tougher comps.","We expect June quarter TRASM to be up 3% to 5% on 3% to 4% higher capacity, which includes 1 point of stage length and 2 points of gauge increases. I\u2019d also remind you that for comparison purposes, last year\u2019s April storms reduced 2017 unit revenues and capacity by approximately 1 point each.","Longer term, we\u2019re focused on driving revenues and earnings growth to our network, our brand and customer experience and segmentation initiatives. First, leveraging our domestic network. The U.S. market drives much of Delta\u2019s earnings and margin strength today.","Through our upgauging, we can efficiently add capacity, notably in constrained airports and premium time channels, allowing us to further improve our domestic performance. This year, over 70% of our domestic seat capacity growth is coming from upgauging.","Second is strengthening our brand and improving the customer experience. We believe that strong customer satisfaction is directly tied to our sustained revenue premium. One of our major initiatives is to further improve the customer experience through our digital transformation.","By taking a customer-centric approach to this major technology investment, we can give our employees the data they need to deliver a more personalized level of service. We\u2019re also leveraging our strong brand to drive solid gains through our loyalty program.","Last year, the Delta-American Express co-brand portfolio had record acquisitions, and we just had another record quarter. Co-brand spend was up 14% which helped drive $85 million of incremental value from our American Express agreement this quarter, and we\u2019re on track to deliver $3.3 billion in total contribution for the full year.","And finally, we continued to expand our segmentation initiatives, offering customers more choices. We have implemented technologies to make the purchase of various fare bundles and products easier for customers and we worked with our JV partners to align branded fare offerings across our partnerships.","This quarter, Virgin Atlantic launched a full range of segmented products, and we now offer an aligned basic economy product with both Virgin and Air France-KLM in the transatlantic. We\u2019ve completed a similar effort with Aeromexico as they introduced a product akin to Delta\u2019s long-established Comfort+ in addition to introducing Basic Economy.","With our fleet upgauging contributing to an 11% increase in premium seats, we grew first class upsell and Comfort+ revenues over 20% in the March quarter. The Branded Fare momentum combined with future functionality such as post-purchase pay with models, put us on pace to achieve our goal of $350 million of incremental revenue in 2018 and a targeted $2.7 billion of total revenue by 2019.","With our employees\u2019 outstanding service, giving customers every reason to keep flying Delta, our commercial initiatives in place and strong revenue momentum building in all geographic entities, we feel we are well poised to deliver solid topline growth throughout 2018.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul.","Paul Jacobson","Thank you, Glen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As we have mentioned repeatedly, one of our top priorities this year is addressing our cost trajectory. For the March quarter, total operating expenses increased $817 million, with half of that resulting from higher fuel prices and higher capacity and revenue related costs.","Our nonfuel costs were up 3.9% for the March quarter on 2.7% higher capacity. Over 2 points of this increase were driven by investments we made in our employees and higher depreciation expense due to accelerated aircraft retirements.","This cost inflation is a step down from what we saw in the December quarter, but it came in at the high end of our initial guidance due to about a point of pressure from weather and foreign exchange during the quarter.","As we move through the year, we\u2019ll continue to see increasing relief on cost as we annualize prior year investments and gain benefits from our upgauging and One Delta initiatives. For the June quarter, we expect our nonfuel CASM to increase 1% to 3%.","With depreciation \u2013 while depreciation pressure continues at a similar pace, we have now annualized last year\u2019s employee wage increases and also lapped the Atlanta storm which combined provide a 1.5 point tailwind to CASM for the quarter.","Then, as we move into the back half of the year, most of our incremental depreciation trails off after the third quarter providing another half point of CASM relief. From this path alone, we get a cost result in the back half of the year that we expect will be significantly better than our first half performance. But that\u2019s not the whole story.","In addition to this, our fleet upgauging and One Delta initiatives can then really help bend the cost curve as we move throughout the year. The delivery of over 60 aircraft this year including the first deliveries of the C Series will drive some of the greatest efficiency gains in Delta\u2019s history with $100 million in expected nonfuel savings this year alone.","And our One Delta project with its focus on cross divisional efficiency is expected to generate about $200 million in 2018, and $1 billion a year over the long term. Through this effort, we\u2019re taking a more holistic view of the company.","One of the first projects we\u2019ve undertaken looks at the way we build our network and coordinate our scheduling functions. This project is focused on simplifying the process, enabling better communication between all divisions, and ultimately allowing more efficient utilization of our aircraft and facilities.","This initiative is expected to generate $100 million of savings this year and $300 million at a full run rate. It will also give us a platform to take our operational performance to the next level, while also driving a better outcome for our customers.","Another example of the type of efficiency we\u2019re targeting this year is the creation of a best-in-class transportation group within Delta cargo to serve as the single source for all of Delta\u2019s logistics needs. We\u2019ve also identified opportunities to drive crew hotel scheduling and spend efficiencies. These cargo and hotel initiatives are set to deliver about $30 million this year alone.","So we\u2019re making progress on our costs. And we have line of sight to get within our 0% to 2% range for the year but there\u2019s definitely work ahead to get to the lower end, as we\u2019ve said.","Looking at fuel, market prices have been volatile in the quarter with Brent trading anywhere between $62 and $70 and most recently hitting $72 per barrel. Our total fuel expense increased $317 million in the quarter as market prices were 8% higher than December and 25% higher than prior year. That pressure was partially offset by a $40 million contribution from our Monroe refinery.","It is also important to note that this is the first quarter that Delta wasn\u2019t impacted by our legacy fuel hedges and that will continue for this year. For the June quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to be $2.07 to $2.12.","Nonoperating expenses for the quarter were roughly flat to prior year. Pension expense benefits, which now appear in the nonoperating section, were offset by the seasonality of our 49% partner earnings. For the full year, we expect nonoperating expense to be $200 million to $250 million lower than 2017, due primarily to pension expense savings benefits from our additional contributions and investment performance that we achieved last year.","For the June quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.80 to $2 per share, which equates to a pretax margin of 14% to 16%.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow for the quarter which allowed for reinvestment in the business through $1.2 billion in CapEx with $1 billion of that related to aircraft and aircraft modifications. We continue to expect roughly $4 billion in capital spending for 2018 and will continue to target CapEx at 50% of our operating cash flow.","In the quarter, we generated $173 million of free cash flow and returned $542 million to shareholders through $325 million in share repurchases and $217 million in dividends. In January, we completed our 2018 pension funding with a $500 million voluntary contribution.","Assuming current discount rates, our unfunded pension liability is improved by roughly $1 billion since the end of 2017 showing further benefit from last year\u2019s accelerated contribution. This is just one example of the opportunities we have unlocked with our investment-grade balance sheet.","And going forward, we expect to have more opportunity to continue transforming our balance sheet by refinancing from secured to unsecured debt which will further increase our pool of unencumbered assets while also reducing our interest costs.","We will also finance a portion of our LaGuardia redevelopment project using tax-exempt bonds as we harness the value of our investment-grade rating and maintain control of the project from a construction and cost-management perspective, which will yield long-term benefits for us in New York.","In closing, we delivered solid earnings for the first quarter with expected strong revenues across our businesses and improving cost trajectory and continued benefits from tax reform. The outlook remains very positive, and we are on track to drive significant earnings growth in 2018.","I also want to pass along my thanks to the entire Delta team for their hard work in these efforts. ","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A.","Jill Greer","Thanks, everyone, and, Eboni, we are now ready for questions from the analysts if you could give instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Joseph Denardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Joseph Denardi","Yeah, thanks very much. Ed, Marriott trades at 22 times earnings because they have a business where they put their logo in front of a property and collect a cut of the revenue with no operating risk. Delta has arguably an even better business where you put your logo on a credit card and take a cut at the spend. Your stock trades at seven times earnings.","My question is do you think you can apply what you learned in forming these partnerships with foreign carriers in a way that better incentivizes both parties. Can you apply that to solve the challenge airlines have faced in trying to separate the marketing company from the airline business so the market can more appropriately value the two?","Ed Bastian","Hi, Joe. We have had this discussion now for a year or two. One of the things I think\u2019s real important is that we\u2019ve aimed to provide better transparency and disclosure around the basis and the foundation of some of your comments, looking into the loyalty arrangement and the profitability that it drives.","And hopefully the marketplace is seeing that, that we\u2019ve got a more sustainable and durable base revenue stream that\u2019s a bit \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say disconnected, but it\u2019s not fully dependent upon the airlines in and of itself. Over time, if we are unable to get our valuation to where we think it needs to be, we\u2019re open to options and ideas. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s premature to come to that conclusion at this point.","Joseph Denardi","Very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it at one. Thank you.","Ed Bastian","Great.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jamie Baker with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Hey. Good morning, everybody. Glen, a question on the domestic and without asking for market specificity, what are your lowest-performing routes have in common? Is it low-cost carrier overlap? Is there a common trade in terms of gauge?","Or is it simply where capacity is up the most that your domestic RASM is weakest? You mentioned Seattle in your prepared remarks. Obviously, the system as a whole functioning well, but always curious where underperformance is more acute. Any more color?","Glen Hauenstein","Underperformance in terms of revenue or P&L?","Jamie Baker","Preferably P&L.","Glen Hauenstein","So I think we\u2019ve talked about this before, is that generally when we can get to gauge \u2013 and this is why our gauge story is so important to us, when we can get to the right operating gauge, we can compete in almost every sector, whether or not it\u2019s against a ULCC, whether or not it\u2019s up against legacy carriers. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re really focused on getting the right gauge aircraft into the airline.","Generally, where we tend to lose money is where we can\u2019t get to scale. So the smaller equipment type in almost every class is the least profitable. So I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about the plan to bring in higher gauge to Delta and drive almost all of our growth through that higher gauge, because we think it\u2019s a much more robust and sustainable model.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Perfect. And a question for Ed, you had a narrative at one point that Delta should be valued more in line with its high-quality industrial transport peers. And you seem to have de-emphasized or, I don\u2019t know, backed away from that messaging as of late. Is that because you no longer believe it? Because it wasn\u2019t working? Or some other reason?","Ed Bastian","No. We still believe that. I think that we need to prove it. And rather than \u2013 I think we\u2019ve made the point and I think the comparisons are clear to any of our owners. There\u2019s obviously something within the durability of our business framework that we need to continue to prove over time and we\u2019re seeking to do that. So I think the point was made and there\u2019s no reason to continue to beat that same drum.","Jamie Baker","Okay. That\u2019s fair. Appreciate it. Take care, everybody.","Operator","Our next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hey. Thank you. Good morning. So it looks like your passenger ticket revenue is 77% of your total revenues, which is down a little bit year-on-year. How low can you get that number in the long term? Do you think you can get that down to like two-thirds, because I would presume the lower you can get that mix, the higher your earnings multiple would go. Would you agree with that?","Ed Bastian","That\u2019s an interesting question, Hunter. We don\u2019t necessarily look at it in that light. We certainly are looking, as I said in my earlier comment to Joe, about diversifying our revenue streams. But there\u2019s no question, our non-ticket-based revenues.","And it\u2019s been for some time now, it\u2019s been growing at a much faster clip than the ticket revenues. And as we bring segmentation and more customized marketing to bear, you\u2019ll see those trends continue. We\u2019ve never set a target as to where that should be, though.","Hunter Keay","Okay. And then, Ed, just to clarify, are you still on track with the 2018 EPS guidance range?","Ed Bastian","Yes, we are. Yes, we are. I know a number of people have been asking and talking about that over the course of the last few weeks. We continue to still expect to be in the range, and I think it\u2019s premature to conclude otherwise. Our Q1 was on plan. We expect the same largely in Q2 as well. Revenues are strong and we\u2019re running ahead of plan.","Our nonfuel costs are up a little bit, but we still expect full year to be in the target range and the wild card is obviously fuel. It\u2019s currently probably $5 or $6 a barrel ahead of plan at this point, but it\u2019s been bouncing all around over the course of the year-to-date.","It really depends on our ability to price it and the time lag required. But it\u2019s only been at this $70 level here for a couple of weeks, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s premature to conclude on a full-year basis as to whether that\u2019s going to continue in place.","Hunter Keay","All right. Thank you.","Ed Bastian","Welcome.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Mike Linenberg","Yeah, actually, two questions here. Ed, just on the running higher-than-planned that you had mentioned I think oil in the same sentence, if we go back to December when you were guiding to 4% to 6% revenue growth for the year and you did reiterate that in this release, were you \u2013 was your forecast at that time, was it at 8% topline growth in the March as well as June quarters?","Or is topline also running higher than planned than what you were thinking back in December?","Ed Bastian","Yeah, topline is running higher than plan in December. I forget the exact plan number for Q1, but we\u2019re running a good healthy clip ahead of plan.","Mike Linenberg","Okay. Great. And then just my second question to Paul. In the non-op area where you\u2019re getting that $200 million to $250 million reduction due to lower pension expense, does some piece of that find its way into the interest expense line as well?","Paul Jacobson","Hey. Good morning, Mike. No, it all sits in the other income line and non-op.","Mike Linenberg","Okay. Great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you so much for the time. I\u2019m not sure who should answer this question, but when you think about your Net Promoter Score and the improvement you\u2019ve seen over the bunch of years since the merger and so on, is it possible to get to a level of 100?","Paul Jacobson","Helane, I\u2019ll take that. No, it\u2019s not possible to get to a level of 100. You would want to see the cost profile that it would take to get to 100.","Helane Becker","Okay. So that\u2019s not necessarily a goal. Do you have like a goal in mind for that? Or are you happy where it is right now?","Paul Jacobson","Our domestic Net Promoter Score is in the mid-40s range. Internally, we would like to get that to 50 and then evaluate the cost benefits of continuing to increase it.","Helane Becker","Okay. That\u2019s great. Actually, all my other questions have been \u2013 most of my questions have been asked and answered. I\u2019ll just leave it at the one. Thanks, team.","Paul Jacobson","Great. Thanks, Helane.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Ed, not to beat a dead horse here, but I want to come back to Hunter\u2019s question on the guidance because if we do hold the fuel constant here, $72 or $71, that would represent about 2 to 3 points of incremental cost relative to where you were guiding, and you\u2019re still talking about topline of 4% to 6%. ","So I guess the bigger long-term question here is earnings are going to be roughly flat or maybe slightly up this year but in a cyclically very strong environment, and we\u2019re still down from a couple years ago on an operating basis. What can you tell shareholders that you can change in the formula that can offset these fuel headwinds over time?","Ed Bastian","Well, I don\u2019t view fuel in the $70 range as a big headwind. In fact, it creates a lot more discipline about the business, and we\u2019ve certainly proven the ability to make some very solid returns at this fuel price in the past. If you were to assume the $70 price range were to hold for the balance of the year, I think that would require about 1 point of additional RASM, plus or minus, to cover it. And we\u2019ll see.","I think it\u2019s premature as I said to say $70 is the new normal. The curve, as you know, is still backward dated, so if you were to take a market, market price is actually lower than that today. And I do think there\u2019s a tremendous amount of revenue momentum that we\u2019re seeing, and I think the industry as a whole is needing to price for this. This is not a unique Delta challenge. This is the industry, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had good success.","Brandon Oglenski","But I guess that\u2019s what investors are asking here. What will drive that pricing upside? And should we just assume it\u2019s going to appear?","Ed Bastian","Pricing? You\u2019re saying what would enable us to cover that cost of pricing? Well, it\u2019s going to be several things. First of all, it\u2019s going to be the strength of the economy. You have to look into what\u2019s driving the underlying reason why fuel is up.","It\u2019s going to be the strength of our branding, our product strategies. Glen can add a little bit more on this, more color, but we believe through our Branded Fares, our international partnerships are really paying off. We\u2019ve been investing for a number of years. ","As you know, that\u2019s been the most challenged part of the business over the last two years, and it\u2019s rebounding at a very strong clip. Our transatlantic RASM was up 12% in the quarter. So there\u2019s a lot of underlying strength on the top line, and we\u2019ll continue to see it over time. Glen?","Glen Hauenstein","Yeah, if I could just add, there\u2019s a huge correlation between airline revenues and fuel price, but it does take a little bit of time both directions, up and down, before it\u2019s absorbed into the marketplace. And so over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve seen a fairly rapid run up.","Under normal circumstances with a growing economy, we would see that roll into fares probably in the 90- to 120-day range, but it has to stay there, and I think as it\u2019s fluctuating around, it\u2019s premature for us to start speculating as to how much of that would be captured in forward revenues.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. I appreciate the response.","Glen Hauenstein","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey. Thanks. Paul, just wondered if you have any new thinking regarding hedging longer term? I know at one point you were studying the use of out-of-the-money call options. Just wondered, given this backwardation into 2019, if you\u2019re studying that anymore?","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Duane. Hey, look, we\u2019re always taking a look at trying to make sure we\u2019re managing risk in the business. We have no plans to add any hedges at this time, and we\u2019ll continue to look at it. But again, I think we\u2019re pretty happy with where we sit right now. We\u2019re driving a lot of efficiencies in the business in which we buy fuel and that\u2019s creating a nice sustainable advantage competitively, and we feel good about where we sit in the fuel line.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks. And then just for my second, broadly how you\u2019re thinking about the buyback? Maybe you could just remind us on where you are with the existing authorization, and with this very generous free cash flow, how you\u2019re thinking about growing the buyback this year. Thank you.","Paul Jacobson","Sure, Duane. So we, as we\u2019ve talked about throughout the quarter, we\u2019re on track with the new $5 billion authorization which was launched last year. We\u2019ve completed about $1 billion of that and expect to complete that by the middle part of 2020, in line with the plans that we talked about last year.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins","Hey. Good morning. A couple revenue questions for me. First, on business fares domestically, with business confidence at cycle highs, what really needs to happen either from a macro perspective or from a company-specific perspective to really get that remaining 75% of the loss, corporate fares, back into the revenue line?","Glen Hauenstein","We\u2019re working on that every day, and the dynamics competitively domestically have changed a lot over the last couple of years. But we don\u2019t see any real impediment to be able to get back there over time. And so every day we\u2019re working to get those up, and it\u2019s at a market level, it\u2019s at a understanding our customers better level.","And I think we\u2019ve shown in the first quarter, anyway, what I would consider to be some industry-leading results in terms of our ability to capture that. And we see that momentum continuing into the second quarter.","Jack Atkins","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, Glen, just following up on your comments earlier on the cargo side of the business, clearly global air freight, the global air freight market is quite strong and continues to be strong driven by global trade and e-commerce demand.","Your cargo revenues jumped nicely in the quarter, up 24%. How much more opportunity is there for you on the cargo side? Because it just seems to me like belly space could be seeing increasing load factors globally, just given that main deck freighter capacity is essentially sold out globally at this point.","Glen Hauenstein","We\u2019re still a couple hundred million dollars below what our peak in cargo was just a few years ago, so I think there is continued momentum if we can, again, get back to those historic levels.","Paul Jacobson","If I can just add to that, Glen, I think the cargo team is doing a fantastic job, and where we have upside is to align the reliability and the quality of the airline into the cargo operation. They\u2019ve done a great job of getting that, improving customer service, and driving the premiums that we should expect with the type of reliability the operation can drive.","Glen Hauenstein","Great point.","Jack Atkins","Okay. Great. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Our next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Savi Syth","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I think, Glen, last time, last quarter on the call, based on current \u2013 the trends at the time, you\u2019d expected Atlantic and Latin to be the best and then maybe domestic and Pacific last. So just kind of curious given the strength, kind of the way that it came out this quarter, is that a function of domestic being weaker than you had thought at that point?","Or maybe Pacific performing better? And also just to follow-on, what were kind of the biggest drivers of the Pacific improvement?","Glen Hauenstein","Pacific has been a great surprise as we moved through the year, and my hat\u2019s off to our Pacific team who is really doing a great job managing a very robust business demand. I think when you think back to Brexit and whether or not you thought Brexit would cause more or less business demand to the UK, I think most of us would have prognosticated that Brexit would present a challenge for business traffic to the UK. ","In reality, business traffic to the UK has never been stronger. And so as we think about a lot of what\u2019s going on in the press, we are apprehensive and monitoring very closely how business travel is going back and forth to China, but all we\u2019ve seen is continued improvements and continued strength in that. So China, Japan, South Korea, all showing incredible strength.","Savi Syth","Just to follow on that, is kind of the partnership with Korean, so we should kind of expect some kind of increased momentum as that kind of gets solidified and into the network? Is that fair?","Glen Hauenstein","Yes. We have had, as we\u2019ve mentioned in earlier calls, a multiyear restructuring of our international Pacific capacity away from our hub in Tokyo and towards nonstop flying into the major points in China. Now we\u2019ll continue to refocus using Korea as our main distribution platform for secondary and third-tier cities in Asia, and we\u2019re off to a great start with our existing services, and we\u2019ll be building on that over the next years.","Savi Syth","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We will move next to Darryl Genovesi with UBS Financial. Please go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. It looks like your [indiscernible] for the second quarter combined with what you did in the first is trending towards the top end of the range for the year, even a little bit above. Should we expect a deceleration in the second half?","Paul Jacobson","So we said three for the year. We\u2019re at a little bit over that for this quarter with 1 point of that attributed to the year-over-year storm impact.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then when we \u2013 I think the last couple of times that you guys have spoken, you have alluded to CASM being towards the \u2013 or that you hoped that CASM will be closer to the lower end of the range. Paul, your commentary today sounded like it had slightly different tone. Do you still think you can get into the lower half of that range this year?","Paul Jacobson","Hey. Good morning, Darryl. Yeah, I think that that is still our target, our goal, and our expectation. I think what we were trying to do on the call today is give the market a progress update on the initiatives that we\u2019ve talked about through the year, but we still feel good about hitting those full-year targets.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then just one quick bookkeeping one. On the non-op, the $200 million to a $250 million decline, that is a change or was that fully contemplated in the original guidance and you\u2019re just disclosing it for the first time?","Paul Jacobson"," It was fully contemplated in our original plan.","Darryl Genovesi","All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Next we will move to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Good morning.","Glen Hauenstein","Good morning.","Rajeev Lalwani","Glen, a question for you. Can you just talk about your expectations around Domestic and International as the year progresses in terms of the spread between the two. I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out whether Domestic has the opportunity to catch up to International or if International is going to be coming in.","Glen Hauenstein","I think that Domestic represents such a huge revenue pool for us. To imagine that Domestic would move like the Transatlantic and be up 12 is a little bit of a stretch, but we see solid progression through the year, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on is to continue that momentum.","As you know, last year was our first year, our first quarter of year-over-year positive revenue momentum. So keeping that trajectory going over an ever-increasing base is our goal, and we think it\u2019s very achievable.","Rajeev Lalwani","[indiscernible] just a quick one for you. Obviously, very committed to hitting the earnings numbers for the year. You seem on track. Would capacity at all be a lever for you to maybe get there assuming that the pricing environment is in good shape?","Glen Hauenstein","You zoned out there. Is your question will capacity changes help keep us in our full-year guidance range?","Rajeev Lalwani","Yeah, that\u2019s right. Or is it something you would consider assuming that the pricing environment is holding obviously?","Glen Hauenstein","We\u2019re comfortable with our capacity for the year. We\u2019re generally within the range that we gave at the start of the year with respect to guidance. There are changing over the course of year. Some of the international strength certainly cause you to think there\u2019s a little more you could do there. But, fundamentally, no. Our capacity is what it is and those types of changes need to be seasoned over a much longer period of time. We can\u2019t adjust them on the dime.","Operator","Caller, did that answer your question?","Glen Hauenstein","I think it did. We can go to the next one.","Rajeev Lalwani"," It did. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Dan McKenzie","Oh. Hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. Glen, with respect to the plan for overall full-year growth of 2% to 3%, what\u2019s the growth in Premium seats for the year, and if you have it for the back half of the year? My thought is just given the upgauging this year.","The Premium seats are probably up more than 2% to 3%. And I guess I\u2019m just trying to peel back the onion on how the Premium seats sort of tie into RASM and how the average fare premium for these seats \u2013 what kind of average fare premium these seats might garner versus an average fare across the system.","Glen Hauenstein","That\u2019s really one of the backbone, if you will, of our commercial strategy is to continue to increase the number of Premium seats we have in the marketplace using the upgauging strategy as the main vehicle for that. So we will have double-digit increases throughout the year in terms of Premium seats in the marketplace.","And the premiums that we get on that depending on the product range from 10% to 2 times the average coach fare. So that\u2019s really a key driver for us, and I think one of the reasons we were able to post what I would consider to be superior revenue numbers for the first quarter.","Dan McKenzie","There we go. Thank you. And then, Paul, with respect to the 50 aircraft that are yet to be delivered this year, what\u2019s the philosophy on aircraft financing at this point, and where would that leave net adjusted debt at year-end?","And I guess where I\u2019m going with that is as you think about your pool of capital returned to shareholders, obviously, I heard you loud and clear on the $5 billion buyback, just trying to get a sense of how financing may help either expand or with respect to your leverage metrics.","Glen Hauenstein","I think we lost the caller.","Dan McKenzie","Hello?","Glen Hauenstein","Dan, are you there?","Dan McKenzie","Yeah, sorry. I\u2019m not sure. Paul, can you hear me?","Paul Jacobson","We can hear you now.","Dan McKenzie","Oh. Okay. Great. Sorry about that. My second question was for Paul. And it\u2019s just with respect to the 50 aircraft yet to be delivered this year, I was just wondering what the philosophy is on aircraft financing and where that might leave net adjusted debt at the end of the year.","Paul Jacobson","Sure, Dan. Sorry about the technical difficulties. We continue to lease some of our deliveries, but we\u2019re predominantly paying aircraft with cash, improving our unencumbered asset base and continuing to provide cushion and flexibility for the future.","The leased aircraft portfolio, as we\u2019ve discussed, is getting back into our targeted range of 20% to 25% of the fleet. It had gotten as low as 7% or 8% during the peak of our de-levering. We want that for long-term future flexibility, residual-value management, et cetera. And on the debt point, we\u2019re very comfortable where our debt sits today.","We are comfortably in all the investment grade metrics that we target and we\u2019ll continue to monitor that as we go forward. So no material change to our plans or significant desire to increase or decrease debt materially.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Thanks for the time, you guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking my questions. This is Leo Vasquez [ph] on behalf of David. So we\u2019ve had Alitalia and EasyJet holding talks, could you comment on the potential impact for the SkyTeam and codeshare plans.","Paul Jacobson","Unfortunately, we cannot.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Jill Greer","And, Eboni, this is going to be our last question from the analysts.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question from the analysts will come from Susan Donofrio with Macquarie bank. Please go ahead.","Susan Donofrio","Yes. Good morning. My question is on your new Branded Fares across the Atlantic. I\u2019m just wondering how we should be thinking about it as far as whether you think it\u2019s going to further drive top line growth that would have happened anyway from strong demand? Or should we view it as more of a defensive strategy across the Atlantic against new competition?","Paul Jacobson","I think that people like to categorize our products and service as defensive or offensive or \u2013 but really what we\u2019re trying to do is we\u2019re trying to give customers what they want to buy from us. And if you think about the evolution of airlines, because of the way we distributed tickets historically, we weren\u2019t able to provide more customized products and services to individual purchasers.","They were based on two or three classes of service and distribution through monolithic GDSs which a ticket was a ticket was a ticket. So this is really just a natural evolution of us trying to provide best-in-class services no matter what your travel needs are. ","So if you\u2019re able to pack a suitcase in an overhead bag, why would we charge you for handling baggage? So I think it allows us to provide a variety of products and services starting from a very basic customer who is willing to forego some of more historic attributes of a coach ticket in order to get a lower fare all the way up to our very premium services where we have the finest champagnes and the flatbed seats with direct aisle access and the Delta One suites.","So we\u2019re really excited about this, this change in Delta\u2019s ability to sell to our customers, and we think that it\u2019s been well accepted by the marketplace and that customers are finding value in it.","Susan Donofrio","Great. And then just as a follow up, I notice that your transatlantic partners are calling their Branded Fares different names. Would we expect, as you further integrate your transatlantic JV, that you\u2019ll start having a little bit more standardization of some of the fare products?","Paul Jacobson","I think that the first thing which was so great to do is to get the alignment on what those products are, and I think over the next five years we would like to see more convergence with our partners on the products and services, absolutely.","Does that involve them being bioidentical, if you will? Probably not. They\u2019ll all have nuances in it. But I think what we launched with Air France-KLM and what we\u2019ve launched with Virgin and what we\u2019ve launched with Aeromexico is a great step forward. Although the nomenclature and the languages sometimes are different, the value proposition in the tickets are identical, and that\u2019s a really big step forward for us.","Susan Donofrio","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Susan. Thanks, everyone. That is going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. And now I will turn it over to Ned.","John Walker","Okay. Hey. Thanks very much, Jill. Eboni, we\u2019re ready to begin the media call. If you don\u2019t mind, would you please review the process for asking a question. Also, I\u2019d like to ask the media to limit themselves to one question with a quick follow up. That way, we should be able to address most questions. Eboni?","Operator","Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question with Alana Wise from Reuters. Please go ahead.","Alana Wise","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the call and taking my question. So there was some mention earlier about business traffic to the UK, and it just made me a little bit curious about whether or not Delta is preparing for the possibility of a slowdown as the effects of Brexit begins to take effect later.","And are there concerns that changes to the current U.S.\/UK open-skies agreement could have a negative effect oven Delta\u2019s Transatlantic business?","Glen Hauenstein","Sure. We monitor this on almost a daily basis and of course we react to changes in demand profiles as quickly as we can. And we\u2019re looking at as far as we can see right now and we see no trail-off in business demand for the UK at all. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s very robust right now. But if indeed it does change we will react to it, of course. As far as the open-skies agreements, we think that there will be no real significant change in the way we operate to the UK or to Europe from any of the changes in Brexit.","Alana Wise","Fantastic. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.","Michael Sasso","Good morning. You may have seen news out this morning that the owner of British Airways, IAG, has taken a stake in Norwegian and may bid for the entire thing. I wonder if you\u2019d just comment, one, about how you see that affecting capacity or just the market across the Atlantic. And the bigger question is do you see anyone else, potentially Delta or anyone else, buying a share or potentially all of Norwegian?","Ed Bastian","Michael, this is Ed. I don\u2019t know what British Airways\u2019 plans are. I think you\u2019re probably better off asking them. And no, we don\u2019t have any plans to invest in Norwegian.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Doug Cameron [ph] with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst ","Quick couple from me. That was a long hour, everybody, a long hour. I\u2019ll never get it back. Just on Norwegian, Ed, do you still oppose their \u2013 the granting of the licenses by DOT? You\u2019re obviously vocal in your opposition and there\u2019s still been lingering calls from some of the unions. Do you think those Transatlantic licenses for the UK and Irish units should be revoked?","Glen Hauenstein","Doug [ph], we haven\u2019t engaged on that topic in some time, so I wouldn\u2019t be in a position to respond to that at this moment.","Unidentified Analyst","But you did engage in it for three years.","Glen Hauenstein","Yes, we did, and I think we\u2019ve moved on.","Unidentified Analyst","You\u2019ve moved on. Very good. Okay. Just a quick one. You talked about the AmEx site and the card revenue, et cetera. If you were to pick two or three of the shall we say nonoperating, nonflying revenues, where would you expect or would you hope to see most growth going forward in the medium term?","Glen Hauenstein","I think the AmEx relationship, which has been growing at a double-digit clip, will continue to grow at a double-digit clip, which is significantly outside the run rate of the core airline business. So I think that\u2019s a significant improvement.","Our cargo and MRO businesses are also doing very well especially with the introduction of the geared turbofan into our fleet and I think those are easily double-digit growth businesses for us, certainly over the next number of years.","And then the Branded Fares initiatives as we continue to segment and merchandise the product better will grow as a faster clip than ticketed revenues, which mentioned on the call. I don\u2019t know how much more is out there, but I think there\u2019s a considerable improvement potential and I think those are a more durable base of revenues, all of those that I mentioned going forward, which adds to our overall foundation in terms of the strength and sustainability of the business model we\u2019ve created.","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s really useful. Thanks very much. Look forward to seeing those C Series.","Glen Hauenstein","Yeah, me too.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Ted Reed with Forbes. Please go ahead.","Ted Reed","Thank you. I guess my question is for Glen. There\u2019s some reporting that I know international growth [indiscernible] particularly transatlantic is great but there\u2019s some reporting that leisure traffic from Europe and elsewhere is weak. Can you comment on that?","Glen Hauenstein","We don\u2019t see that. We see record travel between the U.S. and Europe in both directions for peak summer of 2018. So I\u2019d say we are selecting traffic from the U.S. over traffic from Europe because the fares are higher out of the U.S. than they are out of Europe. They have been historically higher for the last 20 years, and that trend continues. So to the extent that we can favor U.S. origin traffic in peak, we do. But the total traffic to Europe we think will be record-breaking this year.","Ted Reed","All right. Thank you.","Glen Hauenstein","Okay. Eboni, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from Edward Russell with FlightGlobal. Please go ahead.","Edward Russell","Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide any more detail on the number of C Series, and when the first aircraft will arrive this year?","Ed Bastian","Our plan is to take the first C Series by the end of the year and probably induct it into the service at the start of 2019.","Edward Russell","And do you know how many you plan to take this year?","Ed Bastian","In calendar 2018?","Edward Russell","Yes.","Ed Bastian","It\u2019s just a handful in the fourth \u2013 it\u2019s just a handful in the fourth quarter.","Edward Russell","Thank you.","John Walker","Okay. We appreciate everyone\u2019s time, and Ed, Glen, Paul, thank you very much. This will conclude the 2018 March Quarter Earnings Call, and we\u2019ll be back in July.

All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings.","We'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. And you can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measure on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.","And with that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Richard Anderson.","","Richard H. Anderson","Good morning. I want to take a minute to introduce our new Chief Operating Officer, Gil West. Gil is a 28 year industry veteran including his most recent position as Delta\u2019s Senior Vice President for Airport Customer Service and Technical Operations. He is a great leader and he\u2019s led the tremendous performance at Delta in completion track the baggage, on time customer service and our non-fuel CASM performance. He is a good friend and we congratulate him on his promotion.","We also huge owe a huge thanks to a really dear old friend Steve Gorman for his outstanding carrier as the Chief Operating Officer at Delta. We missed his friendship, leadership and of course his always unique point of view. We wish him best in his well earned retirement.","This morning we reported a $444 million pre-tax profit for the March quarter, which is an increase of $363 million over last year. We earned $0.33 per share beating consensus by $0.04. We grew our top line 5%, grew unit revenues 3.2%, kept our non-fuel CASM at 0.3% and expanded our operating margin by 4.4 points to 7.9%. We generated $390 million of free cash flow, reduced our net debt to $9.1 billion and returned a $176 million to our owners through dividends and share repurchases.","Our March quarter performance is remarkable because the severe weather in January and February reduced our pre-tax by $55 million. But for the weather, we would have had $500 million pre-tax profit in the seasonally most difficult quarter of the year, and that says a lot about the franchise we have here at Delta.","I want to take a moment to recognize the extraordinary efforts of all the people at work at Delta. We canceled about 17,000 flights in the first two months of the year due to weather. Through it all, our people stayed focused on taking great care of our customers which helped produced the highest customer satisfaction scores of any network carrier and a record March quarter profit.","Our operating performance in customer service across the board is fully rebounded at the top of the industry. And as a result, we\u2019ve accrued $99 million for our 2014 profit sharing program. I think these numbers reflect a resilient foundation that\u2019s really based upon the creativity and execution of the people at Delta. Despite the weather in the quarter, we met or exceeded our guidance for mid January on margin, revenue and costs. That\u2019s because we\u2019re determined to be a consistently high performing S&P 500 company that deserves the trust of long-term investors.","We are focused on the significant opportunities ahead, as we continue to transform Delta. And let me reiterate on our long-term goals, 10% to 12% annual operating margin, 10% to 15% EPS growth, 15% ROIC, return on invested capital. $5 billion operating cash flow with 50% reinvested in Delta, and we\u2019re going to operate company under investment-grade balance sheet metrics with a target of $7 billion in net debt.","In 2014, we\u2019ll meet these goals again as we\u2019re forecasting another year of significant earnings improvement, margin expansion and cash generation. The demand environment remained strong as we expect single-digit unit revenue increases in Q2 on 2% to 3% capacity increases.","Fuel prices are relatively stable and we have a significant positive fuel hedge book for the year. We are building additional momentum through our revenue fee ancillary businesses and aviation related businesses which all are performing quite well.","We are confident about our ability over the long-term to maintain a non-fuel cost structure with sub 2% y-o-y growth and significant non-op benefits from debt reduction. These strategies are expected to produce a June quarter operating margin of 14% to 16%.","This company is run through long-term shareholder value. We measure our return on invested capital with a goal of generating at least 15% return on invested capital, which is nearly double our weighted average cost of capital. This requires not only a focus on earnings, but also strict discipline around capital deployment. Our Board of Directors under our Chairman, Dan Carp, is exacting in requiring management to prove returns for every dollar we invest.","Management micro manager\u2019s capital expenditures as we required internal rate of return well above our return on invested capital with rapid paybacks. Long-term executive compensation and management compensation throughout the Company is tied to achieving the 15% return on invested capital. Our owners have entrusted us with their money and we promise to be good stewards.","Our fleet strategy is a good example of prudent capital deployment. In addition to 19 new 737-900s this year, which were cash flow positive day one, we\u2019ll take delivery of 42 717s this year. These aircraft have at least 12 to 20 years of useful life and a cost substantially less than $10 million a copy without a dollar of upfront investments by Delta to bring them into the fleet. This approach to refleeting will drive margin expansion at a lower capital cost. This strategy has produced a 16.4% return on invested capital for Delta over the last 12 months.","We will consistently improve our free cash flow. The cash generation of this business is in the top tier of the S&P 500. We expect to produce more than $5 billion of operating cash flow in 2014 with more than $3 billion of free cash flow. This puts our free cash flow yield north of 10%.","Our cash generation over the last year has allowed us to accelerate all aspects for our capital deployment plan. Our adjusted net debt is $9.1 billion and we are on track to reach $7 billion in net debt next year two years ahead of schedule. We made $500 million of incremental contributions to our pension and have reduced the unfunded liability by nearly 25% to just over $10 billion. And we have returned $525 million in cash to our owners through dividends in buybacks in the last nine months. And expect to complete our $500 million repurchase authorization two years ahead of schedule. A year-ago in April 2013, our Board adopted a five year plan, which included our shareholder return strategy.","We expect by the end of 2014 to have achieved the goals in that plan three years early. Our board and management are in the process of determining the next phase of our shareholder returns and we look forward to publicly announcing that strategy and discussing our new five year plan in early May, just as we did last year.","So across the board our performance is the Delta standard for the industry, while rivaling that of other high-quality industrial transports. We run our business on the same metrics as high-quality S&P 500 industrial transports with the same kind of discipline, determined decision-making you see from fine well-run companies. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but also significant opportunity.","I want to just take one minute because we haven\u2019t done this before, and I want to thank Jill Greer and Bonita Reynolds-Bailey for putting up with us in the process every quarter of producing our press release and our earnings material, and I want to thank them. I think we have the best IR team in the industry.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Ed.","Edward H. Bastian","","Well, thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining us today. This morning, as Richard said, we reported a pre-tax profit for the quarter of $444 million, which was $363 million higher than last year\u2019s March quarter.","Our op margin expanded by 440 basis points to 7.9%, and given the introduction this quarter of non-cash book tax expense, we believe pre-tax results provide the best year-over-year comparison of our performance. Our net profits of $281 million or $0.33 per share beat consensus by $0.04.","We achieved these results despite the impact of the severe storms in January and February, including two storms that shut down our major hub in Atlanta for several days, costing us $90 million in revenue and $55 million in pre-tax profits.","I\u2019ll join Richard in also thanking the Delta team for their dedication and determination in producing great operational performance, customer satisfaction and financial results during a very tough quarter. The Delta people continue to prove they are the very best in the business.","On the revenue front, we are seeing a solid demand environment, which produced revenue growth of 5% or $416 million despite the $90 million revenue loss due to weather. Our passenger revenues grew 5% on a 1.7% increase in capacity. We\u2019re seeing solid gains in the corporate space with corporate contract revenues up 6% for the quarter. We did see some weather impact on corporates in January and February, but demand rebounded in March and our corporate revenues were up in the 8% range for the last four weeks led by double-digit gains in the financial services, automotive and media sectors.","Passenger unit revenues increased 3.2%, driven by both higher loads and yields. There was about 0.5 point RASM benefit in the quarter from the storm cancellations. We saw our best unit revenue performance in the domestic system, which increased 6%. We saw particular strength in hub-to-hub flying, continued strong results in Atlanta and importantly, both Los Angeles and Seattle delivered high-single digit unit revenue improvement on double-digit capacity growth. In fact, Seattle had the highest domestic unit revenue gain of any of our hubs for the quarter.","Internationally, trans-Atlantic was our best performing entity despite the impact of the shift of Easter into April. Unit revenues increased to 0.5 point was about up 2 points of RASM pressure from the Easter shift. The revenue improvement was driven by a combination of yield improvement and higher loads on 1.5% lower capacity.","Latin unit revenues were flat as we absorbed an 18% increase in capacity primarily to Mexico and Brazil to improve connectivity with our partners Aeromexico and GOL. In the Pacific, our unit revenues were down 5% on flat capacity. The yen weakened 11% year-over-year, moving from 92 in the first quarter of 2013 to its current level of around 102. This weakness drove a $54 million decrease in revenues, but the bulk of that was offset by our hedges as well as savings and expense. You should note our yen hedge book at the end of March had a value of $118 million. One bright area in the Pacific portfolio has been China, with all of our China market showing year-over-year unit revenue gains despite a 15% capacity increase.","Looking forward to the June quarter, we expect to continue the trend of top line growth and margin expansion. We are expecting a solid increase in unit revenues on 2% to 3% higher capacity. The late calendar replacement of these through this year has shifted that holiday\u2019s traditional travel from March to April, and we are seeing currently April unit revenues up in the 6% range.","Our forward expectations for May and June are strong, with both months showing unit revenues up in the 5% to 7% range. This solid demand environment coupled with the success we\u2019ve had with our cost initiatives and the declining fuel price point to an operating margin of 14% to 16% throughout the midpoint is 400 basis points of expansion over last year\u2019s 11% margin.","Looking beyond the June quarter, we see a number of sources of profitable revenue growth, which we\u2019ve been aggressively investing in over the last six years. First, our investments in the network, product and operations are producing solid, sustainable revenue gains, but there is more room for growth.","We have recently completed our full flat-bed installation and business elite across our entire international widebody fleet, becoming the only U.S. carrier to offer this service with direct-aisle access. And we are also now the only U.S. carrier to offer personal on-demand entertainment at every seat in all long-haul international flights.","Our product and service investments are especially important to our corporate customers and a large driver of our 107% revenue premium to the industry. And not only are we continuing to see gains in corporate share, overall corporate travel spend is expected to increase. Our most recent corporate travel survey show that nearly 85% of corporate travel managers expect their spend will increase on Delta in 2014.","Our initiatives in New York are also delivering results and we\u2019re on track to bring our entire New York franchise to profitability this year. New York unit revenues increased 5% on 2.6% higher capacity in the March quarter. This was a significant achievement as the region was particularly impacted by the Easter shift. We are seeing RASM improvements in the double digits for April in New York.","All of our New York to L.A. flights will feature our premium flat-bed products starting July 1. We\u2019re also gaining good traction with New York corporates with the expansion of our Heathrow service through our joint venture with Virgin Atlantic. We officially launched our immunized JV with Virgin on January 1. We\u2019re now coordinating on pricing, scheduling and capacity with the introduction of the first combined schedule on March 30.","We\u2019ve also co-located our departures to New York, Boston and Seattle at Terminal 3 at Heathrow, offering Delta customers access to more amenities including the Virgin Clubhouse. Customer response has been overwhelmingly positive.","Our non-operating expense this quarter includes a $31 million charge for our share of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s March quarter loss. This is the seasonally weakest quarter of the year for Virgin and we expect they will deliver standalone profitability in 2014 providing non-operating benefit to us for the full year.","Our Seattle expansion is a key part of our Pacific network restructuring. We\u2019re pleased with our performance so far in Seattle with unit revenues improving in the quarter despite a 17% increase in capacity, which helped drive several points of margin expansion. Connecting traffic now accounts for 65% of our current Seattle flows, a trend we see increasing as we mature our service to Hong Kong, Seoul and London.","And finally, another important area of revenue opportunity is our merchandising efforts. These are products and services that allow customers to tailor their travel experience and approve their overall satisfaction while also increasing our revenue.","Products like Economy Comfort, First Class Upsell and Priority Boarding grew 20% year-over-year to a $165 million in the March quarter. Our First Class Upsell product helped increase our paid first class load factor by 5 points to 45%. We think we can grow this high margin revenue stream by $500 million annually over the next three years.","I\u2019ll wrap up here by simply stating that while we are pleased with the type of results we\u2019re producing, we\u2019re even more excited about the opportunities that lay in front of us.","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Paul.","Paul A. Jacobson","","Thank you, Ed and good morning everybody. Our cost performance this quarter truly reflects the great work by the entire Delta team. Our total operating expenses increased $13 million driven by the impact of employee investments including $99 million of profit sharing expense during the quarter. These cost increases were almost fully offset by lower fuel expense savings from our productivity initiatives and receipt of a $25 million insurance claim related to Superstorm Sandy.","On the unit cost basis, our non-fuel unit cost increased only 0.3% despite one point of cost pressure from storm cancellations. When we affirmed our cost guidance in March, we said we expected unit cost to increase more than 1%. The drivers of our out performance versus that is to estimate with the finalization of the Sandy insurance claim during the quarter, and higher than expected completion factor in the month of March, which drove slightly more capacity for the quarter.","This is now the third consecutive quarter that we have kept our non-fuel unit cost growth below 2% in line with our longer term cost commitment. With good momentum behind us, we have a number of initiatives in place that should continue to allow us to sustain this rate of growth. We\u2019re also making prudent investments in our employees products and operations.","The biggest initiative under way is our domestic refleeting. We took delivery of 24 aircraft this quarter and retired 15 mainline planes in 16 50-seat regional jets. We are on track to retire more than 70 50-seaters this year, which would put that fleet below 200 aircraft at the end of the year. The refleeting gives us a strong tailwind on unit cost as we leverage our scale to produce capacity much more efficiently.","For the March quarter, we generated 0.4 higher domestic capacity and 5.2% fewer departures. In addition to the maintenance savings from retiring the 50-seaters. This trend will continue for the next few years as we move through the refleeting project.","On the fuel side, our fuel cost of $3.03 per gallon this quarter included $107 million in hedge gains, which help to offset direct losses at the refinery.","For the March quarter operations at the refinery produced a $41 million loss. Production was reduced during the quarter as we shut down one of our crude units for scheduled modifications. These modifications to the crude unit are part of our initiative to increase the production of higher value distillates intellect jet and diesel, which we expect to account for roughly 50% of the production slate at Trainer going forward.","Our other major initiative at Trainer is domestic crude sourcing which accounted for 50,000 barrels per day of Trainer\u2019s needs during the quarter. We expect this to continue ramp up to a full year average of 70,000 barrels per day for 2014.","Though the first quarter tends to be weak for the refining space, rising RINs expense contributed to the refinery\u2019s loss. We\u2019re continuing our efforts to work with the EPA to address this issue. And we expect both the refinery and our hedge book to reduce our fuel cost for the upcoming quarter. We\u2019re projecting a fuel price for the June quarter of $2.97 to $3.02 per gallon including refinery benefits and $100 million of hedge gains.","Our non-operating expense for the quarter included a $23 million charge associated with the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar for transactions related to 2014. When the reversal of our tax valuation allowance at the end of last year, our net profit was reduced to reflect a 36% tax rate for the quarter. However, we have minimal cash tax obligations due to our $15 billion NOL balance.","As Richard mentioned earlier, we are transforming Delta into a high quality industrial company. And two of the important ways we\u2019ll do that are through our balance sheet and our cash flows. On the cash flow side, we have strong cash generation from the business as Richard mentioned. We generated more than $950 million of operating cash flow during the quarter. A solid result, but even more so given that it is net of more than $600 million in pension funding and $500 million in profit sharing payouts during the quarter.","In early April, we contributed another $300 million to the pension completing both our $655 million of prior funding, plus $250 million of additional funding. These payments will complete all of our funding for 2014. Our CapEx for the quarter was $570 million, which include a $275 million in aircraft purchases and $165 million in aircraft modifications. This resulted in $390 million of free cash flow for the quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $9.1 billion of adjusted net debt and a debt to total capital ratio of 44%. The debt reduction is moving our balance sheet closer to investment-grade metrics. And it\u2019s also driving P&L benefit through lower interest expense. Our interest expense declined by $34 million in the March quarter and we expect to save more than $100 million for 2014.","We are on track to reach our $7 billion debt target next year, which will put us on a run rate of $500 million in annual interest expense, down from $750 million in 2014. During the quarter, we continued with the accelerated pace of capital returns, sending back $176 million to our owners through dividends and buybacks. We repurchased 4 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $30.94 per total of $125 million. We\u2019ve now completed $375 million of our $500 million authorization and expect to complete that authorization during the June quarter.","Let me close by saying thank you to the entire Delta team for their contributions this quarter. It is their dedication and determination that really drives our results and makes Delta the airline of choice for customers and our investors.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Jill.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Thanks Richard, Ed and Paul. Sherlon, we are now already to go to the Q&A session, if you could give everybody their instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll have our first question from Jamie Baker, JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Hey, good morning everybody. First question relates to the pilots, and I realize it\u2019s a little bit early to be asking given the contract runs through next year. But, when you achieved the current contract you had pretty clear asks, you needed improved access to large RJs. You needed better mechanism to facilitate a 50-seat retirements and of course, the 717 was a component of the current contracts.","So, as we look forward and ponder what the pilot ask might be for 2016 and beyond. It isn't clear to me that you're in a stronger position to negotiate it, it isn't clear what the management incrementally needs. Is there something we need to be concerned about?","Edward H. Bastian","Well. No, you shouldn\u2019t be concerned about it, simply because of our track record. I think if you look back over the past eight years, we've always been able to partner with our pilots and figure out what we need to do to keep Delta at the top of the industry. And while we don't talk specifically about how or when we engage and what we talk about, our track record is the best in the industry in that regard.","Jamie N. Baker \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Okay. I'd agree with that. Richard, while I have you, on the 10% to 12% annual operating margin target through the business cycle, or the 15% ROIC, whatever metric you choose? The question I still get from investors is whether Delta is simply going to start growing again, once you achieve these targets? And as you know, the Seattle expansion has made some of your owners a bit nervous as it relates to capacity discipline, it's not my view, but I know you've had to confront it. Should we view the achievement of your financial target as an implicit license to start growing again? Or is there a different more shareholder friendly outcome?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, if you listen to my initial remarks closely, they were all geared toward making the shareholder the priority in our decision-making queue. And if you look at our capacity management over the past decade, it's been the most disciplined and will continue to be the most disciplined. And as we said at our annual Investor Day last December the growth that we are putting in the marketplace today is below GDP estimated growth.","And second, we're actually doing what we're doing with fewer shells. This quarter, we operated with seven fewer total airplanes in the fleet. So that will continue to be the kind of discipline that we have at Delta because we are focused on return \u2013 not just return, but for the whole airline, we like to look at returns by fleet and by sub-fleet.","Jamie N. Baker \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Excellent, always helpful to hear. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Michael Linenberg, Deutsche Bank.","Michael J. Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Yes, hey. Good morning, everyone. Just two questions here. I just I want to go back to the miscellaneous expense, the $81 million. I guess $23 million of that is I guess the impact from the Venezuelan bolivar and then there's the $31 million from Virgin. What's the other piece? Then what was the Virgin, that $31 million, how did that compared to the March quarter of 2013?","Paul A. Jacobson","Mike, it\u2019s Paul. There is other FX-related pressure in that miscellaneous income number that we see, but we called out the largest pieces of that.","Michael J. Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Good. And then just on the Virgin year-over-year improvement or I should say whatever was versus a year ago, do you have that number?","Paul A. Jacobson","","Well, we didn\u2019t close, Mike is that. We didn\u2019t close to \u2013 I think it was end of June last year. So we didn\u2019t have the first quarter contribution, but as I said in my remarks, we expect they are going to be profitable to standalone for the full year. So it's going to be an uplift in our reduction actually in our non-op expense.","Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just a second question here. As one who follows GOL and Aeromexico, one of the things that we've seen at both those companies is that they've seen a significant improvement in how they really produce revenue. And when you talk to those management teams, they talk about the help that they've received from Delta. You know the fact that, you know they have the opportunity to learn the best practices from one of the best carriers out there and my question is, when we saw those investments, they seem sort of more as one-off type deals, but as you sort of look around the globe, are there other opportunities where strategically, it would make sense to replicate what you\u2019re doing with Aeromexico and GOL and I realize I don\u2019t want to sort of exclude Virgin Atlantic from that? Of course you\u2019re doing that at Virgin Atlantic. But are there other opportunities like that?","Richard H. Anderson","Mike, this is Richard. As to your second question, we wouldn\u2019t answer it on the call anyway, because that\u2019s kind of like doing the Virgin transaction or the Aeromexico transaction or the GOL transaction. We\u2019re not going to discuss that publicly. But I think the reason, I mean candidly, one of the reason why those firms are doing well is heads on both their boards.","Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. All right, well thank you.","Richard H. Anderson","By the way Steve Gorman is on the Aeromexico board.","Operator","","We\u2019ll go next to John Godyn, Morgan Stanley.","","John D. Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Hey. Thank you for taking my question. I think the team has done a great job of reframing the focus toward operating margin. So just building on that, I think when we look at the normal seasonality of the business over the last few years even regardless of the Easter shift, the third quarter has tended to have even better margins than the second quarter in a fuel cooperative environment. Is that the right framework?","Richard H. Anderson","John, we\u2019re not giving third quarter guidance on this call. Obviously, the momentum is strong in the business and there will be a time to talk about that, but it\u2019s not now.","John D. Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. I was hoping the team could also elaborate a bit on the aircraft RFP. There were some comments, I think, in the press about a hopeful outlook on the A330 NEO. On the other hand of course the team is very ROIC focused, and I guess there is a third component to that how it relates to the long-term CapEx guidance that you\u2019ve all spoken to.","Richard H. Anderson","Well, we are just testing the market and it will be a pretty long process to see whether there is anything that makes sense from an ROIC standpoint, and the number could be, it could be a lot less than the number that we\u2019ve talked about there. It just depends on what happens when we get the RFP responses back. And what we\u2019ve said in our long-term guidance, it remains unchanged. We\u2019re finished with all the flat-bed mods and you saw this year we\u2019re down at \u2013 we\u2019re at a number of about $2.3 billion in CapEx. So, we\u2019re going to continue to make certain that whatever investments we do make are consistent with what you\u2019ve seen us do in terms of return on invested capital and returning capital to shareholders.","John D. Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to David Fintzen, Barclays.","David E. Fintzen \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Hey, good morning everyone. Just a question, kind of I guess on the wide RFP, but more conceptual. You\u2019ve obviously gotten a lot of CASM benefit with the regional up-gauging and the domestic up-gauging. Are there similar long-term opportunities in international to move towards bigger airplanes or is that a market that\u2019s more fragmented and you actually end up moving down in aircraft size? Just kind of curious how that plays through CASM over the next many years?","Edward H. Bastian","Talking about the causes \u2013 this is Ed, David; I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a huge up-gauge strategy on the international. Certainly there\u2019s a big CASM benefit as we look at the fuel efficiency of the new aircraft. We do operate a large fleet of 747s. So we would expect those would be candidates for replacement in this next cycle. If anything, we\u2019d be down-gauging a bit there, but certainly picking up a very nice CASM return, probably thinking somewhere in the orders of 20% to 25% more fuel efficiency on the new aircraft.","David E. Fintzen \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then just, as we\u2019re looking at particularly Seattle and the development of the international there, I mean how should we think about kind of the spool up curve for new international flying? I mean historically it\u2019s been two to three years to kind of get that flying up to system average. Is that the kind of the right way to think about Seattle or is that something you think can develop much quicker?","Glen W. Hauenstein","This is Glen. How are you doing?","David E. Fintzen \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good. Good, Glen. Thanks.","Glen W. Hauenstein","","Well, we\u2019ve been very excited about the spool in Seattle so far. As a matter of fact in the month of March, all of our new domestic markets were segment profitable and Seattle\u2019s margin improved by 8 margin points year-over-year despite a 22% increase in revenue. So we\u2019re off to a great start, and we have a lot more to go in Seattle. So we\u2019re looking forward to those all coming online over the next few months. And we do expect to become Seattle\u2019s largest carrier in terms of revenues in the third quarter of this year. So we\u2019re well ahead of our own internal forecast on Seattle and we\u2019re pretty excited about the early returns.","David E. Fintzen \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. That sounds very helpful. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Savi Syth, Raymond James","Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","Hey, good morning. Just wondering, how much of a benefit in this hub-to-hub flying and just domestic unit revenue are you seeing from the Virgin partnership right now? And is that some of the $120 million that you had projected in synergies or is that $120 million yet to come?","Edward H. Bastian","Savi, this is Edward. We\u2019re certainly starting to see some benefits. I think it\u2019s very early. I\u2019d say it\u2019s very early obviously since we just launched the JV as of the first of the year and we had ATI granted not until late last year. So the $120 million of synergies is the combination of the JV and the revenue benefits that the partnership will bring us as well as our share of the earnings of Virgin Atlantic going forward. It\u2019s certainly benefiting our New York Heathrow P&L considerably and we expect over the next two years you\u2019re going to see a pretty quick ramp up of those benefits.","Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, understood. And I apologize for the overhead noise. I\u2019m in an airport right now. But just a follow-up question on the refinery, has the upgrade work been completed, and is expectation still that it will be somewhat profitable in the second quarter and maybe profitable in the year?","Paul A. Jacobson","Good morning, Savi. This is Paul. The upgraded work has been completed. We have been producing approximately 50% distillate products throughout the month of March. We do expect that we will be profitable in the June quarter.","Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. All right, thanks so much.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Glenn Engel, Bank of America.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Good morning. Couple of question, please. One, the revenue was up 8% in the first quarter, you said mainly SkyMiles. Is that type of strength likely to continue?","Richard H. Anderson","Yes, we do expect to see some continuing improvements in our SkyMiles program, not just the benefits of the relationship with Amex, but in the future the changes that we\u2019re going to be making back to our frequent flyer activities. We also got some benefits in the quarter from our JV relationships, particularly in Europe.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That shows up in the other revenue line?","Richard H. Anderson","Yes.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And when I looked on the expense side, on the contract, the regional jet capacity cost, it was down 4%. That was in line with capacity, down 4%. I guess it surprises me. With all the cancellations I would expect to see cost pressures on a unit basis on the regional side. Why didn\u2019t that occur?","Paul A. Jacobson","Glenn, this is Paul. That\u2019s going to be offset by maintenance savings as a result of the retirement of the 50-seaters, will offset some of that pressure.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is maintenance cost likely to be more level this year than it has been in the past where it\u2019s been much more frontend loaded?","Paul A. Jacobson","Yes. I think as we talked about at Investor Day, we expected maintenance CASM to be flat for the year. I think due to timing there is a little bit of extra business in the first quarter, but generally around flat for the year.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And finally, where did the $25 million Sandy or credit show up?","Paul A. Jacobson","In other expense.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.","Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks very much operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. I just have a couple of questions and one point of clarification. When you talk about RASM, are you talking about total RASM or just passenger RASM?","Richard H. Anderson","Generally passenger RASM.","Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then just on the new pilot rules that went into effect in early January. Can you just talk about where the cost associated from that would be and whether or not \u2013 and how you\u2019re able to handle that successfully?","Richard H. Anderson","We\u2019ve been able to handle it from an operating perspective incredibly successfully, and Jill how many perfect completion factor days do we have?","Paul A. Jacobson","We\u2019ve got 24 year-to-date.","Richard H. Anderson","We have 24 perfect completion factor days year-to-date. And we\u2019ve been able to manage through that actually quite effectively because the way our pilot agreement was already set up, we had a fair amount of flexibility in terms of being able to manage to the new rules and we put a lot of work into our systems and our planning in advance of 117. In fact, we asked the FAA to let us start a little bit early so that we could have it for the full month of January for the purposes of planning. So you see it or not, we don\u2019t break out separately that kind of detail in our non-fuel CASM, but you can see overall our non-fuel CASM in the quarter was excellent.","Glen W. Hauenstein","I would just also add that practically our operational control center manages that on a daily basis to mitigate the impact.","","Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. And then can I just ask one other question? I saw yesterday a letter that the airport at Atlanta sent to, I guess, a bunch of the international airlines kind of looking around to expand their international service, to ask other airlines to expand internationally into Atlanta. And I\u2019m just wondering if they do this incentive program that they are talking about, can you actually participate in that as one of the larger international airlines there?","Richard H. Anderson","Yes, we will participate and we\u2019re eligible to participate in the program and plan on being able to qualify for much of the $2 million in grants.","Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Great. Okay and that would show up I guess in what passenger revenue or that would just\u2026","Richard H. Anderson","","No, it's rents and landing fees. It's a reduction. The way it's properly accounted for is \u2013 it will just be a straight reduction in rents and landing fees, but we don't call that out by airport. So you are not going to be able to see it in the P&L.","Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","","And it\u2019s a small number but still I mean you might as well take advantage of that if you can get it.","Richard H. Anderson","Although Atlanta is by far the most efficient airport to land an airplane in the United States, I think our landing fee to give you an idea, our landing fee cost in Atlanta are half of what Miami is.","Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Awesome that\u2019s really great. Thank you so much for your help.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie, Buckingham Research.","Dan J. McKenzie \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","","Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for the time. I guess first congrats to Ben and team on winning a legal case in Italy, I think investors are breathing a huge sigh of relief. But a couple of questions here; one, what\u2019s driving the strength to China. Is the strength coming primarily from new accounts, or call it corporate share gains. Or is it more that your existing accounts are just simply investing more heavily in the country. Any additional color here would be greatly appreciated?","Edward H. Bastian","We see very strong demand for corporates to China through the first quarter and we also were able to achieve a re-time of one of our Beijing slots from an un-preferred time to repeat time channel, which had a very positive impact on the Beijing operations. So a combination that's continuing to work with our Chinese partners on improving our connectivity and our schedules to interior China, as well as a good strong core demand from the U.S.","Dan J. McKenzie \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","","Okay, very good. Thank you. Second question here is, I'm wondering if you can help us peel back the onion on the fleet reguaging initiatives. I believe when you introduced the initiative originally, Delta was targeting $1 billion of structural cost savings. Wondering if you can help us or just share what that cost savings contribution was in the first quarter? Where are we, with respect to that $1 billion goal? And do the cost savings a straight line from there?","Paul A. Jacobson","Hi, Dan this is Paul. Yes, when we outlined that $1 billion structural cost savings, there were a number of the buckets in there. Gauge was just one of them, which we had highlighted about $350 million a year of run rate benefits out of that program. We're probably still in the sort of early to middle stages of that process as we've just begun receiving and getting in a steady flow of 717s and some of the 7060 regional jet deliveries, so we still have more to come.","Dan J. McKenzie \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks everybody.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth, Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","Hi, good morning, thanks. Just wanted to come back to this seasonality of earnings question, as you build out Seattle to Asia, restructure Japan, grow to Latin America. Is there any reason to expect at this point that the seasonality of your earnings has changed?","Richard H. Anderson","","No, there is no reason to expect that to change. The changes within the network are not that material.","Edward H. Bastian","But I do think what, you've seen us be able to do last year and this year is to be able to run a profitable cash flow positive business quarter-in and quarter-out, and that's very important for our investors. It's very important for being a member of the S&P 500.","Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","Thanks for that. And then on the non-op line as we think about seasonality, can you give us any sense for the swing that you expect from Virgin as we approach their seasonally stronger quarters?","Paul A. Jacobson","Well, their strength will fairly be in Q2 and Q3. I mentioned then we're expecting them to be profitable for the year, but we haven't given the guidance as to what that number is. So you can expect to see positive contributions in both Q2 and Q3, and hopefully Q4 as well.","Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","Thanks. And then, just lastly, on your 10% to 12% EBIT margin target, what happens if you exceed that in a given year? Does the target change? And thanks for taking the questions.","Paul A. Jacobson","That expectation, Duane, is over the cycle. So we would expect certain years that we would be on the upper end of that range.","Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Kim, Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to ask about the competitive environment on the Pacific and also with regards to the Pacific, can you help us break down the TransPac PRASM ex-Japan, what that would have looked like in Q1?","Richard H. Anderson","Tom, we don't give that level of detail. We did say that China was positive and obviously our Japanese flying was the main source of the negative unit revenue driven by the yen devaluation.","Thomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then just with regards to cargo, this has been an area where we've seen, I guess now a couple of years of weakness. Obviously not a huge part of the revenue, but it is one that's still a slight drag. And I was just wondering, if you can elaborate on what percentage of this is coming from domestic versus international, and are you seeing any signs that the cargo should recover? Thanks.","Richard H. Anderson","We are not seeing much signs of recovery. It continues to be a very difficult. Most of our the cargo weaknesses coming on the international front versus the domestic front and there is a lot of yield and as well as tonnage pressure that it's not unique to Delta, as you are seeing it across not just the U.S. industry, you are seeing on a global scale. There is too much capacity, cargo capacity out there in a lot of these international markets.","","Thomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right, okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe DeNardi, Stifel.","Joe W. DeNardi \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thanks good morning. A question for you Richard on the international margins, just curious to get your perspective on how you view that competitive dynamics there in general relative to domestic? Obviously, domestic is benefiting from all the consolidation capacity discipline. So, is all of the soft consolidation that's happened internationally in terms of JVs and alliances? Has that effectively changed the competitive landscape, so that it looks a little bit more like what you are seeing domestically or does international look a little bit more like what you saw at domestic maybe five or 10 years ago?","Richard H. Anderson","International has gone through a pretty significant amount of consolidation, and if you just go by a region, when we look at our business down in Latin America, you had significant consolidation in Mexico. There is one single flag carrier in Mexico now and they are exclusive partners with Delta.","You've had consolidation in South America with LAN-TAM merger, the Avianca-TACA merger, so the world is really evolving there very quickly in much the same way as the U.S. If you look in the trans-Atlantic, as Ed pointed out, that's been consistently our very best performer, and our immunized joint venture and the immunized joint ventures essentially have three global alliances now in that marketplace.","And in Asia, when you look at the TransPac market, it's really clustered around the three alliances. So we\u2019ve seen a good market dynamics in the regions that we operate around the world and we continue to expect that worldwide consolidation will continue.","Joe W. DeNardi \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay and then for Paul. At the Analyst Day, the CapEx outlook was more like $2 million to $2.5 million, now it's 50% of cash flow. Can you help me understand why that's the right way to frame it longer-term, rather than saying, this is what we need to invest and 75% or whatever the number is goes back to shareholders, I feel like that's more along the lines of what an industrials company would do, so interested to hear your thoughts on that.","","Paul A. Jacobson","Sure, Joe good morning. What we've outlined is 50% of CapEx as part of a broader, more balanced capital allocation strategy for all the cash that's generated inside the Company. I think that's been in line with that sort of $2 million to $2.5 million level, against the cash flow that we have been generating over time. So as we continue to evolve down that space, I think that's subject to continue modification for the size and the cash generation of the Company.","Richard H. Anderson","","I would add one other thing; the great piece of discipline in our business is driving to a return on invested capital metric. Delta has shown a strong capability of hitting very high internal rate of return targets for a very measured investments internally. And I would focus on the return on invested capital number and making certain that we hold to that number and produce those kinds of returns on a consistent basis.","Joe W. DeNardi \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","","Okay, thanks guys.","Jill Sullivan Greer","","And Sherlon, we are going to have time for one more question.","","Operator","","That will come from Hunter Keay, Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, thanks again. Hey, Glen, how come you eliminated some of your checked bag fees on routes a couple of weeks ago?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Hunter we\u2019re not going to answer that.","Hunter K. Keay \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. How come Seattle was only 10% to 20% of connecting traffic three months ago, but now it's up to 65% of connecting traffic? How did that happen so fast?","Edward H. Bastian","I don\u2019t think 10% to 15% was an accurate depiction I think it might have been a misunderstanding of what we were talking about last call, Hunter, that's got to be anything else, the full depth of our connecting close.","Hunter K. Keay \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay thank you, Ed. And the question is, is there any revenues from the Virgin JV hitting the revenue line or is it all showing up in the non-op line and if there are revenues, are there also ASMs associated with it coming through?","Richard H. Anderson","The revenues from the Virgin JV do show on the revenue line to the extent they are coming on Delta metal Virgin passengers, but most of the benefits at this point in time will show on the non-op line.","Hunter K. Keay \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","And are there ASMs associated with that Ed, and thanks a lot.","Edward H. Bastian","No, we don\u2019t have any Virgin ASMs in our numbers.","Hunter K. Keay \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, thank you.","","Jill Sullivan Greer","","That is going to conclude the analyst portion of the phone call. I'm going to turn the call over to Ned Walker for the media.","","John E. Walker","","Hey, thanks very much Jill. Sherlon, if you could review the steps for the media to ask a question. Also we would like to ask the media if it could limit it to one question and a quick follow-up, we should be able to accommodate most everyone. With that, we will turn it back to you, Sherlon.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll have our first question from Jack Nicas, The Wall Street Journal.","Jack Nicas \u2013 The Wall Street Journal","Good morning, everyone thank you for the time. Richard, I was hoping you can speak to this. Can you discuss a bit about the accounting court ruling against Emirates, ruling that they could not fly from Milan to New York and how important that is for you guys and if Emirates tries that sort of flying with history of Emirates from other foreign countries to the U.S., is that something you guys are going to pursue legally and try to block that as well?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, Fifth Freedoms under the Chicago Convention way back in the 1940s were never intended to be used the way that they were used in those circumstances. And so, we\u2019re optimistic that the decision of the Italian court will be a precedent that will be followed in other venues, because it was never the intention. The Fifth Freedoms were originally intended to take into account the range of airplanes to be able to fly nonstop, and it wasn\u2019t intended to in essence set up operations between two countries neither of which you are citizen of, so \u2013 as standalone operations. So we\u2019re pleased with the result and we will be very vigilant as an industry and being certain that these kinds of unbalanced trade activities from state-owned subsidized enterprises don\u2019t create an unfair trade environment.","Jack Nicas \u2013 The Wall Street Journal","","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein, Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein \u2013 Bloomberg News","Hi. I wanted to see if you could possible give us an update on your activity regarding the Ex-Im Bank and its reauthorization? And I also wanted to ask the supporters of the reauthorization of Ex-Im Bank. You said they\u2019re going to launch an all hands on deck effort to win the reauthorization, and I\u2019m just wondering how bigger role you see for Delta in opposing that?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, we have played a significant role opposing it, and it\u2019s not so much the reauthorization. It\u2019s the bank needs to be reformed. There is no transparency around what it does with tax payers\u2019 money in the United States and it creates a huge subsidy for state-owned carriers in the United States.","So in essence while we don\u2019t have any aviation Airline policy, co-gen airline policy in the United States, our treasury goes and we get a very good view of this, because the companies that we own interests in, down in Brazil and Aeromexico, we get a pretty good glimpse of the kinds of financings that the Ex-Im Bank provides and they\u2019re well below market. And they\u2019re competing against private marketplace, alternatives to capital and we believe there needs to be reform.","And there is a place for the Bank in the marketplace when the bank was originally setup, back 60 or 70 years ago. It was to provide seed financing in developing nations. And now we\u2019re providing, at a time when we run huge deficits in the United States, we\u2019re taking the United States Treasury, the United States balance sheet and we\u2019re financing investment grade state-owned airlines at borrowing costs that are probably around 300 basis points less than what Delta would pay, and that\u2019s just not right for our government to do that. So there\u2019s a place for the bank, but the bank needs to be reformed and it needs to be transparent and it shouldn\u2019t be providing financing in any instance where there\u2019s a private market alternative. And our concerns are only limited to widebody airplanes. Not narrowbody airplanes or industrial equipment or the like.","I will point out that both Valero Energy and Cleveland-Cliffs Steel have both also filed objections in their industries in instances where the Bank has financed their foreign competitors to compete against U.S. interests. In the end, it's about jobs, and I can tell you that when the Ex-Im does this, as in the case of Air India, it takes jobs away from the United States.","Mary Schlangenstein \u2013 Bloomberg News","Do you feel like you're gaining any traction on your efforts to get the reforms that put into place?","Richard H. Anderson","Yes, we are gaining traction. At the last ASU negotiation, we significantly increased the financing costs by a couple of hundred basis points. Second, in the last round of reauthorization, there were transparency requirements, which have been largely ignored, and there was a requirement that the United States, State Department and Treasury engage with EU authorities to negotiate an end to \u2013 both the EU and the U.S. run these huge, huge deficits. And the last thing they need to be doing is further funding those deficits by financing airplanes.","Okay, Sherlon with that we have time for one more quick question.","Operator","That comes from Ted Reed, The Street.","Ted Reed \u2013 The Street","Thank you. My questions were largely asked, so I'd just like to ask, is it now fair to call Delta in terms of revenues the world's second largest airline due to revenue trends?","","Richard H.

Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Here in Atlanta today we have Richard Anderson our CEO, Ed Bastian our President, and Paul Jacobson, our CFO, and we have the remainder of the leadership team here in the room with us for Q&A.","Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flows. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow up.","Today\u2019s discussion does contain forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings.","We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. And you can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Richard.","Richard Anderson","Thanks Jill. This morning we reported the best first quarter in Delta\u2019s history producing solid top line growth, margin expansion and substantial free cash flow. Our pre-tax earnings grew 34% from last year to $594 million despite $300 million from early hedge settlements in the quarter.","We earned $0.45 per share versus a consensus of $0.44. We grew our top line revenues by 5%, increased our operating margin by 1.0% to 8.8% and generated a return on invested capital of 22% for the last 12 months.","Our strong cash generation continued with 1.1 billion of operating cash flow and north of $500 million of free cash flow in the first quarter. We contributed 900 million to our pension plans, maintained net debt levels of just over $7 billion and returned $500 million to shareholders in dividends and buybacks.","We continue to run by far the industry's best operation. In the March quarter we delivered 98.6 completion factor that had a lot of tough weather days in it but we did have 25 days with zero mainline cancellations.","Our mainline on-time rate improved 3.1 points to 83.4%. This operational performance is contributing to solid increases in customer satisfaction, we have achieved all time highs in our Net Promoter scores and our customer complain rate has decreased by 23% so far this year.","These outstanding results were made possible by the dedication of our employees who work hard everyday to provide an industry leading customer experience and outstanding returns to our shareholders.","Looking forward the business on the whole is performing quite well, while the strong dollar is creating a $600 million headwind for our international revenues, it is also a factor in keeping fuel prices down which will contribute over $2 billion in gross savings year-on-year in 2015.","We are looking at June quarter operating margins of 16% to 18% up over 200 basis points year-over- year with over $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the June quarter.","These record results in cash flow show that the strong dollar is a net positive for Delta.","We will use that cash flow to further reduce our debt levels and buyback our stock.","These are permanent positive changes to our capital structure. But even with this record level of performance, we have a lot of work left to do to improve our business for our owners.","The domestic business is performing very well and demand is solid. Our network and product investments combined with the world class customer service of our employees have widened our domestic revenue premium to the industry which currently stands at 115%.","We will continue to be disciplined with our domestic capacity levels, with our domestic growth driven by higher gauge in fewer total airplanes which will cause us to improve efficiency and drive higher operating margins.","On the international side, like all U.S. global companies, we are working through volatile currencies around the world. We are taking action to address these issues by reducing our international capacity by 3% year-over-year this winter.","This is a six point reduction versus our planned capacity levels. Unlike other U.S. global companies, our margins and profitability will expand in 2015 in the phase of currency volatility because of dramatic fuel cost reductions and top line growth.","With flat system capacity for the fourth quarter, we should get our unit revenue growth back on the right trajectory. Cost productivity is a core part of Delta and we've kept our non-fuel CASM growth below 2% for seven consecutive quarters.","We have good control of our costs and we continue to drive productivity through domestic upgauging, technology investments and leveraging our scale.","The biggest cost opportunity ahead of us is fuel. We restructured our hedge book this quarter which will put the bulk of our hedge losses behind us after this quarter. So starting July 1, we will have significant tailwind for fuel with fuel prices 25% lower than what we will pay in the first half of the year.","Over the long-term our focus is on building a durable business model not just through our margin expansion efforts but also by taking risk out of our enterprise, we have the best labor relations in the industry with a strong paper performance culture and a history of working collaboratively with all of our employees.","On business risk, we expect considerable time diversifying our revenue streams and building out a geographically balanced network, 15% of our passenger revenues are part of immunized joint ventures and 20% of total revenues from non-ticket sources.","Finally, we are reducing our financial risk, we have lowered our fixed cost structure uniquely with our aircraft purchase strategy which gives us the flexibility to quickly make capacity adjustments.","We have also substantially strengthened our balance sheet with nearly $10 billion in debt reduction in less than five years. We are only two notches away from investment grade and with another strong year in 2015, we expect to operate Delta with investment grade credit metrics by year end.","With a clear path to long-term margin expansion and reduced risk, we get improved earnings predictability and better visibility to the long-term cash generation of this business.","We are investing in our future to healthy base of $2 billion to $3 billion annually which is more than sufficient to support our strategies, and this year we expect to generate $4 billion to $5 billion in free cash flow after those investments, less than 10% of the S&P 500 generate free cash flow at this level.","In 2015, Delta will once again comfortably exceed our long-term commitments to our owners and despite being one of the top performers in the S&P 500 over the last year, last several years, we believe there is considerable upside in Delta stock.","Our free cash flow yield is roughly 12% to 13% compared to the S&P Industrials average of 5% to 6% and our PE multiple is at roughly half the level of this peer group.","We are working through our updated long-term plan now. We'll take the plan to our Board at the end of this month. Part of that work includes developing the next set of metrics that will guide the business including the optimal long-term debt target and level of shareholder returns for the company.","We believe this plan will give long-term equity holders very clear guidance on our future and what they can expect from our cash flows and it will show that Delta has earned a place among the top tier S&P 100 companies. We look forward to sharing those plans with you in mid-May.","With that I'll turn the call over to Mr. Bastian and Mr. Jacobson.","Edward Bastian","Thank you, Mr. Anderson, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a record March quarter with pretax income increasing over 30% to $594 million, despite a $300 million early hedge settlement.","Our net income was $372 million or $0.45 per share versus consensus of $0.44. We expanded our operating margin by a point to 8.8% which includes the impact of the early out of quarter hedge settlements, which cost us roughly three points of margin. These results are in line with the initial margin guide we gave in January.","The quarter was obviously impacted by our $1.1 billion in hedge losses, thus to give you a better sense of the core performance of the business. End market fuel prices our margin for the quarter is 17.8% among the best in the industry and provides a good go-forward perspective on our margin expectations given our hedge losses will be largely behind us as of July 1.","I want to thank the great Delta people for their dedication and determination that made these record results possible. We continue to grow the topline which will be up 5% to $9.4 billion against a back drop of roughly 45% in lower market fuel prices and $105 million in currency headwinds.","Corporate revenues increased 3% despite pressure from currencies, with strength in the Trans-Atlantic driven by our joint venture with Virgin Atlantic and from the financial services industry both up double-digits in the March quarter.","Our recent survey shows corporate travel managers continue to be optimistic about the remainder of the year with roughly 85% of respondents anticipating they will maintain or increase spending over the balance of this year.","We also saw good traction with our ancillary revenues. Merchandising revenues including branded fares, first-class upsell and preferred seating grew by 27% and contributed an incremental $50 million to our top-line this quarter.","However, the strong dollar and lower international surcharges are causing our revenue performance to fall short of expectations. As Richard mentioned, we are taking action with our winter capacity plans to address these issues which I'll give details on in just a few minutes.","First, on the March quarter. Passenger unit revenues declined 1.7% driven by 1.5 points of currency effect. However, the underlying demand environment is stronger than the RASM optics would suggest. In fact on a currency neutral basis, unit revenues were essentially flat with last year's levels.","Our domestic performance remains solid with RASM flat on 5% higher capacity. And as a reminder, two of those capacity points were caused by the first quarter 14 winter storm cancellations which created one point of RASM benefit that we had to overcome this year.","Our Seattle expansion is performing well with domestic unit revenues up 2% on 55% higher capacity. We also saw strength in our JFK long haul markets, especially the Transcons as we continue to make corporate gains in New York and Los Angeles. Our hub to hub markets also performed well with 4% RASM gains.","In the Trans-Atlantic, unit revenues declined 3% driven entirely by a three point currency headwind on four points of higher capacity. Strength in core Europe and London offset headwinds in Africa, the Middle East and Russia which pressured entity unit revenues by more than two points.","To give perspective, these markets collectively saw unit revenue declines up 15% despite 10% capacity reductions. We're pleased with the performance of our two Trans-Atlantic joint ventures. This quarter as these relationships with Air France, KLM, and Virgin Atlantic allowed us to expand margins despite significant currency pressure on the euro and pound.","In Latin America, unit revenues declined 4% on 13% higher capacity. The entirety of the decline was driven by currency and pressure from last year's Venezuela in capacity reductions.","Our partners GOL and AeroMexico contributed $33 million in incremental revenues this quarter and we have more opportunity to expand these relationships. Along with AeroMexico, we\u2019ve filed an application for anti-trust immunity for a new $1.5 billion joint venture between the U.S. and Mexico. This is a significant opportunity that expands options for customers to the largest market in Latin America.","We face our toughest revenue environment in the Pacific where unit revenues declined 9% with roughly seven points of the decline driven by foreign exchange. Specifically, the Yen revenue headwind in the quarter was $40 million net of hedges. For the remainder of 2015, our Yen hedges are valued at about $110 million.","Now looking forward to the June quarter, we are forecasting total revenues to increase about 2% with RASM down 2% to 4% on 3% higher capacity. About three points of that RASM decline is attributable to currency and international surcharge declines. It is also important to note that we are lapping a very strong Q2 2014 performance in which we grew system RASM at 6% which is the toughest comp we'll face this year.","Our summer revenue performance combined with significantly lower fuel prices and continued strong cost controls should result in another record profit with second quarter operating margin of 16% to 18% up two points year-on-year. Excluding hedges our second quarter margins are expected to be north of 20%.","Domestically, the demand environment remains stable and we expect unit revenues to be roughly flat this quarter on 3% to 4% more capacity. This is consistent with the performance we saw in March of what we're already seeing in April. We expect international RASM to be down in the high single digits in Q2 with five points of impact from currency.","In addition to currency, we're also continuing to experience softer demand trades in certain markets including Brazil, Russia, the Middle East and Africa. However, revenue headwinds from currency will be more than offset by cost reductions and fuel price declines. Cash flow and margin performance in the international entities will be at record levels this summer.","Post Labor Day, we will reduce our planned international capacity by six points resulting in a 3% year-on-year reduction to get our RASM performance back to better levels for the winter. This reduction will be a key component to achieve the pricing improvements necessary to drive longer term sustainable margin expansion.","In the Trans-Atlantic, we'll reduce our planned capacity levels by five points resulting in a 0% to 2% capacity decline for the fourth quarter. The biggest adjustments will be in Africa, India and the Middle-East which will see a reduction of 15% to 20%. In addition, we will suspend service to Moscow for the winter season.","In Latin America, our network investment tails-off later this year with capacity growth less than 2% by the fourth quarter.","To address the RASM pressure, we've seen from the devaluation of the Real, we'll reduce capacity to Brazil by about 15%. We'll also make adjustments to longer haul ethnic markets that are highly reliant on foreign point of sale traffic. These capacity adjustments along with lapping the impact of last year's capacity reductions in Venezuela should drive a better unit revenue result. Pacific will take longer to show improvement as we take the next steps in our network restructuring there.","Through gauge reductions, we'll take another 15% to 20% of capacity out of Japan including a 25% reduction in our intra-Asia and beach lines since those markets have been significantly impacted by the devaluation of the Yen. These capacity reductions will be achieved through down-gauging which will allow us to retire six more 747's by the end of the year. In total, our Pacific capacity will decline 10% in the fourth quarter.","We should have good margin and cash flow performance through the seasonally strong second and third quarters. Once the peak summer season ends, we are moving quickly on our capacity actions which will continue to drive momentum in the business.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Paul to go through the details on cost and cash flow.","Paul Jacobson","Thank you, Ed. Strong cost control is a highlight again this quarter and was a key driver of our strong margin expansion we realized before early hedge settlements.","Total operating expenses increased by $356 million driven largely by higher volumes and investments in our product and people, as well as by higher profit-sharing expense which was up 40% versus last year.","Non-fuel CASM declined 1.4% on a 5% capacity increase driven by up-gauging initiatives, lower maintenance expense due to the 50 seat retirements and other productivity improvement efforts. FX also benefited non-fuel CASM by about a point.","Moving on to fuel. Our total fuel expense increased slightly as lower market prices were offset by higher consumption at our hedge losses. Our all-in fuel price was $2.93 per gallon down from $3.03 in the same period last year. The early settlements added about $0.33 per gallon for the quarter.","The refinery made an $86 million profit this quarter versus a $41 million loss in the same period last year. The improvement was driven by lower group costs driven by an increase in North American consumption, a continued favorable crack spread environment and increased throughput.","Over the last four quarters, the refinery has produced a cumulative profit of over $220 million. We expect that to continue to build in 2Q with a projected profit of approximately $80 million.","As Richard mentioned and as we disclosed previously, we took steps in the first quarter to restructure our second half 2015 hedge book in order to balance our exposure while still retaining some level of longer term upside protection.","In February, we took an advantage of the 20% spike in forward curves to settle about a third of our second half 2015 hedges for approximately $300 million. We also extended a similar portion of our exposure out of the back half of 2015 and into 2016. While the second quarter will have approximately $650 million in hedge losses, the average price per gallon will be significantly lower than what we realized in Q1. Specifically, we are projecting an all-in fuel price of $2.35 to $2.40 per gallon for the June quarter.","For the June quarter, we are approximately 40% hedged against an increase in prices but have nearly full downside participation of about 90% all the way down to Brent prices of $40 a barrel.","For the second half of the year, given the hedge book restructuring, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be consistent with the industry average. We have a total of about $300 million in hedge losses for the second half and 90% to 95% downside participation to a Brent price of approximately $40 a barrel. This will equate to roughly 25% lower price per gallon for Delta in the second half relative to the first.","For the second half of the year, we expect our all-in fuel price to be in the range of $2 and $2.05 per gallon which is approximately $0.70 to $0.75 lower than 2014.","Overall, we continue to expect fuel costs to be an enormous tailwind and provide a net benefit of $2.2 billion for Delta for the year. We are also well positioned to benefit of fuel remains at these levels in 2016.","As a result, our already strong cash flow will continue to grow which will allow us to further strengthen the balance sheet by paying down debt, fund our pension plans, and return cash to shareholders in 2015 and beyond.","For the March quarter, we generated more than $1 billion of operating cash flow, net of $900 million in pension contributions. This compares to $605 million of pension contributions in last year's March quarter.","We subsequently made substantially all of the remaining 2015 contributions for a total of $1.2 billion for the year. We also reinvested roughly $600 million back into the business primarily related to aircraft modifications and the purchases required for our domestic re-fleeting.","For the June quarter, we are projecting $1 billion in capital expenditures primarily related to 737-900 and A330 deliveries, as we continue to reinvest in the business for the long term.","With more than $500 million of free cash flow we generated during the March quarter, we continued our path of increasing shareholder capital returns with $75 million of dividends and $425 million of share repurchases. To date, we have completed $1.3 billion of our existing $2 billion authorization.","Adjusted net debt at the end of the quarter was $7.4 billion and our debt reduction lowered interest expense by $55 million for the quarter. We continue to expect strong free cash flow generation going forward and remain committed to a capital allocation strategy that drives value for our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our longer term capital deployment plan in May.","In closing, I'd like to once again thank the entire Delta team for another record breaking quarter. We have the best employees in the industry and our performance is driven by their contributions.","Thanks. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jill.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Thanks, Paul. Sherlon, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call with the analysts, so if you could give instructions on how to get into the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi, good morning. Thanks very much for taking the question and thanks for all the detail. I guess just the first one. When we think about the future outlook from here, and I know you're not ready to give 2016 capacity guidance yet, but should we think about this as a reduction in kind of the overall capacity levels that you would see from Q4 forward, or is this capacity cut more about a bigger swing between the peak periods and the off-peak periods?","Edward Bastian","Darrel, this is Ed. We are \u2013 the guidance we've provided for the post Labor Day you can expect should carry through the winter season into the spring of 2016, and obviously at that point we'll be better position to understand where fuel prices are and where currency are and it focus as you know largely on the international network. So, we need some time to see how the volatility settles a bit, but we're keeping all our options open.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. Thank you. And then also I had a question on tax. At your Investor Day and maybe this one's for Richard, you alluded to the potential to maybe pay a tax rate less than the 38% you've been running through the P&L by taking advantage of some of the international JVs. I suppose you're not ready to provide an update on exactly what rate you might expect, but was wondering, if that is the case, should we also expect a reduction in the book tax rate going forward for the purposes of the P&L, and then also perhaps a retroactive revision higher to the current NOL balance?","Richard Anderson","Well, the question with respect to the book tax rate is above my pay grade. I don't know whether I would really be able to explain that. I do think that we'll be in a position probably by our investor update in December of this year to update you on our tax strategies. We do have viable options given the breadth and scope of our international operations to have a positive impact on our tax rate.","Darryl Genovesi","Thank you.","Richard Anderson","And Bill Carroll here, our Controller and the person to whom I direct all accounting questions.","Bill Carroll","There won't any impact on the NOL?","Darryl Genovesi","I'm sorry, well, I didn't hear you?","Bill Carroll","I'm sorry there will not be any impact on the net operating losses. I mean, those are pretax numbers that will come through and this will be at what rate they get benefited at?","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Julie Yates, Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. A question on the revenue environment, so Q2 PRASM marks the fourth quarter of deceleration and the reasons are well telegraphed, but it seems that Q2 could be shaping up to be a little low point for unit revenue growth and that Q3 directionally improves with the prospect of potentially returning deposits of comps in Q4 since headwind start to anniversary, capacity will be lower and even maybe the branded fares contribution run rate will improve. Is this the right way to think about unit revenue production as the year progresses?","Edward Bastian","I think that consistent with our expectation, surely, we've not guidance beyond Q2 right now, but directionally, yes.","Julie Yates","Okay.","Richard Anderson","That mean the one thing you not miss in all that is that we will have really fine margins in Q2 and Q3 margins we haven't seen before.","Julie Yates","Sure. And then maybe one for Ed, can you breakdown the Q2 PRASM expectation by international geography and the currency hit that you expect in each?","Edward Bastian","I don't know that I have all the details to Q2. Our focus \u2013 the guidance we've given is more post Labor Day. We expect a \u2013 I think we said about three points of the international \u2013 excuse me, of the system wide RASM decline to be driven by currency and the fuel surcharge declines which covers probably say 75% of what the overall international RASM decline","Julie Yates","Okay.","Edward Bastian","So on balance our minus two to four is a effectively similar to what we saw in Q1 and that's draw the majority of that unit revenue overall decline.","Julie Yates","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Didora Bank of America.","Andrew Didora","Hi, good morning everyone. Look, I know we'll be getting more into the capital returns and the balance sheet story in a few weeks, but I just wanted to ask if maybe you can frame your thoughts or maybe some factors that you consider in terms of setting a leverage target and how that target changes over the course of a cycle.","Richard Anderson","This is Richard. With candidly we look out on our five year plan even with high fuel price assumptions and a pretty conservative plan. The enterprise just continues to generate more cash particularly as we get through investment grade credit metrics. You know we can continue to keep the return on invested capital that the kinds of rates that we see today.","So, when we do think about the capital investment level which is really the first piece of the puzzle, we are really comfortable that the $2 billion to $3 billion of balance sheet CapEx is a really comfortable rate long term. It\u2019s more than \u2013 significantly more than our depreciation and so we\u2019re comfortable with that level of CapEx investment in the business.","And really what is driving the long term debt target is where we want our weighted average cost of capital to come out number one, and number two, being certain that we have the business really derisked because the best way to provide a long term stable investment for long equity holders is to make sure we have the best labor relations in the industry and make sure that we have a much lower data on our balance sheet because you have events like we\u2019ve had in the last six months where currencies become much weaker against the dollar we have you know Ebola in Africa, Yen at 120 and Russia and the Middle East because of global political issues creating headwinds in our business.","And I just used those as examples. So the way, the best way to make Delta secure in that environment is to have low levels of debt. But we don\u2019t want those levels in their being so low that our weighted average cost of capital ends up going up because it\u2019s so heavily equity weighted.","Andrew Didora","Guys, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And one last one for Paul, I think you mentioned to date you've contributed $1.2 billion to the pension plan. Are you done for the year or do you continue -- do you plan to continue to fund that throughout the course of 2015? Thanks.","Paul Jacobson","Good morning, Andrew. That\u2019s substantially completes our contribution for 2015. There\u2019s $5 million here and there that can\u2019t vary by timing based on funding rules, but its substantially done.","Andrew Didora","Great, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Mike Linenberg, Deutsche Bank","Michael Linenberg","Yeah, hi I want to go back on you know Eddie has talked about Japan and some of the impact that that had on RASM. You didn\u2019t say much about China and you know I think we just got some additional information out from China that suggest that the economy is growing at the slowest rate against since \u201908 or \u201909, that said you did have a change in the Visa requirements.","So I\u2019m just \u2013 are you really seeing any softness out of China or is it just because of the structural change that\u2019s going on in the market place with the Visa restrictions being lifted for the most part, are you still seeing good flows out of that market?","Richard Anderson","Yes Mike we are seeing good flows, but candidly the industry capacity between China and the U.S. I think the number in Q1 was about 20% of an increase. So either the supply is certainly outstripping demand but demand is strong and our early indications on our -- the new flight we were launching between LA and Shanghai are very positive. So we\u2019re not the predominant player in China at this point, so we\u2019re still building strength as we go.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great and just another second question and Ed and maybe even Glen can answer, you know the discussion about you know maybe allowing more of long haul flights out of LaGuardia and I mean I think specifically they have talked about LAX and San Francisco, is that something that makes sense that something that you are in favor of, is it at the risk that if one or two carriers end up doing it everybody tries to get slots to do it and you end up having too much capacity in Transcon market just your thoughts on that?","Edward Bastian","We are supportive of the lifting of the preliminary rule. We think it\u2019s something that\u2019s incredibly important for New York as they build the future of aviation in the New York Metropolitan area and revisiting an outdated ruling from over 30 years. We are prepared and we\u2019re ready to respond if it does get lifted and I think it will be good for the city, I think it will be good for us as a company and I think it will be great for consumers in the metropolitan area.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jamie Baker, JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Hey good morning, question for Glen and follow up to Mr. Linenberg\u2019s question. Should we assume that any long-haul LaGuardia flying would complement the JFK flying, as opposed to grow it? And are 767s supported at the terminal there in LaGuardia?","Glen Hauenstein","Well, an interesting factoid is that the 767-400 was developed for LaGuardia by Boeing for Delta. So the answer is, yes, 767s can fly. 757s can also fly and well I wouldn\u2019t comment on our exact schedules but I would expect it was finding to demand in a set where the constraints were lifted and we would likely serve both airports from the West Coast.","Jamie Baker","Okay and just to clarify, I was thinking more about the 300 since those are in the trans configuration and -- the 400s are not but it\u2019s a good point that you make. A follow up for Richard as it relates to pilots and you know a year ago you know I think the conventional wisdom was that the industry might overtime move closer to Delta as it relates to profit sharing, American was obviously it was an outlier but many view that as unsustainable.","Today, I think it\u2019s fair to ponder whether Delta might move closer to where others in the industry are as opposed to vice versa. I know you are philosophically in favor of profit sharing but would we be re-missed and if we\u2019ve contemplating a revision bigger formula beginning in 2016?","Richard Anderson","You know we\u2019re in the midst of negotiations with our pilots so it\u2019s pretty mature to really comment on that. But our formula has really served us pretty well. I mean I think that we are working right now on our five year plan and there aren\u2019t very many companies in the S&P 100 that are going to approach the kind of quality of earnings and the quality of cash flows we have with the structure that we have there.","Jamie Baker","Okay. And just a quick follow up on that, on the five year plan since you brought it up, Richard have there been any changes into in regards to your long term oil price assumption?","Richard Anderson","Well, I mean we\u2019re still in the midst of working on our five year plans, so as I said my remarks were due to present it. We\u2019ve had several meeting with our board. We have another meeting with our board and then we\u2019ll see you and New York I think on May 13. But you know that our long term philosophy and this is how we\u2019ve always run the airline is to assume a high fuel price, and to assume a much higher fuel price than the forward curve.","And that does a lot of good things for you. I mean we put it this way, having tried different ways to budget airlines over a really long period of time the only rational way that we found is to assume a high fuel price over the long term, because you are never disappointed when its lower. But if you assume \u2013 if you assume a low fuel price then the fuel price ends up being high then you are put in a situation where you\u2019ve got to go tear apart the company in order to get your cost down.","The other thing it does is it puts a discipline in our pricing and in our revenue management that you know because our revenue managers and our pricers, they don\u2019t get the benefit of making an assumption, a planning assumption over the long term that there\u2019s going to be a few good guy out there.","And that the fuel has to be recaptured, that we use the high fuel price and then we\u2019re going to put the burden on our team to be sure we capture that and then lastly when the fuel price is high then you are not going to build a whole lot of capital and a long term plan to buy a lot of extra airplane, it\u2019s going to force capital efficiency both in terms of the airplanes you select and how many airplanes you buy.","So that philosophy won't change. Now what our numbers are we\u2019ll wait and talk to you about that in May.","Jamie Baker","Sure. All right as always I appreciate a very thorough response. Thank you, Richard. Thank you, Glen. Take care.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to William Greene, Morgan Stanley.","William Greene","Hey there good morning. Richard can I ask you a follow-up on that last point and that is do you think about this year than given effectively fuel surprise significantly versus a long-term assumption in the plan. Does this your sort of appears kind of a peak margin year and so we can kind of think about well they\u2019ll take actions next year on both capacity and cost if fuel is higher to make sure that it turns out that this is not a peak margin.","How do you think about adjusting for that or as you have these anomalies and you think about the long-term trend instead?","Richard Anderson","Well if you think about running the enterprise to be able to capture higher fuel prices and you build in the kind of operating leverage that we consistently achieved in this business you\u2019re going to continue to improve margins.","And it will translate into long-term double-digit EPS growth. So when you have a model where fuel cost is covered by the business. In other words higher fuel prices are going to be taken into account either in our pricing or our capacity.","You can then build around that all the operating leverage that we've have a really good track record of developing and you can continue to produce that mid single-digit EPS growth.","William Greene","And when you think about the \u2013 that sort of plan within an industry context it seems at least one risk seems to me that some of the smaller competitors when you put them in aggregate maybe 20%, 25% of the capacity out there in the domestic market they may change their fuel price assumptions.","How do you counter that, how do you think about the competitive dynamic there such that you\u2019re not sort of losing out if you will or losing share or is that not really concerning or you don\u2019t care about share?","Richard Anderson","We\u2019re a margin driven enterprise, a margin and a cash flow driven enterprise. So we really look at the totality of the pricing environment with our capacity to be certain that we\u2019re going to hit the long-term financial targets that we layout in our five year plans.","William Greene","Is there any evidence that the industry is losing discipline in your mind or not so much?","Richard Anderson","I wouldn't comment on that, because that I think it\u2019s just too much too much commentary on future capacity of the industry, but when you look at what Delta has been able to do even in this quarter when you take our fuel hedges away in this quarter and we would have been approaching an 18% margin.","So when you look at what we were able to do with capacity plus pricing it\u2019s really pretty remarkable that the underlying business of Delta in the first quarter x fuel hedging decisions that were made in prior quarters. So you\u2019re looking at an 18% margin I mean that is remarkable.","William Greene","Agree. I appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Helane Becker with Cowen & Company.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much operator. Hi everybody, thank you for the time. Just, I think Richard you and not to negotiate on the conference call. But I think you exchanged open or sort your pilots already for the contracts. Can you just say where - what expectations are relative to both sides expectations are you far apart is there going to be tough negotiation or can you offer any comment on that?","Richard Anderson","Let me offer my best commentary on that, which is to look at our track record and the track record we have but there are pilots is something that we're proud off, which is look back all the way to 2007, 2006 actually going back to 2006 and I think there\u2019s been one, two, three, four, five, five agreements that were all done in advance of event able dates.","And remember over that same period of time, we\u2019ve proudly posted the most dramatic financial performance of any enterprise over that timeframe. And S&P 100, I mean there maybe others I haven\u2019t gone on check.","But by any measure it\u2019s this process and it served us well and I think it served our pilots well, because the pilots are key leaders in making Delta a preferred airline for our customers. And we're going to continue. We're working very hard and hopefully have a good confident path to continue that same process in practice.","Helane Becker","Thank you very much. Can I just ask Ed a question? I think you have quoted in a trade magazine that I read yesterday saying that foreign currency headwinds this year would be $1 billion. And then on the conference call you talked about $600 million. And I'm just kind of wondering if they took your comments out of context, or you can reconcile the difference?","Edward Bastian","Thanks Helane. I was talking in general terms, and I was also including in my thought process on the $1 billion the impact of fuel surcharge declines as well, which is an incremental cost, largely related to currency since it's affected by fuel prices and the strong dollar. So, we're in the same neighborhood.","Helane Becker","Perfect. Okay. Thank you very much for your help.","Operator","We'll go next to Duane Pfennigwerth, Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about your international margins. And obviously, it's a little tricky to do on the first quarter, given the hedge impact. But as we think about the second quarter, can you talk about the regions where you're seeing year-to-year margin expansion? And can you also, I wonder, give us sort of a rank of your profitability by region, sort of, what would be kind of your most profitable region as we think about a seasonally stronger June quarter?","Richard Anderson","Duane, we are not going to give you all the details you asked for as you would expect. But when you look at the margins of our international business, and you -- again you have to take the hedges out because they will largely be out of there by July 1, and those are singular decisions taken corporately, not in the regions.","All the margins in our businesses look really healthy in the upcoming summer period. I'd say the strongest margins are -- it will continue to be in Europe despite the weakness in the euro. We have a growing business at Heathrow, which is doing fabulous. We have a great relationship and again strong partnership in -- with Air France KLM and Alitalia, so the continents also looking very, very solid and very strong.","Our line is building up; seasonally Latin America in the second quarter is not as strong. There are off season, but absent Brazil which is having some real struggles. The majority of Latin America is doing very well. In the pacific business we're in the midst of our restructuring, and I think you have to wait to see the effects of that by the end of the year about summer.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. Thanks. On Latin I wonder, just a follow-up to Julie's question, the down 4% unit revenue in the first quarter, can you talk about sort of the shape of that trend into the second quarter?","Paul Jacobson","The shape is relatively similar. I think as you move through the quarters, you actually get the currency headwind getting stronger. Because, as you know, international so far in advance, and so those tickets tend to be out 60, 90, 120 days, all the way up to six months, nine months. And as we were selling last fall for the spring, we were selling them at very different exchange rates. So you see the exchange rate differentials becoming more of a headwind in the second quarter. And as one of the previous questions indicated, the good news is as you head towards the fourth quarter you start to see that headwind become flattening experience for international. I think we're positioning and Ed has charged us to go into the next quarter with positive revenue momentum and that's our plan.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. Appreciate that and I want to sneak one more in here. The 10% of your expenses that are not USD, assuming that's primarily labor and primarily euro, any color you can offer there is appreciated. Thanks for taking the questions.","Richard Anderson","Duane, actually it's primarily like navigation charges and local expenses for handling, and it's really scattered throughout the globe.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Sherlon, we're going to have time for one more question from the analyst.","Operator","That will come from Dan McKenzie, Buckingham Research.","Dan McKenzie","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just going back to the margin questions earlier, Richard, I think you've said more than ones this year, you believe Delta could expand margins this year holding fuel constant. And just based on the second quarter here, what imply a much stronger second half of the year than what we all are modeling, and that's presumably on both cost and revenue. So I guess my question is, is the impact from FX simply greater than expected to hit that outcome at this point, or was that comment really tied to hitting the goal at some point later this year?","Richard Anderson","Getting that question?","Edward Bastian","Dan, this is Ed. Could you clarify? Because I think you asked several questions in one.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Sure. So, you know, really comes down to this goal of being able -- of Delta being able to expand margins this year holding fuel prices constant. So, throwing in the '14 jet fuel price into the '15 and expanding margins and\u2026","Edward Bastian","Right, right.","Dan McKenzie","I think Richard has shared more than ones that he believe Delta could do that. I'm just wondering if the FX headwind at this point is simply greater than expected to hit that or was that comment really tied to just to specific quarter some point later this year.","Edward Bastian","Well, certainly FX has deteriorated, and I don't think any of us anticipated the significance a year ago what we'd be facing. But yes, I'd say that's correct. We are still focused on expanding our core margins; as we said, if you took the hedge loss out in Q1 and we had an 18% op margin and 15.5% pretax margin, substantial improvement in raw numbers. And I think there is margin expansion there if you were to -- I don't have the math in front me, but if you were to fuel adjust on a year-over-year basis, you'll continue the expansion in the quarter.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Very good. And then a second question here, Ed, since I guess I have you. This is a soft question. Delta has made enormous investments in the business over the past few years obviously. And I would imagine that that strengthens the brand by a significant degree and that of course should benefit revenue. But how are you measuring the investments made in the business? Is the net promoter score really the best measure for measuring the brand? And if so, how was that evolved with the investments that you've made in the business?","Edward Bastian","Well, our net promoter score is, we believe, the best measure of brand performance and it's across multiple consumer industries, not just the airline industry. And we've seen a very tight correlation between improvements in our unit revenue performance and outperformance that's directly attributable to customer satisfaction and net promoter score. In the first quarter, our overall unit revenue performance on the domestic was 115, indexed against our competitors, which is substantial, and we had close to 40% net promoter score in the first quarter as well on the domestic business.","So, there's no question. It's a -- we think it's the strong measure. It's what we used in our internal incentive metrics. And obviously, you need to drill down to far more specificity when you really can't look at just the broad score; you got to then look at all the drivers that accumulate that score. And we're constantly focused on continuing to make investments to improve areas of underperformance on a customer standpoint, particularly internationally. But we do think and we've been pleased with the tracking that we've had with net promoter score, our financial performance, our employee moral and satisfaction, and obviously our financial performance and our stock price.","Dan McKenzie","Fantastic.","Richard Anderson","The one thing you can't miss in all that is -- Dan, is that a lot of the investment we've made has had a huge payback. I mean, that investment -- the investment you've seen us make is also was driving non-fuel CASM seven quarters in a row below 2%. So, you see -- and when you run a really, really good operation, your unit costs are lower. I mean, Ed, you had a -- what was the fact you had yesterday on completion factor at Delta versus our competition?","So, if you were to look at 2014 domestic performance, we had 197 days last year with perfect completion; and obviously, when you run a perfect schedule that makes everything much better for your customers, for your employees, for your operation. If you were to add Southwest American and United combined in 2014, their total number was 13. So, as a consumer-driven and customer-driven company, we're delivering for our customers, and Gil West and the operating team are doing a fabulous job. And we're going to get better yet again this year.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Fantastic. Thanks guys.","Jill Sullivan Greer","Thanks Dan. Sherlon, that is going to conclude the analyst portion of the call, and so I will turn it over to Kevin Shinkle, our Chief Communications Officer for the media portion.","Joanne Smith","Good morning. It's Joanne Smith and Kevin Shinkle. We have about 10 minutes for questions. So to accommodate everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Sherlon, can you please repeat the instructions and then we'll take our first call.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jeffery Dastin, Thomas Reuters.","Jeffery Dastin","Could you elaborate on the exact changes Delta might like to see to Open Skies agreements if the United States asks for consultations with the Qatar and UAE?","Richard Anderson","Yeah. This is Richard Anderson. What we have asked for is consultations and that those consultations would lead to some accommodation that takes into account the $41 billion of subsidies that have been provided to the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. And that would be with respect to the routs that are flown between those countries and the U.S. and with a particular focus on fifth and seventh freedoms.","So we've land our case out to the United States' government. They're taking it seriously. We're in the process of answering questions with them. And the end results needs to be like the Chinese steel case or agricultural cases that the U.S. frequently brings, where you come up with remedies that will address a subsidy number that is actually the largest subsidy number I believe that has ever been proven in a WTO case.","Jeffery Dastin","And just to clarify, so might there be a clause discussed about capacity dumping or price dumping.","Richard Anderson","Correct.","Jeffery Dastin","Right. Thank you so much.","Kevin Shinkle","Yeah.","Operator","We'll go next to Edward Russell, Flight Global.","Edward Russell","Hi. I wanted to ask a bit more on the Pacific restructuring. You mentioned that you're planning to remove six more 747s this year. How many 747s you're removing in total? And also, will there be any route cuts in addition to the down-gauging?","Kevin Shinkle","There will be no additional route cuts. All of this will be achieved through down gauging or frequency reductions. And there will be seven 747s, 400s remaining six flying.","Edward Russell","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Ted Reed, The Street.","Ted Reed","Thank you. My question was basically asked. But are you happy with the way things are going so far in Washington in regards to the Middle East subsidies?","Joanne Smith","We just need to see where we end up. I mean, we're pleased with the progress we've made and pleased with the work of our colleagues. America and United have worked hard with Delta in that case. So I'd say, Ted, overall, yes we are. But in the context of the Pacific trade agreement and the Atlantic trade agreement I think our government needs to first address the largest subsidy that's ever been brought to the U.S. government before we go deeper into more liberal trade regimes with state-owned and state-subsidies industries.","Ted Reed","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Susan Carey, Wall Street Journal.","Susan Carey","Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little question about your Aero Mix ATI application. The DoT seems rigid on the fact that they are not going to consider it the submission unit the Mexico and the U.S. actually have Open Skies. And I'm a little bit confused about this misunderstanding.","Richard Anderson","Well, Susan, this is Richard. I don't think there is a misunderstanding. There was a side letter signed between the United States' government and the Mexican government that basically condition to the Open Skies on ATI. This is very common. This is what the United States' government did with Japan and has done another Open Skies regimes.","Susan Carey","Okay. Thank you.","Richard Anderson","Yeah. Thank you.","Kevin Shinkle","Okay. With that we will conclude our call today. Thanks everyone for joining and listening.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."," "],"7345":["Delta Air Lines, Inc.

My name is Vicky and I will be your coordinator. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations for Delta. Please go ahead.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Vicky. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on our June quarter call. Speaking on the call today are Richard Anderson, Delta\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; our President, Ed Bastian; and our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Jacobson. We have the remainder of the management team here in the room with us for the Q&A. Richard will open the call. Ed then will address our financial and revenue performance and Paul will conclude with a review with a review of cost performance and liquidity. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.","Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at delta.com.","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Richard.","Richard Anderson","Thanks Jill. Good morning and thank you for joining us. This morning we announced a $586 million profit for the June quarter excluding special items, which is a $220 million improvement over last year. This represents EPS of $0.69 compared to consensus estimates of $0.68. Top line revenue grew 6%. Passenger unit revenues improved 8.5%.","Delta has now produced a unit revenue premium to the industry for 15 consecutive months, and we intend to continue doing so. Our 9.1% operating margin improved more than 200 basis points over last year and we have now achieved $5 billion of our $7 billion net debt reduction target. We will continue to reduce our debt and expect to get below $10 billion in net debt by the end of 2013.","Delta\u2019s operational performance for the quarter was exceptional. For the quarter, our completion factor was 99.7% and 87.5% of our flights arrived on time, an 8 point improvement over last year and our best ever June quarter operational performance. On top of that, our DOT mishandled baggage rate decreased 30% and our DOT customer complaints fell 20%. These results, combined with our international operational performance put Delta at the very top of the industry for operating performance and customer service.","By all measures these are some of the best financial and operational results in Delta\u2019s history, and I am thankful for the Delta team that has produced them. It is their commitment and dedication to this airline and our customers that differentiates Delta.","Looking forward, we are expecting to achieve a 10% to 12% operating margin in the September quarter, with system capacity forecast to be down 1% to 3% year-on-year. The revenue environment remains solid for Delta as July unit revenues are expected to increase 4% to 5% in each of our entities, Domestic, Latin, Pacific and Atlantic have good bookings in the third quarter. Capacity discipline is our key lever. We will continue to actively manage our capacity, including a 5% Trans-Atlantic capacity reduction for this fall. We will remain diligent in our efforts to have our fares fully reflect our costs and we will further reduce capacity if necessary to be certain we properly match our capacity with demand.","We\u2019re pleased with this quarter results and our outlook for 2012. We now have a unique opportunity to lay the foundation for Delta\u2019s future with the continuing a number of strategic investments. These investments in our fleet network and facilities will pressure our costs in the near-term, but they are the right path to future margin gains as we have shown 2010, 2011 and 2012 with our financial performance.","The first investment we are making is to restructure our domestic fleet by eliminating a substantial portion of our 50-seat regional jet fleet. We\u2019ve already completely retired our propeller fleet. We will ultimately replace 75% of our 50-seat flying with more cost-effective mainline aircraft and two-class regional jets. Our 50-seaters peaked at more than 500 in 2008 and we intend to reduce it to less than 125 aircraft over the next two years.","With the benefits achieved with our new pilot agreement, we have the flexibility we need to both accelerate our fleet restructuring and improve pilot productivity as we vary our capacity by season. The agreement enables us to up-gauge our domestic fleet by acquiring 717s and two-class regional jets which will replace more than 200 50-seat aircraft over the next few years.","On the network side, we\u2019re investing in New York where earlier this month we completed the largest expansion in the last 40 years at LaGuardia, predating that airport\u2019s first true connecting hub with more than 260 departures a day to 60 cities. We have experienced a 2% margin increase with an 18% increase in capacity at LaGuardia. Our expanded Terminal 4 at JFK joins the Atlanta International Terminal which opened this past May and our renovated LaGuardia complex in Terminal C and D will open at the end of the year.","We closed on the Monroe refinery transaction in this quarter. We have set up a separate Board of Directors and recruited a fine team of refining professionals under the leadership of our CEO, Jeff Warmann. We are in the turnaround process and expect to be operational in the September to October timeframe. As we stated, we expect the refinery to improve our operating results by approximately $300 million a year. Our intention is to improve our profitability with these gains. We will not use our refinery results to seek out market share. This is a unique opportunity for Delta that will bring significant advantage to Delta shareowners.","With all of these investments, we are making significant progress in becoming the airline of choice for our customers, particularly our business customers. This progress was reflected not only in our strong revenue performance and operational performance over the last year, but also in the recent J.D. Power survey in which Delta was the only carrier to significantly improve its overall score.","So to summarize, we\u2019re pleased with our progress, but there is still much more opportunity to build a much stronger Delta for our shareholders, employees and customers. Here\u2019s what you can expect to continue to see from us. We will continue to drive a significant RASM premium to the industry. We will provide a superior product and experience to our customers. We will be responsible in managing our capacity to be certain we\u2019ve fully covered the cost of goods sold over the long term. We will aggressively manage our costs with a target of $1 billion in structural cost reduction over the next several years. We will pay down debt and de-lever our balance sheet. We will leverage our refinery acquisition to improve our results for our shareholders by at least $300 million a year. We will maintain a unique and an industry leading employee relations which will de-risk the business for our shareowners.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed. Thank you for your attention this morning.","Ed Bastian","Thanks Richard. Good morning everyone. Excluding special items, Delta reported net income of $586 million for the June quarter or $0.69 per share, $0.01 ahead of First Call consensus. Our operating margin for the quarter was 9.1%, up 2.2 points year-over-year.","We had $754 million of special items in the June quarter which resulted in a $168 million GAAP loss. Special items included $171 million for severance and related costs from our early retirement program in which over 2,000 employees elected to participate, $22 million in facilities and fleet charges, and a $561 million mark to market adjustment on fuel hedges, which reversed prior gains and moved our hedge book to a net $250 million loss position at the end of June.","Fuel prices have risen since the end of the quarter. And at current prices, the expected value of the hedge book sits at a $100 million loss. Looking forward, we expect to have negligible impact on a settlement basis as you can see in our fuel guidance of $3.09 per gallon for the September quarter and $3.05 per gallon for the December quarter.","Before I go through the revenue results, I would like to echo Richard\u2019s comments in thanking the Delta team for all of their great work that went into producing this quarter\u2019s results.","For the June quarter, turning to revenue, our top line revenues increased $580 million or 6% on a 1.3% decline in capacity. Passenger unit revenues increased 8.5%, driven by strong performance across all regions. I\u2019m pleased to say that June marks the 15th consecutive month that we\u2019ve generated a unit revenue premium to the industry, with our system unit revenues coming in at 105% of the industry average. This is the proof that we continue to see returns from the investments we\u2019ve made in our products and our service.","Our Domestic unit revenues increased 8% on a 1 point reduction in capacity despite the negative impact from some competitive fare actions. Our expanded LaGuardia flying is doing quite well, resulting in a 2 point operating margin improvement on an 18 point increase in capacity. It\u2019s very early, but we\u2019re quite optimistic with the LaGuardia expansion.","In the Trans-Atlantic, our unit revenues improved 9% against a 7 point reduction in capacity, as we trimmed underperforming markets to better match demand. In spite of weak economic conditions in Europe, we saw good point of sale demand from our corporate customers in Europe as European businesses and investors showed interest in the relatively stronger US marketplace.","Specific unit revenues increased 9% for the quarter on a 10 point increase in capacity. We saw particularly strong improvements in load factor and yield for our in Trans-Pacific flights. In Latin America, we had an 8 point year-over-year improvement in unit revenue on flat capacity. While we saw some pressure from targeted sale fares, the region\u2019s revenue performance remains strong, particularly in Mexico, which had a 25% unit revenue improvement.","On the corporate side, we continue to see momentum with corporate revenues for the quarter coming in at 14% year-over-year improvement, driven by a 1.5 point improvement in overall corporate travel share and good growth in automotive, financial service and healthcare sectors.","In terms of our revenue outlook, as we head into the September quarter, the revenue trends appear solid despite the continuing weak economic backdrop we face. For the month of July, we\u2019re expecting our unit revenues to increase 4% to 5% and we continue to see unit revenue expansion across all entities, however, not at the rates we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years.","Comparisons continue to get more difficult as we proceed through the year. And while we welcome a reduction in fuel prices, it will likely be accompanied by some reduced yields as well. I\u2019ll also remind you that the September quarter last year included a $70 million benefit from the FAA excise tax suspension.","Domestic bookings are trending well for July and August and we\u2019re encouraged by the market\u2019s continued response to our enhanced LaGuardia schedule. In the Pacific, which traditionally peaks in the September quarter, we see strong unit revenue performance for July and August, especially on our Trans-Pac flights into Japan. We\u2019re looking at good booking trends in our Latin entity, with booked load factors showing improvement for every month up through the fall. And in the Trans-Atlantic, our aggressive management of off-peak capacity is helping us maintain solid book load factors.","In terms of the corporate revenue outlook, we recently surveyed our corporate clients to gauge their forecasted travel spend for the balance of the year, and 84% responded that they anticipated either the same or increased travel spend on Delta despite the relatively weak economy and global pressures, so corporate revenues continue to perform well.","Turning to guidance, we\u2019re forecasting a profitable September quarter with an operating margin of 10% to 12%.","On capacity, we expect system capacity to be down 1% to 3% with domestic flat to down 2%, and our international capacity to be down 3% to 5%, driven by the previously announced post Labor Day capacity reductions in the Trans-Atlantic.","With, that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Jacobson","Thanks Ed. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us this morning. Looking at our cost performance, our June quarter non-fuel unit costs increased 3.6% on a 1.3% decline in capacity, and as we\u2019ve said, we expect our September quarter non-fuel unit costs to be up 5% to 6% versus prior year.","We are continuing to experience cost pressures from the impact of our 2% capacity reduction in the second half of 2012, as well as the enhancements we\u2019ve made in our products, services and facilities which account for the majority of September quarter\u2019s cost growth. While pressure and costs in the near near-term, these service enhancements are strategic and do provide us a platform for our future success through expanded margins. Our opportunities for cost reductions lie in the structural initiatives we are implementing. These initiatives will take some time to begin delivering results, but they are unique opportunities to improve our cost outcomes.","First, the combination of our new pilot contract and this acquisition of the 717s allows us to accelerate our domestic fleet restructuring. We expect the 717s and the new 737-900ERs that begin delivering next year as well as bringing in 21 additional low capital MD-90s will allow us to retire older mainline aircraft and at least 200 50-seat regional jets over the next two to three years.","The retirement of the 50-seat regional jets is one of the single biggest opportunity costs we have. The up-gauging strategy will improve our efficiency by lowering our unit costs while simultaneously improving our product while maintaining our capacity discipline. Secondly, we are aligning our head count with our reduced capacity and recently had over 2,000 employees elect to participate in our voluntary early retirement program. These employees will retire by the end of the year with limited backfill, which will continue to result in improved productivity.","In addition, technology is also a critical key to improving our costs, whether through lower distribution costs or improved employee productivity. To that end, we\u2019ve been making targeted technology investments in areas such as delta.com, crew scheduling systems and airport technology investments that not only will reduce costs in the future but will offer our customers better service. So we understand there\u2019s a lot more work to be done on our cost structure, but we\u2019re putting the pieces in place now to improve our cost outcomes in the future.","Turning to fuel, on a per gallon basis, Delta paid $3.37 per gallon for fuel for the quarter which includes $0.16 associated with hedge losses during the quarter. We entered the June quarter with a hedge book that was structured to protect against increases in oil prices up to $150 a barrel.","We remain committed to our hedging strategy and we view our hedge portfolio as protection from volatility in the fuel markets. We don\u2019t expect our hedge book to be a profit center but as a means to better manage our business by reducing the volatility of our largest expense. Based on the July 23 market close, as Ed mentioned, we are now projecting our fuel price to be $3.09 for the September quarter and $3.05 for the December quarter which includes minimal hedge impact and excludes any benefits from operating the refinery.","We are also looking at other initiatives like the refinery to reduce our fuel expense. As Richard mentioned, we closed on the purchase of the Trainer refinery in June and we expect initial start-up to occur in mid-September. We do expect the refinery will have a modest loss in the September quarter as we ramp up operations, but the refinery should be profitable, thereby reducing Delta\u2019s fuel expense beginning in the December quarter.","Turning now to liquidity, we ended the June quarter with $5.3 billion in unrestricted liquidity, including $1.8 billion in un-drawn lines of credit. We had $350 million of hedge collateral posted with counterparties at the end of the quarter, which was down to less than $100 million at Monday\u2019s close. We generated $683 million in operating cash flow in the quarter which was net of $354 million of pension funding. We have now completed all of our defined benefit funding for 2012.","We had $650 million in capital expenditures for the quarter which included $180 million for the Trainer refinery purchase, $65 million investment in Aeromexico and an additional $300 million in aircraft parts and modifications.","During the quarter, we paid down another $374 million in debt and ended the quarter with an adjusted net debt of $12.1 billion, well on our way to hitting our goal of $10 billion next year.","In the first week of July, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and completed the 2012-1 EETC, which priced $480 million at a very attractive 5.3% average interest rate. The proceeds of this offering will primarily be used to refinance the 2002-1 EETC, which matured in early July.","For the September quarter, we expect capital spending to be $400 million to $450 million and we have debt maturities of $200 million net of the proceeds of the EETC we just issued. And we are forecasting $5.1 billion of unrestricted liquidity at the end of September quarter.","In conclusion, Delta had a successful June quarter. We produced an operating margin of 9.1%, generated a revenue premium to the industry for the 15th consecutive month, and had exceptional operating performance. We\u2019ve made strategic investments in the business which will generate margin increases into the future, and we are implementing the structural initiatives we need to achieve better cost outcomes.","In conclusion as Richard and Ed mentioned earlier, these results would not have been possible without the hard work of our employees and all the momentum they\u2019ve built into the business on all fronts.","Jill Greer","Thank you, Richard, Ed and Paul. Vicky, we\u2019re now ready to move to the questions from the analysts, so if you could please review the process for asking a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you, Ms. Greer. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Glenn Engel of Bank of America.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America","Good morning. One cost question, one revenue question. On the cost side, the maintenance levels just, expense seems much higher than I would have expected. How long does it stay at these levels? In the second half, what do you expect it to level out at and what\u2019s normal?","Paul Jacobson","Glenn, we continue to experience some pressure from seat-related modifications in the second quarter. We expect maintenance spend to be roughly flat for the rest of the year.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America","Flat with last year or flat with the first half?","Paul Jacobson","Flat with last year.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America","And second is the timing of the July 4 holiday seemed to have had an impact for some airlines. Can you say how much that probably held back your July PRASM?","Glen Hauenstein","This is Glen. Glenn, how are you?","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America","Good.","Glen Hauenstein","July 4 with falling on a Wednesday is clearly not good for airline revenues. Business travel really took the whole week off. And because it was on a Wednesday, the discretionary traveler demand was not as high as it would have been had it been at the beginning or the end of the week. So it was, it\u2019s generally a bad week for us. This year it was particularly bad and probably had about a 0.3 to 0.4 point impact on the month.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America","Thank you very much.","Richard Anderson","Thank you, Glenn.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Savanthi Syth, Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James","Good morning. Just wondering on the $300 million savings you\u2019re expecting for the refinery, could you provide a little bit more about how you get that? Or if the details are a little complicated, what drives that? What are the key inputs that drive it and given where the fuel prices have been volatile and pulling down, does the benefit reduce if fuel prices pull back, or what are the kind of key inputs in getting that $300 million in savings a year?","Paul Jacobson","Savi, the $300 million in savings comes from the sale of the products in excess of the cost of manufacturing and cracking crude oil against the index prices that we\u2019ve seen. And while there\u2019s been volatility in the crude oil markets, crack spreads have actually expanded slightly during that time period and we don\u2019t anticipate any change from our original guidance.","Ed Bastian","Savi, this is Ed. One other point is we talked about this when we announced the acquisition. We went, also back-tested this over the last six years and the average return Trainer would have had on our results is anywhere between $300 million and $500 million a year over the last six years. So we feel reasonably confident in our estimates on a going forward basis.","Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James","Great. Just on my follow up question, have you kind of calculated what the contribution will be with the replacement of 717s with the \u2013 or with the 50-seaters and the kind of older aircraft and what the timing of that would be?","Ed Bastian","We haven\u2019t publicly disclosed the impact. Obviously we believe it to be substantial. If you look at the, not just the cost of continuing to keep the 50-seat RJs in the fleet but even more importantly the upcoming fairly significant maintenance costs that we\u2019re going to be experiencing which will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars on that fleet if we had decided to retain that aircraft. So not just a savings on the current cost structure but a substantial benefit to offset future cost rises.","Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan","Hey, good morning everybody. Ed, the 16% of corporate accounts that responded they would be flying less, any color on what type of business they fall into and is that 16% of respondents or 16% of your corporate revenue base?","Ed Bastian","It was 16% of our respondents. We took a very wide span of respondents and it lined up largely with the spend. And in any portfolio, you\u2019re going to have some guys that are increasing, some guys that are decreasing some of the sectors. You can guess yourself which are having more difficulty in this marketplace, particularly in the defense space. But on average, the trend lines are they\u2019re going to continue to stay with the spend patterns and the trends we\u2019ve seen or actually look to expand it a bit going forward. So no unique comment in that 16%. I didn\u2019t see JPMorgan\u2019s results. So I don\u2019t know what they are telling you.","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan","Yes, to be decided. For Paul, the new pilot agreement includes a decrease in the profit sharing calculation. Is it reasonable to assume similar changes for non-union employees and if so, have those changes been made or should we leave the equation alone in our models for now?","Richard Anderson","Mike?","Mike Campbell","We have said to the non-union employees that the same adjustment in profit sharing will be made with them and that will be effective January 1 for next year.","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan","January 1. Okay, helpful. And lastly if I can squeeze one in for Richard. Once you get below the $10 billion net debt target, what\u2019s next?","Richard Anderson","What do you think should be next?","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan","Well I think the concern out there is that you\u2019re tempted to fall off the wagon and you go on some sort of a growth bender. That\u2019s not particularly my concern, but I hear it from investors all the time. On the other hand, there are pension issues that still need to be addressed. There\u2019s possible restoration of dividends, share buyback potential. I mean sort of take your pick and don\u2019t limit it to those.","Richard Anderson","Well first of all, we\u2019re not going to go \u2013 I mean I think we have demonstrated now for a number of years in a row a unique discipline around how we deploy our capital, and I think the 717 is a prime example of that and the MD-90 is a prime example of that. So we\u2019re not going to change that focus, because we think the most important thing we can do for our shareowners is de-risk and de-lever the business.","So we have some time to make that decision because we\u2019re scheduled to hit our net debt at $10 billion at the end of 2013. I think you can reasonably expect that no matter what we do, we\u2019re going to continue to grind down that net debt number, because that both improves our EPS quickly because it comes right out of non-op which benefits our shareholders significantly.","So I think no matter what, there are two principles and we have some time to discuss this with our investor base. But the first principle is we are not going to go, to use your term, we\u2019re not going on any benders around here, period, because we\u2019re incredibly focused on pay back of our capital investments and getting our ROIC target. And number two, you can count on us continuing to pay down debt in some form or fashion, even after we hit the $10 billion mark. Our ultimate goal, it\u2019s going to take us a while, is to get back to investment grade.","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan","Excellent. And you say take a while. Care to throw a year out there?","Richard Anderson","No, I don\u2019t care to throw a year out there.","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. All right. Thanks for the clarity on that. That\u2019s a excellent response. I appreciate you letting me slide a third question in.","Richard Anderson","Do you have a fourth?","Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan","No. That\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll turn it over to somebody else. Sorry.","Richard Anderson","I have another one for you. What\u2019s JPM\u2019s travel going to be? Are you going to try to get them to pick with us?","Jill Greer","I think she cut him off.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from David Fintzen with Barclays.","Dave Fintzen \u2013 Barclays","Hey, good morning everyone. Just a question for Glen. You sort of mentioned the 5% premium on RASM that you\u2019re hitting today. I mean as you look out over the next couple of years with the puts and takes of the refleetings versus ongoing merger synergies on the revenue side, just how do you see that evolving? Is 105% your long term target in where you think you go or do you think there\u2019s upside from here on a relative basis?","Glen Hauenstein","We really believe that there\u2019s continued upside. The 105% is actually an amalgamation of all of the different entities, not all of which we have produced premiums today, but all of which we aspire to produce premiums over time and we think that that will drive the system-wide number higher over the longer term.","Dave Fintzen \u2013 Barclays","And so we should think of those as 105% sort of your target in every entity or in all \u2013 or is that, every entity has its own sort of expectation?","Glen Hauenstein","Every entity has its own expectations based on our gauge, our stage length, the market selections we fly. But I think it\u2019s safe to say that we think there is a couple of points of headroom, 2 to 3 points of headroom in the next couple of years that we could achieve.","Dave Fintzen \u2013 Barclays","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe a question for Richard, on your ROIC targets, just as you take a step back and think about the derisking and the deleveraging, and how should we think about ROIC over the cycle? I mean is that, is the range shrinking? Do you think 10% to 12% is achievable in most environments or do you think there\u2019s still a pretty wide range on returns through the cycle?","Richard Anderson","What we\u2019ve been able to show, I think if you look at 2010, 2011, now 2012, we\u2019ve been able to manage and have good performance and make good money through three years of pretty volatile fuel and economic environment. So that 10% to 12% return on invested capital we think is a solid number for us going forward. And this is a management team that is incredibly serious and intent on hitting that number for our shareowners.","Dave Fintzen \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Appreciate that color.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes, hey. Just a couple here and I guess maybe a clarification. Richard, in your opening comments, when you talked about the third quarter and you mentioned bookings being good, I thought I heard 4% to 5% top line growth. Was that in reference to the third quarter?","Richard Anderson","No.","Ed Bastian","Mike that was month of July RASM.","Richard Anderson","Yes.","Mike Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, okay. All right, so that\u2019s helpful then. I guess next one for Paul Jacobson, you talked about the change in, or the RJ fleet, the shrinkage of that by 250 airplanes as being the single largest opportunity cost. And again I realize that there\u2019s been some questions on this maybe sort of variations on this, but how do we think about this? I mean you talked about hundreds of millions of maybe foregone maintenance expense on some of the older aircraft. What about the potential revenue opportunity? There are a lot of different moving parts on this. Any additional color that you could give us would be great.","Ed Bastian","Mike, I\u2019ll jump in. This is Ed. The revenue opportunity is substantial. We\u2019ve said any number of times the 50-seaters have been the perfect storm for us because not only is it a cost opportunity, it\u2019s also an airplane our customers don\u2019t particularly prefer. So as we up-gauge, and that was sitting behind the 717 strategy and that\u2019s why they are linked at some level as well as getting some incremental two-class 76-seat RJs, we\u2019re going to have a fairly substantial up gauge in margin improvement, cost reductions, some revenue enhancements. And from the capital efficiency standpoint, with where we were able to acquire the 717s is going to improve those returns all the more. So it was a win all the ways around.","Mike Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. All right, thank you. Very good.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Richard, when investors think of Delta, I think increasingly they look at you as aggressive and creative at trying to better manage or control some of the forces that other airlines leave to chance and maybe best symbolized by the recent refinery deal, and that\u2019s something you touched on in your prepared remarks. But as we think about scenarios surrounding American\u2019s emergence and the possibility of M&A, is this a situation where you think the outcomes are out of your control or does Delta have the ability to drive the situation toward outcomes it favors?","Richard Anderson","As a matter of policy, we do not comment or speculate on transactions of that nature. I would just say that overall, one, at Delta we will continue to always control our destiny. And by pushing a lot of different opportunities and leverage across the business and, number two, global consolidation is good for the business model.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just broadly, we\u2019ve heard from a lot of different airlines about solid revenue trends and how we\u2019re not seeing really any signs of economic weakness yet. But this quarter cargo revenue for you guys fell year-over-year for the second quarter in a row and we\u2019ve seen a lot of weakness in cargo. Normally that\u2019s a canary in the coal mine. Can you help us understand why it makes sense to look through cargo weakness this time around when thinking about the trajectory of passenger revenue?","Ed Bastian","John, this is Ed. Cargo revenues for us in the second quarter were fairly flat on a year-over-year basis and we had some weakness in yields, but the volumes improved on a year-over-year basis. We\u2019re not a big enough cargo carrier to really be able to call that as a trend. Obviously we see what\u2019s going on with the bigger freight operators around the world. So I\u2019d say, one, don\u2019t necessarily look at our cargo performance as a indicator.","But looking to our business model, we think when you\u2019re \u2013 because we\u2019ve asked ourself that question a lot with some of the continued concerns and headline risk coming out of Europe and other parts of the geography, how do we look at our July unit revenue performance. And if you were to contrast June to July, there\u2019s about a 2 point sequential down-tick, which compared to what we would historically have expected to see. We think 1 point of the 2 point down-tick is due to some of the domestic competitive fare activities that we\u2019ve commented on in the past.","And the other point is a myriad of a little bit of economic weakness, a little bit of the fuel sell-off which obviously has some revenue implications, a little bit of July 4. And again, just so a little bit of softening but nothing on the guise of what some of the cargo carriers are seeing. So, or a consumer business in the environment that we\u2019re operating in to see a 4 to 5 point year-on-year revenue improvement, which is our, effectively our same stores sales metric. We feel it\u2019s pretty solid.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, and can I ask just a quick clarification on an earlier question. There was a question about uses of cash and free cash flow. When you guys think about excess cash for paying down debt or what have you, is the right way to think about it as cash above and beyond the air traffic liability or do you define excess cash in a different way?","Paul Jacobson","We define excess cash as free cash flow, operating cash less capital investment.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Dan McKenzie with Rodman & Renshaw.","Dan McKenzie \u2013 Rodman & Renshaw","Hey, good morning everybody, thanks here. Ed, over what period of time is Delta targeting the $1 billion in cost savings and where does that leave the new non-fuel cost target? And then I guess related to that, how are you thinking about full year cost guidance at this point?","Ed Bastian","The $1 billion structural cost reduction is over the next two to three years, Dan, and obviously the 50-seat reduction is probably the single biggest contributor there. But the early retirement package that we just completed is also a contributor, so it will take a couple of years to see the benefits come through.","Dan McKenzie \u2013 Rodman & Renshaw","I see. And then I guess secondly here, if I can go back to revenues at 10% to 12% operating margin for the third quarter, of course is pretty encouraging. But the investor worry is just the daily barrage of negative economic data points and historically revenues at times have deteriorated quite quickly. I wonder if you could just talk about what\u2019s different today. Can you elaborate a little further about the source of confidence as you look ahead to demand in the back half of the year?","Glen Hauenstein","This is Glen. How are you doing?","Dan McKenzie \u2013 Rodman & Renshaw","Yes, thanks, Glen.","Glen Hauenstein","We don\u2019t have a crystal ball here and I think our commitment is to react as quickly as we can to changes in demand, and as we look out into the early fall, we really don\u2019t see anything yet. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t react quickly if we do see a shortfall. So I think our commitment to our shareholders and all of our constituents is to make sure we\u2019re doing the best we can with the information we have. And while we read the same headlines, right now in Europe we have a little bit of a disconnect between what we\u2019re experiencing and what you read in the headlines. So, and the forward bookings and forward unit revenues look great into the fall. If that starts to deteriorate, and so we have already taken proactive reductions. So we have reduced 5% of our capacity because of things we know. So we know the euro is lower and we know that winter is higher ex-European demand than ex-US demand which peaks in the summer. So we\u2019ve already taken actions on what we know, and we will take the actions required as more unfolds if it does.","Dan McKenzie \u2013 Rodman & Renshaw","Okay, terrific. Thanks so much.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Helane Becker with Dahlman Rose & Company.","Helane Becker \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Company","Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody. So just with respect to the changes you\u2019re going to make over on the regional side, one of your major providers is basically out there saying that there\u2019s no way you can get out of their contract, and the contracts go out four or five more years. And I\u2019m just kind of wondering how we should think about that, given the fact that you\u2019ve got to get down to something like 125 50-seaters over the next I think three years.","Richard Anderson","Well we have, without going into the particulars of any of the contracts that we have, we have a steady path to be able to get to 125. So we, without going into the specifics, we have a confident path of moving to the 125 and I\u2019ll just leave it at that.","Helane Becker \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Company","Okay. I will accept that. And then my other question is with respect to Latin American market. In the past couple of months, I\u2019ve just seen some unit revenue growth slow. It hasn\u2019t been quite as robust as it was six or eight months ago. Is there anything accounting for that or is it just tougher comps which would be one thing to account for, I suppose. But is there anything going on we should know about?","Glen Hauenstein","This is Glen again. If you look to the fall, I think the one thing that we are keeping a close eye on is industry capacity. Clearly not Delta capacity, but as you get into the fall in Latin America, current schedules show that capacity is up around 10%. You combine that with decline of the local currencies, the real now, a lot of the real is not priced, the tickets aren\u2019t priced in reals but about 10% of our Brazilian sales for example are priced in reals and that has a 30% negative year-over-year bias. So I think you\u2019ve got some foreign exchange. I think you\u2019ve got some capacity issues. But I think the core demand is still quite strong.","Helane Becker \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Company","Okay. And then your investments in Aeromexico, where does that show up in the numbers, or does it?","Ed Bastian","It wouldn\u2019t show up, Helane, in the numbers per se. It would show up through better passenger revenues as we better hook our two networks up. You\u2019re not going to see that in a separate line item or anything.","Helane Becker \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Company","Okay, got you. Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Kevin Crissey with UBS.","Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. CASM ex-fuel, I guess I just wanted to go back over the timeline a little bit. I think it was back say maybe October 2010, I think it was somewhere in that vicinity, you guys had targeted 2011 to be kind of flat with 2010. And then I think it was revised at your Investor Day and then you\u2019ve cut some capacity. But what I\u2019m trying to understand is, I didn\u2019t see these CASM ex-fuel pressures coming and I think I didn\u2019t see them partly because I think you guys had guided that they weren\u2019t really there or at least one point you had guided it that way, or maybe I\u2019m misreading it. But I wanted to understand what changed from that point to today in terms of your pressure on the CASM ex-fuel line.","Richard Anderson","This is Richard. First, if you look out over the past two years, we have pushed capacity down pretty hard. We have viewed capacity as the real lever to push our business, and it has put real pressure on our non-fuel CASM. If you look where we\u2019ll be by the end of this year in 4Q and compare it to two years ago when we were giving that guidance, we\u2019re going to probably be down 5% to 6% in overall system capacity and the industry is probably on the main grown a bit. So if you think about being down 5% instead of being up 1% to 2% each of those two years, the equation is very much different on the nonfuel line.","The second piece is, is that we have along the way made investments that are the right investments in our product, in our employees, and you can see it in our revenue performance versus the industry. Hence our drive to drive another $1 billion of structural costs out and our push in the refinery to make up on a total basis, total unit cost basis, those inflationary pressures that we see.","Ed Bastian","And I\u2019d say the other thing, Kevin, there that we did not necessarily forecast or see coming as clearly is the opportunity we had with our pilots to do the contract early. It\u2019s going to pay significant dividends over time as it will have a big cost return to it, not just in terms of improved productivity, but the ability to fairly substantially restructure the domestic fleet. But that those costs came in right away so that\u2019s in our September guidance as well, and that was another big piece.","Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thank you. And Richard maybe if I think about, you talk about derisking the business and we all want that, one of the big things as we look across transportation companies, fuel is only a discussion in the airlines pretty much. If you look at trucking or rails and stuff, what more can be done to allow fuel surcharges to truly be pass-throughs? I mean it should be to me, it should be the effort that\u2019s expended by every company before they buy more planes, it\u2019s like let\u2019s see how we can get a fuel surcharge in here that actually truly does what it does in every other industry.","Richard Anderson","Two points there that are different in this industry from those industries, which is we sell our tickets 330 days in advance. So if at the point in time that we sell the ticket for travel six months from now, we don\u2019t have \u2013 we have current fuel or the current forecast that we have for fuel which we use in our pricing department.","Because, if you look at businesses in a totally deregulated environment that are commodity intensive, the management team is always working to match the cost of production to the pricing in the marketplace. We\u2019re a bit more challenged in that we sell tickets 330 days in advance and the DOT does not allow us to collect fuel surcharges in the US. We can inform point of sale but we cannot in the US.","So there are some differences there. So what we do is we manage capacity very tightly and are prepared to suffer some of the risks of a little higher unit cost creep as a result because the independent variable needs to be then how we manage our capacity and how we manage our internal pricing mechanisms to be certain that our prices are capturing the actual cost of goods sold at the time that we price.","And that leads me to my second point which is why we hedge fuel. Because if you\u2019re selling 330 days in advance and you cannot legally use fuel surcharges, we need the ability to take some of the volatility out and allow us in a more near term basis to lock in our margins.","And candidly, that\u2019s what we just did in the second quarter. When we were moving through the second quarter, we saw some of the best revenue performance we\u2019ve ever seen for the month of May, and but the biggest risk was where fuel was going in the January through April timeframe. And we wanted to be certain that we had 200 basis points of margin expansion. So it\u2019s going to be a combination of, one, managing your capacity, because that\u2019s our biggest lever. And we\u2019re going to continue to manage the capacity to be able to drive our revenue up by putting more revenue on each airplane and you do that by reducing capacity.","The second thing is, in our pricing environment, we\u2019re very focused on having our pricing and yield management professionals have the cost data at the time they make decisions around capacity and pricing. Third, we made an investment in the refinery to be able to take the crack spread risk out of our business, which is our single highest fuel expense. And number four, to use our hedging program in the shorter term to be able to lock in our margins, so that we know that our cost of goods sold is going to match the pricing we have in the market.","Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS","Thank you. Just one last real fast one because Jamie had three, I\u2019ll take three. Capacity change by month, if you could to help us frame the RASM expectations by month?","Ed Bastian","There\u2019s nothing \u2013 we don\u2019t typically give the monthly forward capacity outlooks, Kevin, but there\u2019s nothing unique in the months.","Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Jill Greer","Vicky, we\u2019re going to have time for one more question from the analysts.","Operator","Okay. We will take our question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Thanks for getting me in, appreciate it. Just maybe a subtlety, Richard, but you\u2019ve referred to a net debt target of $10 billion by the end of 2013. I think recently you guys have been saying mid-2013. Is there any particular reason why that\u2019s changed? Given I think the pull back in the fuel prices, I would have thought maybe that could have been possibly even accelerated a little bit. Is that, just any kind of color on that would be great.","Richard Anderson","No, there\u2019s no change. Our goal is to make certain that we get it done as soon as possible.","Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Sure, okay thanks. And a little bit more on the hedge book. Can you tell us how you manage the risk or oversee the tail risk in the hedge book? Because we obviously saw some pretty big mark to market adjustments with the big pull back in prices in May and I\u2019m wondering how you guys think about managing risk within the derivative exposure in the hedge book. Who oversees it, what\u2019s your sort of tolerance threshold for risk? Any kind of color you could share with us would be great.","Paul Jacobson","Hunter, this is Paul.","Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Hey Paul.","Paul Jacobson","We have a robust and independent risk management function that oversees the financial risks of the company including the hedging book. When we hedge fuel and we see rapid declines in fuel prices, you\u2019re going to expect hedge losses because the hedge book is net long in its offsetting position. But we monitor that very independently and we\u2019re very comfortable with our position in our book.","Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay. Thank you.","Jill Greer","Vicky, that is going to conclude the analyst portion of the call and so I\u2019m going to turn it over to Ned Walker, our Chief Communications Officer for the media portion.","John Walker","Okay hey, thanks very much, Jill, and welcome everybody. Vicky, we\u2019re ready to begin the Q&A with the media. We\u2019ll ask the media to limit themselves to one question with a quick follow-up. We should be able to accommodate most Q&As but often we are not able to get everybody on. So with that we\u2019ll go ahead and turn it over to the first question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Again, that concludes the analyst portion of the question and answer session. We will now take questions from the media. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein \u2013 Bloomberg News","Quick question. Earlier in the call, you said that you are looking at other initiatives like the refinery to decrease your fuel exposure. And I wanted to see if you could be any more specific in terms of what you might be looking at.","Richard Anderson","I thought we were fairly clear in saying that the way we manage our fuel exposure is, one, capacity; number two, having the right pricing processes and mechanisms in the company to be certain that we\u2019re fully covering the cost of fuel in our pricing; number three, we have a lot of fuel efficiency efforts under way, including our refleeting, adding winglets and more efficient aircraft routings; and then number four is our hedge program.","Mary Schlangenstein \u2013 Bloomberg News","I\u2019m sorry. I thought the reference was perhaps to another asset purchase of some kind?","Richard Anderson","No, that was not what the reference was at all.","Mary Schlangenstein \u2013 Bloomberg News","Okay. Thank you.","John Walker","Thanks, Mary.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Andy Compart with Aviation Week.","Andy Compart \u2013 Aviation Week","Richard, I want to get back to the steady path to 125 50-seaters. SkyWest\u2019s CFO, which was an indirect reference made to earlier, had said to me that they operate about 150 50-seaters and he said they are not inclined to trade them for 76-seater, two-class 76 seaters if there\u2019s nowhere to put the 50-seater. So that\u2019s above 125 right there. so how do you get to that if SkyWest or others are resistant to making this trade-off?","Richard Anderson","I\u2019m going to stand on what I said before which is we have a clear path through \u2013 we have a number of operators and a number of contract expirations and I think we\u2019ve shown a pretty steady process here. I mean our high watermark was a little over 500 and I think today we\u2019re at 300, 320. So we\u2019ve been able to do 180 so and I think you just have to stay tuned, but it\u2019s going to happen.","Andy Compart \u2013 Aviation Week","Can you do it without voluntary participation by some of the partners?","Richard Anderson","As I said, I mean without going into the specifics of any of these, it is going to happen.","Andy Compart \u2013 Aviation Week","All right. Thanks.","John Walker","Thanks Andy. Vicky, next question.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Josh Freed with The Associated Press","Josh Freed \u2013 The Associated Press","Yes, well I suppose this is related. What can you tell us today about your plans for Comair?","Richard Anderson","In view of the significant changes in the economic and competitive conditions in the regional airline industry in recent years, Delta continues to explore strategic alternatives for Comair as previously announced. Until a final decision has been made, we cannot comment further.","John Walker","Hey, thanks Richard that was really good.","Josh Freed \u2013 The Associated Press","It almost felt like you were reading from something there.","John Walker","No, that\u2019s really, Josh, that\u2019s really basically been what we\u2019ve been telling you and the rest of the media over the last few weeks and so our position really hasn\u2019t changed publicly on that.","Josh Freed \u2013 The Associated Press","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Kelly Yamanouchi with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.","Kelly Yamanouchi \u2013 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","Hi there. I\u2019m just wondering, since you have a target of $1 billion in structural cost reduction over the next few years, do you plan for further job cuts over that period to accomplish that?","John Walker","No.","Kelly Yamanouchi \u2013 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Edward Russell with Flight Global.","Edward Russell \u2013 Flight Global","Yes, hi. I was wondering if you could detail a bit more the swap from 50-seaters to 76-seaters at your regional carriers about who might be receiving those and where they might be going?","Richard Anderson","No, we wouldn\u2019t comment on that. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do there and there will be RFP processes and the like so we can\u2019t comment on that. We\u2019ll let you know as soon as it\u2019s all worked out.","Edward Russell \u2013 Flight Global","Okay. Thank you.","John Walker","Okay Vicky, we have time for one more question","Operator","Okay, we will take that question from Linda Loyd with Philadelphia Inquirer.","Linda Loyd \u2013 The Philadelphia Inquirer","Thank you for taking my call. I have two questions about the Trainer refinery. How is the turnaround at Trainer going at this point, and do you anticipate you will have to spend more than the estimated $100 million to get the refinery up and running?","Paul Jacobson","This is Paul Jacobson. The turnaround is actually progressing very, very well. We are on budget and on target to begin restarting that facility in mid-September, and we expect the actual costs to come in line with all of our expectations. There have been no surprises.","Linda Loyd \u2013 The Philadelphia Inquirer","Well thank you, and I have one follow-up question. How many years are the swaps with BP and Phillips 66? That\u2019s the first part of that, and what are Delta\u2019s plans after those swaps expire?","Paul Jacobson","Those are, all the commercial agreements that we entered into are three-year agreements and we\u2019ll continue to monitor that as we get underway and down the road and explore our options.","Linda Loyd \u2013 The Philadelphia Inquirer","Because it is not true that the benefits of buying the refinery hinges on the swaps for the gasoline and diesel produced at Trainer for jet fuel that is made somewhere else?","Paul Jacobson","No, the swaps are a means to exchange product for jet fuel. The economics of the transaction don\u2019t hinge on those commercial agreements but they are sources for those products and there\u2019s a broad market for those products in that area.","Linda Loyd \u2013 The Philadelphia Inquirer","Okay.

My name is Kelly Anne, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Jill Greer","Thanks, Kelly Anne, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our September quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are Richard Anderson, Delta's Chief Executive Officer; Ed Bastian, our President; and Paul Jacobson, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have the entire leadership team here in the room for the Q&A session. Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and cash flow. [Operator Instructions]","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, and some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted, and you can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at delta.com.","And with that, I will turn it over to Richard Anderson.","Richard H. Anderson","Good morning. Today, we reported a $1.2 billion net profit for the September quarter. We increased our profit by 56% or $444 million year-on-year, expanded our pretax margin by 3.7 points to 11.5% and achieved our $10 billion net debt target. EPS is $1.41, beating consensus by $0.05. Importantly for our shareholders, we bought back $100 million in stock in 3Q and paid $51 million in dividends. We are pacing well ahead of our goals for 2013. We ran a good operation, with on-time performance at 83% and completion factor at 99.8%. Our employees have hit every operational goal so far this year, including 40 days of 100% completion factor.","Our customer complaints at DOT are at all-time lows for Delta. For that operational success, our employees have received $69 million this year in Shared Rewards. We are planning to hit all of our operational goals, so we should have maximum Shared Reward payouts for our people for over 2 years in a row. The success in this quarter is a credit to the 80,000 Delta employees worldwide. We are pleased to recognize their efforts with $240 million accrued profit-sharing, which now puts us at nearly $390 million for the year, which exceeds last year's total. We look forward to a record profit-sharing payout for Delta people on Valentine's Day 2014.","Delta has significant opportunities ahead throughout our businesses, and we must keep our heads down and work hard to continue advancing Delta. We will have a record year in 2013 and there's a sizable opportunity in front of us to drive improved service, better RASM, further margin expansion and increased cash flow in 2014. Our revenue performance is currently at 106% system revenue premium to the industry. And we have a variety of initiatives underway that will grow the Delta premium. Our ancillary revenues are top-tier and we believe significant upside exists going forward.","Our operational and customer service performance is overall the best in Delta's history. We will continue to deliver and improve upon that performance. Good operations and customer service drive a revenue premium, as business customers demand quality service. This is reflected in our 10% corporate revenue growth. Running a solid operation also improves our cost efficiency, which is reflected in our nonfuel CASM performance in this quarter.","On the corporate side, our momentum is building and we are capturing more corporate share, particularly in New York. The investments we've made to upgrade our product will be completed by midyear 2014. Whether it's flat beds on long-haul flights, Wi-Fi across the fleet, JFK facilities or similar product attributes, corporate customers are showing they value these investments. While these investments are tapering, the paybacks will grow going forward.","On the Pacific network, we had good profitability in the quarter and we are building Seattle as a West Coast gateway to Asia. New flights between Asia and Seattle, along with the domestic feed we've added there to support this, will allow us to provide broader service to our customers, including direct flights to the top 5 destinations in Asia and the top 3 destinations in Europe. The Atlantic network, in conjunction with the AFKL JV, lead all of our entities in performance. With our Virgin antitrust immunity coming online January 1, we are well-positioned for long-term improvement in the trans-Atlantic. Likewise, our Latin network, along with our exclusive partners, Aerom\u00e9xico and GOL, had solid performance with improvements across the network. We have nice opportunities ahead in those markets.","Our domestic network continues to generate excellent revenue performance. Our domestic revenue index was over 112% for the quarter and we posted a gain of over 5% in PRASM in the quarter on a capacity increase of 2.6%. We look forward to even stronger domestic performance as the cost benefits from our domestic re-fleeting and upgauging began. Between now and 2016, we will take delivery of 180 mainline and 2 class regional aircraft, allowing us to retire 150 additional 50 seaters and 50 to 60 older mainline planes. Our goal is to cut our 50-seat fleet from 260 at the end of this year, to 100 to 125 over the next 2 years. Not only do new aircraft provide maintenance and fuel efficiencies, and they're much better for our customers, but the upgauged fleet can produce capacity growth below GDP with fewer aircraft, further improving our return on invested capital.","With regard to cost, through a lot of hard work, Delta has the best unit cost position among the network carriers. We are determined to achieve our goal of keeping annual cost growth below the rate of inflation. This quarter is indicative of our long-term expectations. We also have a tremendous opportunity with the Trainer Refinery. Importantly, the refinery's production has proven to be effective in keeping jet cracks in check, particularly in the New York Harbor. Our next step is to improve the refinery's profitability through lower-cost domestic crude supply from the Bakken field, increased jet fuel output and operational initiatives to improve throughput and product mix.","For our shareholders, the business has produced more than $7 billion of free cash flow over the past 4 years and we will be -- continue to be very responsible stewards of that cash flow stream. We are now executing the balanced capital deployment plan we laid out for our share owners in May 2014, which creates more than $5 billion in shareholder value through additional debt reduction, returning cash to shareholders and addressing our pension liabilities. In fact, we are performing ahead of the May 2014 long-term capital deployment plan. We have produced a 14% return on invested capital over the last 12 months and we are incredibly focused on maintaining that performance. That means we will continue to maximize free cash flow, pay down debt, because the EPS accretion opportunity is significant for our owners. We will return excess cash to shareholders and be very disciplined about capital investments.","To close, we are continuing to work hard to build a better airline for our customers, employees and investors. There are significant opportunities ahead of us and we will keep our heads down and execute on those opportunities. We expect to set an all-time profit record for Delta in 2013 and in turn, expect to improve on that performance in 2014.","Thanks for your attention and we look forward to seeing you at our Annual Investor Day in New York on December 11. With that, I'll turn it over to my colleague, Ed Bastian.","Edward H. Bastian","Thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced a September quarter profit of $1.2 billion, a $444-million improvement over the prior year. Our EPS of $1.41 beat consensus by $0.05. I'll echo Richard and congratulate the entire Delta team for an outstanding quarter. Summer weather posed considerable challenges across the system and our employees did a remarkable job in running a solid operation and taking great care of our customers. It's an honor to be able to recognize those efforts with a record profit-sharing accrual.","At a high level, our revenue performance was remarkable, as we increased our top line in a declining fuel price environment. This combination has been key to the margin expansion we've seen this quarter and this year. Passenger revenue increased 7% or $581 million dollars on 2.6% growth in capacity. We are continuing to make good progress in increasing our corporate travel share. Our corporate revenues increased 10% during the quarter, driven by strength in the domestic market. Banking, financial services and healthcare all grew at greater than 15%, proof that our efforts, especially in New York, are paying off. Our passenger revenue performance has also been bolstered by a double-digit increase in sales of seat-related products and other services.","While this is still a relatively small portion of our total revenue base, we see good growth potential, as our experience so far has shown the customers are willing to pay extra for products and services that improve their travel experience. This is an area that Glen and the marketing team will update you on at our December Investor Day, and is a key part of our future revenue growth strategy.","Cargo revenues were down almost $15 million and continued to be impacted by a weak global freight demand and yen devaluation. Other revenue was flat for the quarter, as growth in our third-party staffing business offset a decline in our MRO revenues stemming from our decision to exit certain low-margin contracts. Domestically, we had a strong summer season with high load factors, which produced unit revenue growth of over 5% on a slightly higher capacity. Our domestic revenue strength was one of the key drivers of our earnings improvement this quarter.","We saw robust revenue generation among the business travel segment in our core markets, including noticeable gains in Atlanta. In New York, we have now seen unit revenue growth outpacing the system average for several quarters. In the trans-Atlantic, despite sluggish European economies, solid corporate revenue share gains and effective collaboration with our JV partners, Air France, KLM and Alitalia, contributed to a 6% unit revenue improvement for the quarter.","Once again, Heathrow unit revenues led the pack by a sizable margin, with a nearly 20% unit revenue improvement. We have significant potential with our alliance partners. Our Air France-KLM relationship is a model of how these alliances can be mutually beneficial. By working together, we've doubled our profit within the JV over the past 3 years and quintupled it since the JV was implemented 5 years ago, as we provide higher-quality and more comprehensive service to our customers.","We will leverage this experience as we implement our joint venture with Virgin Atlantic. We received the final approval of our antitrust immunity a few weeks ago and are on track to implement the JV starting January 1. The Virgin and Delta teams are working well together and our customers will benefit from this innovative partnership. We've already announced a number of changes to improve service between New York and Heathrow, including retiming our schedule to better meet customer demand. And the team at Virgin is making great progress in turning around their financial performance and delivered a solid profit for the September quarter. For Delta, included in our nonoperating line was a $40-million benefit, representing our 49% portion of Virgin's September quarter profit.","Turning to the Latin entities, improving yields drove 2% unit revenue growth against a 14% increase in capacity. We are building on our partnerships with Aerom\u00e9xico and GOL. During the quarter, the Aerom\u00e9xico relationship helped drive unit revenue improvement in Mexico despite a 15% increase in capacity. And in Brazil, additional traffic from the GOL partnership delivered nearly $20 million in incremental revenue during the quarter. There is great upside potential with these partners and we are continuing to strengthen these commercial and operational relationships.","Moving on to the Pacific, the yen devaluation continues to negatively impact the beach markets, primarily in Japanese point-of-sale, and we tactically adjusted our beach capacity throughout the summer to offset this weakness. The yen devaluation and the associated weaker demand negatively impacted the quarter's profit by $80 million. Fortunately, our foreign exchange exposure was fully hedged and the $80 million impact represents the impact on Japanese point-of-sale demand. The yen impact peaked in September quarter since August and September are the heaviest demand months for Japanese point of sale, especially in the resort markets. But even with the yen's impact, it's important to note that the Tokyo-Narita operation was our highest margin hub for the September quarter. We expect our Pacific restructuring will improve our Pacific performance next year.","Moving in to the December quarter, we are forecasting an operating margin of 7% to 9%, which would represent roughly 200 to 300 basis points of margin expansion over the December quarter of a year ago. As Richard mentioned, our domestic re-fleeting is a key source of margin improvement over the next few years, and we are just beginning to see the benefits. We expect to put 27 new aircraft into service during the quarter and retire 41 aircraft. As a result, our December quarter capacity from this upgauge should increase 1% to 3% on 14 fewer aircraft. Rest assured that our commitment to maintaining strong capacity discipline remains in place.","In terms of unit revenues, our fall bookings look strong. For October, we are expecting a 2-point increase in RASM. However, I need to provide some context. Our comps in October are substantially more difficult than they were in September, and the Sandy impact last October alone created 1 point of higher RASM that we are now lapping. In addition, we did see approximately a $25-million impact this month from the government shutdown.","So after giving effect for these 2 factors, the Sandy impact and the impact of the government shutdown, we estimate our core RASM for October to be up approximately 4%.","November will be a tough month to forecast. The late Thanksgiving calendar shift this year means that the peak Sunday-Monday return travel dates are in December, which will shift 2 to 3 points of RASM between those months. In addition, we had a $30 million negative hit for Sandy last November, which impacted a considerable volume of walk-up traffic in the Northeast. And when you also factor in the national election held last year, we have a lot of unusual factors to account for.","That said, what we have on the books for November and December indicates a strong holiday period and a solid close for the year. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Paul, to cover cost and cash flow.","Paul A. Jacobson","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We came into this year with a clear goal of stemming the rate of growth in our costs and expanding our margins, and our results to-date show the entire Delta team has executed well on that goal. Total operating expenses increased 2% on a 2.6% increase in capacity during the quarter. More than 1\/3 of that increase was driven by $75 million of higher profit-sharing accrual. With 3 quarters of financial results that were better than our plan set out at last year's Investor Day and a solid profit expected for the fourth quarter, we've adjusted our full year effective profit-sharing rate to reflect that a portion of this year's results will accrue at the higher 20% rate.","Our nonfuel unit cost for the quarter increased 1.1% year-over-year, as we have begun to lap cost pressures from wage increases and targeted investments in our operation. We expect our nonfuel CASM to increase about 2% in the December quarter, in keeping with our long-term goal. It will take hard work and innovation to maintain this level of cost performance going forward, but we have the right plan and commitment in place to do so.","On the fuel front, our full expense declined $81 million on lower market fuel prices and better hedge performance. The all-in fuel price per gallon was $2.97, which included a $0.06 per gallon hedge gain. The refinery produced a $3 million profit for the quarter, despite lower overall crack spreads towards the back end of the quarter. These lower crack spreads also resulted in lower market jet fuel costs for Delta. With every penny of jet fuel change equating to $40 million in annual expense, the decline in jet fuel relative to where it has traded historically has produced savings that more than offset the year-to-date loss at Trainer.","Our fuel cost benefited also from $67 million of hedge gains this quarter. As our hedge performance shows, we have effectively positioned our hedge book to provide protection against significant increases in crude, while maintaining meaningful downside participation. For the December quarter, we are hedged approximately 30% up to $120 per barrel, and those positions are currently worth approximately $70 million. So as of the October 18 forward curve, we are forecasting a December quarter fuel price of $3.03 to $3.08 per gallon, including the refinery and the hedge impact.","Moving on to cash flow, we generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $627 million of free cash flow during the quarter. We have used our strong cash flow generation over the last 3 years to delever the balance sheet and ended the quarter with $9.9 billion of adjusted net debt. Debt reduction has lowered our interest expense by more than $30 million this quarter over last year alone. With our initial $10 billion target now achieved, we have already begun marching down the path toward our new $7 billion target, which will further reduce our interest expense in the future and expand our pretax margins.","As Richard mentioned, we have also shifted to the balanced capital deployment plan we articulated to you earlier this year, which includes returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the September quarter, we distributed $51 million through our $0.06-per-share dividend payment. We also began our share repurchases, buying back 4.8 million shares at an average price of $20.82 for a total of $100 million during the quarter. Combined, these programs returned $151 million to our shareholders.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $635 million. Of that, $450 million went towards fleet investments and $61 million to purchase 12 aircraft off lease for debt reduction purposes. For the December quarter, we expect CapEx to be $800 million, primarily for the aircraft that are a part of our domestic re-fleeting initiative.","As our financial and operational results show, we have built solid momentum across the business. As we move forward, we will not waver on our commitment to improve our margins, maintain our cost and capital discipline and generate free cash flow, while taking great care of our customers and our employees.","In closing, once again, thanks to the 80,000 Delta folks making this happen every single day. Jill?","Jill Greer","Thank you, Richard, Ed and Paul. Before we go to the Q&A section, I did want to remind everybody about our annual Investor Day, which will be held on December 11. If you could mark your calendars now, we'll be sending out more information in the next few weeks with all the details.","So with that, Kelly Anne, if you could give everybody the instructions for asking questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move first to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just 2 here. Ed, I want to go back to the comments. You were talking about the Pacific and how it was -- how the Narita hub was very profitable. And then, you sort of quickly alluded to a Pacific restructuring that's expected to take place next year. What does that entail? I mean, is that -- are you pulling out of some interport flying? Are you assuming some pickup of some Haneda slots to do some additional service? Can you just maybe shed a little bit more light on that?","Edward H. Bastian","Sure, Mike. I'll give you a little bit of color and then Glen's here, he can provide more background as well. As you probably are aware, we are continuing to diversify our network, not just through the Pacific but internationally. And the growth of our direct flying to Asia, using Seattle as our principal hub that we're creating off of the West Coast, is affording us the opportunity to get some additional frequencies and opportunities in China. So part of the strategy is to reduce the concentration in Japan with some additional flying both to Korea, as well as to China. And secondly, as you look at Japan and the interports, you're right. There are a handful of interports that we have been pulling down over time and we're going to continue to as we fly directly into Haneda, and then we have those additional Chinese frequencies.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just my second question, as we look out to 2014, what are some of the potential capacity hotspots that you see? Like for example, we're starting to see carriers, both U.S. and Asia, ramp up. Is that a potential concern? Are there any other regions that you're sort of watching closely as things play out over the next 6 months or so?","Edward H. Bastian","From what we can tell, the capacity seems to be relatively in line with demand. I'd say the area that we're watching closely here is clearly in the U.S. We've been adding a bit of capacity in the U.S., but that's coming through the form of an upgauge strategy, which is clearly margin accretive and very cost-effective and in fact, reducing the amount of flying we're doing in terms of volume, but increasing the size of the aircraft. Internationally, Europe has some -- probably, some capacity this winter that's at a little higher level than we might like to see relative to the economies there. But as far as Delta sits, we're quite comfortable with where we're positioned.","Operator","We'll hear next from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on some of that Pacific commentary. Just maybe for Ed and for Glen, I mean, how -- as your shifting around new routes and opening in China and Korea, et cetera, how long should we think about the spool up curve for these new routes? I mean is this like a 2-, 3-year process? And I guess the flip of that would be what's the spool up for some of the domestic feed that obviously you have to put in to places like Seattle, and you're developing L.A., to feed in to that? And ultimately, what I'm trying to get at is, as we think about 1% growth, is this a more developmental 1% system growth kind of going forward, where maybe there's a little more RASM dilution in that growth than we've seen in the past?","Glen W. Hauenstein","David, it's Glen. I think you have to look at it as we're culling the system for the underperforming assets and then we're trying to deploy them into higher potential. And usually, that's actually RASM accretive to us. So if we're doing our job right, we're making that RASM accretive for the airplane from Day 1. Additionally, in Seattle, markets like Shanghai have been out-of-the-box profitable for us. So we're very pleased with the results for our Seattle expansion. Remember, these are really not necessarily new -- all new customers to us because we've been in those markets for many, many years. We're just changing the routings of how we get them there and making it better for the customer and more efficient for the airline.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And just maybe a quick follow-up, just on the CASM side. That 2%, the re- fleeting, how much of a CASM benefit from the initial re-fleeting is there in the fourth quarter? And maybe how much of a RASM penalty?","Paul A. Jacobson","On the CASM side, David, we actually are just getting started with that. So many of those aircraft they delivered at the back end of the quarter are just going into service. So it's somewhat limited in fourth quarter of '13 and will continue to appreciate over 2014. I think if you're looking at the sequential cost performance, there was some higher spend in third quarter of 2012 that gave us a little bit of an advantage. But overall, we remain balanced at less than 2%.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from JPMorgan's Jamie Baker.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question for Paul. On the fourth quarter cost guidance, it does appear to be sort of at the upper end of your target for the year, despite a little bit more fourth quarter capacity than I expected in what looks like a pretty easy cost comp on Hurricane Sandy. I realize there's a fair amount of demand uncertainty, particularly in November. And I can't help but wonder, I mean are there some real cost drivers in this 2% CASM guide? Or is this just where you're kind of building in some cushion for the quarter?","Paul A. Jacobson","No, I think we believe that we're going to come in around that 2% level and we'll get inside of it. But as we look at where we were in 2012, actually third quarter was the easier comp than fourth quarter is. But as we go through it, again, we're committed to keeping inside of that 2%. We think we'll achieve it.","Edward H. Bastian","Jamie, one of the things that got going on, as I mentioned, we have a lot of new aircraft delivering this quarter. So there's a little bit of uncertainty on the timing and the induction. So rest assured, we're going to strive to come in below the 2%. But for modeling purposes, we think 2% is probably a good estimate right now.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, helpful. And second question for Richard. And this isn't intended to take away from the success that you're having here in New York in the share that you've picked up from corporate employers, such as my own. But the fact of the matter is your largest New York-based competitor, which is a polite way of saying United, is having a rough go of things. You came out swinging in your opening comments, but I'm curious if you're baking in any competitive headwinds next year or just extrapolating from the current trajectory. In other words, how big of a threat to your considerable bullishness is a potential renaissance at United or even a merged LCC-American? Who knows?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, Jamie, I wasn't intending to make any commentary on any of the competitive dynamics in the market, but just focus on what we need to do at Delta. If you look at the New York market, it is a huge market. And what we've been able to do at LaGuardia has been pretty remarkable in terms of turning that to a fully-allocated profitable business. And as we ramp up the Virgin arrangement, our antitrust immunity with Virgin, we will now have the #2 position across the trans-Atlantic to the most important airport in the world for travelers out of the U.S., which is London, Heathrow. So, when you look at -- and I'm just speaking for Delta. I'm really making no reference to any other carrier, because at Delta, we're really just kind of focused on what Delta does. If you look at the momentum we have in LaGuardia, it's going quite well. And JFK has tremendous upside because we've seen enormous improvement in our trans-Atlantic operation to London, Heathrow with Virgin, and we haven't really started the joint venture yet. So the joint venture doesn't even start until January 1. And so when you take the combination of those events for Delta specific, it's a really strong base to be able to continue to grow. When you take the quality of our product, the new facility in JFK, it gives us a very strong base to be able to grow our unit revenues in New York.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. I would agree the LaGuardia and the Heathrow momentum are likely unrelated to any RASM benefit you might be gaining at the expense of the competition. So appreciate the input.","Operator","We'll move now to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a cash flow question. Your earnings were up $440 million, yet your cash flow was up $650 million year-to-year. Are you seeing any change in seasonality around advanced ticket sales? Could you help explain that difference?","Paul A. Jacobson","I think if you're looking at just quarterly cash flow, there was an event in third quarter of last year where we've -- third quarter this year, where we've actually unwound some fuel securitization deals that generated a little bit of extra performance. I think on our forward cash, we see continued strong -- receipts are getting us some comfort around that.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And can you give us any thoughts at this point on 2014 CapEx and your hedge position at this point for next year?","Richard H. Anderson","We're going to look forward to seeing everybody on December 11 in New York at our Annual Investor Day.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. I'll sneak in a little detailed one then. Just the fleet was 900 versus 725. Can you explain -- maybe that had something to do with consolidation of a regional. Can you give us some detail there?","Richard H. Anderson","Endeavor. It's -- we picked up Endeavor as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Formerly Pinnacle.","Operator","We'll move on to John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to first ask about the repurchase. It looks like you executed a good amount the last quarter. It didn't really hit the share count. I think you had kind of a lump of shares that crept in there. But first of all, if you could just kind of talk about this $100 million. Is that a reasonable quarterly run rate to assume? Or should we view that as very opportunistic? And secondarily, if you could just explain sort of what neutralized the benefit on share count, that would be helpful.","Paul A. Jacobson","Sure, John. The share count was primarily a happy problem when the stock price was up 20% quarter-over-quarter. The dilutive impact on treasury stock method for accounting for options and restricted stock actually increases your higher diluted count. The repurchases during the quarter were somewhat back loaded during the quarter, so that the average calculation didn't give them as much of an impact. And then, on your other question, I'm not sure I'd be in good stead if I gave forward-looking guidance on repurchase.","Richard H. Anderson","Let me just give a little bit of qualitative. In my remarks, I said that we were running ahead of the long-term plan that we provided to investors in May of 2013.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And if I could just ask a question more broadly on corporate travel, not necessarily focused on the New York market. Is there anything you can tell us sort of about how you're tracking it internally in terms of how much of the corporate travel revenue growth has been market-share driven versus the market overall? And how much market share opportunity you think you continue to have?","Edward H. Bastian","I think, John, I think it's clearly both. We've seen continued uptick in the overall volume of corporate travel across the industry. And I note that GBTA just put out a survey last week that said that looking into 2014, they're estimating travel expenditures to be up 7%. So clearly, there's a continuing rising tide for corporate travel. But given our double-digit performance that we've been running consistently year-on-year-on-year, clearly there's a considerable amount of share shift that we've also been picking up. So it'd be hard for me to split the 2, but I'd say they're both significant contributors.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And opportunity going forward?","Edward H. Bastian","We think there's great opportunity going forward, and I think Richard covered a lot of that in his opening remarks. When you think about the product, that will now be consistent across our entire international fleet, with widebodies starting the spring of next year, when you think about the progress we're making in New York with the new facilities at JFK and LaGuardia and you think about the inroads we're making, particularly in the banking and financial sectors, markets we didn't have much share at all and we're going to be a strong contender, and then you add Virgin on top of that, we got a lot of confidence that we're going to continue to grow that share.","Operator","And Glenn Engel with Bank of America has our next question.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of smaller questions. One, on the yen side, you mentioned the impact this year is really on the lost traffic. As those -- if the yen stays where it is and as those hedges roll off, do we have a yen impact on yield next year?","Edward H. Bastian","You're asking about a 24 -- could you rephrase your question, Glenn? I didn't quite follow...","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This year, the yen is -- should've diluted your yield, but you hedged it. As those hedges roll off and the yen stays at this level, do we see a further impact from the yen next year, but this time showing up in the yield?","Edward H. Bastian","Sure, sure. We have a considerable hedge book out for another 18 to 24 months. We're building our Pacific restructuring around the assumption that the yen will be at, at least 100 going forward.","Richard H. Anderson","Glenn, we're 50% hedged in the 80's through 2015.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Oh, boy. On the Endeavor side you mentioned, did that -- even though it's wholly owned, did that show up entirely under the contract carriers on your operating [indiscernible] statement line?","Jill Greer","No. It's under unusual line items in the P&L, Glen.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm sorry. The Endeavor, is that -- the expenses in -- of -- tied to Endeavor, does that show up in contract or does that show up throughout the operating expense lines?","Jill Greer","It's in the operating expense lines, Glenn.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Oh, all the pieces. So it's all spread out. Okay.","Jill Greer","Yes.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And on LaGuardia, can you talk about connections? What level of connectivity you're up to right now?","Paul A. Jacobson","We're sitting right around 20% connectivity in LaGuardia, which is the targeted range that we thought we'd be in. We're going to continue to refine our schedule now that we know actual demand, and we feel like we have a lot of momentum going into 2014 with the LaGuardia operations.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Would you like that number to be higher? Or is 20% really where you want to stay?","Paul A. Jacobson","No. I think our original target was 20% to 25%, so we might be a little bit on the lower range. But we've made a lot of adjustments to really tailor capacity for demand. And I think we're very satisfied with the P&L and where we sit today, and we think there's a lot of upside as we move forward.","Operator","And from Cowen, we'll go to Helane Becker.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Richard, I was wondering if I could ask a follow-up question to my last question on the last conference call, when we talked about CBP in JFK. I know you guys added a bunch of self-service kiosks. Can you just talk about the performance there and how that's going for you?","Richard H. Anderson","Actually, the self-service kiosks have been fairly remarkable in terms of reducing line waits for people coming into the U.S. And it's probably one of the biggest innovations that we've seen come along from CBP and we are hopeful that we're able to roll it out. Actually, what we should do as an industry is roll it out across all of the big airports in the U.S. to just facilitate travel into the U.S. And Steve Gorman, you may have some specifics to provide Helane on what line waits have turned, how they turned?","Stephen E. Gorman","Yes, Helane, just to give you a feel. Granted, this is not necessarily the peak season, but since we've put them in, we've seen as much as 90% reduction in line waits. So line waits in the 45-, 50-minute range, down to mid-single digits, 5, 7 minutes for line waits. So, remarkable improvement.","Richard H. Anderson","And Helane, I have to thank Senator Schumer for his work in helping us in New York.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then can I just ask a completely unrelated question? As you build up Seattle, should we think about that as an international connecting hub versus Salt Lake as a domestic hub? Or, will you be transitioning some capacity away from Salt Lake into Seattle? How should we think about those 2 hub locations?","Glen W. Hauenstein","Helane, it's Glen. Seattle is an amazing city and we are going to continue to expand internationally there, but without taking anything away from Salt Lake. Salt Lake is a great domestic hub with a couple of international flights into it. We expect to maintain that status, maybe even grow it over time, as that city is continuing to grow rapidly. But Seattle is our Asian gateway and we'll serve the top 3 cities in Europe next year, and we're very excited about the opportunities that present themselves in Seattle as an international gateway.","Operator","We'll move now to Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Ed, following up on your commentary to growth to South Korea, it is an Open Skies country. So just a quick question here. Are you leveraging that opportunity with the JV at this point? Or is that an opportunity possibly on the horizon?","Edward H. Bastian","I'm sorry, I couldn't hear your opening remarks. Were you asking about Korea?","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Yes. Following up on your commentary to growth to South Korea, I was just pointing out that it is an Open Skies country. My question is, is are you leveraging that opportunity with the JV at this point? Or is that an opportunity that might possibly be on the horizon?","Edward H. Bastian","We don't have a JV with Korean at this time and I can't project where that's going to go.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And I guess, just a follow-up question. I guess, Richard, for you, just on Open Skies in general. What are your thoughts about what might be holding back Open Skies with China?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, I think the Chinese carriers are continuing to develop and the Chinese government, to their credit, views -- unlike the United States, the Chinese government views aviation as a strategic asset for its country. And so they're making the kinds of investments in growing and developing 3 strong flag carriers. And if you were in their situation, you would take similar steps.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Is that something you can see changing on the horizon?","Richard H. Anderson","Long term, for Delta, ultimately, it could possibly change. I don't know when that will. But when you think about how Delta is positioning itself with China Southern and China Eastern, we have exclusive relationships with 2 of the 3 important flag carriers there, and we're now actually connecting 30 to 40 passengers a day on to our partners in Shanghai and Beijing. But if you have a good vision of where you should be a decade from now, you could imagine replicating the kind of joint venture relationships that we perfected in Europe to be able to move those to China. It's going to take a long time, but that's the kind of work we need to be thinking about now so that we can sustain the free cash flows and the growth of the enterprise over the very long term.","Operator","And Savi Syth, with Raymond James, has our next question.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just on the MRO side, I know the revenue there has been declining as you get rid of some of the lower profit business. There's some news about more MRO business coming to the U.S. just because the labor arbitrage has been moving away. Do you see that business as growing some time? I know back in maybe 2011, 2010, you thought that was a business that you could grow in. I was wondering what the prospects were for that business?","Richard H. Anderson","This is Richard Anderson and I'll have Steve chime in with more specifics. We like the MRO business quite a lot. The change that we've made in that business is to transition it more to component and engine work over time. And given the need around the world for the ability to perform complex maintenance tasks, we're particularly well positioned at Delta. What we have been able to do over the last 18 months, we brought in a new head of that business, Peter Turner, who ran the MRO business for Rolls-Royce for many years. And we built a very strong team and we have significantly expanded our margins in the MRO business. And we expect now that we're going to be moving more into a growth mode in that business. We have a joint venture agreement with Boeing on the 767 tanker that we expect will be a significant growth opportunity for Delta. And as we look out at fleet maturity around the world, we believe we'll be well positioned to be able to leverage our expertise, particularly in engine and component overhaul.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And is that still, like, maybe a $0.5-billion-sized revenue business?","Richard H. Anderson","A little more than $0.5 billion, with double-digit fully-allocated margins.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great to see the contributions out of Virgin Atlantic from the get go. I was wondering if you could give us a preview of the increased types of collaboration you anticipate once the JV is formed next year?","Edward H. Bastian","Sure, Tom. This is Ed. We have a big opportunity, principally in the corporate arena, where we can bring our selling efforts together on both sides of the ocean. So since we already have antitrust immunity, our sales -- collective sales teams are working on it today to go out the market with a single sales plan. So, you'll see that will be a big driver of our look-forward opportunity, and New York will be a big beneficiary in that regard. We'll be looking at future network opportunities to grow, with either the Virgin metal or the Delta metal. And I think operationally, Virgin is going to benefit from Delta's operational prowess. And when you think about the size of the company, they've got a great brand and a great name, but they're relatively subscale. We bring a lot of purchasing might to them as well, and operational know-how. So, I think it's a great opportunity and our teams are working very effectively and I'm very excited about it.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","For modeling purposes, should we anticipate the benefit accruing more through the JV or actually directly through the trans-Atlantic contributions?","Edward H. Bastian","I think it'll -- well, it's both, right? So the JV and the trans-Atlantic, it's all going to be through the JV. So, that's where the big benefits will be. It'll be in the top line.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then if I can ask one last follow-up on that. Given that Virgin's privately held, what type of transparency should we expect to see going forward, as this contribution could continue to grow and become much more meaningful?","Edward H. Bastian","We'll continue to give you disclosure of the 49% ownership stake that we have on a real-time basis, and we'll keep you posted as to the JV's progress once we get engaged next year.","Operator","And that will be from Hunter Keay with Wolf Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Question for you. I can tell that you're excited about this trans-Atlantic JV, obviously, with Alitalia, but they're having some problems right now. And I'm curious, you guys, your JV is unique in the sense you actually share costs and not just revenues. So can you give us a refresher as to how the costs from Alitalia's operation flow-through? And maybe more importantly, if these guys are facing some sort of liquidation scenario, which is possible, are you guys going to be prepared to step up and potentially offer a capital injection if you have to keep them afloat?","Richard H. Anderson","Hunter, this is Richard. Alitalia is an infinitesimal -- a very small part of the trans-Atlantic JV. It's a $12 billion enterprise and Air France-KLM have the lead on that, and we're not injecting any capital into it.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","And in terms of these corporate share gains, can you give us an idea how much of your corporate -- structured corporate contracts come from foreign companies? And is this an area that you're targeting for growth in the future? And do you have an ideal percentage as to what you'd like to get that to be?","Richard H. Anderson","Well, we don't disclose or break down the specifics by foreign origin point-of-sale on our corporate sales.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Is it fair to think it's like a small portion right now? I mean like less than 10%? Or, I mean, is this just something that is just rounding?","Richard H. Anderson","It's just a lot more complex than that because we have joint venture agreements with Air France, KLM, Aerom\u00e9xico, GOL. And these joint venture agreements have both foreign point-of-sale and U.S. point-of-sale. So they're really -- the right way to look at these businesses as in the totality.","Jill Greer","And that's going to conclude the analyst portion of the call. I'm going to turn it over to Betsy Talton for the media portion.","Betsy Talton","Thanks, Jill. Kelly Anne, if you could, please go over again the process for queuing up to ask the questions for the media. [Operator Instructions]","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein","I may have missed this during the course of your presentation, but did you quantify the impact of the government shutdown?","Richard H. Anderson","Yes, we did. In the month of October, we estimated that it had a negative impact of $20 million to $25 million on our revenues.","Mary Schlangenstein","And are there any concerns with the uncertainty of pushing out the date on the debt ceiling and the rest of that? That will continue to have an ongoing impact due to the uncertainty? Or it kind of sounds like from your outlook and your expectations, that you don't see that impacting things further in the fourth quarter?","Richard H. Anderson","We don't expect that it will have any further impact in fourth quarter.","Mary Schlangenstein","Out into the start of 2014, too far out tell?","Richard H. Anderson","Well we haven't issued any guidance to the like for 2014. But just overall, it's not good for the U.S. economy to lurch from one sequester government shutdown to another every 90 to 120 days. It's not good for any company or organization in the U.S.","Operator","We'll move on to Karen Jacobs with Reuters.","Karen Jacobs","Will you anticipate expanding flights beyond what you've already announced for the Virgin venture?","Richard H. Anderson","We don't speculate ahead of time on any decisions to enter markets in the future.","Jill Greer","Thanks very much, again, everyone. Richard, Ed, Paul, Glen and team, thank you. That concludes our September quarter call. We'll see many of you at Investor Day in New York on December 11 and be back on the phone for the December quarter and year-end results in January.","Operator","Again, that will conclude today's Delta Airlines conference. We thank you all for joining us."]}}
