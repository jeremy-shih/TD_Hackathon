My name is [Kaneesha], and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Verisk Analytics\u2019 Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","Ms. Eva Huston, you may begin your conference.","Eva Huston","Thank you Kaneesha, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011 financial results.","With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer.","Following some comments by Frank, Scott and Mark, highlighting the key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions.","The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investor section of our website at verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be posted on our website and available by dial-in for 30 days until March 29, 2012.","And finally, as set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. And information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of the press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Frank Coyne.","Frank Coyne","Thank you, Eva, and good morning. In the fourth quarter 2011, we delivered strong performance of almost 20% revenue growth and over 25% diluted adjusted EPS growth. Our performance for the fiscal year was also strong with 17% revenue growth and 25% diluted adjusted EPS growth. These results are evidence of our discipline in execution.","We are pleased that the market has recognized this through the strong performance of our stock price in 2011. We performed well in many of our businesses and our recent acquisitions also contributed. Risk assessments grew 3.9% for the quarter and the full-year, as our continued value to customers is reflected in our revenue growth.","We also saw improvement in property specific revenue growth in the quarter. In the quarter Decision Analytics revenue grew almost 35% and our insurance solutions in Decision Analytics grew almost 15% organically. For the full-year Decision Analytics grew almost 30% with similar growth from our insurance solution.","Our healthcare solutions revenue grew almost about 37% organically in the quarter as we continued on the double-digit growth trajectory we started to see in the third quarter. Overall, our organic revenue growth was 7.6% in the quarter and for the full-year.","Decision Analytics organic growth in Q4 was 11%, driven by both strong growth from insurance-facing solutions as well as the accelerated growth in healthcare. The mortgage market remained challenging with the macroeconomic conditions continuing to work against us. We continue to have conviction around our margin and overall profitability. We are pleased to deliver 25% growth in diluted adjusted EPS for 2011 and over 16% growth in EBITDA, while expanding margins to over 46% excluding the recent acquisitions.","As always, we remained focused on delivering shareholder returns. We remained determined to find attractive M&A opportunities to take advantage of our substantial balance sheet flexibility. We bought $41 million of shares in the quarter, a lower amount than in previous quarters as we managed our buyback as part of our broader capital allocation plan including acquisitions.","We remained interested in using our capital as appropriate for buybacks is evidenced by our $300 million new authorization announced in January 2012. As I look forward to 2012, I see a consistency in our business plan, but also new opportunities on the horizon.","I have confidence, we can continue to execute on that plan and realize attractive growth from the insurance base. We have set our healthcare business on a positive path to continue to grow and expand its footprint. I also think 2012 will bring more opportunity in our supply chain business as we work to leave our solutions in analytics together and also continued to pursue acquisitions in the space.","Mortgage is likely to remain a soft spot for 2012, but we are also ensuring that we use our skill sets in ways that meet the evolving needs of the mortgage market as well as across the broader financial services sector.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott to talk about the progress we are making in a number of our business areas.","Scott Stephenson","Thank you, Frank. I talked about innovation and it remains a key focus of our execution plan. Innovation means a lot of things to a lot of people, but to us it is about both staying ahead of the market as well as meeting your customers where they want you to be. We continue to invest in new products and we\u2019re committed to this as a constant insight of our plan. While our margins continue to expand and we must also ensure that margin expansion does not come at the expense of future growth.","One great example is the investment we\u2019re making in our unified healthcare technology platform which will be a 2012 and into 2013 project and we will provide simplified workflow for our customers. We\u2019re leveraging the platform we acquired in the Bloodhound acquisition and are consolidating our fraud and abuse analytics and creating a data submission standard that will power both the front-end underwriting and back-end fraud solutions, thereby improving our customers ease of use and facilitating our ability to cross-sell. We're working to move closer to clinical data; it will be very useful inside of our overall analytic approach.","Another example of investment is our next generation platform and the expanded parallels for our catastrophe models which will help our customers use our tools in broader ways than in the past including in making underwriting decisions.","We're investing over $10 million between these two projects, both of these projects are a result of us seeing our customers needs and pinpoints and working to make our solutions not just the best analytical tools, but also the ones that are easiest to use.","Another focal point for us is integration, which is quite important as we grow. The unified healthcare platform I discussed is an example of how we're quickly moving to bring our recently acquired HRP and Bloodhound assets together with the rest of Verisk health. And the creation of our underwriting solutions group also shows our ability to successfully pull together relevant parts of our organization.","The underwriting team has brought together a number of our underwriting tools with a particular emphasis at this point on personal lines to provide a more holistic view of our customers underwriting process and create efficiencies. The formation of this group which was announced in January will not change any of the financial reporting structures you see, but our team will be rewarded for their success. We expect that continuing to evolve our business organization as needed, will further align our customer success with our own.","For those of you who are going to attend or listen to our Investor Day on March 8, you will hear more about these projects and initiatives as well as hearing directly from our business unit leaders whose passion and creativity and discipline are what will drive our company forward. These are the people who are looking to expand and re-imagine our position in the market to enlarge our growth opportunity and I hope you have the opportunity to spend time with them.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark, to talk about our corporate financial results.","Mark Anquillare","Thank your, Scott. As Frank noted in the fourth quarter we delivered 19.9% revenue growth and 7.6% organic revenue growth. And for fiscal 2011, we delivered 17% revenue growth also with 7.6% organic revenue growth. For the fourth quarter and fiscal year our Decision Analytic segment revenue continued to lead with 34% and 28.9% growth respectively. The Decision Analytics revenue growth organically, which was 11% in the quarter and for the fiscal year excludes the acquisitions of Crowe Paradis, 3E, Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners.","For 2011, we've converted our Decision Analytics revenue categories to those we previewed with you in the supplemental revenue data provided in the third quarter. We've received positive feedback from the market on the transparency of this financial data. Going forward we\u2019ll use the vertical categories to report within Decision Analytics. We've not changed any of our historic financial results and our segment reporting remains the same.","Last quarter we provided historical information in these same categories back to 2008 full-year reference. As a reminder, we\u2019ve grouped revenues by the primary end-market of the various parts of our businesses. In insurance, key solutions include insurance fraud solutions, including claim search, our catastrophe modeling solutions from ARR worldwide, and our insurance loss quantification solutions from Xactware. This grouping is the same as we\u2019ve referenced in the past as insurance-facing solutions and Decisions Analytics.","In mortgage and financial services, we include our Interthinx underwriting and forensic audit tools facing the mortgage market as well as our strategic analytics businesses which also serve other consumer finance markets. Starting in first quarter of 2012, we\u2019re also including our ACI, property appraisal tools facing the mortgage market in the mortgage and financial services category to reflect a management reporting change that split the mortgage appraisal tools from the appraisal tools used in the insurance space. These mortgage appraisal tools represent about $11 million in revenue 2011 with lower margins in the remainder of risk assessment. These financial contributions which were previously reported is part of property\u2019s specific revenue grouping in risk assessment.","Healthcare includes all of the Verisk\u2019s health tools including DxCG, [Suremed], D2Hawkeye, HDI, Bloodhound and Heath Risk Partners, and specialized markets includes our Climate Risk Analytics provided by our AER business as well as the 3E component of our supply chain risk management solutions.","Within Decision Analytics our insurance category grew 19.5% in the fourth quarter and 14.6% organically. For the fiscal year, revenue from the insurance category grew 21% and 14.6% organically. We continue to benefit from the growth in our claims tools as well as the cumulative effects of higher claims volumes due to 2011 weather events, which drive additional transactional revenue when customers exceed the maximum contracted claims volume totals.","We also had some benefit from custom work for large customer, and continue to see growth in underwriting tools and newer solutions, such as content type information within loss quantification.","We\u2019re generating revenue from our international expansion. We plan to grow its contribution over time, to help procure model transition to our new categories inside Decision Analytics. Our revenue formally reported its loss quantification grew 27% in the quarter. We\u2019ll not be reporting this separately going forward.","In the quarter, catastrophe modeling solutions continued double-digit growth due to new and expanded customer relationships from our core catastrophe model products. When we observed the market share over the past year, we\u2019ve increased for both the commercial and personal lines primary carriers, evidence of the cross-sell success.","We also had a good quarter for both our core catastrophe models for investors as well as for catastrophe bond projects in area, which our market shares are over 85% in 2011. Our insurance fraud claims also continued good revenue growth.","The revenue in mortgage and financial services declined 7.2% in fourth quarter, and declined 1.9% for fiscal year 2011, reflecting a weak macro-environment originations and the downward trend in the number of loans that are delinquent, defaulted, or in foreclosure. Based on those trends, revenue from both underwriting and forensic solutions declined in the quarter and in the fiscal year as new customers and increased usage by existing customers was not sufficient to offset the double-digit decline in origination versus 2010. On the forensic audit side, revenue continue to decline as new customers were not enough to offset the lower volumes of large customer, we\u2019ve previously discussed.","Our outlook for 2012 from mortgage remains negative, as the current market makes it difficult to predict trends for the majority of our products. It is possible the trends seen in the fourth quarter on revenue continue throughout 2012. However, we remain focused on building our skill-sets for opening solutions such as contract underwriting and other tools to respond to current and long-term trends in the market.","Healthcare continues to prove out the opportunity we\u2019ve spoken about, with total growth of 170.2% for the quarter, and 37.3% organic. This shows nice progress building on over 25% organic growth in third quarter of 2011.","Our total growth continues to benefit from the additions of Bloodhound and HRP in 2011. Our organic growth is also benefiting from our consolidated approach to selling our tools. We deliver about 20% of organic growth for all of 2011. Our HRP revenue is weighted about 70% to the third and fourth quarters as the season from Medicare Advantage reviews kicks in that.","So, I\u2019d expect that the portion of healthcare revenue would be at lower levels in first and second quarter than in fourth quarter, but at a high-level than the related period in 2010 prior to the acquisition.","Our specialized markets revenue grew 134% in fourth quarter, and 181.3% for the fiscal year 2011. Total revenue growth included the acquisition of 3E in December of 2010. Organic revenue growth declined 1.6% in the fourth quarter as a result of government contracts for weathering analytics that began in 2010 as it reached its full quarterly value as well as governmental budgetary delays in 2011.","Organic revenue in this category grew 12.4% for the fiscal year 2011. We continue to look for ways to repurpose our weather analytics into the insurance and supply chain markets, and we\u2019re excited about the ability to continue to build on our capabilities of 3E to broaden our supply chain offerings.","Turning to risk assessment, we grew revenue at 3.9% in the quarter and for the fiscal year 2011. Our industry standard programs grew 4.9% in the quarter, a continued reflection of the value-based price increases in January 2011 in the moderation of premium declines at our customers as well as new customers in 2011. Our premium linkage solutions also continued to add growth.","Our property specific information revenues return to modest growth of 0.5% in the quarter as lower transaction volumes with certain customers were offset by increased use of property appraisal tools. About 85% of our revenue in risk assessment is based on subscriptions and long-term contracts, with 99% renewal rates recurring in fairly predictable revenue for a vast majority of the segment.","As we think towards 2012, we expect to see the benefit in risk assessment due to our new invoices, although premium growth remains negative in 2010. And we try hard to be sensitive to our customers as well as to position ourselves for cross-sell opportunities.","Overall, we\u2019re comfortable with our enterprise performed even in the face of specific market issues from the mortgage business. Excluding the mortgage business, organic growth was 9.6% in the quarter and over 9% for the full-year.","EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $158.4 million and $592 million for the full-year as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 20.5% for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 45%. Our consolidated EBITDA margin increased in the fourth quarter, compared to 44.4% in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, EBITDA margin was 46.6% in the quarter, and also excluding the benefit of the reduction in earn-out provision 45.8% for the fiscal year 2011.","In the quarter our risk assessment margins were 51.4% versus 51.3% in the fourth quarter of 2010, and 50.5 in the third quarter of \u201911. Our business continues to show scaled profitability while we continue to invest in developing new solutions. The margin in Decision Analytics was 40.7% in fourth quarter versus 40.1% in third quarter of 2011. Improving the underlying margins of several of our businesses as well as a mix shift to higher margin solutions benefited us in the quarter partially offset by the impact from the mortgage business.","Our interest expense was flat in third quarter \u2013 flat with third quarter of 2011 as the increased interest associated with the bond offering December was reflected in only part of the period, and was offset by decreased borrowings under our credit facility as a result of the refinancing we completed in early 4Q. Our $250 million bond was our second public bond issuance and was closed on December 8th with a 4.875% coupon and maturity of January 2019. With the bond proceeds we repaid the entire outstandings leaving $725 million available on our revolver.","We continue to be opportunistic in the debt markets, and in 2011 created valuable committed debt capacity and public market access that can be used as a part of our strategic acquisition program. We ended fourth quarter with total debt of $1.1 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.87 times, leaving us a bit below our target capital structure of two times. Our run rate interest expense for 2012 based upon our debt outstanding trend, all of which was fixed rate is approximately $65 million. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.5 for the quarter down due to favorable audit settlements and resolutions, the continued execution of our tax planning strategies and the benefits associated with R&D legislation. For the full-year our reported effective tax rate was 38.6%. For 2012, we are expecting rate inline with our historical rate of approximately 40%.","Coming down to the net income line, we focused on adjusted net income and non-GAAP measure which we defined in the current period as net income plus acquisition related amortization expense, less income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 22.2% to $85.5 million for the quarter and grew 16.3% to $303.6 million for fiscal 2011. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.50 for fourth quarter 2011, an increase of 28.2%. The average diluted share count was a 170.5 million in the quarter and on December 31, 2011 our diluted share count was 170.9 million shares.","In the quarter we repurchased 1.1 million shares for approximately $41 million. At quarter end, we had about 7 million left under our authorization. In January we announced additional 300 million to be added to that. In fiscal 2011 we repurchased 11.3 million shares for a total purchase price of 381 million. Our approach to share repurchases remained focused on limiting dilution and only going beyond that we believe the purchase will deliver appropriate economic returns and not prior to acquisitions. Our share repurchase program is successful to-date generating annualized IRRs of over 20%.","Turning to our balance sheet as of December 31st, our cash and cash equivalence were $192 million, reflecting the remaining proceeds from a bond offering in December that were not used to pay the bank debt. Total debt both short-term and long-term totaled just north of 1.1 billion at December 31st, up slightly from third quarter 2011 as we funded share buybacks largely with cash on hand and cash from operations.","Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 1.87 times at year-end, well within our covenant. Our debt capacity is about $675 million and will continue to grow as our free cash flow generation and as we had EBITDA of acquired companies.","We intend to use somewhere between $70 million to $90 million of our cash on hand in the first half of 2012 to fund our pension plan above the required funding levels to bring it closer to a full funded status. Free cash flow in 2011, which we defined as cash from operations, less capital expenditures was $307.3 million, an increase of $12.3 million versus 2010. Free cash flow increased 4.2% in 2011 and the 11.8% increase in cash from operations partially offset by increased capital expenditures which totaled about $68.4 million for the year including capital expenditures related to our acquisitions.","Our capital expenditures were 5.1% of revenue as a result of the investment period and a periodic upgrade to our computing environment as well as continued investment in the business. We continued our strong free cash flow conversion of EBITDA which was 52% in 2011. In our 10-K we stated that we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $75 million in 2012. Overall, we had a good year with strong growth in both revenue and earnings reflecting both our discipline and execution on strategy.","With that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from David Togut.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc","Can you quantify the price increase that you invoice to your customers in the risk assessment business in January of this year?","Mark Anquillare","Well, I don\u2019t think we typically provided that level of detail. But I think what we -- we have always said that we want to try to put in place some type of inflationary type of increases. We think that\u2019s reflective of the value that we add. And in the center premiums which are a component of that invoice start to harden up, which remember our 2012 invoices are really reflective of 2010 premiums is still a difficult time for our customers that will add and certainly provide a little bit of a tailwind in the future, but that will be more into 2013 than \u201912.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc","Do you have a specific expectation for the record premium growth for 2011 as a whole and 2012 based on the trends you see with your customers?","Frank Coyne","Well, we don\u2019t have a specific number expectation. All the signals and information indicate that the soft market has bottomed out and we\u2019re going to have a gradual increase in premiums going forward.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc","And then can you be a little bit more granular about the underlying drivers of the accelerating growth within the healthcare vertical and to what extend would these be sustainable in 2012?","Scott Stephenson","Yeah, there is a lot of different things that contribute, some of the things that would sort of rise to the top would be we have had a lot of success in selling new business and I suppose the acquisition of new customers as well as the penetration of newer parts of our portfolio into existing customers. So the cross-sell themes that we talk about a lot is that work in the healthcare business as well as in insurance. And then in addition to that we have actually streamlined some of our processes which have permitted us to actually accelerate the rate at which we implement. Some of what we do in healthcare is transactionally priced. And so getting the implementations ramping faster is \u2013 has benefited the revenue. There is no reason why our process will change, so I think that the efficiency of our implementations will stay high and we still think we have a very large cross-sell opportunity in front of us in healthcare.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc","Scott, you highlighted 10 million of incremental investment for 2012. Can you give us a little bit more insight into potential operating leverage for 2012?","Scott Stephenson","Well, we continue to do the things that basically have gotten our margins to the point that they are at right now. So the first thing is just to run the business with a great deal of discipline. I\u2019d say on top of that a very powerful and a very long-term trend inside of our business is just the -- the way in which cost related to computing storage and network are always moving in the right direction. And so we are always looking for opportunities to change our internal environment as it relates to automation and we are going to continue to do that. So it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think there are new themes there. We are just going to continue to press them into our business.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc","Just a final question if I might, for Mark. Could you talk about capital allocation priorities for 2012? You have highlighted a 307 million left in your share repurchase authorization. I mean how do you compare value of your current stock versus acquisition and your pipeline?","Mark Anquillare","Well, first of all -- I think we try to highlight that. We did go to a larger authorization in January that does not change our approach in anyway. We remain committed to investing our business first and foremost, that is with other -- in total investment which typically takes the form of expense inside our P&L. But acquisition would -- will be at top of that list. We have committed to buying back shares to limit dilution, and to the extent that we have the ability to buy more, it\u2019s probably because we are trying to for the most part balance between acquisition and buybacks. Our continued commitment is to make sure we deploy that in a disciplined way. And I think we\u2019ve been successful in trying to make sure we think about it in the right economic way before we deploy capital.","Operator","Question comes from Eric Boyer from Wells Fargo Securities.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Margin question again. How should we think about the margin moving forward, the pace of acquisition slowed in the back half of 2011 and you exited the end of the year at the top end of that longer term guidance range. I guess the question is will you manage the margins moving forward if the pace of acquisitions are slower or reinvest to keep the margins in that longer term rage or could we see the margin moving up above on an annual basis?","Mark Anquillare","Let me start with that. I think the first answer to your question is we are thinking about the long-term. So we are going to make the right investment if we think we are going to be able to generate cash for our shareholders and grow the business in long-term. That\u2019s our foremost. So, managing margin is not something we think about day to day. We think about trying to find the right investment and deploying capital the most effective way possible. So that\u2019s a broad perspective. More specifically we do think there is natural operating leverage inside the business, we would imagine that should scale and remain \u2013 continue to scale offset by some investment. The other thing is a little bit of product mix shift. Obviously, the risk assessment business and some of the insurance-facing solutions have some nice margins as healthcare grows there\u2019s a product shift there or about product mix shift there. We have good margins in healthcare, not as high as some of the healthcare \u2013 some of the insurance-facing, and then clearly offsetting some of the margin expectations in the future is, what's going to happen with mortgage and those are a couple of the variables that we think about as we continue to hope to drive growth and cash flow into the future.","Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Along the same lines, you talked about the acquisitions that you did in 2010, and \u201911 having an impact of 160 basis points. Now where are you in the progression of improving those margins for those acquisitions and how should we think about that impact in 2012?","Mark Anquillare","So, let me give you, maybe at a high-level some of the numbers and maybe Scott, to talk integration. So I think that\u2019s a great theme. First of all, what we tried to highlight is because of the size of both 3E and in Crowe Paradis back in December, we knew that it was going to hurt us to the tune about 1.8%, just because they were very profitable or just the margins were not as high as.","We continue to believe and we\u2019ve seen natural scale and operating leverage in each of those businesses. So as you now look forward, I think we are on kind of a run rate that we don\u2019t have to worry about any adjustments and each of those business in and of themselves do have natural scale to them. Scott, maybe \u2026?","Scott Stephenson","Yeah that\u2019s \u2013 on top of that, there\u2019s two themes with respect to integration. The near-term one is the less powerful one as it relates to near-term margins, but there is an effect there and that is, we consolidated account management functions and selling across the different parts of Verisk Health, so we do get a little bit of efficiency there. Much more importantly, we\u2019re more coherent in front of the customers, and that\u2019s the primary reason we did it.","The longer-term drive to efficiency post-acquisition has to do with the creation of this unified platform that I mentioned earlier which will allow us to essentially have one definition of data regardless of which of our solution sets we\u2019re talking about, and so the creation of our data assets, the warehousing of the data, and the use of the data inside of the analytic engines, all of that will respond positively and become more efficient as we get that put in place. And I think I mentioned earlier that, the creation of the unified platform is a 2012-2013 initiative.","Frank Coyne","It is often the case when we do these acquisitions that we see opportunities to invest in these companies once we own them for them to realize their full potential. So it could take a while depending on the particular acquisitions to start achieving the scale that we see in the acquisition when we buy it.","Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","And then just finally on cash flow conversion, the year was below your usual range, you did some technology upgrade in the CapEx related acquisitions, you talked about continued investment. Where do you expect that range to be for 2012?","Mark Anquillare","Let me just give a little bit of a clarification, and I agree to your point, the first is that, from an operating cash flow perspective we delivered about 12% or less than 12% from an operating cash flow. Remember the pension works against us. We've been funding the pension, and that increase probably hurt us and in fact that out would be a little less than 14%.","So going forward, I don\u2019t think we've anything that would preclude us from thinking differently about kind of that operating cash flow. I think what has happened, we gave you some guidance as to what we think CapEx would be in 2012, which was $75 million that in our K.","Other point I want to make, as you think about all this, we\u2019ve talked about funding some of the or I guess accelerate funding, some of the liabilities inside the pension to the extent that we did that, it would be kind of a one time hit to operating cash flow the way it works, but then that would be behind us. We think it\u2019s a thoughtful and good investment. So that is the one exception there or one item I want to just call out for 2012.","Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Next question comes from Bill Warmington from Raymond James.","William Warmington - Raymond James","Good morning and congratulations on a strong quarter.","Frank Coyne","Well, thank you.","William Warmington - Raymond James","It seems that insurance companies are becoming increasingly concerned about renewals and their property insurance books, because the market value is below replacement value for some of the properties and the velocity that new sales is down so much. I want to ask, how that \u2013 what opportunity that presents for you guys?","Frank Coyne","Well, one of the opportunities it presents is that, our 360 value tool, you the concern is getting insurance to value and which is totally different than market value.","William Warmington - Raymond James","Right.","Frank Coyne","So, the use of our 360 value tool is very important and useful to these companies as they\u2019re trying to distinguish between those two issues and make sure that they\u2019re getting the proper, what\u2019s called coverage A amount. So we think it just opens up an opportunity for us to, well further penetrating in that area.","William Warmington - Raymond James","Okay. And Mark, you mentioned the guidance on the $75 million for CapEx for 2012. I just wanted to ask what you -- when you look at that as a percentage of revenue, what parameters you\u2019re thinking of? It\u2019s been moving up, and I wanted to know if that\u2019s a short-term phenomenon or whether that\u2019s going to be kind of the level, about 5% of revenue going forward?","Mark Anquillare","Well, I think what we have seen is in 2011 we did do some periodic upgrades to our computing platform both here and in Salt Lake City area. So those are two items I\u2019d guess primarily because of the volume and the growth and exact where that\u2019s probably ongoing, the Jersey City was periodic which is kind of a one-time.","Other point I'll make is, Scott, talked about the unified platform and some of the things we\u2019re doing to kind of bring these things together, and to bring those things together it does cost us some money. So I think 2011 was for the most part, a little higher than the norm, and $75 million I think is kind of more inline with, just kind of moderate growth. So I hope that\u2019s clear enough, but I\u2019m just not going to comment on this.","William Warmington - Raymond James","All right. One more question for you is, I just wanted to ask how the M&A pipeline was looking. You guys had been sort of quiet in that front.","Frank Coyne","Quiet on -- perhaps quiet on finalizing, but not \u2026","William Warmington - Raymond James","On public \u2013 exactly, your public announcements, right?","Frank Coyne","Yeah, not quiet on our activity and evaluation of opportunities and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s an ongoing process.","William Warmington - Raymond James","Okay, excellent. Thank you very much.","Frank Coyne","Yes, sir.","Operator","Next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc","Hi, good morning. Nice quarter guys. Healthcare within DA was clearly a bright spot in the second-half of the year, and it seems like you reached a tipping point either in the delivery of your products, introduction of products, customer uptake, maybe some combination there of. Can you just talk about sort of the steepness of the curve as we go into to \u201912 recognizing as you said, Mark that it\u2019s kind of going to be more back-half weighted. I mean, did we see sort of the kink in the curve in the second-half of \u201912 and we\u2019re at a sustained or \u201911, we\u2019re at a sustainable level or does that trajectory or the slope of that curve remain pretty steep as we go into \u201912?","Mark Anquillare","Let me open it, and maybe, I\u2019ll let Scott flip. Let\u2019s focus separate from the acquisition, just focus on the organic growth. I think \u2026","Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc","Right, that\u2019s what I\u2019m referring to in particular.","Mark Anquillare",".. we\u2019ve been talking about the fact that we were signing contracts and that was about implementation. We saw 25% organic growth in 2Q. We saw 30% organic growth in 4Q. So it has been the implementation and sales that had been realized. Now I would not keep that curve growing like you would, but I think it is sustainable and its good news. This is just kind of an opening.","Scott Stephenson","Right. I mean, rate of customer adoption is something that we live and die with every day and our customers are sophisticated and they go through long evaluations of our solutions, but \u2013 sort of the context here is that, if we were to fully penetrate our \u2013 and we\u2019ll talk about this more in Investor Day. We were to fully penetrate our existing customer base with all of the solutions that we got in the healthcare universe, is that represents multiples of our current run rate revenue.","So it\u2019s really on us to present our solutions and help the customers, find a value and then be efficient in getting them implemented. But in general, we\u2019re still essentially in the same position we were later half of 2011, in terms of the amount of opportunity we\u2019ve got relative to the book of business we currently got.","Mark Anquillare","And just to cap that point, the fact that and we do add any acquisitions, the HRT nature of the business is all that were back-end loaded, we talked about 70% of that revenue being moved towards third and fourth quarters as opposed to first and second. So that\u2019s the next layer of healthcare modeling they need to do, so I just want to make sure we\u2019re clear there.","Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc","Right, right. Now that\u2019s helpful. And then with regard to the insurance solutions cross-sell where you\u2019re clearly also enjoying success. Was there, -- should we think about an acceleration in momentum in the back-half or is that, and something that can carry on into \u201912 or is that more of just steady grind-out the cross-sell and sustain above average or above company average organic revenue growth in DA as a consequence. I am just wondering if we reach a similar kind of tipping point insurance or if that\u2019s less -- looks less like healthcare?","Frank Coyne","I don\u2019t think we see it as a tipping point. There are good things happening inside of the business. We referenced earlier that the catastrophe modeling category has been performing strongly for us. In our view that\u2019s basically the market responding to the depth and quality of the science that we've been bringing to this marketplace forever basically.","We've always felt that our science was distinctive. We seem to have come to a moment in the marketplace where the customers are even more aware of that and maybe more waiting their buying decisions according to that. And then we have referenced, we continue to reference the fact that some of what we do in the DA side of insurance is related to climate conditions, and 2011 was pretty robust in terms of not mega catastrophes, but a lot of storm activity that just raised the demand for some of the estimating that \u2013 as [estimatics] that we provide.","So, there were some factors that work in 2011 that we see as much more sort of we\u2019re building strength for the long time and we think that the strength is being recognized, but to call it a tipping point, I think with over \u2013 sort of overstate what happened in the latter half of 2011.","Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc","Okay, let\u2019s not hope for too many mega catastrophes, right?","Frank J. Coyne","Yeah.","Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc","And then one last one if I might, again, just to drill down and make sure I understand, in the DA margin you\u2019ve three quarters in a row north of 40%, are the investments you\u2019re making in \u201912, will they be expensed, should we think about that 40% level is maybe the right long-term margin, but in the short-term look for it to potentially come down a little bit?","Mark Anquillare","So, let me take that for you, so two things. First of all, our investments primarily kind of focused on Decision Analytics is in people. Some times it kind of gets into hardware and software for the most its people. A majority of that people cost is expensed inside of our P&L. So, there is a piece of that that you\u2019re already seeing in the margins, and as we continue to ramp that investment, yeah, that will kind of have an offset. The other part of that is in CapEx, okay? So as you think about CapEx, you\u2019re seeing that number go up, that\u2019s capitalized in terms of software. So I think in most of our businesses, you\u2019re going to see kind of a consistency to the margins offset by what is happening in mortgage and probably some margin erosion there.","Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Meltz from JPMorgan.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JPMorgan","Yeah, thank you. Three questions, Mark, just \u2013 can you just tell us simply margin was 44.4% in \u201911, do you expect it flat, up or down in \u201912, please? And then I\u2019ve two follow-ups.","Mark Anquillare","I think we feel that we\u2019re going to continue to drive strong margins. I think we feel that we\u2019re going to continue to drive earnings as we\u2019ve faster than top-line growth and all of that factors into how much investment and what kind of acquisition happens. So, our people feel comfortable at where we\u2019re. I feel we\u2019ve demonstrated somewhat nice operating leverage and margin improvement over time. And I think we\u2019re on path to continue to execute.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JPMorgan","And then you grew, organic growth was 7.6% in the second half and for the full-year, as you look to \u201912, given all the moving pieces, where are you \u2013 how should we think about organic growth relative to that rate? I know there is only a tail of the acquisition; potentially all are mostly organic anyway.","Mark Anquillare","Well, as I say, we don\u2019t typically give a lot of specificity. I think we feel good with our business. I think -- we think we\u2019re feeling good about the margin we\u2019ve seen -- the organic growth that we delivered over the course of the 2011, I think there is some strength there offset by some unknowns with regard to mortgage. And that\u2019s the one thing that probably is a little bit more difficult to predict.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JPMorgan","And then on mortgage, are you at a point where mortgage \u2013 or when do you get to a point where mortgage is evaluated as a divestiture candidate?","Scott Stephenson","Well, our first priority is to take the fine assets that we\u2019ve got and try to make some as market-ready and valuable to our customers as we possibly can. And that\u2019s the focal point.","Frank Coyne","Yeah, Michael, as we observed in some of our remarks, we\u2019re and have been working to maximize the capabilities we\u2019ve within mortgage, not just for our mortgage customers, but for a broader sect section of the financial services industry. So we think we\u2019ve got valuable assets there that have potential.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Frank Coyne","Yes, sir.","Operator","Next question comes from Suzy Stein from Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley","Hi. In the specialized markets business, you noted that government budget delay is affected Q4. Should we expect that to reverse in Q1 or are the delays continuing?","Mark Anquillare","Suzy, this is Mark. The budgetary delays I think have been generally worked out. It was kind of more of a \u2013 towards the end of second quarter into third and a little bit into October. So I think we\u2019ve worked through those now.","Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And I know the risk assessment business is sensitive to the P&C cycle, but how sensitive is the insurance piece of Decision Analytics, would you expect a substantial pickup in new business as the cycle improves?","Scott Stephenson","It\u2019s not as sensitive. The general climate of the industry certainly sort of conditions customers to \u2013 and their willingness to make investments in new solutions, but if there is not the same direct link as that there is end of the pricing mechanism, that\u2019s a part of risk assessment.","Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley","And then, can you just address your plans for hiring in 2012?","Scott Stephenson","Yeah, kind of steady as it goes, I mean basically inline with the growth that we see in the business. I mean we\u2019re pursuing the same business model, which is a highly leveraged approach where we\u2019re creating industry standard solutions and selling them hopefully many, many times.","So, we\u2019re extremely alert to how much we\u2019re adding to our team and the places where there will be growth -- will essentially be inline with where the growth in the revenue is going to occur. But I mean there is nothing fundamentally changing inside of our business model.","Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Flynn from Credit Suisse.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse Group","Thanks for taking my question. I just have a couple, so, I\u2019m just trying to figure out how optimistic we should be that risk assessment growth will accelerate in fiscal \u201912 due to the improvements in P&C premiums? I recognize that your pricing changes depending upon what goes on with premiums. So, if industry standard did 4.9% growth, which is pretty decent this quarter. So in what type of growth can the subscription portion of risk assessment put up in fiscal \u201912 as it benefits from P&C premiums improving?","Mark Anquillare","Kelly, let me first just make sure, I remind everybody of the timing. I think what we started to see towards the end of 2010, but really in 2011, that\u2019s were some hardening of the market happens. So some prices started to increase and hopefully the premium had an increase in \u201911. Those \u201911 changes won\u2019t affect us until 2013. It\u2019s basically a bit of a two-year lag. So in 2010, industry premium was still negative, better than, but still negative. So I think what we\u2019ve always tried to do is, is try to keep things more moderated with regard to increases because we\u2019re sensitive to customer needs and we also want to make sure that we\u2019re first and foremost, they thinking about us for buying other products. So \u201910 was not a great year from an industry standard and from a premium perspective in the industry. It will be really \u201911 which will have kind of future benefits for us.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse Group","Okay. But I guess, what I\u2019m getting at is, I mean, 5% growth for industry standard is pretty good growth. Its \u2013 and it\u2019s not that different from your historical norm. So, I mean, as the market \u2013 as you start to benefit from the hardening of the market, lets say, potentially in fiscal \u201913, do you expect that to be more or like high single digit growth or will kind of your pricing decisions to offset that, and that will continue to be mid single?","Mark Anquillare","I think historically our pricing decisions has moderated some of that.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse Group","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then just a second question, I know Michael Meltz asked about organic growth for fiscal \u201912, and you didn\u2019t get into a lot of detail, but I mean last quarter you made a very helpful comment about Q4 organic growth expectation. So I was wondering can you at least talk about Q1 organic growth, I mean, if we ex-out mortgage, do you think something similar to the 9.6% is what we should be thinking about or there are some incrementals that could weigh on growth a bit versus Q4?","Mark Anquillare","Kelly, I\u2019d love to answer your question, but I mean we really do try to think more a long-term than we do next quarter. So, I think we feel good about where our business is, I think we feel that we have the right type of momentum and its not I\u2019m not answering, but I hope you respect that our view and our vantage point is what\u2019s really create the value long-term and that\u2019s we preferred to follow.","Scott Stephenson","I\u2019ll just add that in the external environment there is nothing that\u2019s moving around that would cause us to think differently about our business or our opportunity.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse Group","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Next question comes from Robert Riggs from William Blair.","Robert Riggs - William Blair & Company, LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to Mark\u2019s comment about the international expansion. I know there are certain things you do, for example, like healthcare that are little tougher that translates into international markets, but it would seem like supply chain would be something that on a global basis would fit pretty well, is that kind of a key element of growing the international part of the business or are there other things that we should kind of keep an eye on?","Frank Coyne","Yeah, that\u2019s a good question. And you started out in the right place also. Supply chain is just born as a global business, and even today, a fair fraction of what we do in the environmental health and safety space inside of the supply chain is non-domestic.","And we do have focus on that. We\u2019ve made some changes in terms of our go-to-market strategy in Europe and Asia in that part of our business. So, yes, that is a focal point. Its hard work, but we\u2019re up for it.","There are two other parts of our business that I\u2019d point to, one is the catastrophe modeling discipline is also by its very nature global. One big customer said, is the global reinsurers, they\u2019re thinking about apparels anywhere that there are assets that have risk, and in fact one of the things that we\u2019re looking to do is to leverage some of the business development resources that have sort of growing up inside of our catastrophe business, but perhaps can represent other parts of our product mix.","And then thirdly, while sort of the idiosyncratic nature of markets means that some of what we do doesn\u2019t travel all that well across national boundaries. It\u2019s more of a case that the claim is a claim and so, some of our businesses which are claims-oriented, I think for example, the [estimatics] business, we actually have plans of the flag over in Europe and we\u2019re looking for opportunities to spread that out.","So, we\u2019ve a lot of attention on it. I think that the amount of energy that we\u2019re going to put into it is probably going to exceed the rate at which it shows up in the P&L for some time because it\u2019s just that -- it\u2019s a long development sort of an activity, but we\u2019re purposeful about the overseas markets.","Robert Riggs - William Blair & Company, LLC","Great. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up on cross-sell in healthcare, it\u2019s got in the path, I think you\u2019ve broken out the solutions across the buckets around population management and performance measurement and then kind of compliance and payment integrity. But also know that you kind of compete with different players in each one of those buckets. As you get some scale in bulk of all three of those capabilities do you get a competitive advantage by offering your clients kind of a comprehensive solution that will enable cross-sell or there are other things as the unified platform, is that kind of key to the cross sum?","Scott Stephenson","Yeah, again a very fine question. So just a couple of things one is, each of the solutions needs to be excellent on its own and we give that a lot of attention. And the performance and the results that you\u2019re seeing are primarily a product of each of the solution sets being on their own highly valuable and very competitive against other offerings. But that said, yes, we do get advantage as we penetrate more broadly. I mentioned before a unified account management approach which definitely is meaningful in front of the largest accounts. And then again I\u2019d point back to the unified platform which we really do believe will make us unique in the sense that the vision is once you are using one of our products since the underlying data infrastructure is common across all the solutions, it\u2019s relatively easy for a customer to then turn on the next solution. And we do believe that that capability will make us unique. So it\u2019s a great question and so in the near-term, yes, the whole is greater than some of the parts, I think particularly as it relates to facing off with the customers and in the long-term we can stream together more of the intellectual property assets to be flexible and more inventive.","Robert Riggs - William Blair & Company, LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie. Mr. McVeigh, your line is open.","Kevin McVeigh \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","I apologize. I wonder if you could just give us a sense with the economy firm in a little bit. Does it change kind of the multiples you\u2019re thinking about in terms of acquisitions, in terms of what people are looking versus what you are willing to pay, how we should think about that on a go-forward basis?","Scott Stephenson","Yeah, it doesn\u2019t change our method for assessing acquisitions one bit. We are using exactly the same methodologies that we\u2019ve used in the past. And what \u2013 and actually what we start with and we\u2019ve mentioned in the past that we really are very disciplined on the acquisition side. The stream of opportunities that we assess versus the ones that we ultimately execute against is \u2013 the first is much larger than the second and that\u2019s always been the case. In the current environment I\u2019d say that probably marginally sellers are a little more inclined to perhaps going to processes. But it\u2019s not really very different than it has been over the last several years, and in any of that we are not -- we are not referencing the macro environment when we are thinking about what it is that we are looking to do which is to derive from our strategy or what we are willing to pay which is really related to our evaluation methodologies. None of the -- none of the assumptions, none of the parameters inside of our models have changed, and I don\u2019t believe they will.","Kevin McVeigh \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","That\u2019s helpful. And then is there a way to quantify what the impact of the acquisitions on an overall margin basis will be in 2012? As we think --.","Mark Anquillare","The ones that we\u2019ve already done?","Kevin McVeigh \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Yes.","Mark Anquillare","I don\u2019t think you will see comparing \u201912 to \u201911 I don\u2019t think there is any adjustments that need to be made. I think we just simply roll forward and we are normalized on a go-forward basis. That may answer your question properly.","Kevin McVeigh \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Bill Clark from KBW.","William Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc","Hi there. The color on seasonality in HRP revenues was helpful. Just as far as in annual run rate at the time of the acquisition you talked about 15 million to 20 million number for that business in 2010. Could you just give an idea if we\u2019re still in that range or 2011 was significantly above that?","Mark Anquillare","Well, not substantially. But we did experience like we expected growth there, so which was reasonably strong growth, nothing outrageous. And I think then take about 70% of that and allocated towards the latter half of the year.","William Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc","Okay, great. Thank you.","Mark Anquillare","Sure.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Frank Coyne","All right. Well, thank you very much.

Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered solid overall results with total revenue growth of about 16%, adjusted EBITDA growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 1.4% including the impact of the shares we issued last year for the Wood Mac transaction.","Year to date free cash flow is up 21%. Organic revenue growth was 5.4% as we continue to grow faster than our underlying end markets. We've spoken of higher longer term organic growth, and the underlying trends remain encouraging. Profitability remains strong with total EBITDA margins over 49%.","We're focused on leveraging our Verisk distinctives which are, one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows and our core capabilities to add value for our customers and in turn for our shareholders. We're also seeing traction in new solutions that are being developed and continue to be optimistic about their long-term potential to contribute to customers and ultimately our financial performance.","As we announced in June, I'm excited to have expanded the roles of several members of our senior leadership team. Mark Anquillare, who had been our CFO since before our 2009 IPO, is now Verisk's Chief Operating Officer with responsibility for our insurance businesses and our technology and customer experience organizations.","Eva Huston is now our Chief Financial Officer responsible for financial strategy, including accounting, tax, treasury and investor relations. I'm also pleased to have appointed Nana Banerjee and Steve Halliday as group presidents. Nana leads Argus, Geomni and Verisk Retail. Steve leads Wood Mackenzie, 3E Company and Verisk Maplecroft.","The strength of our platform and the clarity of our vision, combined with greater scope of responsibility for these four proven professionals, will support our growth agenda and global push into the near and long term. These are all natural evolutions from their previous roles and will help us continue to deliver value to our customers, employees and shareholders.","During the quarter, we closed the sale of the healthcare business and used the proceeds to pay down our revolver, giving us plenty of capacity to support our long stated capital allocation strategy for a balanced approach over time to acquisitions and repurchases.","We had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of June 30, 2016. We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions, in particular as we make buy versus build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion. We also see M&A as a channel for expanding our solution footprint. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, you saw that we purchased Greentech Media, an industry leading information services provider for next-generation electricity and renewable sectors.","Greentech Media joins Wood Mac, enhancing our research and other capabilities for subsectors, including solar generation, energy storage and smart grids that react dynamically to changes in supply and demand. These are very exciting areas in the energy and power markets and an excellent complement to our outstanding oil and gas franchise.","I remain encouraged by the opportunities we see for growth both near and long term. We're excited about a number of early stage efforts where we are developing new and innovative solutions for our customers and where we are expanding existing solutions around the world. Near term, we continue to expect acceleration of our combined insurance businesses and double digit growth at Argus. Wood Mac is performing in line with the expectations we discussed with you last quarter.","So, with that, let me turn it over to Mark for some additional comments.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Scott. Across our businesses which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we have seen several key industry themes including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I will briefly describe a number of positive recent developments in our businesses.","Reflecting on all three themes, Verisk Insurance Solutions launched a new integration option for 360Value, our web based replacement cost estimator for homeowner's insurance. 360Value is built on our unique and industry standard construction materials and labor cost data. This solution helps our customers estimate coverage limits for residential, commercial and agricultural properties. Our customers can now integrate 360Value directly into their online homeowners quoting platforms. This helps the industry deploy more engaging solutions which include pre-filling and online insurance application with property-specific information when a homeowner enters an address.","Another recent launch is Mozart, a new product development platform increasing engagement in automation which helps our clients to easily research, create and distribute coverage language, providing efficiencies in time-to-market from new products and critical coverage updates. Mozart will help our customers accelerate profitable growth, reduce expense ratios and enhance audit and compliance.","Leveraging big data methods, cutting edge technology and pioneering automation, AIR released a hosted cloud solution for its catastrophe risk management platforms, Touchstone and CATRADER. More than a dozen companies are already up and running on the AIR cloud, which enables them to conduct all of their analyses remotely while minimizing capital expenditures.","Finally, in addition to the new deployment option, AIR recently expanded its coverage model of Southeast Asia. These models combine 10 years of extensive scientific research by AIR scientists with findings from studies of local building codes, damage surveys, lost experience data and structural engineering research.","With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results in more detail.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Mark. In the second quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth going forward. Revenue grew 16.3% and 5.4% organically. EBITDA grew 12.4% to $245 million. EBITDA margins were 49.2% in the quarter. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 23.5% and 5.5% organically.","Financial services was the fastest-growing organic revenue end market while insurance focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to growth. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 6.2% in the second quarter. The increase was led by strong growth in loss quantification and claims analytics solutions. Underwriting solutions also grew in the quarter. Our catastrophe modeling solutions saw a modest decline versus the prior year as a result of lower cat bond issuance and consulting revenues. Customer retention remains very high, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth.","Financial services revenue returned to strong growth, up 15.9% in the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the contributions from the media effectiveness solutions, which grew very well in the quarter. Our international revenue continues to grow nicely here as well, which does mean that FX may influence the reported results throughout the rest of the year. As Scott noted, we remain comfortable with double digit growth based on accelerating growth in the second half of the year.","Energy and specialized markets revenue grew 70.4% including Wood Mac, which was acquired in May 2015. In this year's second quarter, Wood Mac revenue was around flat on a constant currency basis. The decline in the British pound late in Q2 will have a larger effect on reported results starting in Q3 as the average Q2 rate was $1.43 and is currently in the low $1.30s. Organic revenue excluding Wood Mac, PCI and Infield declined $2.4 million in the quarter.","Services revenue peaked in the prior year as customers met 2015 compliance deadlines. We are also transitioning to a subscription revenue model, which is better for Verisk and better for our customers over the long term. The dollar impact remains small in relation to Verisk as a whole. Finally as a reminder, Wood Mac is organic starting in Q3.","Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.5% and 5.3% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Additionally, contributions of new solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland, which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions Ireland, added growth.","Industry standard insurance programs revenue grew 6.0%, reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 3.8% in the quarter. Growth was led by an increase in commercial underwriting solutions subscription revenue.","EBITDA increased 12.4% in the quarter to $245 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 49.2%. Decision Analytics EBITDA increased 20.8% to $141 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions and growth in our existing businesses.","EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 2.9% to $105 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, offset in part by talent realignment initiatives we have been discussing with you. This resulted in moderated margins versus Q1 as the hiring started to take effect, as well as the impact of our annual merit increases. We are very excited about the additions we've made to the team, and we look forward to their contributions over time.","Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at June 30, 2016, after our repayments facilitated by cash flow generation and the proceeds from the sale of the healthcare business. Our leverage at the end of the second quarter was about 2.2 times pro forma for the healthcare divestiture, and we are pleased to have reached our target ahead of plan. We appreciate the support and confidence of our debt holders as we acquired Wood Mac with the goal of returning to the 2.5 times steady-state leverage. Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.5%.","Adjusted net income in 2Q increased 3.7% to $124 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.73 in the quarter, an increase of 1.4%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations both organic and acquired and lower interest expense. The increases were partially offset by higher fixed asset depreciation and amortization, only a partial quarter of Wood Mac ownership in the prior period and an increase in shares outstanding related to the 2015 acquisition of Wood Mac. We expect that our adjusted EPS growth will normalize over time to reflect similar trends you see in our underlying business results.","The average diluted share count was 171.2 million shares in the quarter. And on June 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171.4 million shares. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter as we continue to balance our appetite for share repurchase with our desire to maintain flexibility for M&A. At June 30, 2016, we had about $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital.","Free cash flow increased 21.1% for the six month period to $305 million including Wood Mac. This represented 61.9% of EBITDA. These numbers are all for continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of Wood Mac.","Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and therefore shareholder value. Capital expenditures increased 4.6% to $52 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2016, due to the inclusion of Wood Mac's CapEx for the full quarter.","CapEx was 5.2% of revenue. We expect CapEx for the full year to be $150 million to $155 million pro forma for the divestiture of the healthcare business. We continue to manage our capital intensity to enable free cash flow growth.","As you think about your models for 2016 on a continuing operations basis, we expect that based on current FX rates, there's about a $25 million impact to full year revenue relative to where rates were at the start of 2016. This is up from our estimate last quarter of a $10 million impact. FX is a new factor as you think about our future growth, and we will look to provide more insight going forward to help you include it in your forecasting.","As you think about Q3, keep in mind that last year, EBITDA included a $15.6 million warrant sale gain which will not recur this year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a one-time P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a nonrecurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO which will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability, and we just want it to be on your radar ahead of time.","For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of $150 million to $155 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $132 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. We know these are items that are hard to project, which is why we share them with you each quarter.","Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense after paying down the revolver with the divestiture proceeds to be around $120 million. We estimate the tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 33%. For the intangible and amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rate that's applicable to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases.","Overall, we are working hard to execute on our 2016 plan and remain excited about the go-forward financial profile of the company. We're well positioned for profitable growth in the future and have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for continued long-term growth. We continue to appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up.","And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. First, I wanted to ask about the cat modeling business. I guess, one, can you give us any sense in terms of the magnitude of the impact from the consulting and cat bonds or I guess how big those are relative to the size of the cat modeling business? And just trying to get a sense of the underlying trend in that cat modeling business versus the trends you have been seeing.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Great. Hey, Tim. It's Eva. Thanks for the question. Maybe just starting at a high level, cat bonds and consulting are less than 5% of overall Decision Analytics insurance revenue. Obviously for AIR, those would be a greater percentage. But if you were to peel back the onion and look at AIR's performance, the underlying subscription business is performing very well. We're very happy with our position in the market. And with regards to cat bonds, we continue to win and we have strong market share. There's just some variability that can happen across periods in some of those revenues that are non-subscription.","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then the comment about accelerating growth in the insurance vertical this year, it seems to imply you would need pretty strong performance in the second half of the year. I guess, can you just tell us, make sure I guess, tell us what you are assuming there? And I guess, just to be clear, is that I guess inclusive or exclusive of the kind of true-up revenue that you had in the first quarter?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Scott, here. We'll come back to that true-up question. But the way that we observe our business, Tim, it's always really going through pipelines and conversion rates on renewal opportunities or new business opportunities. So, it's very much a bottoms-up view.","If I look across the insurance vertical, it's pretty broadly based in terms of our expectations for the latter half of the year. I wouldn't say that any one theme really stands out. We called out that in this quarter some of the transaction based business around the cat modeling space were soft. But overall, as we look at the latter half of 2016, it's really pretty broadly based across claims, underwriting, industry standard solutions and catastrophe modeling.","One perspective I thought I might just add here is, if you just think about the kind of the world in which Verisk sits at the moment, and you think about really exogenous factors, there's really three things that are kind of out there that are just sort of bubbling at the moment, probably in order of importance when you think about Verisk outcomes overall.","One would be that our customers in the oil and gas industry are under a lot of pressure at the moment because of where the commodity stands. We think that that's a moment-in-time effect. We don't predict the oil price, but we expect a more normalized environment.","The second is that there hasn't been a lot of extreme event activity over the last couple of years and that really tends to have two effects. Now I'm in the insurance vertical. That tends to have two effects. One is the reinsurance world has softened. The pricing has softened, and there has been some consolidation, and so that works its way in little bit. And then cat bond issuance has actually responded to that as well, the lack of extreme events. And as Eva said, we continue to get the overwhelming share of the cat bond activity. It's just that the absolute volumes have turned down there.","We get asked a lot, by the way, whether overall premium progression in the insurance industry tends to affect us, and the answer is basically no because of the way that we contract with our customers. But when there is a sustained period of less extreme events activity, it actually it shows up a little bit because the underlying markets respond to that. And also, a few of the things that we do like repair cost estimating, there is an element of it which responds to the absolute number of claims. And when you have extreme events, you have more claims.","And then the third thing is, as Eva was pointing out in 2015, a lot of our environmental health and safety customers needed to really scramble to make sure that they were compliant with regulations that required compliance by the end of 2015. So, there was a bit of surge of work in that regard.","So you have kind of a moment-in-time effect which is that was kind of powering the business up to 2015. That is also a part of the business where when you look at subscription-based revenues, we're actually happy with what's happening.","So, I just thought I would throw out that perspective overall in the sense that, on the one hand, I don't really think our business is that affected by what's happening in the outside world, but it's not as if we're totally immune. And probably, all the dials are pointed in the wrong direction just at this moment, and yet the performance of our company is good. I'm really happy with it. So then, Mark, did you want to just take on the?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer","So, just to kind of follow up on the question you had from a DA perspective, that growth would be with and without the true-up adjustment. Just to kind of reiterate Scott said, I mean we're feeling pretty good and confident because of what I refer to as contracts that are signed and waiting for implementation, so those do kick in in the second half.","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","In Wood Mac, so good to see that the trend was largely as you expected. Any reason to think that that changes in one direction or another in the back half of the year based on what you're seeing from client demand?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. No. The retention rates on the subscription based part of the business remain very strong. And actually, the services side of the business actually had some very nice wins in the last couple of months. So no, we don't anticipate any changes.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And then turning to margins, as we think about margin trends for the two segments, you had talked before about plans for increased hiring in Risk Assessment and it looks like we saw that come through in this quarter. Are we now at a stable run rate for cost in that segment or is there further ramp in the cost base to come? And if you could help us think about various factors impacting the margin trends for Decision Analytics in the back half of the year as well, that would be great. Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So let me just make a general comment and then, Eva, maybe you want to take it on a little more specifically. One of the decisions that you get to make when you are in the position we are of leading a company like Verisk is, when you're aware of kind of the macro environment and modest waxing and waning in terms of revenues in any particular moment, the question you get to ask yourself is what is your confidence in the business. Are you going to continue to invest? And we're very confident in this business. And so we have continued to invest knowing that at this moment in time, we have the kinds of just macro factors that I talked about before.","Specifically with respect to ISO solutions, we are very interested in amplifying what it is that we do there. And so the kind of talent that we brought in with respect to topics like \u2013 and all of these relate to the insurance world, cyber, Internet of Things, the linkage between the energy ecosystem and the insurance world, et cetera \u2013 we've really created a substantially new talent base that we just didn't have before. Also resilience issues as they relate to extreme events, and I could go on.","We're excited to have this new talents inside of the organization. And so our judgment is that the best thing to do is to keep investing inside of our company and to do it on a consistent sort of a basis, which is where we are right at the moment. Did you want to add anything to that, Eva?","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah so, Sara, just to take on your specific questions around margin, I mean I think Scott's elaborated on the talent realignment, and there is impact there as well. Don't lose sight of our usual annual merit increases that go in in the second quarter, a common occurrence and does have impact on margin in 2Q. I think if you look back historically, you would see that as well.","With regards to Decision Analytics, one, I would just point out that the non-subs revenue that we've been talking about a bit, actually unlike some of the historical transactional revenue that we used to have in businesses we no longer own, that's actually pretty high margin business. And so when we don't have that come through, that can have some impact on the margin in the moment. I would also point out to you, I mentioned in my comments FX, and FX can have some impact on margin as well. Revenue and expense, we try to have those mostly aligned, but they're not always perfectly aligned.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Scott, I definitely heard the second half acceleration for insurance which is expected. I just wanted to know quantitatively if we're still looking for Verisk to see each RA and DA insurance accelerate for the full year 2016 from the 2015 rates which were 6% and 8%.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Most of the lift in terms of the growth rate is going to come on the DA side.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I appreciate you taking my question. Hey. Mark, the color on some of those new products is helpful. I wonder if you can elaborate again as a follow-up to Andrew Steinerman's question, specifically within DA, is do we see some of those new products making a meaningful contribution in the back half or is this sort of just the natural motion of continued share gain and pricing to value and so forth?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer","So, the short answer is I think these will become more meaningful as we think about 2017 and beyond. But as I highlighted, we have some AIR customers that are on the cloud and moving quickly. So it does help 2016 back half, but I would think these are a little bit more longer term in the way I think and outline the business for the future.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And are there any other callouts? I know underwriting is sort of one of your burgeoning areas, or is as you indicated in the second quarter, the growth sort of pretty evenly distributed across your solution sets? And again, I'm thinking about insurance DA.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer","Once again I'll just, I'll echo Scott. I mean it's broad-based. I think we feel good about most areas of the business with regard to growth in the second half relative to the first. And there's a couple areas where we actually are having customers transition to our solutions. And that just sometimes takes a little more time than you anticipate, whether it's volumes coming through or the volumes you expect coming through. Although you have signed contracts that you know there's a commitment over time, we want to go as fast as we can, and we have to work with our customers to do that.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, so maybe a little bit of timing to consider in the second quarter too then?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer","All true.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani from KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Just to start off. In terms of Wood Mac, I know in the past you talked about how you thought it was undersold. I was just wondering if you have any updates there on progress you've made on that front.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah so, the sort of the selling of Wood Mac really you can think of it as being in two different buckets. So one of those is to cross-sell and up-sell inside of our existing customer set which is order of magnitude 1,000 customers. And we give a lot of attention to whether we're right-sized there. Obviously, we're trying to pick our spots at the moment because of just the overall environment. But that is a team that is strong and getting stronger. We actually have new leadership of the sales team there and very excited about Lynda's leadership for us.","And then secondly, there is how do we go from 1,000 to say 5,000 or more kinds of customers. And that in part hinges upon opening up new channels for distributing our content. And we have one new such relationship in place and are working hard to get others in place. So, I think that it's a good feeling into the future and kind of there are some early shoots with respect to these new channels.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you for that. And I guess next question is kind of staying on the Wood Mac topic. Just given that I guess last year in the second of half of the year was when Wood Mac started to become sort of challenging, and given that earlier in this call, you mentioned that even on the services side, you're starting to see more of a pick-up. Is there any reason not to expect there to be positive momentum in the second half of the year given those dynamics?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're sticking by what we said before which is our view of 2016 overall is essentially flat relative to 2015 and there are puts and takes with respect to the different lines of business that Wood Mac does. And then of course, there's always the X factor of just the macro environment overall. And so we're pretty comfortable with where we're at. But I would like to say as I said also last quarter, I think the performance of our Wood Mac colleagues is absolutely outstanding in light of something which is tsunami-like inside of their end market. I mean, I think the quality of what Wood Mac does and the depth of relationship with customers is actually demonstrated so strongly in this moment actually. So we expect a normalized environment. We want our customers to feel less pressured than they do today, and when they do, I'm absolutely certainly that it will be reflected in our performance.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks very much for the answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning. Can you just give us an update on where you are in terms of aerial imagery image capture as well as productizing the broader aerial imagery capabilities?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, one of our favorite topics. So we have at the moment basically two different ways that we give ourselves access to images today. One is our own efforts to source images and the other is working with third parties who have been sourcing images for their own purposes. That mix I would say is working, and has helped us to take all of the great image analytics technology that we've got and basically make that more active, particularly in the insurance vertical today. That's really where it's happening today. And we continue to ask questions about how we can be more in control of a larger set of images that are optimized for the use cases that we have in mind and we're working actively on that right now. So the report, Jeff, would be that commercially we're succeeding with what we're doing in the imaging space and we continue to think deeply about additional things that would help us to be more in control of a larger set of images.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","When you say commercially succeeding, do you have the image library and gathering apparatus necessary that you're at the point where you're productizing and selling to clients?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Correct.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then, just maybe a comment on the Wood Mac M&A pipeline. There's been a few smaller deals, so I guess just any comment on how much of the activity is you putting more capital behind Wood Mac than they were getting under their prior ownership. How much is it more opportunity in the market because of what's going on in the end market? And then just any, what's your appetite for a potentially larger deal for Wood Mac?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah. So, let me just step through to that real quick. So, part of what we've done on the M&A front has been what I would consider to be small and tuck-in and really about trying to give ourselves additional distinctive data assets. That for example was the Infield acquisition. So that's sort of point one. The second point I would make is that we're very excited about Greentech Media because of the depth of expertise there with respect to solar and smart grids and grid edge technologies and storage technologies.","And what we're finding is that our existing hydrocarbon-based customers are increasingly interested in the alternatives. And so, not only is it in a sense new business for us, the degree to which we're now looking specifically at the dynamics of what's going on in solar generation, specifically in terms of what's going on with respect to grid edge effects, not only is it new business, but it also actually makes us a more compelling partner for our existing customers in the hydrocarbon ecosystem. So, we are really excited about it. We think that it's really going to be helpful.","And then I think overall, you were just kind of looking for what's the forward profile. Well, I'd make a couple comments. One is, there have been some very large trades in the oil and gas space. And we didn't participate as you saw. And we continue to ask questions about what strategically would advantage this business the most. But we're certainly not enamored of the thought of large deals. And a lot of it is, we're going to make the business that we have run well. I think that again, kind of around the edges, we will try to support that which we already do. And there will be opportunities that are kind of thematic in the way that say Greentech is thematic.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you, Scott.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning everyone.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, first congratulations to Mark and to Eva on the promotion.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Bill.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So first question for the new CFO, you've hit your leverage target, exceeded it, 2.5 is what you had set back when you had purchased Wood Mac, you're at 2.2 times. Going forward, what's that new leverage target? It had been 2.5, but that seemed like more of a combination temporarily. Is it more like 3 times?","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Bill, I would say that our leverage target steady-state remains 2.5 times. But remember how we've always operated, is we have flexibility to go above that. We did with. We said we'd delever. I think that we have a leverage point that our business can very easily support. I think that we always just look at the opportunities and figure out where we need to settle that. But I think the good news for us is we've got capacity under even at steady-state and the flexibility to go up as warranted if there's a deal that makes sense for us.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. And then a second question for you on the insurance business and Decision Analytics. If you could talk a little bit about Xactware, XactContents and the blend of the subscription and transaction business and then also how the new 360Value product fits in with that whole category.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah so, Bill, maybe I'll take the second part first, then I'll let Mark talk a little bit about some of the specific products in insurance and solutions. If you were to think about Decision Analytics overall, the mix between subscription and non-subscription, it's about 77% subscription. I would say insurance in Decision Analytics looks fairly similar to the rest of Decision Analytics now, now that we don't have that highly transactional business in healthcare in there anymore. There's more uniformity across that. So, I think that we love where we sit. We've always thought it was natural to have someone out of non-subscription revenue, and I think in Decision Analytics, we have a bit more of that, and that includes things we do that provide us opportunities to work closely with customers and develop those new solutions. I'll let Mark comment a bit on Xactware and some of the other solutions.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And the 360 innovations.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. So let me just quickly highlight the fact that we continue to improve the suite of Xactware solutions. Our vision and our focus for this year and next is to bring out what I'll refer to as a more integrated solution which brings together Xactimate that's used in probably about 85% of the property repair cost estimates across the United States in combination with XactAnalysis which is the BI tool and everything around it so that you can work and use your back office in an efficient way. In addition, Contents, which represents all of the information about pricing and materials inside the home to replace the TV, couches, rugs and things.","So our focus, make it more integrated, easier to use, more focus on the claim as opposed to the assignment, which was doing the work but more on the claim. All of that has been kind of a focus from a customer perspective and our perspective to achieve those things. Very much in our forward vision is to take that solution, that more simplified solution and bring it to the global insurance market, customizing it in a way that it is fit for use in that market and we've put a lot of time and resource and are making progress there.","The final component to this is we are seeing a lot of activity in the US market where people are interested in trying to make access to the quote engine, going online and getting a quote for auto and home, more and more interactive with the customer. And our ability to help our customers do that through the enhancement here at 360Value, lets you as a homeowner go online to make sure you have the proper coverage for your home. That's valuable, that's helpful and it's easy. You have the policyholder, or the person who's getting the quote do it himself and that's the type of innovation we want to work with and help our customers with their customers.","Last piece as we think about this bringing it together, we are finding increased interest in basically the whole property suite of solutions as we go overseas. So we kind of led in with the claims side of things, but clearly people are looking for information about large commercial buildings. So, replicating some of the things we do here in the United States, using both remote sensing and aerial images, providing with insights into risk about a building and help him understand what the insurance to value is, meaning what's the replacement cost if there was a total loss. And all of those themes, I think we are trying to be more comprehensive, more seamless, both internationally and that will obviously revert back with our US customers as well. So I probably said a lot, but I want to make sure I responded to some of the questions then.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning, would appreciate your thoughts more broadly on capital allocation, Scott, especially since you've reached the target leverage ratio or even below it, ahead of schedule. Post the sale of healthcare, you have more subscription revenue, more visibility on cash flow. You indicated a preference for small tuck-in data-oriented acquisitions. I guess two questions. First, how do you think about opportunities in the acquisition pipeline versus share repurchase given the current price of your stock? And then secondly, with the higher subscription based revenue, more visible cash flow, higher margin profile, how do you think about the possibility of initiating a dividend?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean all good, all good topics. So, maybe back to the top. If you look at our company over extended periods of time, the program of acquisition and the share repurchase program have both done very well for our shareholders, both have done very well. And there's really nothing in our situation that would cause us to think that anything fundamentally is going to be different in the future than in the past. You actually pointed out one of the features of our company, which is that the cash flow visibility is, if anything, even greater than it was. So we would continue to see both of those as real pillars inside of the way that we do what we do.","And so at any given moment, this moment for example, we're always taking stock of where we stand in the M&A pipeline and how imminent we think good opportunities are. And we remain very interested in deploying capital in terms of returning it to shareholders when we feel that sort of that which is right at the head of the pipeline and the size is such that we still have capacity. And I would say that we do have, we have capacity as we sit here. So we're very alert to the application of capital and we'll remain so and that's a statement for the third quarter and the fourth quarter and really forever.","I actually thought your second question, David, was going to be different, more about sort of a higher leverage target rather than a dividend. We're very interested in returning capital to shareholders I guess that's the way that I would put it. Our analysis to date has not indicated that there's anything fundamentally superior about doing it in the form of a dividend versus the buyback program that we've had. So, that's kind of where we sit with that thought at the moment.","By the way, even David and I and Mark and all of us that are out there talking to investors, we actually ask that question all the time, how do you feel about it. And so we remain open to the conversation, but I would say that we haven't drawn the conclusion that a dividend is a superior way of expressing our commitment to returning capital to shareholders.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thanks so much for the insights.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I was hoping you could give a little more color on the pieces within specialized excluding Wood Mac. Were there parts of the business that did well this quarter? And basically, where were the sort of the troubled areas; where were the bright spots?","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Toni, I'll kick off on that and Scott may want to add some comments. I think if you take Wood Mac, PCI and Infield out of specialized because those are all inorganic in the quarter, you primarily have our environmental health and safety solutions and some of our weather solutions. We referenced in the press release and on the call, when you think about EH&S, there were some global standards that went into place in 2015 which gave us the opportunity to serve our customers in making those transitions. Those transitions are complete and so you'll kind of see a normalization of that type of work this year which is leading to the organic result of a decline there. I would say that that's probably the primary impact.","And if you were to think about it, I think the headline growth decline as a percentage is larger than the actual dollar impact on Verisk. The other thing we mentioned is with regards to that area, we are transitioning into more subscription based revenues. And I think that's really great both for us and for our customers. So in a moment in time, if you're going from more transactional to more subscription, the great thing about subscription is it's recognized over time but in the moment, transaction is not there and subscription is only the portion of what you're going to recognize, you're going to see a little impact.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We've actually observed on this before, but just a little sort of data analytic observation is that when you start out with a new solution, both customers and the vendors often want it to be transaction priced, because nobody really knows the absolute level of demand. There really do come these moments where the customers are open to, and maybe even wanting to move to a subscription, because they want more certainty and visibility in terms of the future. So, it's a kind of a natural sort of a development for newer kinds of solutions. And Eva was describing that with respect to some of which goes on on the EH&S side. Same thing on the country and political risk side, we're doing the same thing.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then looking at financial, the comps get a lot easier in the back half of the year. I think you've previously talked about double digits in that segment for the full year. What would be the difference between getting to low double digits versus mid teens? Would it be project revenue? You mentioned the media effectiveness grew nicely this quarter. And how's the transition going from sort of project revenue to subscription in that business?","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Toni, I would just start by saying as a reminder, when we talk about double digits, we're actually including the grow over impact of that one-time media effectiveness revenue we had in 2015 in the first quarter. So I actually think the target we set is pretty ambitious. If you consider that we're not taking that out in that analysis. I would say that like many of our businesses, I think there's opportunity for us to add incremental revenue through project revenue. And certainly, that's something that you can move, that could move a growth rate in a short term. But I think fundamentally, when we talk about the double digit growth rate, again given the comparable that we have for last year, we think that that is very strong.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and I'll just add that there are some sparkling new names on the customer list even this quarter. I mean, this business is doing a wonderful job of reaching out to new customer sets.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital. Your line is open. Pease go ahead.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks so much. I know it's late. I just have a quick question. Eva, you had mentioned the potential $25 million impact from FX for the year. Can you give us a little bit more color exactly which line items from a revenue perspective we might see the biggest impact? Thanks.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, absolutely. I mean obviously Wood Mac has the most of the pound-based revenue which is the rate we're referencing, although we do have other currencies in there as well. I would say that we have international revenue in our financial services, as I mentioned. We have some of that in EH&S. I mean we have a little bit now in insurance as well. And so most of it would be in Wood Mac, but I think it is actually scattered across the company. And as we go forward, I think one of the things that's been on my mind is, I think we will continue to try to provide you more visibility into that, because my sense is that to date, your inclusion of that impact in our forward-looking expectations that you develop has been a little more soft as opposed to direct. And so we'll try to help you with that.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. That would be appreciated. Thanks so much.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. So, my question is just on the longer term margin profile of the business. It sounded like obviously there's some macro issues and some issues within the insurance vertical in general that are kind of, I wouldn't call them one-time, but are ebbs and flows of the business. and you're taking the opportunity here to add resources and to maybe bulk up on some of your new offerings. So how should we think about the longer term margin profile of the business? Is this a short term thing, and if those macro factors turn in your favor, will you kind of pull back on that or is this something that's in place until those new businesses kick in? How should we think about it? Thanks.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, well maybe just starting with long term because as we think about long term, that's over multiple years. I don't know when you're saying that and you're referencing the quarter, it almost sounds to me like you're referring more to a shorter long term than we would. But what I would say is I think we continue to be constructive on margins over the long term. Our business is that build it once, sell it many times. As I did observe in the quarter in particular, when you have some high margin non-subscription business like cat bonds and you have lots of that, that will have a moment-in-time impact on the margin in the quarter. But that being said, I think over the long term, nothing has changed in our outlook for what we can do there and the opportunity to expand margins over time.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Welcome.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Let me echo the congratulations on your respective promotions. I'll just ask my two questions up front. And you sort of addressed them in your prior three responses, Eva, but I just want to make sure I had this right. The transition to subscription in Wood Mac, how should we sort of dimensionalize the revenue impact? That's the first one, the subscription in Wood Mac. And the second one is, were there any project based revenues in the Q2 related to financial services? Thank you.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah so, just on the first question, a clarification. When you're talking about transition to subscription revenue, that was referencing ex-Wood Mac in energy and specialized, so that was really more around our EH&S solutions.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, in country and political risk.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Country and political. So, that was not a Wood Mac related comment. With regards to project revenue in financial services, I mean we always have some. I would say there was nothing in particular that we would call out in the quarter.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And that's not the dominant theme in terms of what's going on. The growth in financial services is very broadly based. It's new geographies. It's the traditional subscription revenues. It's analytic product. It's the whole mix.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you, Scott. Thank you.","Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time. I would return the call to the presenters.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, just wanted to say thank you all very much for your interest today and all the good questions. And I know we'll be seeing some of you in the relatively near future and look forward to that.

This call is being recoded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Director of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen. Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.","David E. Cohen - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, Beth, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2016 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.","Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. All discussions of EBITDA reflect adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain severance costs and a gain from an investment in a business which was acquired by a third party.","The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. The earnings release contains reconciliations of several non-GAAP measures which we will reference on today's call. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thanks, David. Good morning, everybody. In the third quarter, we delivered solid overall results with total and organic constant currency revenue growth of around 6% as we continue to grow faster than our end markets. With almost 8% growth from our combined insurance and financial services businesses, the long-term underlying trends remain encouraging. Profitability remains strong with total EBITDA margins of around 51%.","Adjusted EBITDA growth excluding the prior year warrant sale gain was around 6%. Diluted adjusted EPS grew about 8% and about 17% excluding the warrant gain. Year-to-date free cash flow is up 13% excluding the tax on the gain from the healthcare business sale.","We were pleased to resume returning capital to our shareholders through our longstanding share repurchase program. We bought $73 million of stock in the quarter and we had $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of September 30, 2016.","With our leverage back below our 2.5 times reference level, we have plenty of capacity for strategically relevant tuck-in acquisitions as well as additional repurchases. We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions in particular as we make buy versus build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion and vertical enhancement.","Analyze Re is a great example where we found a high performance analytics capability that complements the Touchstone platform at AIR. While the deal only closed last week, the teams are already working on integration and go-to-market strategies. We continue to make progress enhancing the Verisk distinctives of one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows. Consistent with our efforts, Verisk was recently ranked in the top 20 on Forbes magazine's 2016 list of the world's most innovative companies.","Our success is due to the outstanding efforts of our people, including those who have joined us relatively recently. And I'm very encouraged by the growing enthusiasm across the company to serve our customers with innovative data analytic solutions. We see a direct relationship between the excellence of our employees and their commitment to creating innovative solutions for our customers.","We remain confident in our double-digit growth forecast for financial services this year, and we still continue to expect WoodMac to be around flat in constant currency. In pursuit of our goal of insurance growth above the 2015 run rate, we are pleased with new contract signings and the performance of several newer, more innovative solutions. As you know, there's been some softness in the reinsurance market, and 2016 has been an extremely quiet storm season.","In addition, a handful of customers have signed contracts as expected, but the related implementations are starting a bit later than originally planned. While timing is a factor as we cross the 2016 finish line, we continue to feel very good about the quality of our data assets. Our customers' regard for us is higher than ever according to our NPS methodology, and the long-term outlook is for continued revenue growth.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark who will make some additional comments.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, Scott. Across our businesses which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we had several key industry themes, including vertical big data, industry automation, and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I'll highlight a number of positive recent developments.","In the vertical big data area, we launched a new energy insurance group focused on transforming risk assessment, rating, and risk modeling for the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power generation, and metals and mining industries. The group is drawing on deep domain expertise and proprietary data from our ISO, AIR and WoodMac businesses. The data analytic solutions will help global property and casualty insurers evaluate and select risk and manage portfolios based upon energy and insurance industry-wide data, rather than relying solely on their own experience, data sets and tools. We're uniquely positioned to be the first to market at innovating the intersection of insurance and energy sectors.","One of our industry automation solutions saw a win as a leading insurer expanded use of A-PLUS, Verisk's Loss History solution, to conduct loss history evaluations at the beginning rather than the after the quote process. This change of workflow will enhance the experience of their customers while improving operational and sales efficiencies. Improving conversion rates through better customer experiences while keeping expenses flat and maintaining underwriting integrity is a forward-thinking, innovative approach to profitable growth.","We continue to perform well in the cat modeling space. As an example, we're very pleased when a leading global player decided to select AIR's Touchstone platform as its primary modeling solution along with the complete suite of AIR's global catastrophe models. Their decision was informed by, in their words, AIR's detailed loss modeling capabilities and superior service. This follows the June 2016 release of Touchstone 4.0 which features a variety of enhancements designed to improve performance, workflow automation and efficiency, and the overall user experience.","Finally, we continue to improve digital engagement in the P&C industry through the availability of Circular Authority for Insurance. This is a cloud-based analytic solution designed to help insurers better manage ISO content with tools to visualize, compare and analyze updates. The solution helps insurers plan, implement and track our filings with state regulators and stay informed on the latest insurance topics. This is a natural extension to the thousands of insurance program updates we issue each year, and we're confident that it will add value and functionality for our customers.","With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. In the third quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth in the future. Revenue grew 5.9% and 6.2% on an organic constant currency basis. Our combined insurance and financial services businesses grew 7.7% in the quarter. EBITDA grew 5.9% to $250 million. This growth excludes the prior period gain on sale of warrants. EBITDA margins were 50.9% in the quarter.","Within Decision Analytics, revenue grew 6.2% and 6.9% on an organic constant currency basis. Again, this quarter, financial services was the fastest growing vertical, while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to growth. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 7.4% in the third quarter. We saw solid growth in underwriting, claims analytics and catastrophe modeling solutions. Loss quantification solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter. Customer retention remains very high, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth.","Financial services revenue increased 24.5% in the quarter, led by growth in analytical solutions and media effectiveness. We are seeing good interest in the solutions we are building with our partners and continue to believe that our differentiated data assets position us well to execute on our plans in this vertical. As reported, energy and specialized markets revenue was about flat. The continuing weakness in the British pound remains a headwind to both revenue growth and Decision Analytics margins on a reported basis.","Consistent with our longstanding approach, WoodMac became a part of organic growth starting in the third quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes PCI, Infield, Greentech and Quest, declined $5.3 million in the quarter, but increased slightly excluding the impact of FX.","Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.3% and 5% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value to our longstanding insurance customers. Contributions in new solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions Ireland.","Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.4% reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions such as Predictive Model and Electronic Rating Content. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 4.8% in the quarter. Growth was led by an increase in commercial underwriting solutions subscription revenue.","EBITDA decreased 0.6% in the quarter to $253 million resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.9%. EBITDA growth adjusted for the 2015 gain on sale of warrants was 5.9%. EBITDA excludes a third quarter 2016 severance charge as we combined administrative functions following the WoodMac integration. It also excludes a gain on an investment in a company which was acquired by a third party.","Decision Analytics EBITDA excluding the prior year gain grew 7.3% to $147 million in the quarter. Decision Analytics EBITDA as reported decreased 3.7%. EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 4% to $106 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management offset by increased staff levels following the previously announced talent realignment.","Reported interest expense was $28 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at September 30, 2016. After using our proceeds from the healthcare divestiture to pay down debt, our pro forma leverage at the end of the third quarter was about 2.2 times, below our 2.5 times reference level.","Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 26%. We saw a one-time benefit in the quarter from a change in the tax rates in the UK. Adjusted net income in 3Q increased 8.1% to $144 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.84 in the quarter, an increase of 7.7%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations, both organic and acquired, lower interest expense, and lower taxes. The increases were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, and the 2015 warrant sale gain which did not recur this year. Excluding the 2015 warrant gain, adjusted EPS grew 16.9%.","The average diluted share count was 171.8 million shares in the quarter. On September 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171 million shares. We repurchased 900,000 shares at an average price of $81.72 for a total cost of $73 million in the quarter. At September 30, we had about $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to-date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital.","Free cash flow increased 12.8% to $429 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, excluding the $75 million tax on the gain of the sale of the healthcare business. Free cash flow excluding the tax was 57.4% of EBITDA. These numbers are all from continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses, the addition of WoodMac, and lower CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and, therefore, shareholder value.","Capital expenditures increased 0.8% to $88 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, and we continue to balance the capital intensity of the business with investing for future growth. CapEx was 5.9% of revenue year-to-date. We expect for the full year, our CapEx will be about $10 million lower than we previously discussed as we manage efficiencies across our hardware and software spend even while developing more software for solution delivery.","As you think about your models for the remainder of 2016 on a continuing operations basis, please remember that in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a one-time P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a non-recurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO and will exclude \u2013 be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability and we just want it to be on your radar ahead of time. This is really the final item that will be associated with ESOP adjustments.","For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx from continuing operations of $140 million to $145 million, fixed asset depreciation\/amortization of about $125 million, and the amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $120 million for the full year, and we estimate the tax rate to be around 31% for the full year.","For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rates applicable to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect a full-year diluted weighted average share count of about 171.6 million shares before incremental repurchases.","We are executing on our 2016 plan despite larger than expected currency headwinds and are actively engaged in planning for the future. We're excited about the opportunities we see for profitable growth and remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term.","We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up.","And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley.

LLC","Scott, you mentioned the softness in the reinsurance market does this impact your ability to grow insurance this year over last year or are you still confident that you'll be able to achieve that and could you just remind us of your exposure to reinsurance?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. So, our goal remains the same and I did mention it just because it is a factor in the environment right now. Our exposure to reinsurance is primarily with respect to the work that we do in the cat modeling world, not exclusively. We also provide some loss distribution content to the global reinsurers, but it's principally through catastrophe modeling and basically and I'm actually mention two things that are in the environment right now, the other is it's a very quiet storm season and in fact, it has been a quiet storm season for the last several years. And that does interact with the way that the reinsurance market behaves. And so, there have been some combinations in the reinsurance world including the brokers.","And so, you have that in the environment. So, it's in there. It's a factor but the business \u2013 our insurance business overall is really good. And even yesterday, we had a visit from folks from an extremely prominent global non-domestic insurance organization and they were essentially asking, how could they get closer to more of our solutions. I think it's a conversation that we were probably not going to be able to have even just a couple of years ago. So, that's kind of where we sit right now.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. And my follow-up is just on the expense side. You had a really strong quarter specifically referring to the 63% gross margin in DA. Just \u2013 was anything one-time in there? How sustainable is that? And just overall when we think about EBITDA margins of 51%, it's obviously extremely strong. So, what do you view as may the key areas to move margins higher, not that we're complaining? But, or are you focused on keeping margins flat and just plowing scale benefits or any sort of additional expense benefits into supporting future growth?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So, you had a couple of questions in there. So, the first one, there was really nothing one-time in the results. And in fact, we're trying to kind of help you see that there were actually some one \u2013 there were some one-time effects in 2015. So, but no, nothing with respect to 2016. And it's really the same story that it's always been which is that there is definitely scale just built into the way we do what we do.","And the offset is the investment in new things and we're actually just completing our annual refresh of our five-year plans. And I think we have the most robust new solution pipeline that we've ever had, actually. So, we're excited to be investing in the business, and that is the one offsetting factor. But the business continues to demonstrate the same scale effects as it always has. So, we've said we're constructive on margins in the intermediate and long term, and we're still in that place.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh, William Blair & Company. Your line is open.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. First, just on the energy and specialized markets. Can you \u2013 the organic growth that you mentioned was slightly positive on a constant currency basis?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Correct.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Can you help us think about the legacy part of that segment versus Wood Mackenzie and how that contributed to that performance?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. Tim, it's Eva. Good morning. I think, if you think about the business, I mean, as you said, we have the legacy, we have the environmental health and safety, and some of our (20:35) analytics solution. And I think some of the comments we made last quarter would be reflected in the performance there. We had a grow-over from last year and some global regulations that went in place in the H&S, and that will sort of continue to be an impact on the growth you see this year.","And then with regards to WoodMackenzie, what we've talked about is, for the year, we expect about flat growth on a constant currency basis. And we're tracking towards that. We feel good about the performance of the business there. And I would say sort of by degrees, I think, the third quarter, some of the renewals we've been seeing are positive signs, I would say, that the market continues to be in the state it's in, and so I wouldn't overweight that. But I would say that we're pleased with the performance at WoodMackenzie.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, on insurance, I guess, not to, to follow-up on it. To get to a faster growth this year than you had last year, it seems to imply you need a growth rate, I guess, for that vertical that we haven't seen in a while. And so, are there any like, kind of project or one-time revenue that can get you there? Or is it \u2013 I guess, can you help us think through that and anyway to size some of the headwinds, the storm season, the later start, and I guess, as we think about how that kind of impacted kind of the revenue for this quarter or kind of the outlook?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. Tim, well, maybe just to start on your question, the insurance business and aggregate is split probably a little more weighted towards subscription than our overall but roughly if you think about 80%\/20% subscription, non-subscription across Verisk Analytics, so I would say that you see a reflection in the business similar to that.","So, there are elements that are transactional and others are longer term. I think, as Scott observed, we have \u2013 the storm season can have some impact both in transactional and some of the other items. And as we think forward to the quarter, I think we're just pushing hard to do everything that we can to position the business well for the future. And sometimes, we have implementation timelines that are not fully in our control.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey, SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, all. Thanks for taking the question.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Sure.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Good morning.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, Mark, I'm intrigued by the vertical big data comments especially, I guess, the integration or overlap between commodities, analytics and insurance risk management. Could you elaborate just a little bit, I guess, and talk about what the long-term, you know, maybe the TAM is and the long-term potential to contribute to growth on sort of an enterprise basis. Cause that sounds like somewhere \u2013 an area where you have pretty good competitive differentiation.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So, I think across the insurance value chain, whether it's in the front side of underwriting or inside the claim space, all of our customers are very much looking to become more efficient and improve on the selection of the risks, better pricing of the risks or literally doing claims adjudication kind of in an automatic way. They would really like, for the most part, not touch a lot of claims which would save them money and actually improve their own relationship with the customer.","So, I'm not sure we've been able to quantify TAM for all of that. But let me just describe to you some of the bigger things that we think are important. One, we highlighted here, as you underwrite a claim \u2013 excuse me, if you underwrite a risk, you have a lot of information that is necessary to underwrite that risk. We want to take and move that to the front-end. We want to do that upfront so that people can be quoting with all that information in mind. And I think that's a big opportunity.","I think the other opportunity we highlighted here was energy. So, bringing together the big data kind of world of what we do with WoodMac, and the information we have with WoodMac and what we do in insurance, we have found, or at least we think, that the energy market is a little bit more specialized \u2013 it's a little bit the expertise of the players in it. And they really have never had look at, and views into a pricing or a risk assessment approach that we would do with traditional limited insurance. So, this is more of a E&F type asset. It exists in surplus. It's the bigger players across the world and we think this is a, I would say, probably tens of millions type of TAM if not larger.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, thank you. And, the other question I just have is can you talk a little bit about the growth in insurance that you're seeing from international expansion of existing customers and whether or not you think about that as distinct from broader global expansion plans?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. So, I think that's a great question. I think there's two ways we think internationally and as Scott highlighted, it's become very much a priority over the last couple years. There's two things I think we're doing well. There's a couple places, particularly on the claim side of things, where we have a customer, they're using us in a geography, let's use the UK as an example, they like the results they've gotten. We're able to demonstrate strong ROI, and that large global insurer takes us from the UK to other geographies and ultimately, I think the plan would be to implement across all of their operations.","Once we get into another geography and we customize for that geography, one of the things that we always have to identify and understand is the insurance markets are very different. So, we have to locally customize the software and that's true of things we've been trying to put in place, so that we can then extend down beyond the one customer into many.","There's other places, kind of the second tact we've taken is, we know markets that look and feel a lot like the U.S. market. It has maybe not the same regulation, but it has the same kind of nature of transfer risk, and we're good and knowledgeable that we can help them. And to the extent that is maybe U.S. speaking and has a more mature market, we're starting there because we can probably be most helpful. I think we've seen some opportunities to do things with buildings as an example.","Big commercial buildings, we're very good at. We're very knowledgeable of a building that sits in some foreign location, has the same type of risk attributes as long as we can get an understanding of the property characteristics and we can relate a building in whatever foreign region to something here in the United States and we can build out with a lot of imagery.","So, we're following our customers, one; we're finding like markets, two; and we have a kind of a team that's really focused on trying to accelerate our growth internationally.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman, JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Scott, do you still plan on seeing Verisk combine DA and RA insurance revenue growth to accelerate for full-year 2016 compared to the growth rates of 2015?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","As I've said, we're working hard towards that goal. That is our goal, it remains our goal. And I also laid out sort of what's in the environment right at the moment that is a part of the performance that we will eventually produce.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And that's totally separate from looking at DA financial services, right?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Oh, yeah. Of course. Yes.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik, Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. So, just wanted a little bit more color on the \u2013 I think, outside of the reinsurance market (29:33) and the quiet storm season, you talked about some contract implementation delays. I was just hoping you could give a little bit more color on that and maybe some examples of what's going on there?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So, this is Mark again. Let me provide a little color. One of the great parts of Verisk is we're deeply embedded into our customer workflows and that's true of a lot of the competitors in which we go after. So, if you were to think about where we try to provide information at the point of underwriting. So, transitioning a customer from another solution to our solution just takes time. It takes a lot of effort from internal IT departments and we just can't always control the timing of those things. We also have contracts, so we know it's going to happen but the timing and where they want to roll out, sometimes they want to roll out regionally as opposed to across the nation. So, those are the type of things that we are kind of referencing there when we talk about timing. So, signed contracts, just look into push implementation where we don't necessarily have as much control as we'd like.","I think the other comment or, at least, the other thing Scott referenced was in our world, we have a lot of subscription, pretty high visibility, storm, storm activity effects some of our repair cost estimates. There is a variable aspect to that and some of the contracts allow for additional charges when we have higher volumes. And just more broadly, if I'm to answer your question right, storm, storm activity creates what is maybe some pricing opportunity for both reinsurers and primary insurers and that helps the overall state of the market and really just the mindset of insurers who, at this point, are really focused on cutting cost as opposed to growing their book and growing their top line. So, little bit of a mindset as well as build transactional. So, hopefully that provides a little of the color you're looking for.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then just on Argus. Obviously, some really good growth there. I was just hoping you could give us some color in terms of the growth coming from the \u2013 what we knew of Argus in terms of the move to financial services elements of the business versus the more media effectiveness that you guys have talked about recently like, is there a way to describe the split in growth there or what's more exciting or where that's coming from?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. It's really very balanced. The growth at Argus is extremely balanced. So, as we've talked about before, there are data management solutions, there are analytic services, there are the contributory data sets, there is the media effectiveness world, there is international expansion. And all of those are contributing.","So, I really wouldn't point at any one thing. But the wellspring of what Argus is good at is a remarkable ability to integrate large amounts of data, contributed data in an extremely efficient way and then equal capability at turning it into insight and putting it back into the customer's environment in a way that they can consume the analysis and the data very quickly. And so, all the things that I just mentioned are essentially expressions of that same capability.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari, Macquarie. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, guys. This is (33:13) filling in for Hamzah. Have a question about the talent realignment initiative in Risk Assessment and the overall hiring plans you guys have as you look toward 2017.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Eva, you want to take that?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. Well, I think, as we mentioned the last quarter, we've been filling in the positions that we had targeted as a part of the talent realignment. Obviously, as we had announced that back in the end of 2014, there was some period of time during which those people had left and the new talent that we were bringing in had not yet joined. I think we've been doing a good job and you've probably seen a few press releases about various people who've joined us and their areas of focus. But I would say that we are working hard to have all of those seats filled. I think that we'll probably talk about this less as we get to 2017.","Unknown Speaker","All righty. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler, Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thank you. On the WoodMac flattish organic constant currency, I'm guessing there's some customers that are under extreme distress or going out of business. So, I'm wondering what the positive offsets are to get to flattish. So, just looking for color around uptake of new solutions, any initial successes with broadening the selling motion. I think you previously said it was undersold. Just what are the positive offsets?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. So, several things around that. First, customers generally have been under pressure, but I don't think it would be correct to draw the conclusion that, if what you're picturing is a lot of industry consolidation and the exit of a lot of players, fewer belly buttons on the customer list are out in the market, that's actually not the case. And in fact, one of the reasons why we were interested to do the small tuck-ins that we did is, in some cases, they actually serve different segments of the market. For example, more pure-play E&P kinds of companies. And so actually, the net effect of all of the acquisitions is that the customer list which used to be circa 1,000 is now closer to 3,000. And so we're obviously very excited about the cross-sell opportunities inside of that.","Let me just also remind everybody that one of the largest segments that is served by Argus is the financial services world. There are a lot of folks who are interested in understanding what's happening in the hydrocarbon ecosystem that are not \u2013 I'm sorry, did I say Argus, in the WoodMac \u2013 excuse me, I'm addressing WoodMac. One of the largest segments for WoodMac is the financial services segment. And because there are a lot of folks that are interested in the performance of the hydrocarbon ecosystem other than the oil and gas companies and that segment has remained a very important part of what it is that we do. And then WoodMac is, actually yesterday, literally yesterday, launched a new solution, and new solutions have always been a part of the WoodMac story and I think always will be a part of the WoodMac story.","And yet another thing which is in the environment right now is the oil and gas companies have really trimmed their work staffs, and part of the effect of that is that when the rebound comes, and it will come, I mean, you can just see it coming based upon lack of investment in CapEx. When it comes, the \u2013 our customers will be a little bit shorthanded in terms of talent. And so we think that they'll want to make use of both of our sort of products as well as our services. And you can see little green shoots of some of that even today.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Jeff, it's Eva. I'd just add, I mean, I think we've talked about this before but generally, the WoodMac client base isn't very highly rated investment grade type client base. So, it's not to say there is never something here or there but I think to characterize it overall, despite the industry pressure, it's a very high-quality customer base.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then on the Touchstone win, just how penetrated is that market in terms of either using your or a competitor's solution? And how does your market share differ between, I guess, U.S. and European-based insurance companies?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So, let me help you out with this. This is Mark. I think if you were to look at the number of insurers, most of the larger insurers use multiple models, so they would use both AIR and the competitive model. What we have seen is more and more people are using us or at least we're winning what I'll refer to as the primary modeling spot. If you're embedded in the workflow, if you're a part of that underwriting decision, the primary model is paid more. The secondary model is used as a reference point and to make sure things look right and to kind of sync up (38:45) with other information. So, it's a checkpoint. Our goal and it continues to be is to displace the competitor and drive towards being that primary model in the biggest insurers where the competitors, historically, had a little bit more prominence.","The other part of your question is, I would say to you that a large majority of (39:08) of the world uses models. In some cases, they own them themselves and kind of have their own internal staff. In other cases, they work through brokers and we license our product through brokers. So, I think everyone has access to the models. I think it becomes more prominent for larger insurers to own it and have it directly in-house for use by their internal staff. So, they're using more and more models, too. So, that's why Analyze Re provides an opportunity to kind of bring all those modeled outcomes together. You could pick a region, you could pick a model, and you can kind of look at across the book in a portfolio way to do that.","I think the last part of your question is, we model 100 countries. It think it's 104 countries, all major parallels. We are listening to our customers where they think there's economic loss to be covered. And we will attempt to build models where there is customer feedback and demand, and we think we're pretty well covered, albeit we're always looking to improve and always looking to expand.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. There's also a dynamic in there, which is that there are new modalities of risk. So, cyber would be an example of that or a comprehensive look at risk in the agricultural channel, both of which lend themselves to the kind of stochastic methodology that AIR uses. So, when you think about cat modeling, I would just encourage you to open up the aperture on the view just a little bit. It's a little bit more dynamic. It's actually considerably more dynamic than just earthquakes and hurricanes and weather phenomena.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington, Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Hi.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Good morning.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Good morning, Bill.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, a question for you on WoodMac and the GEM renewals. If you look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, meaning adjusted for currency, GEM dollar renewals on a year-over-year basis, are those trending up, flat, down? And then, how do you look at that trend, how do you expect that trend to look over the next 12 months to 18 months?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So, it's very segment specific inside of the customer base today. There are some segments, who's current situations are sort of more leaning in and growth oriented, and there are somewhere that they've been more heavily impacted by some of the trends in the industry. So, there's really no one answer which sort of covers all of that.","The way that we manage inside of the energy vertical is the same way that we manage the insurance vertical, actually, everything we do, which is we take a comprehensive view of the relationship with the customer, so when we're thinking about making our proposals, it's a combination of when it's time to renew the existing product or products, but also we're always presenting new solutions that they're not using today.","And where we come out on a customer-by-customer basis is essentially the net of all of that. So, I would say that in the current moment, we've had to be particularly thoughtful about the pricing on like-over-like when we come to those renewal points. Bear in mind, by the way, that there are multi-year \u2013 a number of multi-year agreements here. So, it's not as if that really predominates in what goes on. But really the outcomes in these negotiations with customers have really been kind of what we expected. And certainly, as we go forward and the environment normalizes, I think that there will be room there.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","And Bill, I just wanted to add. You asked your question kind of narrowly just focused on GEM, I mean, we've had this discussion before, WoodMac is much more than just GEM. We have a lot of offerings there. So, I just wanted to add that color.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, fair point. For my follow-on, I wanted to ask about \u2013 a year ago, we started to see some weakness in the non-GEM products, the non-subscription services like consulting. And consulting has historically been a leading indicator within the energy space for the other parts of the business. And I was curious whether you're starting to see \u2013 or how your consulting pipeline is looking there, whether that was one of the green shoots that Scott had mentioned earlier?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Well, as you know, we don't sort of formally break out the results between the different sides of the business. But the team, the consulting team has been very busy this year. And we actually are talking about as we move into 2017, ways to amplify that team.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Well, thank you very much.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is open.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Thanks. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Good morning.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Good morning.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Just had a question on the RA side. I'm looking at growth in the quarter. Could you just help us understand some of the components of that, whether it's just growth in end markets versus pricing versus new solutions? I know in the past, you mentioned that you've shifted some of the subscription agreements to value-based-type arrangements. Just trying to understand growth there and how we should we think about it for the next quarter? Thanks.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So, this is Mark. I think we've had a very high subscription rate inside of those industry standard programs, as you know, it's in large part the pricing and the invoice that goes out at the beginning of the year, and it renews, prepaid a quarter in advance for a majority of that revenue, in some cases a full year. So, good visibility.","The things that kind of cause some, ups and downs if you will. Clearly, we have the opportunity to sell more where there's a customer looking to expand services or a new insurer concept. When two insurers become one inside of mergers, obviously that has some potentially negative downward effect on the way we kind of price. You're correct, a large chunk of the contracts today are kind of multi-year subscriptions, and they have kind of inflationary type of clause in there that is ongoing.","Last piece of it is, inside industry standard programs, we continue to do a lot as it relates to new products and services. So, if you were to think about ways that people take our content and bring it into their own solutions, we call it Electronic Rating Content. That has been growing nicely. We've done a lot of work around analytics. We called it Risk Analyzer Suite. Those are the type of things. But because of the way we contract, it's usually multi-year and it's kind of spread evenly over the term.","So, you've been seeing a pretty constant approach to industry standard programs from year-to-year-to-year. I hope that's what you were looking for.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. Yeah, no, that's helpful. And should we expect, I guess, an improvement from the current levels in terms of growth or the next quarter, the next year?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So, I'll talk long term. I think we need to believe that the solutions and new solutions that I'll refer to as our ISO solutions team continues to produce is promising. I think there's a lot of analytics that are on the pipe. Things like energy we discussed here provides upside and opportunity. So, I think we generally remain pretty confident and remain pretty upbeat about the long-term prospects for insurance.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","We don't view it as a mature business and we manage very much as if it's not a mature business, but one that has the opportunity to grow.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of An Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on your energy insurance unit launch. Realizing its early days, hoping you can share some color on what the initial demand or commercial reception has been. And now that you've married energy to some of your supply chain capabilities, and now insurance, perhaps some thought on where you continue to see opportunities as far as products that combine your areas of expertise?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Sure. So, I think we always had approach where we want to work with our customers for any type of rollout. So, we brought all of our teams together to see what we have and what capabilities and solutions we have to help energy insurers including and featuring a lot of the WoodMac content. With that group together, kind of a cross functional team, we built what we refer to as a minimum viable product. It's something that could be used for demos and used for (48:18) and look into what really can happen. And what our attempt is always to work with partners, development partners, to build out and enhance that solution. So, we are \u2013 have gotten some very nice acceptance and interest from some of the largest players in that space. We have a couple development partners and we are anxiously looking to move forward and trying to move as quickly as we can on that front. I think it opens up some nice opportunities and really provides a little insight into what is a great opportunity to build across the two verticals of Verisk.","You also had a comment or question about supply chain and I think that offers another kind of opportunity where a lot of different partners.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. We really like the supply chain theme because it lends itself to the kind of stochastic network kind of analytic that we're good at. And in fact, a lot of our supply chain thinking at the moment is directed at one of the most complex supply chains in the world which is around the hydrocarbon ecosystem. And so, we're actually \u2013 that's a place where we're trying to bring together sort of the pattern of thought, and the vertical market.","The other thing that I think really ties our company together is large-scale data integration and data management which is just \u2013 and it's just the bread and butter of doing what we do, but bringing those methods across all parts of our organization and finding ways to make sure that we're commercializing those opportunities in all of the vertical markets. I think that's, by degree, it's kind of new business for us, and it's exciting. But that, to me, is actually the most \u2013 that's the greatest amount of connective tissue we have across the company.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. That's really helpful. And as a follow-up, could you speak to your media effectiveness business within financial services? I know you've been more optimistic on the project revenue opportunity there. But wondering if you have any updates you can share with regards to that view. It seems there's some discretionary pullback from some customers in that space. And while I realize you guys aren't (50:32) working on more subscription-type arrangements, does it all change your outlook for the more, more of the larger projects that we've seen in the past?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. Not quite sure what you're referring to with respect to discretionary pullbacks. We had one relationship that was project-based and then got sort of put into just a fundamentally different context. But, no, I mean, 2016 has been a year for the acquisition of some very exciting name brand companies that are definitely new economy kinds of companies that have essentially come into our method. And we've also continued to have a lot of success with our way of partnering with others in the media world to be able to say very unique things to companies that are using old media and new media. And so, it's a very good story. And, it's very broadly based. It's the same story as it was a year ago, exciting and growing.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Good morning. So, what's causing the slowdown in implementations? Is it decisions on the part of the customer? And have you seen any cancellations?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","No, to your last question. And, basically, some of the things that we do, and I'll actually make a comment about the longer term by the way, but some of things that we do have an on premises quality which require customers and their IT departments to do something in order to get hooked up to our solutions. And so, there are just kind of occasions where, as they're moving into our product suite, they just need to essentially to be sort of scheduling the implementations and that's something that isn't always entirely in our control.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And then, given the reinsurance and demand comments, any early thoughts about maybe your outlook for insurance for 2017? I figured I would try. Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Well, we remain very, very excited about our business. And just this fall, having gone through long-range multi-year plans for all parts of the business including all the parts of the insurance business, I think we have the most robust view of new forms of value that we can bring to the market that we've ever had. I think the pipeline of internal opportunities has never been stronger.","So, insurance remains a world where you can really think of an insurance company as an information factory and there are many, many insurance companies and they're all in different places in terms of their journey towards data analytic proficiency. They are all I think, in varying degrees becoming even more comfortable with the thought of third-parties like ourselves contributing to what it is that they're doing. So, the environment in general, is one that our approach which is vertical data analytics is a meaningful one.","And we're actually having a two-day customer conference beginning tomorrow for our North American customers and it's very exciting. The attendee list is very exciting and what we're going to be talking about is really interesting, future oriented stuff.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani, KBW. Your line is open","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Quick follow-up. The tax benefit you mentioned from the UK legislation, did you say that was a one-time benefit or could it have an enduring benefit going forward as well?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. So, basically, there are two elements. There was about $0.04 in the quarter that was one-time. The rate basically came down by a percentage point in the UK and there, the change that we make to our deferred tax asset is a result of that, that's the one-time, but obviously the lower rate of one point will continue through the future.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","That's helpful, thanks. And, the other question, I know you said WoodMac, you still expect it to be flat for the year as you said before. Did you say earlier what the organic constant currency was for WoodMac this quarter specifically?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","No. We haven't called that out quarter-by-quarter, but I think we're tracking to the full-year view. And the reason we talk about it that way is that's really consistent with how we run the business.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right, perfect. Thank you very much for the answers.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning. I'm outside here, so hopefully you can hear me clearly.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","We can hear you fine.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","My first question was, in the past, you talked about efforts with the connected car and the push to kind of be the part or help to shape the ecosystem for data shared between OEMs, property insurers and drivers. I didn't know if you have anything new on that and how you are thinking about the opportunity there?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So, we continue to be really at the forefront of this as it relates to the insurance industry in connecting OEMs and to others, together with insurers. I think it's just a very difficult process to try to connect with all the numbers, contributors, all the different OEMs as an example, and 300 insurers, 400 insurers that may be interested in it.","So, we are making good progress with other OEMs, meaning other car manufacturers, as well as folks who do central alarm systems and connected home, things like that, because we think it will be a key element in understanding, assessing and rating in the insurance policy. We've made good progress both here, and it also kind of creates a nice beachhead for us in international expansion opportunities.","So, I think we are a little ahead of the markets right now, but I think we are well positioned and Scott earlier mentioned, there's a industry conference we're holding later this week, and that will be a featured part of the presentations and we'll have some news information about that as well.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","My last follow-up would be the Argus partnership with Nielsen, some of the market impact of this has been tremendously successful. I was wondering, one, is that agreement exclusive or could you partner with potentially some of the others in that space which is growing rapidly? And similarly, are you thinking of any alternative areas where you could use Argus data outside of the traditional credit suite?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. We're not, Andre, talking about the specific partnerships. I realize that there is sort of chatter in the market, et cetera. But we, ourselves, aren't really talking about who our partners are. But I will say that it's a rich ecosystem and we are relating to a number of players in the space.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Okay.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","I will now turn the call back to our presenters for closing remarks.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We appreciate your interest. And I hope and expect we'll see a number of you at our Investor Day next month, and, which we're looking forward to. And until then, be well.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Verisk Analytics Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Thank you. Ms. Eva Huston, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, you may begin.","Eva Huston","Great. Thank you, Brandy, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2012 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following some comments by Frank, Scott and Mark, highlighting key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions.","The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-K were provided on Tuesday and can be found in the Investor website of our -- Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Frank Coyne.","Frank J. Coyne","Thank you, Eva, and good morning. Before going into comments on the third quarter, I would like to say our thoughts are with all our employees and all others who have been impacted by Sandy. We have continued to be operational throughout the storm and its aftermath and are supporting our customers at our usual excellent level of service. However, due to some travel and power issues, the management participants in this call are not in the same location.","In third quarter 2012, we delivered strong overall performance of over 17% total revenue growth and 20% diluted adjusted EPS growth. Overall, our consolidated organic revenue growth was 8.5%, reflecting strong growth in healthcare and good growth in insurance solutions.  Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth was 10.8%. Profitability was strong with an EBITDA margin of 45.9% in the quarter. Free cash flow was also strong, increasing over 15% year-to-date after adjusting for certain timing items and the previously discussed pension funding.  We are pleased with our results in the quarter.","In the third quarter, our Risk Assessment revenue grew 4.9%, after adjusting for the impact of a transfer of some revenue to Decision Analytics in 2012. This growth is a continuation of what you saw in the first half and evidence of our strong subscription model.  In Decision Analytics, our revenue grew almost 30%, and our insurance solutions grew about 9%, even while we continue to face tough comps with regards to storm activity in 2011.","While we certainly will see claims coming through from Hurricane Sandy, much of our claims volume revenue is contracted above current volume, and we will still experience tough comps versus fourth quarter 2011.","Our healthcare solutions continued on the excellent organic growth path we have seen in the past few quarters, growing revenue above 47% organically in the quarter. Total healthcare revenue grew -- growth was almost 130% bolstered by the contributions MediConnect continues to make.  In the quarter, we generated almost $70 million in revenue from our healthcare business. Compared to 3Q 2009, our first quarter reporting after our IPO, our reported healthcare revenue increased by fivefold in just 3 years, making it a meaningful part of our enterprise.","In mortgage and financial services, we are pleased to have closed our acquisition of Argus. And in the first month since closing, performance has been on target, and our future expectations have been reconfirmed.  With our mortgage tools, we are seeing recent trends continuing. Our origination-related revenue continues to grow in line with the market, while our overall mortgage revenue declined due to lower volumes of forensic review.","We remain disciplined in our use of capital and are focused on delivering shareholder returns. Year-to-date, we have spent almost $800 million on acquisitions. We are excited about these acquisitions and believe our shareholders should be pleased by this use of capital, as evidenced by the acquisition's strong initial results and strategic fit.","As we have previously communicated, we moderated our share repurchase in the quarter to about $21 million. We continue to be active in looking at M&A, but also continue to maintain our discipline, focusing on assets with the true strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth. We also remain focused on meeting our commitments to our debt holders as it relates to delevering back to our target ratios.","In this quarter, we had strong financial results, and behind the numbers are many initiatives that we expect to bear fruit in the future. The creativity and deep domain expertise of our teams is evident, as we discussed our near-term and long-term objectives. And with our diversified portfolio, we have the ability to weather global uncertainty, while continuing to build a stronger Verisk.","Now I'll turn it over to Scott to give you details about our progress in healthcare and other parts of the business.","Scott G. Stephenson","Thank you, Frank. We have a lot of exciting initiatives going on at Verisk, and I wanted to share a few with you to give you a sense of our current customer interactions, as well as some emerging opportunities that are not yet reflected in our numbers.","First, our teams at AIR and AER have been working round the clock to provide real-time updates to their forecast on the path and impact of Hurricane Sandy. These estimates are vital to our customers, as they help them to understand what to expect and what will likely be a major impact on their business and operations.  While our teams may be operating remotely, they are in constant communication with customers about the storm. It's events like this that highlight our importance of our customers.","Now to talk about the value we bring, away from the storm, our Healthcare business is performing very well and also exceeding -- executing on its plans for the future. We continue to make progress on our unified healthcare platform, and it is proceeding as expected.","We talked about having a new customer live and on the fraud platform last quarter. And more recently, we expect to use the combined fraud platform to bring a large corporate customers' healthcare claims together to allow them to see aggregate spend across employees and coverage limits in the fourth quarter this year.  We estimate that our tool could save them substantial dollars and have a very strong ROI.","We are also making excellent progress in bringing together our MediConnect business with our revenue integrity platform, a lot of this work is operational and involves ensuring that we work together seamlessly, both on the sales front and also on the customer delivery front.","We are finding the teams energized by working together, as well as being a part of the bigger Verisk health platform and mission. As well, we continue to see the combination of our solutions and teams resonating with customers through new sales and improving product pipelines.","We also continue to work to find ways to use our numerous capabilities in data sets across multiple functions, verticals or geographies. The aggregated medical database for P&C insurers for healthcare claims is running well and bringing significant value to our customers. We are also continuing our development of the next generation platform for our catastrophe models, and we expect to launch the customers in 2013.","We are also using our weather data for P&C companies and continue to make traction in that space. And with the addition of Argus, we have spent time during the first 60 days holding brainstorming sessions between the Argus team and existing Verisk businesses. These sessions are leading to discoveries around how we can repurpose the data models built by Argus to deliver solutions to other customers, including in the insurance space.","Internationally, we are working on translating our substantial intellectual property into new markets, where no or limited analytics exist today. This is a long-term project, but the reception we're finding so far is very encouraging.","All of what we are doing is about creating innovation within our company, as that will permit us to reimagine and enlarge our markets. We must continue to know both our current customers' value propositions, as well as relate to our customers as development partners, and we're committed to both.","With that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results.","Mark V. Anquillare","Thanks, Scott. You've heard some of the exciting things that are going on in our business, and I'll share some of the numbers as the results of these efforts.","In the third quarter, we delivered 17.3% total revenue growth and 8.5% organic revenue growth. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic growth in the quarter was 10.8%.  For the third quarter, our Decision Analytics segment revenue continued to lead with 27.4% growth, of which 11% was organic, excluding the acquisitions of MediConnect, Aspect Loss Prevention and Argus, as well as the transferred revenue for the mortgage appraisal tools.","As a reminder, in 2012, we transferred revenue related to the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessments, property-specific revenue categories into Decision Analytics mortgage and financial services revenue category. We will continue to provide you visibility into the apples-to-apples comparisons throughout 2012.","Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category grew 8.6% in the third quarter and 8.3% organically, excluding June, July acquisition of Aspect Loss Prevention. We continued strong double-digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions.  We also saw improved growth in our loss quantification solutions despite continued to lower levels of storm activity in 2012 versus the same period in 2011.","I knew you have a question on the impact of Sandy on our volumes through exact analysis. As you may remember, our multi-year customer contracts include an annual days number of claims to be processed that varies by client. To give you a sense, we are tracking below the contracted amounts of claims year-to-date. So we don't expect to see the transactional bump we saw last year, when clients went into overages.  For 2012, we have approximately 20% more claims volumes under contract than in 2011. So we're not currently forecasting overages.  Also in the quarter, Claims Solutions delivered good growth.","In mortgage and financial services, we grew 10.8%, reflecting the addition of Argus as of August 31. Argus is an excellent business, and we're pleased with the performance today and continue to see opportunity, at least as large than we initially anticipated. After adjusting for the acquisition of Argus and it's transfer to the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment into this revenue category in the third quarter revenues declined 11.9%.","We continue to see the same themes that we've been discussing in previous quarters. Underwriting tools grew nicely in the quarter and reflected the growth in the mortgage application to the market. Our revenue from forensic solutions declined in the quarter, more than offsetting that growth.","To provide additional clarity on these trends, a quick reminder about the shape of our business. Broadly speaking, there are 2 types and 2 parts of the mortgage business, what we call the front end, the part that are related to originations and refinancings. It's about half of the mortgage business and is performing well. The other part is what we call the forensic piece. That's about half the business and about 4% of consolidated revenue in the quarter.","The forensic business benefited from the surge in demand in the wake of the financial crisis. That demand is now subsiding. To frame the potential downside for you, before the crisis, the forensic business is about $10 million on an annual basis, with business primarily from 1 of our 2 large current customers. We are now in the process of reverting to historic levels.  However, because our customers remain somewhat uncertain about where their needs will stabilize, it is harder for us to get kind of forward visibility into our mortgage revenue that characterizes most of our businesses.","Based upon our latest review of the mortgage business, our current expectation is that there is more revenue likely to roll off as a part of this normalization process, including in the fourth quarter of 2012. We have projected in early 2012 that our mortgage revenue in aggregate for the year will decline similar to the fourth quarter 2010 or about 7%.","Our current revenue expectation for the fourth quarter now leads us to believe the decline for the full year 2012 will be in the 12% to 15% range. The EBITDA margins in this business are below the segment average, so there is less of an impact on the bottom line than top line.  Now, of course, when we aren't standing still, we continue to develop new solutions that bring value to our customers, and those opportunities will create new revenue streams in our forensic space.","Healthcare continues strong revenue growth, 129% for the third quarter and 47.4% organic. Healthcare organic growth year-to-date is 41%. Our total growth benefited from the second quarter addition of MediConnect.","Organically, we continue to add, implement new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers. Both the acquisitions of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners became part of the organic growth calculation this quarter and have added to organic growth, although all of the businesses are growing nicely.","As a reminder, we do have seasonality in our Revenue Integrity and MediConnect businesses related to the CMS review cycle. And the revenue between third quarter and fourth quarter can be a bit fluid depending on customer schedules. While I expect to see strong, continued growth year-over-year next quarter, we may see a modest sequential dip in dollar revenue.  Our Specialized Markets grew 11% in the third quarter, with growth both from the supply chain solutions as well as weather analytics.","Turning to Risk Assessment. We reported revenue growth of 2.8% in the quarter and 4.9% after adjusting for the impact of the transfer we discussed earlier.  Our industry-standard programs grew 5.8% in the quarter, reflecting our 2012 invoices and strong growth from our premium leakage solutions. Our property-specific revenue declined 5.1% as reported, but excluding the transfer grew 4% based upon new sales and higher volumes, as well as growth in appraisal solutions.","EBITDA for the third quarter was $182.9 million as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 21.1% for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 45.9%, reflecting good expense management, as well as seasonal benefit of some of our healthcare businesses. We continue to see opportunities from investing in future growth, and as you remember, those can have a near-term impact on margins, but grow our future opportunity.","In the quarter, the Risk Assessment margins were 54.6% versus 50.5% in third quarter 2011. We benefited by about 2% on the margin due to this lower pension costs related to the freeze of the plan in February. Our business continues to show scalable profitability, while we also continue to invest in developing new solutions.  Margins in Decisions Analytics was 40.9% in third quarter 2012 versus 40.1% in third quarter 2011. Our acquisitions of MediConnect and Argus added slightly to our margins.","Our interest expense was up $3.5 million versus third quarter 2011, based upon higher debt balances related to our acquisitions. We ended third quarter with total debt of $1.6 billion, including the $380 million to fund the Argus acquisition on August 31.  Our reported effective tax rate was 39.3% for the quarter, which we expect to continue for the rest of 2012.","Coming down to net income. We focus on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we defined in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense, less income tax, except on that acquisition -- on that amortization.  Our adjusted net income increased 20.9% to $92.2 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS, on a fully diluted basis, was $0.54, an increase of 20%, a great growth rate.","The average diluted share count was 171.7 million shares in the quarter. As of September 30, 2012, our diluted share count was 171.5 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased 425,000 shares or about $21 million. At quarter end, we had about 179 million left under our authorization. As we discussed last quarter, we have moderated our buyback program after acquiring Argus to ensure that we meet our deleveraging commitments. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs of over 25%.","Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, our cash and cash equivalents were $98 million. Total debt, both short term and long term, totaled about $1.6 billion, reflecting the borrowed funds to acquire Argus, which closed on August 31.","Post-Argus, our debt capacity is over $850 million and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA ratio at September 30, including a full year of historical results for both MediConnect and Argus, was 2.2x, down from the pro forma ratio of 2.35x we cited at the time of the acquisition. As we've stated before, we are willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt-to-EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunity, because our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly.","Free cash flow in the first 9 months of 2012, which we define as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, was $264.2 million, a decrease of about $11.3 million or negative 4.1% versus the 9 months of 2011. This decline was principally due to the funding of our pension, which we have mentioned previously. Excluding the impact of our pension, net of the tax benefit and certain year-over-year timing issues, our free cash flow was up about 16%.","Our capital expenditures was about 5.1% of revenue for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012. Free cash flow represented 52.2% of EBITDA in the first 9 months of 2012, reflecting a reduced conversion rate due to the $72 million pension funding, partially offset by the associated tax benefit.","As we have indicated previously, we moderate our share buyback program as we delever following the solid acquisitions we made this year. We would anticipate that the share count in 4Q may be up about 1%.","Overall, our business is performing very well, and we have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals and continue to invest in the future. We see that both our subscription and transaction revenue is growing well. Even with our transaction revenue, while we see some variations around that revenue, the purchase of our solutions is largely nondiscretionary, and therefore, we have good visibility into the future.","With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Mark, with the guidance you gave about the sequential dip in healthcare revenue and absolute dollar terms for Q4, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this right. Would that assume a year-over-year growth rate in the single digits to the maybe the low to mid-teens?","Mark V. Anquillare","Well, I mean, I don't want get into very specifics. I didn't go over -- just trying to describe this. We see very strong growth for healthcare, both in aggregate and organically in fourth quarter. But when you consider seasonality, and if you actually look at the absolute dollars in third quarter relative to fourth quarter, we're just talking about what we see from an absolute dollar amount, 4Q relative to 3Q.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then starting again next year, and then '13, would you suspect the growth rates to reaccelerate then?","Mark V. Anquillare","Well, we have high hopes, and we continue to be very bullish on the prospects for healthcare. So I think we feel good about healthcare. We continue to just describe that it's a growing business. We expect growth. But over time, the law of large numbers takes over. So we would expect that it's going to be -- continue to grow. But at the percent levels of today, I think will be diminishing over time.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, just one more in healthcare. In the past, you talked about being in early innings in terms of completing implementations and then being able to recognize revenue. Are we still in the early innings there or no? And then how is the pace of new integration startups going?","Mark V. Anquillare","So let me take the beginning of that, and then maybe I can ask Scott to just comment. So the first thing that we're -- are saying is a, from a back-end perspective, from a fraud perspective, we are implementing the customers. You're seeing that in the revenue now, and we have a very good and improved process around implementing customers. So there's a combination of a, existing customers rolling out more regions and states. That's good that's in, and that continues. At the same time, we have signed new customers. And that does take a little time to ramp up, and that will have kind of more of a tail to it into 2013. That is particularly true on the front end. When we sell the customer on the front end, we do require information and data from them, And then we turn around some of the models. And there, there's a little bit of a deferral until we are able to deliver the product to those customers. So that is also kind of a deferral of sorts from a revenue rack. But I think you see the trend, and you can see the opportunity, as both the pipeline and new customers come to fruition are implemented. Scott, maybe you can comment a little more on the progress.","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, I think you said it well. I would just add that this effect of catching up with respect to implementations is particularly felt in our payment accuracy business. And we're certainly not complete in that process, but we do continue to make progress, as Mark said. And I would just say that you have to account for the fact that our mix is shifting a little bit also. And all of what we do that we call Revenue Integrity is just becoming a more and more important fraction of the total of what we do in the healthcare space. So we do have a mix effect in there as well.","Eva Huston","Eric, it's Eva. I just want to add one clarifying point on healthcare. Fourth quarter 2011 healthcare revenue was $38 million. And this quarter, we did $69 million.","Frank J. Coyne","And you did have a question on how the integration is going, and we're very pleased with our progress there. And the synergies of the business are really showing enhanced opportunities in the marketplace.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Evercore Partners. Scott, could you provide a little bit more granular insight into the underlying drivers of the 47% organic revenue growth in healthcare? And to what extent is superior growth sustainable in this business? Perhaps not at the 47% level, but if you could perhaps take us out into 2013 and talk about how some of those growth drivers might play out?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes, happy to. First of all, I think everybody's aware, but I'll just kind of refresh you that we actually do a variety of different things in the healthcare space. We do risk adjusting, which we call our Enterprise Analytics group, and all of the analytics driven off of that. We do payment accuracy, which is combing through claims flows to make sure that there are no fraudulent ways or abusive claims. And then we do a lot of work in the revenue integrity space, which is the collection of things that we do, which is fundamentally that helping plans to assure that they're being completely and properly reimbursed for the work that they do, particularly if it's in the Medicare context, so a wide variety of things. And MediConnect, our most recent acquisition, actually supports both the revenue integrity business, but also the opportunity to accumulate clinical data will increasingly become meaningful inside of our enterprise analytics. So with that as the backdrop, we're really kind of hitting on all cylinders is the sort of the first part of the answer. So I wouldn't really point to any one thing. I would say that it is the case that Verisk Health collectively has really emerged as a meaningful vendor inside of the space. We bring a number of things. We bring a lot of unique intellectual property. We bring kind of a unique positioning, because, we, I think, we're seen as, in many ways, as kind of a Switzerland inside of the space. I think it's been noticed by the marketplace that Verisk is strongly supportive of what -- of our business in the healthcare arena. And so that kind of corporate commitment, I think, does -- we're selling a lot of enterprise-level applications. And so that level of commitment really does communicate into the market, creating an even greater sense of confidence to buy our solutions. And the healthcare space remains one where there is mounting interest on the part of our customers in using data analytics to drive their decision making. So it's -- it's very broadly based, I would say. And as Mark said before, we remain very optimistic about the opportunity to continue to grow the business in the future. I mean, we have, from time to time, at Investor Day meetings and in other forums, just made the point that the space is very large. And you know what our run rate was in the third quarter. We are still relatively modest in terms of the fraction of the overall market that we represent. So it's a very broad -- and what's happening right now is very broadly based. It's not one part of our business, and it's not one team. And it's certainly not related to what's going on with respect to regulation in the healthcare space. That's sort of mildly benign from our perspective.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Bracket for us, some reasonable organic growth expectations for healthcare in 2013?","Scott G. Stephenson","I don't think we put out numbers like that. But the -- again, I'll just say that the kinds of conditions, which are underlying the performance that we've turned in recently, we don't see any changes in those. Obviously, third quarter organically was very strong, but the underlying conditions remain.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And just a question for Mark, if I might. I just want to understand your comments on the mortgage business. For 2012, I think your updated guidance was down 12% to 15% for the year versus 7%. What's changing your thinking on the forensic side that would lead you to reduce guidance for the year?","Mark V. Anquillare","I think the short answer is, we are very much dependent upon our customers to provide us with insight as to what and how much service they need, and we just haven't seen the type of commitment from customers that we need to feel confident about fourth quarter. And specifically, we think that they're going to need less. So we are trying to provide you with as much information insight as we have. The reality is most of our businesses, those type of transactional services are very much nondiscretionary in the minds of most of our customers. The mortgage, and specifically, the forensic review, is unlike that, and we just felt that, that's the best guess right now around 4Q.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Are you signaling cost reduction actions to limit any earnings impact from that decline?","Mark V. Anquillare","Well, I think we've always been very cost conscious. So to the extent that you think about a decline in top line, we're going to be try to be as thoughtful around expenses as possible. But obviously, it's tough to pull enough expense out to offset the type of declines that we've seen on the top.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the trajectory of the RA growth, which has been mid single-digit going into next year. And I wanted to know if it's likely that Verisk's RA segment will accelerate in 2013, knowing January is a key point, asking about the lag effects of the 4% P&C premium growth in 2011.","Frank J. Coyne","Yes, Mark?","Mark V. Anquillare","Sure. Thank you, Frank. I think what we continue to see is, first of all, we like the fact that, there's a stronger market that helps our customers and, obviously, a customer that is feeling good about their business, they make it more apt to more likely to purchase services from others. when we think about, specifically, premiums, I think the way we continue to interact with customers is not just about a Risk Assessment or how our industry standard programs will interact. But more importantly, what's the best way to grow our business with our customers across the insurance space in broad term. So clearly, the harder market or at least better pricing, I'm not sure if it's going to be called the harder market, will potentially have good news for our customers. I think we're going to remain as pretty tempered in the way we think about Risk Assessment, because what we really believe is the opportunity to grow inside those insurance customers is to sell them some Decision Analytics customer -- excuse me, Decision Analytics products and our customers receive value there. And we think that's the best way to grow our business, and we continue to believe that.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure. No, I understand your answer. And surely, a broader customer sell is great, but is it there some mechanics with your RA line and the premiums that are up in 2011?","Frank J. Coyne","So I think you were talking about the industry-standard program. Those premiums are related to our invoices. But as I said, I think we've always described it as -- typically, we try to put in some type of inflationary type of increases. And I think we would continue to think about that into the future, because we really do believe there's some good opportunity to make sure that we can sell -- continue to sell more product and bigger volumes of product into those customers, as well as those industry-standard programs. So I don't see a sweeping uptake, no. I think we will be pretty tempered in the way we handle those.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kelly Flynn with Credit Suisse.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I want to go back to healthcare. I was wondering if you could just be a little bit more clear in the sequential revenue decline. Do you expect that at both MediConnect and the rest of the Healthcare business? Or is it going to be more pronounced at one or the other?","Frank J. Coyne","Mark, why don't you start that?","Mark V. Anquillare","Sure. So I think we've always talked about the fact that a combination of MediConnect and the Revenue Integrity businesses are very much focused on the latter part of the year, and it's tied to the CMS review process. So what we're just trying to describe is that we continue to see wonderful growth. But as you think about those 2 businesses, which are, for the most part, the latter part of the year weighted, it's a little difficult to understand how things move between third and fourth quarter. And we have seen a good third quarter. I think we would continue to see a good fourth quarter. But in absolute dollar terms, we could see a slight dip between third and fourth quarter because of those 2 specific businesses.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, I mean, just back to the comment someone made earlier about the implied growth. I mean, I think it does come in at the high single-digits organically, if you calculate based on everything you said. And I know you tried to clarify, Eva, but it didn't really change the imprint, so I'm just wondering if you want to clarify any further.","Eva Huston","Yes, Kelly, I think if you did the simple math, and you took -- again, we're not going to give you forecast for the fourth quarter, but look at the third quarter revenue, look at what MediConnect did. And if you just did that simple math and took out MediConnect, because again, where I believe you're getting too organic, you would see a double-digit growth rate, if you did that math. Now both of those pieces may move a bit, but I think that, that would be the simple math.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then can we talk about Argus? I think you said -- I think maybe, Frank, in your comments that your future expectations were reconfirmed. But I was hoping you could just reconfirm them as far as the numbers. Are you still also thinking about that as a 15% to 20% organic grower? And then maybe you could comment on the margins. I think Mark said they were accretive to the corporate margin. Does that imply that it's higher than what the EBITDA margin was this quarter? And that's what we should expect going forward?","Frank J. Coyne","Yes, I'll turn to Mark for the numbers. But I would reconfirm, and Scott had indicated in his comments that as we have visited with Argus that has both great leadership and tremendous assets, we see a lot of opportunities for our entire enterprise. Beyond our original expectations, though we were optimistic that, that's what we would find. Mark, why don't you comment on the numbers?","Mark V. Anquillare","Sure. I mean, everything that we've said in the past, with regard to the growth rate that you described are -- I think we remain consistent with us. And specifically around margins, yes, I mean, the Argus has some wonderful margins. As you've seen in historic results, they're actually running ahead of the Verisk margins, and I think that will continue into the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Unknown Analyst","[indiscernible] in for Tim this morning. I just want -- I appreciate the color you guys you gave earlier on the healthcare business. And I just want to specifically ask about MediConnect. If we compare that to the rest of the healthcare practice, how would you compare that growth rate? Is it similar, is it slower or faster on a organic basis?","Frank J. Coyne","Mark?","Mark V. Anquillare","So MediConnect, once again, was not a part of our operations in 2011. And if you looked at some of the filings we did regarding the prior year, I think you'll see that MediConnect has been growing extremely well, and I think, probably, a little bit faster than the organic growth we even described for our healthcare business. So they are doing well. And it is -- it's ramped very nicely. And I think, as Scott described, a part of the power of MediConnect is not just Medicaid alone, it's a part of that overall suite of solutions. The business that is our Revenue Integrity business, in combination with some of the HEDIS reporting and the MediConnect business all in one provide a very nice suite of solutions to a set of customers. And I think it's been well received by our customers.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then if we looked at the acquisition environment right now, could you maybe talk a little bit about the opportunities you're seeing there? And if there are any particular sectors you guys are looking at more than others?","Frank J. Coyne","Yes, let me comment on that. There are opportunities out there. There are no particular sectors that we look at more the others. As I observed in my comments, and this is Frank, we're looking for good strategic fits at what we consider an appropriate price, given the growth profile the companies that we look at. There are certain characteristics that we particularly like that is that they have business models much like the businesses that we have. And as we look for international opportunity, that's a plus. But we see opportunities, especially in supply chain, to add to our portfolio. But we're not exclusive to just that. We look across the entire spectrum of our strategic map.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Clark with KBW.","William Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Healthcare margins being modestly lower than insurance, yet you've been able to maintain and even grow overall Decision Analytics margins as healthcare has become a bigger piece of that segment. Just trying to find out if you'd say that, that's more due to the GAAP between healthcare and insurance margins closing? Or are you seeing margin expansion across all verticals and the difference between kind of product types is staying about the same?","Frank J. Coyne","Mark? Mark, are you still with us?","Mark V. Anquillare","Sure, I apologize. One of the great things about all of our businesses, there's natural operating leverage across the board. So to your specific question, we have seen an increase in the margins inside of our Healthcare business, in part, that's because we have more volumes running through, doesn't take as many people to run those volumes through to natural scale. The other thing that has happened is to the point that we're talking about earlier, we weren't able to recognize as much revenue. Implementation takes time. It takes effort. And then sometimes, that revenue is somewhat deferred. So you're seeing the cumulative effects of both of those on the Healthcare business. And also, just to be clear, across-the-board, with the exception of mortgage, obviously, we see and have seen scale and ramping margins in our Decision Analytics businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Raymond James.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So a question for you on your long-term EBITDA margin targets. We've talked about 43% to 45% in the past, and you guys look like you're on target to actually be above that potentially this year. And with the Argus acquisition, that would seem to put upward pressure on that. So with that in mind, is that still a way we should be thinking about it? Or are we thinking that it's probably likely to move up into the 44% to 46% range?","Frank J. Coyne","Mark?","Mark V. Anquillare","Sure, so let me take that on. I think the reality is, yes you're right, right now, we are running a bit above. I think what we continue to talk to you about and make sure everyone's aware of is that we really don't think about ways that we can keep our margins high. We think about ways that we can grow cash flows, and we can grow our top line for the long term. With that in mind, we are happy to see a lot of our business units coming to us with investment ideas and investment opportunity that have started in third quarter and will continue into 4Q and into '13? So there's some costs that we feel will happen. We also expect that will contribute to the top line into the future. And although Argus and MediConnect have some very strong margins, as you noted, it is tough to find businesses to acquire that have those type of margin characteristics. So as we think about the long term, still -- we think we still remain a little bit tempered about how big those margins can be, because what we're most and first focused on is longer-term growth.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if you could remind us the comps on the mortgage business in the fourth quarter versus third quarter, I believe, eased. Is that enough to offset some of that decline? Or are we still likely to see another 200 basis point type drag?","Mark V. Anquillare","Just to recap. I mean, I think when we talked about the range of 12% to 15% for the full year, we factored in the fourth quarter of 2011. So I think that is kind of our best guess, full year, including the comp in 4Q of '11.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. One last question for you was on the -- your -- how do you balance the -- your goal of taking leverage from 2.2 to 2? And then also the share repurchase and the M&A opportunities?","Mark V. Anquillare","Good question. I think what we've tried to do is really be very thoughtful about our capital management program. So at the time Argus came along, we were in talks and knew about Argus for a long time. It was a unique opportunity. And we said, we want to continue to be very growth oriented. That is our primary focus. And at that point, we've been telling everybody that we would go above that 2x target. I think, once that happened and we jumped above the 2x, we now have been thoughtful about the cash that goes out the door, and that comes in the form of acquisitions. We will do the right acquisitions. There'll probably be for a bit of a time, a little bit smaller. At the same time, we've also dialed back our buyback program, so that hopefully, in the near term, we'll be back towards that 2x level. And we have a little greater flexibility around acquisitions, as we kind of go into the future towards the latter part of -- in the middle of 2013.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Could you remind us, how big is the catastrophe modeling business as a percentage of revenue? And with Sandy and, obviously, Katrina not that far back. While, the claims, it sounds like you're not going to get a spike there. Does it impact kind of your clients' view on overall P&C, and just bode well for the business longer-term as we think about it going forward?","Frank J. Coyne","Mark, do you want to start that with percentages?","Mark V. Anquillare","Sure. So let me -- first of all, obviously, we haven't provided you specific visibility into the cat remodeling business. It is a significant part of our insurance category within Decision Analytics. It has been growing very nicely over the last year. And I think, Frank, from the standpoint of characteristics and how the market...","Frank J. Coyne","Yes, I'll go there. And yes, sure. I'd make this observation. We -- the cat modeling business did not get recognized until we had Andrew on the heels of Hugo, '89 and 2002, I think, Andrew was. And then, since then, of course, it has had significant tick up. What will likely happen here is that we -- number one, AIR delivers great science and great products, and that's being recognized. So we're getting more opportunities to be sometimes an additional model to companies that have not been customers of ours in the past. We have done 100% of the cat bonds. We have the model within 100% of the cat bonds that have been issued this year. And we're finding that other industries are recognizing the value of these catastrophe models and their enterprise risk management. So we will see -- we'll, a, recognition of the value proposition around the product. And b, I think, that we'll see more market opportunities as risk managers understand that these cat models can be used in their organizations beyond just P&C.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And Frank, can you just remind us what other industries beyond the traditional P&C your kind of focusing on this services?","Frank J. Coyne","Well, I can point to one that we've already gotten some pickup, and that's crop, where the models have that impact. But when you think of supply chain in its entirety, the disruption associated with that, I think, is going to cause -- with Sandy is going to cost increased focus on how companies can get a better handle, enterprises can get a better handle on their exposures.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. And again, there are no further questions.","Frank J. Coyne","Do we have no more questions, operator?","Operator","No, sir, there are no further questions.","Frank J. Coyne","Okay, well, thank you very much. We appreciate everyone joining us. We're sorry that we had a delay, but we think it was a prudent decision. And we appreciate the value of the questions and the quality of them and look forward to speaking with you the next quarter. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.","Eva F. Huston","Thank you, Julie, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2013 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days until December 6, 2013, on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott G. Stephenson","Thank you, Eva, and good morning all. Before I launch into the financial results for this quarter, which were solid but shy of our longer-term objectives, I'd like to review several recent accomplishments. We are confident our long-term prospects remain excellent.","Over the years, you've heard us speak about running the business with a long-term prospective. Our view on this remains consistent. Recently, we put more emphasis on our innovation agenda, which has always been an underlying theme for how we have grown while delighting our customers. Our long-term management of the business and our determination to innovate are very well aligned. Innovation works over long cycles, and we will continue to invest in a thoughtful way to support new data analytics solutions for our customers, which will result in strong revenue growth over time.","We remain focused on our twin goals of organic growth through innovation and operating our business with efficiency and scalability. We were pleased to achieve several innovation milestones in the third quarter, including initial customer use of our pooled data initiative for healthcare, our first provision of Roof Insight reports using aerial imagery and the first sale of our new supply chain platform. While these initiatives are not revenue-generating in the quarter or materially in 2013, they are a good indication of future opportunity.","To delve a bit deeper into what these can mean, let me take as an example the new pooled data initiative to fight healthcare fraud, which Verisk Health launched in the third quarter. With some of the nation's leading healthcare payors joining as founding members, we built a database across payor information and analytics designed to combat the estimated $300 billion that America's healthcare loses annually to fraud, waste and abuse. This initiative will turn the identification of improper or elicit billing practices from an abstract view into an actionable one and save millions in claims dollars in the process. For the first time, healthcare payors will be afforded the same comprehensive view of suspect providers and schemes that has proved so successful for the property casualty industry through our claim search platform.","As another example, as the fourth quarter began, we announced the creation of the Verisk Climate division. Our customers in insurance and government and across the supply chain are increasingly voicing concern about the effects that climate volatility and environmental extremes are having on their operations and on their earnings. We formed the Verisk Climate division to introduce new weather and environmental analytics that will enable our clients to assess and plan for environmental impacts and to implement strategies to differentiate and grow their businesses despite those impacts. We and our customers will benefit as we create integrated solutions that directly leverage the data and platforms of our other Verisk operating units. While we manage the business with a long-term of view, we are mindful of the need to execute day to day, and we understand our progress toward our strategic objectives.","In the third quarter, our organic growth was a bit soft for 3 reasons: first, property claims activity was low relative to historic norms leading to moderated transaction volumes on our claims estimating platform for the property and casualty industry; second, our mortgage business continues to adjust downward toward historic norms with respect to the analysis of defaulted loans; and third, we made the decision to accept downward price adjustments in the Revenue and Quality Intelligence division of Verisk Health in order to achieve higher committed volumes with key customers on a multi-year basis.","Last quarter, we shared with you our forecast for our organic growth at Verisk Health, and we now expect organic growth for 2013 to be in the 12% to 14% range. The differences between our original assumptions and today were changes at 4 customer accounts. In 3 cases, work has been slow to start or ramp, and in one case, we made price concessions in exchange for multi-year volume commitments. Having redoubled our efforts to forecast this highly transactional business, we are comfortable that we can grow revenue in this business in the mid-teens in 2014. While our near-term outlook has changed, there has been no change in the market size or our opportunity to compete in the vertical. Corporately, we will remain focused on the efficiency of our operations while also elevating investment as we re-platform several solutions and acquire new data sets.","In the third quarter of 2013, we delivered a good overall performance with total revenue growth of 10% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of about 15%. Our consolidated organic revenue growth in the third quarter was about 6%, which is below our long-term historical trend line. Organic revenue growth was over 8% in the quarter, excluding our mortgage analytics business with its macro challenges. Profitability was strong with EBITDA margin over 46% in the quarter. We expect that level of margin to be a high watermark as we continue to manage toward our innovation agenda.","We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders, and we remain disciplined in our use of capital. We also remain active in looking at M&A. We continue to focus on assets with a strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth opportunities. In the quarter, we returned capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases of about $24 million. Our remaining authorization at the end of the quarter was $282 million. We will continue to use our authorization consistent with our capital allocation strategy as we previously outlined it.","And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.","Mark V. Anquillare","Thanks, Scott. For the third quarter, we again delivered both revenue growth and increased profitability. In the third quarter, total revenue grew 10%, and organic revenue grew 6.1%. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth in the quarter was 8.2%. Let me dive into the details for you.","For the third quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 11.2% of revenue growth, of which 5.2% was organic, excluding the acquisition of Argus. Beginning next quarter, Argus will be part of the organic revenue growth in the financial services category. Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category revenue grew 11.5% in the third quarter. We had discussed our expectation of accelerating revenue growth of the combined insurance revenue this year and are pleased to see ourselves continue in the direction with 9.5% organic revenue growth in the quarter, including Risk Assessment.","Our underwriting solutions delivered strong growth, and we saw a continued double-digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions in the quarter. Our claims solutions also contributed to growth but not as strongly as in the past due to historical claim trends Scott referenced. Additionally, we saw a benefit of a little over $3 million related to the implementation of our solutions with a large customer. The comparison in the fourth quarter for insurance are a bit tougher as we saw in the past 2 quarters.","In financial services, which includes both Argus and the mortgage analytics business, revenue grew 26.6% in the quarter. Argus has continued to perform very well since the acquisition in third quarter 2012. Argus is a very ISO-like business and serves as a trusted, neutral intermediary using a contributory data model to help create analytics, which are deeply embedded in our customers' workflows. The growth outlook at Argus remains positive, including through international expansion and partnering opportunities, as well as additional penetration of existing customers. We have seen growth of over 20% year-to-date at Argus on a pro-forma basis and feel good about exceeding our estimate of mid-teens growth in 2013.","The mortgage portion of the financial services revenue declined 16.6% in the third quarter. The origination-related revenue declined this quarter, about in line with the market and the ongoing normalization of the forensic piece of the business continued. We were glad to see a slower decline in forensic revenue again this quarter.","Full year 2013 results may be a little lower than the revenue decline we saw in 2012, which was about 11%. The mortgage market remains bumpy, and originations are expected to continue to decline through 2013.","Healthcare revenue grew 6.2% for the third quarter, which was below our expectations. We had a few customers where we now expect transactional volumes the come through later than we previously planned. In addition, we mentioned last quarter that there was an opportunity for us to trade near-term pricing for longer-term volume commitments. In some cases, we are seeing the volumes ramp up more slowly than our customers initially anticipated. These are very good customers where we continue see these agreements as win-win for our longer-term relationships. As a result, we now expect 2013 revenue growth to be between 12% and 14%. We expect growth in 2014 to be in the mid-teens. We remain excited about the opportunity in the healthcare space, and we expect growth to remain above the corporate average growth rate in 2014.","Our specialized markets revenue declined 1.4% in the quarter. Growth in weather and climate analytics was affected by lower growth in government contracts. We are pleased to see continuing traction in our efforts to re-purpose our intellectual property to meet strong demand from our P&C industry customers. We think our formation of Verisk Climate will enhance our ability to capitalize on that. Growth in environmental health and safety solutions were driven by ongoing customer agreements moderated by lower volumes from customer implementation projects. We expect to see a several million dollar sequential decline in specialized revenue next quarter due to cycling of government contracts in climate analytics prior to the ramp-up of our commercial solutions, as well as fewer environmental health and safety projects as we approach year end.","We think about AER and 3E as long-term options on a -- the growing use of analytics around climate and supply chain, and see them as elements for our growth agenda in the future. In our recent launch of Verisk Climate division and with our ongoing efforts in the supply chain area, we can start to see evidence of the kind of traction we hope to gain over time.","Turning to Risk Assessment. For the third quarter, we reported revenue growth of 7.8%, indicating the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew 5.1% in the quarter, reflecting our 2013 invoices, which were effective January 1. Our property-specific information revenue increased 17.2% in the quarter. This increase was from new sales and higher volumes from certain customers as they commit to expanded long-term contracts, as well as incremental revenue contributions due to the exploration of a revenue sharing agreement with a technology provider in the fourth quarter 2012. Innovation is also an important component of our heritage business. We continue to work closely with our customers to innovate around international solutions and enhanced predictive analytics and commercial real estate solutions building on our P&C expertise.","EBITDA for the third quarter was $202.9 million as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 10.9% for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 46.3%. As Scott mentioned, we are eager to continue our investment program and are focused on doing that while maintaining a strong margin profile. We intend to accelerate our investment in aerial imagery in the fourth quarter, which will likely have a P&L impact of about $10 million.","The margins in Decision Analytics were 41.4% in the third quarter 2013 versus 40.9% in the third quarter 2012. The margin in the quarter reflects good cost management even as revenue growth decelerated in the quarter. We continue to make the necessary investments in the business to support our innovation agenda.","In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 55.1% versus 54.6% third quarter of '12. Our margins were helped in the quarter by good cost management in natural scaling business.","We told you at the begin of the year that we expected our 2013 EBITDA margins to be flat to modestly down compared to 2012. Based on the investments discussed above and spending to support ongoing and future customer contracts, margins may be down up to 100 basis points. The net-net of all this is that we still feel confident that we'll be towards the upper end of the 43% to 45% EBITDA margin range in 2013, and we'll continue to drive EBITDA and free cash flow growth. You can expect in 2014 and forward that we'll continue to invest in new initiatives and accelerate them as appropriate, which will likely keep our margin in the current range.","Our interest expense was up $0.6 million in the third quarter versus the respective period in 2012. This increase was due to higher debt balances taken on during 2012 related to our acquisitions. We ended the third quarter with total debt of about $1.3 billion and no outstanding revolver borrowings. The total debt balance reflects the repayment in the quarter of about $100 million of our long-term private placement debt in August of 2013. At quarter end, we also repaid an additional $35 million in long-term private placement debt.","Our reported tax rate was 36.2% in the quarter. As discussed over the past several quarters, we've been working actively in our tax planning strategies. In the third quarter, we again saw a onetime benefit resulting from those efforts. We now expect the tax rate to be a little below 37% for the full year 2013. We expect the normalized rate to be about 38% for 2014 and forward.","Coming down to the net income line. We focused on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we define in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization less the income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 15% to $106 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.62 for the quarter, an increase of 14.8%.","The average diluted share count was 172.2 million shares in the quarter and also at quarter end. In 3Q, we purchased about 381,000 shares for $24.4 million. We had about $282 million left under our authorization at September 30. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date generating annualized IRRs of over 25%. For 2013, we continue to anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution.","Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents were $180.2 million. Total debt, both long term and short term, was about $1.3 billion. As I mentioned before, the debt balance reflects repayments in the quarter. Today, our incremental debt capacity is over $1 billion and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Also, just as after the quarter, we upsized our credit facility to $975 million of commitments, all of which is undrawn and available for general corporate purposes, including M&A. Our debt to pro forma EBITDA at September 30 was 1.7x, below our steady-state target. As you know, we're willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt to EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities because our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly.","Year-to-date in 2013, free cash flow, which we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $271.6 million, an increase of about $7.4 million or 2.8% versus the first 9 months of 2012. Our capital expenditures were 9.1% of revenue year-to-date in 2013. Free cash flow generated represented about 47.8% of EBITDA in the first 9 months of 2013, and adjusted for the timing of certain tax benefits mentioned previously, free cash flow represented 54.1% of EBITDA.","As we think about capital spending for 2013, we are now expecting $160 million for the full year, including about $30 million of investment initiative spending. We have increased our expectations for capital expenditures due to business opportunities, as well as some timing for multi-year hardware and software purchase support growth of our business.","As you think about your models for the full year 2013, we still anticipate amortization of intangibles of about $64 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $72 million and now a tax rate below 37%. We aim to keep share counts flat through our repurchase program. And at current debt balances, our quarterly interest expense is about $18 million. Overall, revenue growth remains solid, margins strong, and we are innovating for the long term.","With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First, I guess, I wanted to ask about the healthcare business. And just, I guess, I apologize if I missed it, but just to make sure I heard it correctly. The weakness was mainly in RQI, and it was isolated to 4 main customers. Is that correct?","Scott G. Stephenson","Tim, this is Scott. Yes, that's correct. They're -- basically all of -- the difference between our original expectations and where the quarter came out were a function of events at 4 customers, and in all cases, that was related to RQI.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And did you trade off lower price for more volume at each of those customers? Or was...","Scott G. Stephenson","No, no. In the comments I made upfront, Tim, I said that of the 4, 3 of them were slowdowns in terms of implementation or ramping. One of them was because we traded off price for longer-term commitments.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And do you have any sense for why the volumes slowed down, I guess, at those customers?","Scott G. Stephenson","A lot of it has to do with the ability to get implemented. And the ability to get implemented is not always fully in our control.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","But these are new -- these are not existing customers that slowed down from what you saw last year necessarily. These are new customers that didn't add as much...","Scott G. Stephenson","One thing to bear in mind about our business, Tim, is that we have a very healthy mix of new business with new parts of an existing customer, as well as absolutely new customers. And so you actually have those effects inside of what was happening. In other words, an existing customer, which is trying to implement in a different part of their operation, that actually shows up in some of those cases that I was just mentioning.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess, if we want to look, is there any -- in trying to understand, was there any competitive impact? And\/or was there any signs that the customers are less interested or demand is less for these solutions?","Scott G. Stephenson","No, to both questions.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just the follow-up, did I -- on the margin side, did you say -- with the 100 basis points for the -- was that in terms of margins being down perhaps as much as that? Was that for the year or...","Mark V. Anquillare","Correct. Yes, it was for a year.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. So obviously, an even bigger decline implied for the fourth quarter.","Mark V. Anquillare","Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to also ask about revenue quality intelligence, RQI. This unit primarily serves Medicare Advantage plans, optimizing reimbursements and such. And when you look at the headlines for Medicare Advantage plans at places like UnitedHealth, it seems like Medicare Advantage plans themselves have some headwinds. Do you think that has anything to do with what you described in the Verisk Health business?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes, Andrew, this is Scott. I don't actually. And you're right about those headlines, and we're aware of what's going on in the space. But the fundamental fact of our situation remains that we are still a relatively small player inside of this world. And so our opportunity is ahead of us, and it really is centered upon building out our business and acquiring business with a number of plans that we don't even work with today. And so yes, there are the dynamics of what's going on inside of the category. Although I will say that it remains the case that Medicare Advantage plans are still highly incented to get after precise measurement of their performance, both cost and quality, since their reimbursement hangs upon it so deeply, and that's the category that we're providing here. So no, I don't think that there's really any affect in what happened in this quarter nor will there be in the -- at least, in the near-term future because our opportunity is essentially to take more space starting from a relatively small position.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And you said these 3 clients will be implemented soon, right?","Scott G. Stephenson","They are -- we believe that all of them are in the process of moving towards contracting with us and\/or expanding their business with us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with SIG.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So Scott, I had a couple of questions. Upfront you had described some of the innovation initiatives related -- one you mentioned related to pooled healthcare fraud from -- yes, so maybe if you could help us to -- it seemed important, potentially important that you have payers that are joining that initiative. If you could help us to understand how that rolls out and the magnitude of it.","Scott G. Stephenson","Right. So first with respect to the rollout, a lot of -- a fundamental fact is that a lot of the fraud, waste and abuse the goes on in healthcare is actually perpetrated by providers. And when you take that perspective, then immediately, you're framing on trying to get after this becomes a somewhat local one because you're actually trying to diligence providers in the way they interact with payers more on a market-by-market basis. And so the way that we've gotten started with this is the -- in the first phase of this, we've got -- we have 2 national players who have come in, but they have come in only for certain localities. And so the rollout is going to take 2 forms: one is hope -- we expect that they will bring more and more of their localities into the pooled data initiative; and then secondly, more payers will enter in to the initiative. And so just to kind of give you a sense of kind of the scale of all of this, with the providers that we started with, we're dealing with a relatively small fraction of their total business is inside of what we're doing today. And the next wave of payers to come in, we would expect it to be on the order kind of 3 to 5 additional source of plans, and that sort of pace of build over the course of rest of '13 and into 2014, is kind of what we're looking for. So it does grow. It's not growing linearly. It will be much more than that, and there is the network effect of having more and more payers in the process. So we -- that's the way that we think it'll grow.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that sounds exciting. And then switching gears on the aerial imaging side. Mark, you had mentioned $10 million of incremental investments. Is that -- if you -- so are you putting infrastructure into database, the images? Is it procurement of the infrastructure to get those images? Where is that $10 million going?","Mark V. Anquillare","Sure. So let me describe, the images are one thing, obviously, a lot of people have pictures. What we are actually trying to do is go one step beyond that and from those pictures derive data through a computer vision actually creating what is specific measurements of roofs and homes and information that can be used for both claims and underwriting in the P&C space. We have been on this agenda now for over a year, and we have built out the infrastructure from standpoint of the technology, the data center and the servers. However, as you actually start to collect and aggregate data in the form of images, that needs to be expensed, not a CapEx item. And so we're trying to call out some of the P&L impact associated with that initiative, and there is a bigger chunk in the fourth quarter. That's what I was trying to describe there in the $10 million.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then the last question, if you look at both of these, should we view them between pooled health and aerial imagery as long-term revenue objectives? Or are we going to see some waterfall sooner potentially next year?","Scott G. Stephenson","We definitely expect revenue from both in 2014, absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","This is Jeff Rossetti in for Joe. I was wondering if you could provide some additional color on healthcare within Payment Accuracy and Enterprise Analytics, maybe how those businesses performed, excluding RQI?","Mark V. Anquillare","Let me take that one. This is Mark. The general theme is they have performed well. I would tell you that the bigger growth in the opportunity at least recently has been with RQI, and that's where we've seen some big customer contracts. I think the underlying theme around Payment Accuracy, which is the fraud and abuse case, is very strong, and we continue to have nice ramping customers in volumes. Although as the business gets larger, it's tough to grow at the same percentage rate. So what we've seen is growth extension and the opportunity to continue to add dollars. But the dollars are on a bigger base, so the percentages are lower. From an EA, which we refer to as Enterprise Analytics side of things, a little more competition in this space. I think we see opportunities there that extend beyond what as providers -- excuse me, extend beyond what are the payers and into the provider space, and we're ramping up in spending and investing there with the opportunity to kind of extend the market opportunity as what is, call, population management or the world of what we do in Enterprise Analytics can be applied to a shifting set of risks potentially inside of the healthcare space as providers probably take on some more risk in the future.","Scott G. Stephenson","And I'll just add to that, a very pleasing fact for us is that we now have a material fraction of all the ACOs, which have been launched to date as customers for our EA division, which is a really, really nice place to sit.","Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And just one follow-up, Mark, I apologize if I missed this. Did you say there was any change to your 2013 investment plans and innovation of -- or is it still tracking at around $90 million?","Mark V. Anquillare","So I think what we tried to describe, the dealer part was -- and this is more of a CapEx discussion and then I'll double back into the P&L. Our CapEx is higher right now. I want to just at least give a little color and clarity on that. And inside that, I think at least $10 million additional has been added. So now we're at about $30 million inside that CapEx because of these investment initiatives and some of that additional CapEx is really just because operational needs to get the bigger, whether it's around facilities or just it's around computing power. That's been the focus with some additional CapEx. I think that answer your question. If you're more on the P&L side, I'm happy to go into a little deeper dive there, but what we tried to reflect inside of the -- up to 5 -- 100 bps is some of the expense that we would incur resulting from the investment initiatives, which are more than $90 million today from what I'll call P&L perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I know you've been asked this question a number of different ways, and I'm not sure that I completely understand this. So how significant were the pricing concessions? Because maybe I'm not thinking about this right, but if part of the disappointment in Health in the quarter was related to delays in transactional volume. And I think you mentioned that was the case with 3 of the 4 big customers. Then, why aren't you expecting growth next year to be higher than mid-teens? I mean, is the real underlying organic growth in healthcare now actually lower just given that, that mid-teens number includes some of this catch-up revenue?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes, it's not -- no, there's not a catch-up effect here. So I'm not quite sure I'm tracking your question, but let me say it the way that we see it and understand it. So we made some trade-offs in the third quarter with respect to price, which showed up in our third quarter results, will show up on our fourth quarter results. And will have the effect of relating to transaction volumes in '14, '15 and '16 in particular. Then separately, there are customers that we're finding are intending to be our customers, but the rate at which they are moving into being a part of our customer set is lower than we had originally thought it would be. And that applies in the quarter, but also as we try to think about where the business is going to be in '14, we're seeing some of that same effect. And as I think you know, a large fraction of what we do and in healthcare, about 70% of it, is transactional as opposed to the rest of Verisk, which is about 70% subscription and recurrent. And so that which we don't get in '13, it's not -- it doesn't just roll over into '14.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and then separately, when do you expect mortgage to bottom? And then are you going to continue breaking out mortgage within the financial segment going forward once Argus is brought into organic?","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, I'm sure that we would -- I'm not on the point about specifically what our reporting looks like, but certainly, we will continue to comment on mortgage just because mortgage is a meaningful part of what we're doing in financial services. With respect to the bottoming, you got to look at 2 things. One is what's happening with respect to mortgage origination volumes. And there, according to the MBA, the expectations for '14 is it'll be a somewhat softer market than '13. And then the other piece is cycling through the forensic piece, and our view is we haven't quite gotten to the bottom yet, but we're moving towards it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just another question on healthcare. Just it looks like your fourth quarter, your guidance for 2013 would imply fourth quarter healthcare revenue growth to be about 0% to 6%. Is that what -- is that the right implication? And then on 2014, we just saw the trading pricing for volume, we start to see that pick up in '14, so why -- just maybe one more point of clarification on why we're not kind of reaccelerating back toward that 20%? Then a quick final one on the margin. Are we flat into '14 from 100 basis points down in '13?","Scott G. Stephenson","Okay, so let me take the healthcare question. So for first of all, in the fourth quarter, you talked about a 0% to 6% range. We think we're at the higher end of that range but yes. Again, the slowdown on the ramp-up is an effect which doesn't happen at just one moment in time. In other words, we're trying to be very clear and very thoughtful about what we see happening across the customer base, existing customers, as well as prospects, the ramping up at existing customers, as well as prospects. And so that effect is at work in '14, as well as '13. And then, Mark, do you want to just talk about the margin question for a moment?","Mark V. Anquillare","Yes, when I was referring to the 100 bps, I was referring to full year '13. I think we've continued to have a view that we'll be in that high end of the range of 43% to 45% as we roll into '14 and beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one on healthcare for me as well. But the impact, I guess, the pricing impact on that one customer, I'm just trying to understand like can we see more of that sort of trade off that you're making on additional customers down the road that could have a similar impact.","Scott G. Stephenson","I would say that it's possible. What happened in this case was very specific to the individual customer. And -- but we're also paying a lot of attention to price realization in the category. And again, we are still sort of the, relatively speaking the new kid on the block in healthcare generally. We were -- in 2010, we did about $55 million of healthcare and you know where we are now. So our position is one that isn't -- is emerging relatively quickly. It's in a category where a lot of the product today tends to be transactional rather than long-term subscription. So we're working very hard to secure that business. But it's also the case that the customers themselves are going to have a view about exactly how rapidly they're looking to grow their own books of business and how rapidly they're looking to grow their engagement with us. And so those are essentially the moving piece parts. And in the middle of all of that, our goal is to become an increasingly relevant part of what it is that they do. So certainly, if there were opportunities to trade off price with volume, we would take a look at those because we want to be a leader. And this is a moment where we're introduced to new customers that we haven't worked with before, and we're expanding relationships with existing accounts, and all of that is -- it's very dynamic. And we're open to what the right way to go about optimizing that going forward.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then, I guess, just within the healthcare space as well, I mean, and in line with your commentary around an active M&A pipeline, can you maybe talk specifically on how you see your mix shifting towards maybe a little more M&A now that you've been a couple of years so without doing much in that space?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes. Well, as you know, 2012 was actually a very active year for us in M&A. So there was a little bit of -- we needed to fulfill our commitments with respect to our leverage, and we accomplished that. But otherwise, we remain as active in them M&A process as we've ever been. We -- and I would just underline that we continue to be thoughtful about what we think is the right assets, and we're certainly looking hard at what are fair valuations. I think it's fair to say that in this time of relatively cheap money, valuations have tended to move up. There have been several transactions this year around assets that, from the headline level, at least you would have said, \"Gee, isn't that really logical for Verisk.\" But as we looked at them, we thought very long and hard about valuation and what we thought was the right way to use our shareholders' money and in some cases, took a pass. But we're as active as ever, and we remain very committed to the M&A agenda as part of long-term value creation here.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just, Mark, finally on the mortgage side, can you -- what is the mix between forensic and the front-end piece? And just to clarify, in your comments, you said that the front end, the one tied to originations was down as much as the market was?","Mark V. Anquillare","That is correct. So what we've seen is, at one point, the forensic was as much as 60% of the business. I think we're kind of trending towards that 50-50 at this point. And to clarify, yes, we have seen a lower or lighter decline on the forensic side. And with regard to the front end of the business, which is more closely tied to originations, it was kind of down consistent with what has been a drop in the overall market in the a number of originations there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Could you give us a sense of, Scott, of the performance of some of your acquisitions in revenue and quality intelligence? That seems to be the area within healthcare where you've been most active from M&A standpoint, in particular MediConnect. As you look at the properties you've acquired over the last couple of years, have they performed about in line with your buy plan?","Scott G. Stephenson","They have, yes. They -- and one of the things that we talked about a couple of quarters ago, actually, when we were characterizing MediConnect upfront, was that we thought that something unique would happen when we put MediConnect together with the assets of what we used to call HRP because essentially we were now sort of fulfilling a value chain where it began with chart abstraction and ends with the analytics to support the payer in making their argument for their cost and quality outcomes. And so we had -- we were putting all of those assets together. And in fact, what we saw over the course, particularly of third and fourth quarter 2012 and first and second quarter of 2013, was that some demand was essentially liberated by virtue of our ability to provide that end-to-end solution. And you certainly saw that in our results and in the substantial organic growth that took place there. That effect continues to occur, and that's why we believe that we're going to have a very healthy level of growth in the healthcare business next year. But there was sort of a moment in time response to a capability that just was not there for us prior to the 2 assets coming together. And each of them individually has continued to do well. MediConnect has very much been operating according to plan.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Good. And just as a quick follow-up, historically, you don't provide growth rates for the 3 segments within healthcare. But in light of the slowdown this quarter, can you give us just some broad ranges on growth for Enterprise Analytics, Payment Accuracy, and revenue and quality intelligence?","Mark V. Anquillare","This is Mark. I mean, I think we tried to characterize earlier the nature of the growth there, it has been primarily driven by some of the RQI. The other 2 businesses have continued to perform nicely but not at the levels of RQI.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So all 3 businesses actually grew within healthcare in the quarter?","Mark V. Anquillare","All businesses were strong. As we kind of think about the businesses, we think there's opportunities across the board, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Clark with KBW.","William Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just one more on healthcare. How long is the typical implementation in RQI? So if you get those 3 customers locked in, how long would it normally take for us to see a meaningful contribution to the top line there?","Scott G. Stephenson","It's sort of weeks to months. So it's -- and it all depends on -- in many ways, it actually depends on the nature of the customer's operations. But think of it as several weeks to sort of a low count in terms of number of months.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","In the past, you guys talked about seasonality in the healthcare business. Is there anything we should be thinking about as we model healthcare for next year?","Scott G. Stephenson","I think the one thing that we are trying to do, so we get a little bit away from some of the seasonally is we have tried to work with our customers so there wouldn't be quite as much kind of second half demand so that the opportunity and their needs are spread more broadly across the entire year. I think we've been somewhat successful there, but I think you're going continue to see more in the second half of the year. Typically, that was in that 60% to 70% range. So hopefully, we're trending towards the lower percentage there as we're thinking about that in the future.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I'll now turn the call back over to Scott for closing remarks.","Scott G. Stephenson","Okay. Well, we appreciate everybody being with us for the call. We appreciate all the questions, and we certainly understand the interest in our -- the healthcare part of our business. We remain focused on making it a really very strong and important part of Verisk. It's a long march but one in which we're very confident. We're also very excited about a lot of other things happening in our business. And the agenda remains focused on innovation, and we believe that we are becoming an increasingly strong company with respect to innovation and growth. And so we look forward to being with you again next quarter, and thanks for your time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's Verisk Analytics Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Stacey Brodbar. Ma'am, you may begin.","Stacey Jill Brodbar - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, Regina, and good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2018 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer.","Following comments by Scott, Mark, and Lee, highlighting some key points about our financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. It's good to be reporting another quarter where we can see strength in organic growth of our business across all our verticals. Excluding exceptional events in the third quarter of 2017 in the Insurance segment due to extreme weather and in the Financial Services segment due to a contract signing, the organic growth of our company was 7.5% in the quarter, consistent with our long-term model, and the profile of our growth is also reflecting our long-term model, in that it is balanced across all the verticals.","I thought I would take a few minutes this morning to comment on the environment in which we do our work and the factors which interact with our results. Fundamentally, we are aligned with one of the most powerful movements in the economy, which is companies harnessing data analytics with even greater focus and investment. There is a new level of digitization of business operations that has become a necessity for companies in all the verticals we serve.","While the notion of data as an asset has been around for a while, companies now are compelled to change the way they interact with their customers by becoming faster, more automated, more visual, and easier to use. These changes at the front-end of the business model require companies to rewire most everything behind the front-end as well. As businesses become more digital, they accumulate more data in real-time, and this causes them to become more analytic, given the decreased cost of ingesting and storing the data combined with improving data science.","Against this backdrop, our ability to help our customers on the digitization journey, in combination with our unique datasets and deep domain knowledge, give us expanding opportunities to add value for our customers. The search for efficiency and insight from data analytics will only increase for our customers. As long as we remain close to our customers, hearing their emerging needs and responding with timely useful solutions that leverage our scale across industry participants, our value to our customers will grow. It is a positive thing for us that our customers are becoming more data analytic and hiring more data scientists. This increases their propensity to value the things we do.","We are always alert to three risks. Is the regulatory environment changing? Is the structure of the verticals we serve changing? And, is the environment causing changes in the cost of doing business? On the one hand, the regulatory front has seen some change, but on the other hand there have been few changes that have materially impacted our business.","One noteworthy move of the last several years has been more scrutiny in the banking sector, but the only effect has been our need to make some of our products more ready for reporting requirements, and that shift has already occurred. At the societal level, there has been movement toward more concern about data privacy, with approaches such as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in Europe. The primary effect of this is to reinforce the diligence we've always brought to keeping our data assets secure.","Although data analytics, innovation, and technology continue to evolve and increase in importance, the structure of our industry verticals is not changing to any material degree.","In Insurance, the global reinsurers and brokers have seen some consolidation as they work to adjust to a world in which risk can be borne directly by the capital markets. But the bulk of our work is with primary insurers, and the reinsurers are being affected in modifying their businesses.","And more generally, the effect of digitization is to reduce distribution advantages and fixed costs, both of which will lessen the incentive to combine companies for cost advantage.","The environment carries two trends, which push our costs in opposite directions. On the people front, we are increasing the mix of our team, which comes from the hard core data science world. These folks are highly sought-after and paid accordingly. On the technical infrastructure front, the move toward cloud computing and away from premise computing will reduce our computing and storage costs. We are in the early stage of seeing these benefits.","So our overall perspective is that the basic conditions of our environment remain constructive. What it's down to, therefore, is the depth of our relationship with our customers, and the capability of our team to innovate solutions and make them work for our customers.","In the past 30 days, I've visited with four CEOs of our leading customers. In every case, I came away with an enhanced sense of opportunity. As they take their businesses forward in a digitizing environment, their expressed preference is for a relatively short list of partners who can make sense of all the technical innovations and relate them to existing workflows.","In such an environment, a trusted and tested partner like Verisk stands taller. As long as we continue to invest to keep our customers at the leading edge of innovation and do so with efficiency, we will realize value.","On the talent front, I just received the results of our most recent employee engagement survey. We have once again qualified as a certified Great Place to Work. Additionally, Forbes has named Verisk to its World's Best Employers list and its America's Best Employers for Women list in 2018.","This is supportive of our business, because our talent is what drives our customer depth and innovation agendas. We are expanding our business footprint globally. And in line with this, we are making moves to have centers of excellence in multiple geographies, with special focus on India and Eastern Europe.","Lastly, our progress in the UK market remains encouraging with recent contract signings with market leaders. We are viewing our approach there as a template we will use as we target other specific markets in Europe and Asia.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Mark.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. In our Insurance business, we had another strong quarter, with all insurance-facing businesses, Underwriting & rating, as well as Claims, contributing to growth. Let me highlight a few areas that drove top line growth and update you on several initiatives that better position us for the future.","During the quarter, Underwriting & rating delivered another strong quarter of organic growth across personal lines underwriting, extreme event modeling, and industry-standard insurance program, through a combination of cross-sell of the existing solutions to new customers and the sale of new innovative solutions.","Our Risk and Analytics Summit recently took place in Jersey City, focusing on our underwriting and pricing solutions. We covered a wide range of topics, including industry disruption, talent drain in the insurance industry, and cutting-edge technology, in combination with demonstrations of some of our newer solutions.","The conference attracted about 150 insurance companies from around the world and featured a list of more senior level attendees this year. Feedback was very positive, with participants excited by the direction of our solutions and complimentary of the diverse and thought-provoking sessions.","The engagement with customers was strong, further cementing the type of relationship that has led to our high customer retention rates and Verisk demonstrating the thought leadership in the property and casualty insurance industry that clients expect.","In our extreme event modeling business, growth in AIR solutions remains strong. During the quarter, AIR Worldwide released Touchstone Re, a new catastrophe modeling application designed for estimating the loss potential of reinsurance contracts and portfolios, industry loss warranties, and insurance-linked securities. Touchstone Re is a major upgrade from CATRADER that enables companies to model and price complex reinsurance structures, understand where their exposures are concentrated around the globe, and summarize their portfolios and aggregate their overall risk.","As you may recall, 2017 was marked by exceptional storms globally, including hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in the United States. In fact, 2017 was a record-setting year with catastrophe losses of more than $130 billion across the industry, which compares to an average loss of about $55 billion over the 10 years prior to 2017.","Our Claims business benefited from the severe weather in third quarter 2017, which resulted in a revenue surge of approximately $8 million. After normalizing revenue from severe weather, our Claims business unit experienced another very strong quarter, with organic growth across all business units. Let me provide some color on these successes.","The foundation of our Claims business unit consists of two core solutions, ClaimSearch, our industry fraud prevention solution; and Xactware, our repair cost estimating in workflow tools. These solutions are well-penetrated and deeply embedded in the workflows of U.S. insurers. From this strong position, we have been successful growing the business through a couple of avenues.","The first path for growth is the sale of these core solutions to new segments. We continue to extend the consortium data and the use cases for our claim solutions, including new lines of insurance, such as health and disability. During the second half of 2017 and into 2018, we extended beyond insurance companies and have signed several contracts with service providers to help them manage their workflow and better serve their insurance customers.","In addition, we continue to gain market share in the repair cost estimating market by signing new contracts during 2008 (sic) [2018] (00:11:49) that have contributed to the growth.","The second avenue of growth is the development of new analytic solutions, leveraging our underlying core solutions. A few examples of success include ClaimDirector, our expert claim scoring systems that helps customers distinguish between suspicious and meritorious claims. This proactive fraud-fighting tool provides scores based on the analysis of each claim's attribute and the broader industry data from ClaimSearch.","In addition, ClaimXperience, a digital engagement platform that provides insurance companies with important tools to help claims representatives work more effectively with policyholders. This workflow tool leverages the underlying Xactware solutions and helps insurers engage with their policyholders in their supply chain.","Finally, Geomni, our business unit that aggregates an image library of commercial and residential structures and leverages advanced analytics to extract measurements and data. Although applicable in many markets, Geomni's early success has been in the insurance claims adjusting market due to the tight integration with our Xactware repair cost estimating tools. This has resulted in noteworthy efficiencies for insurers and strong growth at Geomni, where we have signed several new contracts and have gained market share. Across all businesses, from both a customer and financial perspective, we're very pleased with the performance of the Insurance business.","With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank, Mark. First, I'd like everybody to know that we posted a quarterly earnings presentation that's available on our website. The presentation provides some background data trends and analysis to support our conversation today.","So moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and a GAAP basis, revenue grew 9% to $599 million. Net income was up 37.5% to $166 million for the quarter. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.99 for the third quarter of 2018, an increase of 37.5% compared with the same period in 2017.","Before I begin discussing the financial results in more detail, I would like to call your attention to three exceptional items in the quarter that impact year-over-year comparisons. Number one, Insurance segment organic constant currency revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth were impacted by $8 million in exceptional storm-related revenue in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2017. This was the result, as Mark described, of exceptional client activity related to hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017.","Two, Financial Services segment organic constant currency revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth were impacted by $6 million in nonrecurring TSYS project revenues in the third quarter of 2017, as we described in our last earnings call. These revenues were the result of the initiation and implementation of our partnership with TSYS and do not reoccur. We do anticipate over time revenues from the joint marketing of our analytics products to TSYS customers.","And three, in August 2018, the subordinated promissory note associated with the sale of our healthcare business in 2016 was settled in full for cash proceeds of $121 million. As a result, we reported a gain of $12 million in the third quarter of 2018. The interest income associated with this note was approximately $1 million per month or $3 million per quarter. Given the settlement timing, we recorded interest income of $2 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $3 million in the prior-year's quarter. The related gain and interest income from the note settlement were excluded from all adjusted EBITDA calculations.","Please note that, historically, this interest income was included in adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, our ongoing adjusted EBITDA will be reduced by $3 million per quarter, mostly in the Insurance segment.","With those items covered, let's focus on our organic constant currency results for all year-over-year growth rates and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations, recent acquisitions for which we don't have a full year-over-year comparison and nonrecurring items.","Acquired revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the quarter from all deals that haven't moved into organic results were $32 million and $9 million, respectively. On a reported organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 4.7% and adjusted EBITDA expense growth of 7.9% for adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.6% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.5%.","The revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth rates reflect the impact of the exceptional storm activity and the nonrecurring TSYS revenue in the third quarter of the prior year. Normalizing for these events, revenue growth would have been 7.5% and adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 7.1%, reflecting organic growth across all our industry segments. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 48.5% was down slightly from 48.7% on a normalized basis in the prior period.","Now, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you'll see in table 2 in the press release, Insurance reported 5.5% revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth of 2.5%, reflecting the inclusion of exceptional storm revenue in the prior period. Excluding these events in the prior year, Insurance revenue would have grown 7.7% and adjusted EBITDA would have grown 6.4%, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.3%, down from 55% in the prior year on a normalized basis due to continued investment in Geomni and other breakout opportunities, as well as higher commissions related to the strong sales and higher salary and benefit expenses to support growth opportunities.","Within our Underwriting & rating business, we saw solid performance, with healthy growth in both personal and commercial lines. Within Claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance across most of our claims businesses, partially offset by a modest decline in our workers' compensation claim resolution services.","Energy and Specialized Markets delivered revenue growth of 6.3% in the quarter, up from 5% in the prior quarter, as the energy industry continues to recover. Growth improved in both our consulting and research solutions, and we also had a positive contribution from environmental health and safety revenues.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.1%, also an improvement from 0.9% growth in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.8% was up from the prior year period of 31%, despite the ongoing investments in WoodMac 2.0 and our chemicals, subsurface, and power and renewables breakouts that increased head count and associated compensation expense. These areas represent opportunities to leverage Wood Mackenzie's data and industry expertise more broadly and to deliver and develop products more swiftly and efficiently.","Financial Services revenue declined 9.2% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA decreased by 28.6%, reflecting the impact of the nonrecurring TSYS revenue of $6 million in the prior-year period. On a normalized basis, revenue would have grown 9.1% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA would have grown 15.2%, reflecting growth in portfolio management solutions, which includes our foundational benchmarking analytics, and spend and marketing solutions, where we are leveraging our data and expertise in consumer spending to support both financial and non-bank clients.","In addition, expense control contributed to the strong adjusted EBITDA growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.7% in the period compares to 32.8% in the prior year on a normalized basis. We continue to be encouraged by the progress in our Financial Services segment and certainly are pleased by the strong normalized results in this quarter, demonstrating the core growth potential of the business.","It's important to keep in mind that we are working to reduce the variability of revenue in the business, particularly around project-based items. As we continue to work through this process, the Financial Services segment will continue to have a higher level of quarterly fluctuations on revenues and growth than our other segments.","Reported interest expense was $32 million in the quarter, up 6.6% from the prior year quarter due to the funding of acquisitions in 2017. Total reported debt was $2.6 billion at September 30, 2018, down from $3 billion at December 31, 2017. We used the proceeds of $121 million from the repayment of the subordinated promissory note to pay down debt and our leverage at the end of the third quarter was 2.2 times. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $152 million at September 30, 2018.","Our reported effective tax rate was 13.9% for the quarter, compared to 33.2% in the prior year quarter as the result of recent tax reform. Our effective tax rate was lower than our targeted range due to significant exercises of soon-to-expire employee stock options related to our 2009 IPO that produced a favorable tax rate impact.","We are maintaining our estimate of our effective tax rate in 2018 to be between 16% and 18%. However, the timing and impact of employee stock option exercises depends in part on the Verisk stock price and personal decisions. We expect the impact from employee stock option exercises will be less pronounced in 2019, and thus we will revert to a higher effective tax rate.","Adjusted net income was $182 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.08 for the third quarter, up approximately 30% from the prior year. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, and the impact of 2017 tax reform. Equalizing the third quarter of 2017 effective tax rate to that of third quarter 2018, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 3.7% and 3.8%, respectively. Further normalizing for the elevated storm and TSYS project-related revenues in the quarter, net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 9.2% and 9.1%, respectively.","Net cash provided by operating activities was $227 million for the quarter, up 39.7% from the prior year. Capital expenditures were $55 million for the quarter, up 33.7% from the prior year, reflecting primarily increased investment in Geomni and software development for recent acquisitions. As we've discussed previously, 2018 will be the peak year of capital expenditure for Geomni. Free cash flow was $172 million for the quarter, an increase of 41.8% for the prior year.","We returned $102 million in capital to shareholders through the repurchase of approximately 1 million shares in the quarter at a weighted average price of $117.97. At September 30, we had $584 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And in addition, we initiated a new $50 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the fourth quarter.","In conclusion, I want to add an additional perspective. As you know, we are very focused in these calls on the results for the quarter. However, given the three items that impacted the quarter as we approach year end, I think it's useful to step back and look at our year-to-date results for the Insurance segment and Verisk as a whole.","For the year-to-date period, on an organic constant currency basis, and not \u2013 I repeat \u2013 not normalized for the exceptional storm activity, revenues were up 7.5% and adjusted EBITDA was up 7.6%, demonstrating margin improvement. On the same basis, and not normalized, Verisk revenues were up 6.3% and adjusted EBITDA was up 5.8%, reflecting a slight overall margin decline from 49% to 48.8%, despite very high margins from the storm and nonrecurring project revenue in the third quarter of last year.","These overall results, of course, reflected weaker performance of our non-Insurance segments earlier in the year and tough comparisons in the third quarter. However, in the third quarter, we demonstrated continued progress in operating revenues and margins for both segments. We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and remain focused on the long-term profitable growth and solid returns on capital. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term.","We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk, and we look forward to seeing as many of you as possible at our upcoming Investor Day on December 6 in New York City or welcome your participation through our webcast. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us today, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up.","With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first will come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Good morning.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Scott, my first question was just tied to your opening comments around digitization and the opportunity there. And, I guess, more specifically, just in terms of the decision analytic side of Insurance, like how do you think that will perform if we do enter a tough period here in the next couple of years?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I just want to clarify your question. A tough period meaning the performance of the insurance \u2013 the state of the insurance industry?","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Well, yeah. Just if we do hit a recession broadly in just the Insurance offers, like how do you think the analytics piece of your Insurance business...","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I got it.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I understand. Yeah, thank you. Well, the best answer to that, I think, is actually found in our own historical performance. There was a consecutive five-year period where premiums were down year-over-year and our business performed very well during that period, and the reason is that what the insurance companies need to do, whether they're in particularly strong moments of the cycle or weaker moments of the cycle, is to continue to upgrade their ability to ingest information, translate it into insight, and then reflect that in a way they price their products, structure their products, adjust claims around their products, et cetera. That is the work of the insurance companies, and that's what we're fundamentally a part of.","So, we're very comfortable with how our Insurance business will do, almost regardless of the cycle. I'm saying that very strongly. Obviously, sort of extreme events in the moment can have an effect, but we've actually been through this and our business held up very well.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And, Mark, maybe just in terms of some of the new products and so forth you were calling out, I guess, maybe the one area maybe you can just update us on is the telematics initiative. It sounds like all the insurance companies are, obviously, talking a lot more about it on their calls, but just curious how we should think about when your exchange starts driving some contributions.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah, thank you, good question. I think we are very pleased with the position we're in, where we've these really exclusive arrangements with some of the larger OEMs and that has cemented us. So now it's every day we have more cars, more miles, and better data on that exchange. The early returns are really focused on two things. One, there's approach on the claims side to be easier and helpful to those driving your automobile. So think of an accident occurring, first of all, is there some safety or public safety you need, ambulance, could we get you a ride, tow truck? Also, let us quickly through a hot and warm transfer notify the insurance carrier that there's a claim. So this is a first notice, all automated that is very attractive to all parties involved, and that seems to be probably the place we lead.","Secondly, we have found that a lot of carriers are taking the data and the information that is coming off, we call it model-ready data, but basically they're using the data to model, and they're finding great lift in pricing policies using that industry or data exchange. So, early days, I think it will continue to grow. I would say that we all think that IoT is happening, but probably at a slower pace than what we've seen in Europe and elsewhere. We remain optimistic and we love the position we're in.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Good morning.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","First, I wanted to ask about the Insurance EBITDA. I think, Lee, you mentioned that there's going to be sort of $3 million lower in the future quarters in Insurance EBITDA because of the interest expense recorded from that promissory note. I wanted to just make sure I had that right. And so, basically this quarter you adjusted out that, as well as the gain, so it would really be as if this quarter didn't have it, but prior quarters did. I just want to make sure I understood that right.","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah, thank you, Toni. I appreciate the opportunity just to go into a little bit more detail on that. And so, you referred to it as the interest expense, just to be clear on the note, it was an asset that we hold. We were receiving approximately $3 million of interest income on that note. And the reason that it's in EBITDA is that under the SEC definition of EBITDA, you take net income and you add back interest expense, not net interest expense, so it's included in that calculation.","And so since this was an acquisition-related activity and we want to certainly separate out the gain and the impact of the interest income for comparability, the gain has been excluded. And then to the extent that there is any interest income in the period, we have excluded from the third quarter of 2017 $3 million of that interest income from our EBITDA and in the third quarter of 2018, $2 million of the interest income that we realized before its redemption.","And so the thing that we want for all of the analysts to understand is that going forward that that $3 million, which is in all of the segments, but the bulk of it is in Insurance, I would think of it at a corporate level of $3 million of EBITDA that comes out of our future quarterly results. Does that clarify things?","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It does. Thank you. And then my follow-up, I wanted to ask about energy, really good, strong organic growth quarter there. Just if you could give us a little bit more detail. I know you mentioned the markets recovering, but just what are you hearing from clients? What are sort of some of the \u2013 is it sort of driven by the consulting strength, and basically do you think that the positive trends should continue in the fourth quarter as well as into next year? Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah, so maybe starting at the end of that, Toni. The performance of that segment is really pretty broadly based, and what I mean by that is that it spans the kinds of solutions that we have traditionally provided, so sort of the core look at the supply chain of the oil and gas space, but also includes the upstream subsurface kinds of analytics, which are relatively newer for us, analytics related to the renewable forms of energy. And then kind of over-the-top on all of that, the digitizing trend that I talked about probably is differentially being felt more strongly in the energy space than it is in the others, because energy actually has started further behind.","So we talked a lot about WoodMac 2.0 and essentially sort of changing our own technical infrastructure, which allows us to interact with our customers differently. That's a constructive movement in the business, because our customers themselves are also changing their digital methods on the commercial side of their businesses. So it's really very broadly based.","If you were to think of it in terms of sort of what it is that's getting delivered and looking at where we have been in 2018 and where we're going in the future, we're always encouraged when we see consulting do well, because it tends to be a leading indicator of the propensity of our customers to be thinking into the future. And that has been strong, so that's an encouraging signal for us.","But as those of you who are familiar with our story know, most of the revenue is related to subscriptions. And over the course of 2018, subscriptions have advanced nicely also across several of those thematic categories that I talked about. So it's not really any one thing. It's really broadly based.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. It's Andrew. I wanted to talk about two things around Argus. I know it's a smaller business for you. The first one, Scott, you said something about \u2013 your prepared remarks about kind of changing products to, I think, adjust to regs. And I was wondering if that's an Argus-related comment? Because I remember in the second quarter you talked about some regs about targeting within Argus that needed changes for the customers.","And my question is, have those changes been made? And have customers moved forward? And the second question is, the contracts that were announced at Analyst Day, have those ramped up?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew. Yeah, so to your question about the models, that comment in my remarks was related to Financial Services and Argus specifically. And what's going on there, just to sort of reprieve that real quick is, that in the face of mounting regulation, the amount of documentation that is required on some of your models, if you're a bank or you're a credit card issuer, have really, really ramped up.","And so we have created some offerings that were pretty popular with our customers. And that summarized a lot into what we call a wallet-share model.","And so if you're going to use sort of a wallet-share model, what the regulators have said is you cannot sort of operate that as a black box. You're going to have to show us what's inside of your black box. And so sort of the burden for our customers of opening up the black box really got sort of pretty large.","And so in the face of that, what we've done is we have essentially disaggregated some of those models and sort of essentially taken the attributes which build up into the overall view, and that's what we're now making available to our customers. So I just want everybody to understand that's the movement. So the insight is still useful, but the way it gets presented has had to change.","And then to your question, so in the third quarter of 2018, the net effect of moving \u2013 some of our customers moving away from the wallet-share models and moving into the attributes was essentially a drag on the revenue line in the third quarter.","So the transition is not yet complete. What that means is actually that there is upside for us going forward. We're feeling \u2013 we have felt, over the last couple of quarters, the burden of that transition. And as we go forward that's going to eventually even out or even move in the right direction.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And, Scott, I asked about the eight contracts from Analyst Day.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Right.","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Michael, let me take that one. So the answer is from \u2013 over this period, there has been a portion of those contracts that we have executed and have begun generating revenue, and there have been a portion that has fallen out.","I appreciate your assiduousness in tracking that. It's not something that we are tracking on a regular basis. We're, obviously, looking at kind of the current portfolio. But we have realized some of those contracts and some of those we did not get to execution on. And I can try to give you more detail on that once we've kind of researched and tracked those specific items as we have in the past. But I don't have those numbers in front of me.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Much appreciated. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. My question is just around pricing. Just given inflation in the system, but more importantly, given your investment in new datasets, are you guys thinking about pricing differently than when you were owned by the insurance companies versus even just before you had Geomni? Just any sense on pricing philosophy and how that has changed and what we should think about going forward.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah, our pricing philosophy is the same as it's always been, which is that we price to value. So we're very focused on the utility of our solutions for our customers. And it's on that basis that we set the prices for the solutions that we provide.","And as has always been the case, our preference and the heart of our model is recurring subscriptions, and we find that that's good for our customers. They like knowing with some certainty what they're going to be paying for our solutions. And it's good for us, because of the visibility and the recurrence. So we normally try to \u2013 that's where we try to set our pricing model.","There are some occasions where with newer solutions particularly, the customers would prefer that we start out transaction priced, because (00:40:03) exactly how much of it they're going to consume as they begin using it. And so we're perfectly happy to do that when that's what the customers want. But we generally find with time that they would like us to transition to subscriptions.","And then the last thing I'll add is, as a part of our pricing philosophy, that we generally attempt to achieve multiyear subscriptions with price inflators on an annual basis, which reflects the fact that most of what we do is so basic to what our customers do, it's so embedded in their workflows, that there's just sort of a mutual understanding that this is the way business is going to get done. And so our customers are comfortable with signing multiyear agreements. And of course, for us that just represents an even higher level of recurrence.","So everything I just said has been a part of our approach since October of 2009 when you first saw us as a public company. And I'm very certain will remain our go-to-market approach.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And just a follow-up question. I know you touched on healthcare a bit around insurance. Maybe just remind us, how much of your business today is not P&C insurance? Specifically auto, home, you touched on healthcare. And then maybe, do you see any changes in terms of autonomous cars, connected homes impacting that business just from a technology standpoint? Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So, Lee, in a minute, I'll let you just talk about the split of our revenues. But, yeah, autonomous cars and Internet of Things, data coming from vehicles and from homes, very definitely a part of what we're doing. Those are constructive trends inside of our business and will only continue to be more important, especially for insurance companies.","So that's just sort of established inside of what it is we're doing. Lee, do you want to just talk about the split of our business?","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah, let me \u2013 and, Hamzah, I think first, just to kind of start off at a high level. Just from the overall insurance perspective, for year-to-date 2018, the Insurance segment represents 71% of our total revenue and 81% of our EBITDA.","I think you were asking for color around what portion of our revenues or our business composition is not P&C, and so let me clarify. The vast majority of our Insurance revenues are P&C-related. Auto and home are what we do there is P&C, property and casualty related.","So you may want some context around what portion is home-related or auto-related, and perhaps Mark can give you some perspective around that. I don't know that we have that breakout, because it's embedded in, for instance, our ISO and our Claims business together, but perhaps we can talk around that. Is that the sort of information that you were looking for?","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yes, exactly.","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So maybe that's something we can come back to you with to try to give you the breakout on some of those other components, but we don't have those \u2013 a sense of that right now.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah, we can do it offline. Thank you.","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, guys.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Good morning.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Scott, your high-level industry comments are always much appreciated for perspective. And one of the things, I think you said \u2013 you touched a little bit on the insurance industry consolidation and, obviously, you have seen that flow-through your business for the last few years, and then I think you made some comments on perhaps reinsurance.","I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit in terms of how the industry is changing via consolidation and what specifically you think that means to your business maybe shorter term or intermediate term. I assume longer-term it's not as big an impact, but I just wonder if you could maybe be a little more granular.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So all the way to the top, just talking about what the demography of the industry looks like. At the top-end of the market, there are a certain number of consolidations each year. My emphasis here would be on the fact that it's really not a very large number. But also bear in mind that there are new entrants into the insurance space on a consistent basis and several of these are what get referred to as the insur-techs. Sometimes they're innovating based upon the way that they segment the market. You have some innovation in terms of, say, peer-to-peer forms of insurance, which are kind of interesting, but they haven't expressed themselves yet as particularly big trends. But think of it as an industry where, yes, there is some consolidation at one end of the market, but there is also entry at the other end of the market.","We have done very well with the new entrants. They find it really helpful to be able to make use of our methods as they get started. They're efficient. It helps them get into business quickly. It's actually a credibility point for them as they do their business, et cetera. So, as we talk about sort of the evolution \u2013 and this is very real-time what I'm describing here, these new companies come into the market, we find that they're very inclined to work with us.","When consolidations occur \u2013 and again, my emphasis here would be how relatively few of them happen, but when they do occur, it's very situation-specific in terms of what it does to our business. There may be some cases where the two companies coming together, they're very overlapping in their use of Verisk solutions. And in that case, they very reasonably expect that like-on-like there might be some reduction in the total invoiced amount for the solution that the two companies were using and now the one are using.","But there are frequently offsets to that also, because it's also the case that one company may be using our solutions and the other company is not. And in those cases, actually, there's a very nice cross-sell opportunity within that same account. And so when we go through these transitions with our customers where two become one, we dig in very deeply and talk to them about everything that they're using that comes from us, and the things that they're not. And there can be an effect maybe in year one, although, not particularly large, and then on an ongoing basis generally, the profile of the account going forward, the growth profile is, I think \u2013 Mark, check me on this, but I think is generally about the same as it was before two companies became one. So we note consolidation, and as I say, it's very situation-specific, but it's not a major effect on our business. Anything you want to add to that?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I think the only thing I'll \u2013 I think you were trying to get a little feel for it. I think we feel that 2017 on the primary side of things, it was kind of business as normal. I think there were some reinsurance mergers that may have a little bit of a headwind as it relates to more of our cat modeling business. That would be my high-level, short-term view of things, if that helps.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","There might be a few more situations, like where AXA and XL Catlin came together, and that's an interesting one, because I think that one actually represents a fair amount of opportunity for us. But I mentioned that one, because that has sort of a global geographic markets dimension and it's also reinsurance sort of being layered more directly on top of insurance inside of one specific company. So I think you may see some of that, but that's actually the most constructive kind of consolidation I can imagine.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","For us, constructive for us.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's really helpful. Thank you. And, Scott, I think you also made a comment \u2013 maybe, Mark, it was in your comments, about Geomni share gains. I wonder if you could just talk about from whom Geomni is taking share.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Well, there's only a few competitors in the market, and I think we've been fortunate to deliver value and provide a particularly integrated solution that is appealing to several insurers and service providers. So, we continue to see some opportunities, a good pipeline, as well as close sales. So that's contributing to the growth you're seeing in 2018 and should continue into the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on, there was an earlier question about Wood Mackenzie and energy, I guess, more broadly, and I understood the kind of broad comments, I guess. But can you help us drill down into how we should think about the growth trend within the subscription piece, the high level number in the earnings release about subscription revenue, the percentage of revenue from subscription would suggest it was very strongly driven to growth in that segment by the consulting piece. And I understand there is a comparison with the loss of one contract, there'll be some noise there. Can you give more color to help us understand the progress or how much progress, I guess, is being made on growing subscription revenue for that business?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah, actually, quite a bit of progress is being made on subscriptions. And again, I think you do need to look beyond one quarter to say the year or even multiple years. But since we really called the turn on the business, which would have been \u2013 just referencing my notes here \u2013 oh, I guess, about 10 months ago or so, the progression of the subscriptions from then has looked very much like what we would expect and is very supportive of our view that this is a business which can perform above the rate of organic growth of all of Verisk actually.","So in the quarter, it happened that the transaction revenues were particularly strong. And, yes, we are working our way through one substantial subscription agreement that went off the books in 2018. We've talked about that. But I think that over intermediate and long periods of time, subscription revenue growth will be equal to or probably even exceed the rate of consulting \u2013 or just kind of they will both be very strong contributors, but what we're focused on is subscription revenue growth. That's the heart of our business.","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Scott, maybe I could add perspective. I think, Tim, that when we think about the subscription growth and kind of the core subscriptions, kind of putting aside some of the breakouts, and the breakouts are also largely subscription-oriented and research-oriented, and we have seen steady progress in the growth rate and new subscriptions in kind of the mid-single digits category before we factor in the breakouts. And then we look at the breakouts and those have been very strong growth as we penetrated those new areas, and so that gives us confidence that moves us more into kind of the higher single digits range.","And then on top of that, we have the consulting revenue, which, as you point out, was strong. Now, consulting revenue and the growth that we saw this experience was clearly a significant contributor to the overall growth. But we certainly see continued progress in that strength and in that improvement in subscription growth, supplemented by the breakout subscription growths, which are at a high level. So that maybe gives you some context on relative growth rates to complement Scott's perspective.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I guess, a last point I would make is that a lot of the subscription renewals occur in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So to a degree it's not really quite surprising that the third quarter would be relatively a little quieter with respect to subscriptions.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Lee, just a follow-up to that. Are those growth when you say mid-single digits in the core and high single including the breakout, are you excluding the loss of the \u2013 the impact of this customer that you lost?","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. What I'm referring to are kind of what we're experiencing currently, and so that reflects the impact of that loss of that large global investment bank. And so, I think as we've talked about in the past, that's kind of roughly 1 percentage point drag from a growth standpoint.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thank you. A couple segment-level margin questions. So, first, on Insurance, I know that there's other factors in here, like that come from the year ago and the interest income effect. But just on the aerial imagery investments, I guess, can you just maybe talk about where you're at in that investment cycle? What you're investing in in terms of product? Because I understand the planes and sensor investments, but I think that would flow through CapEx. So just on the margin impact, I guess, where you're at on the aerial imagery product and what you're investing in currently?","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Sure. So Jeff, let me approach it this way. So, yes, there is \u2013 certainly, the bulk of the investment from a capital standpoint is going into purchasing planes and sensors and operations, and so that's something that we've talked about before that will peak in 2018. We expect that that will come down. Further, as we are ramping up the pilots and the personnel in order to drive that, that that is effectively an additional investment as we are gathering and expanding the scope and the breadth of data, and so that is factored in and you see that in the P&L.","To kind of give you some context, when we look at that impact across Verisk as a whole, that contributes about 1% roughly of our expense growth, so that gives you some context for the scale of that impact. It has a lesser impact currently on revenue, but we, obviously, are growing at a high rate, and so that translates into a slightly also smaller impact on EBITDA. So that kind of gives you kind of a sense of the scale of that investment. Mark, did you have something you wanted to add to that?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","All I was going to say is, once you get those planes and those sensors, you now need to put them in the sky, so we're looking to drive coverage as far as both nationwide and frequency so we can see changes in properties. So that causes us to have to put pilots in the plane, there's cost to operate, there's maintenance on the planes.","Clearly, then we take all of the imagery, we process it, we're trying to kind of use it for different use cases, and we're extending the analytic capabilities of the team to provide underwriting use cases, extending the claims, and cat exposure. So I want to just emphasize, there's an OpEx piece as we continue to do a lot of advanced analytics, along with build out coverage and kind of capability. So (00:57:01).","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","And I think one thing to bear in mind is, I think as Mark was describing, the benefits of the use of this data spans across multiple of our businesses, and so it will have revenue impacts and EBITDA impacts positively as we try to leverage that data across the business.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the Energy and Specialized Markets margins, they've been quite good. I feel like a couple quarters ago, you were calling out investments there with WoodMac 2.0 and the breakout initiatives. And I don't know if you were more describing why when you started presenting segment margins they were lower than investors might have expected, but I just \u2013 I guess I wanted to confirm that there wasn't some delay in those investments. They're progressing as planned and the good margin we're seeing on a year-over-year basis in that segment is even with that investment. Thank you.","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So, certainly, there has been a level of investment that we've been making in WoodMac 2.0, as well as in the breakout opportunities that we have been investing in that have an impact. Those are proceeding as we expect. WoodMac 2.0 will be an investment cycle that certainly existed in 2018 and will persist through 2019 as we expand that platform. And that we are already beginning to see some benefits of that within the business, but there will be continued CapEx investment, continued OpEx investment in that through 2019, and so that's embedded in those margin numbers. And I think one of the benefits that we saw is that we had good cost control. Headcount growth was, I think, a little lower this quarter, having brought on some of the development folks that we needed on that front, and so that contributed to the clear improvement in margin that we saw in the third quarter.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Good morning, Bill.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, first question, just a clarification on the storm contribution adjustment. I know that last year was a major year for storms and outsized gains from that, but there also were severe storms in third quarter of 2018. And so when you make that adjustment, how much storm revenue \u2013 was the storm revenue contribution from the third quarter of 2018 also backed out? I just want to understand the mechanics of that adjustment.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So, Bill, I guess our view is that 2017 was truly an exceptional year. There's always going to be severe weather. 2018 is going to be, in our mind, something really strange happened. Towards the latter part of the year is just going to be a normal year of severe weather. So I don't think we see anything adjusting or any adjustments to normalization in 2018. We've been focused on 2017 because of the exceptional aspect.","Let me just remind everybody, the way many of our contracts, specifically the Xactware or repair cost estimating contracts, work is that we provide access to the solution for a number of claims. And then when you eclipse a threshold, you then get charged per claim at excess rate. It takes quite a substantial threshold or number of volume \u2013 lot of volume to get above that threshold. I don't think we're going to see much of that in 2018. 2017 was noteworthy.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then for my follow-up, Nielsen has been talking about how the GDPR regulation has been negatively impacting their marketing effectiveness business, and I know that they're a big user of the Argus data. And the Argus organic revenue growth showed a nice rebound in the third quarter. So I wanted to ask, is that rebound taking place despite \u2013 or even with that GDPR headwind, is that something that you're seeing that you're able to overcome?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. So, GDPR is a contextual factor for us, but not one that I would say is really interacting with our results near-term. And as long as we protect our data assets, the way that we have and I expect we will, I do not believe it will be a material impact going forward. So I can't comment on somebody else's construal of the effect of the regulations, but where our business is concerned. The primary effect of it, as we interface with our customers, is we have an extended discussion about contracts, because we need to now talk about the assignment of liability, at a higher level we always have had to talk about it, but we talk about it more than we used to. That's really the only effect that I see. And it's not material, it's not material.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Well, thank you very much, and Happy Halloween.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. So, I guess, the first question, when I look back to the beginning of 2017, pretty clearly you've had a significant investment cycle here, 20-some acquisitions and a meaningful internal step-up, things like Geomni, the new WoodMac platform, et cetera. Can you just frame for us how you think about the returns to the business that this investment cycle will deliver going forward?","And, I guess, I'm wondering things like should we think of this as incremental to revenue growth or really just bolstering the business so it can continue to deliver. How do we think about the step-down in margins and how that may trend over time? And anything about how you're thinking about the return on this. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Right. Good. So I'll ask Lee to talk about margins in a moment, but with respect to the investments that we've made, very substantially they go in the direction of putting us into new categories of solution sets that we otherwise either haven't provided or we provided in ways that haven't fully expressed what it is we can do for customers. So, for example, the acquisition of PowerAdvocate puts us in a category of spend analytics for the energy vertical that we weren't doing before. The Sequel acquisition puts us in a position to serve the London market, particularly with respect to complex commercial risks, in a way that we weren't able to serve it before.","And then all the investments that we've done in Geomni, we were in the category of interpreting remote imagery into datasets, into analytics for our customers. The issue that we had was we didn't have enough high-quality raw material. And so a lot of the investment, as you heard Mark saying, on the Geomni side was basically to put ourselves in a position to have a lot of great raw material. So, again, that is very much aimed at putting us into a new and different position for enhanced revenue growth on the top line. And then other internal investments, the same. WoodMac 2.0 will carry with it some efficiency gains, but it also makes us more capable in front of our customers.","So very much it is about contributing to incremental growth of our business. It's not about the maintenance of things that we already do. And that is also really part of our feeling about the likely returns of these investments that we're making, which, as you would imagine, revenue ramps, most everything we do is scalable, so as these investments mature and the revenues grow, I would expect to see it be constructive with respect to margin.","And also, even if you look at more than just say a quarter \u2013 and maybe, Lee, you want to pick up here a little bit \u2013 yeah, we still see constructive progression in the organic EBITDAs inside of our business relative to the organic revenue growth rates. So...","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. I would just quickly add in addition to what Mark described to develop new sources of revenue growth or enhance the revenue growth that we're generating off of our data, we are also making investments, for instance, in cloud modernization that we think will yield overall improved returns on capital and improved margins for us. So we are making those types of investments as well.","And we look at each of those investments on the basis of what type of return are we generating, whether it's through savings or through incremental profitability. So, thanks, Gary.","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. And then just the follow-up for me, so you've lapped three of the four chunkier, larger acquisitions from 2017 during this quarter. I know you don't like to talk about forward margin trends. But is there anything you'd call out that would lead us from believing the reasonable pathway here is having lapped a lot of that drag that there's been in your profitability goes away at this point or soon? I realize you got a tough comp in Q4 with the Insurance comparison. But anything else you'd call out? Or is it reasonable, having lapped a lot of that, things look better from here? Thank you.","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. So, Gary, I think it's important to understand your frame of reference, because what we do try to accomplish with our organic constant currency margins is to look at the business on an apples-to-apples basis, so that the business isn't influenced by those trends.","You will see in the difference between our reported and our organic margin that delta reflecting the impact of some of the acquisitions before we have a year-over-year comparison. And those also include some transition costs associated with those businesses.","So I think perhaps what you're seeing is a narrowing of the difference between that reported and the organic margin numbers, which I think reflects what you're describing, is effectively the business is now absorbing that. We still have \u2013 I think in the fourth quarter, we still have PowerAdvocate that is outside of that. So there still will be some adjustments for that, but we are narrowing that gap.","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I was wondering to what extent do you think you could provide \u2013 and I don't want to take anything away from the Analyst Day, but a medium- or longer-term outlook for the growth rates for the segments.","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. So, Joe, thanks for that. We do provide, as we described before, our target revenue and EBITDA growth rates. And what we've said is that over the long term we expect all of our businesses to deliver on those growth targets.","So beyond that, we don't provide separate for that. I kind of think implied by that, obviously, the Insurance business is going to be expected to deliver on those growth rates. And we certainly expect over time \u2013 or, I should say, based on historical performance, have seen both the Financial Services and, we believe, Wood Mackenzie have delivered on higher growth rates than that. And we certainly believe that that's an opportunity ahead of us in something that we are working towards.","But those we are focused on our overall Verisk growth rates. And each of the businesses are expected to meet those objectives.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. So essentially those are kind of unchanged as of right now, just to be clear. And then the second question is, without being sort of on the inside of the business, maybe you could give us the top two or three drivers of margins at this particular juncture. And any area where you think there might be some volatility on the margin targets going forward. Thanks.","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. So from an overall standpoint, the important driver of margin improvement is our ability to leverage our cost base in our businesses, our data businesses, across a broader customer set. And so that's \u2013 the fundamental driver of that, an additional subscription of our existing dataset, however broadly we define that, is going to have a very high margin and one that is in all likelihood higher than our overall margin. And that's the fundamental dynamic that drives our confidence in our operating leverage and our ability to achieve that.","I'd say beyond that, we are always looking for ways to become more efficient with the resources that we have. And so, Mark has been driving an initiative on looking at how we can be more efficient by leveraging our scale internationally within the business.","And so given that personnel costs represent about 70% of our cost base, we're always looking for how we can improve productivity from that base, which is something that Scott emphasizes highly in our discussions with the business. So I think that's another dimension to what we do.","And then from a technological standpoint, as I talked about, investment in cloud technology is something that we think has the opportunity to improve our margins, not just by reducing our technology costs, but by facilitating our development of products and our clients' interactions with data that kind of further extend kind of the initial dynamic that I talked about. So those, I think, would be three of kind of the things that drive our margins.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Morning.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask about organic EBITDA margin performance. You had cited elevated investments in Geomni, breakout opportunities, and commission performance as drivers of the contraction, even on a normalized basis on a year-over-year basis. So looking forward, can you talk about how you expect these investments to evolve? And your general philosophy around organic EBITDA margin performance, if you're targeting expansion over the near-to-intermediate term?","Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Sure. So, George, let me take a crack at that. I think that there are a couple dynamics that we think about from organic margin performance. The first is starting with, at the highest scale level, are the growth of our business where we expect revenue growth to exceed expense growth. And that drives an overall expansion of that organic margin.","Offsetting that in the near-term are investments that we make in new initiatives that are going to be \u2013 at the outset going to be lower margins, but we believe that those margins will ramp up quickly and be additive overall to the business. And so that has a near-term impact.","And then, as you described, the impact of acquisitions that may have a lower margin initially. And some of them may have a lower margin permanently, which may be dilutive to the impact. But each of them we expect in the businesses that we look at have a high degree of operating leverage. And we have an ability to improve their operating leverage over time, improving margins for the business as a whole.","But recognizing that we have businesses with exceptional margins, what we focus on in addition to overall driving margin growth for the business as a whole and in aggregate and consistent with our long-term targets of growing EBITDA faster than revenue, we also look at our returns on capital for those investments in new businesses.","So, core growth in the business is the fundamental driver. We are making investments near-term that will diminish near-term margin, that's a function of the investment, but hopefully, expand our growth and improve margins over time. And then the impact of acquisitions, some of which we think have higher margin, all of them we expect to have higher margin over time, but they may \u2013 as a function of their impact in the business, may be lower margin, but represent higher growth opportunities and higher return opportunities. So, hopefully, that gives you kind of the perspective on the dynamics for that margin.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then turning to your Insurance business, if you look at the organic constant currency growth rate normalizing for weather from last year, it did still step-down from second quarter growth rate. Can you talk about any unusual drivers in the quarter that might have contributed to a normalized deceleration in Insurance constant currency organic growth and maybe the momentum of the business over the course of the quarter and exiting the quarter?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So maybe I'll try to take that. This is Mark. I think if you were to actually look back on 2017, I think the answer really lies there. We had probably a little bit of a slower start to the year 2017, and we had kind of a stronger growth at the second half, so I think we referenced this maybe a little tougher comps in the third and fourth quarter just because of the nice pickup we had, some of it catch-up with first half of 2017.","What I'd just like to emphasize, and I think Lee did a nice job of it, is year-to-date we have had a very strong year from Insurance. We feel good about the direction of the business. We feel great about the relationship and the level of engagement we have with customers, and I do believe that the number of and breadth of new solutions we have provides an exciting year forward. So, I hope that emphasizes and answers your question.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it.

I'm pleased to be able to report that 2019 is off to a solid start at Verisk. The first quarter was marked by solid organic constant-currency revenue growth of 6.7%, which remains the most important measure of our vitality as an organization. Moreover, our growth was driven by continued broad-based strength across our Insurance vertical and ongoing improvements in Energy and Specialized Markets segment. This growth was a product of our continued efforts to get closer to our customers, to introduce new innovative solutions and to cross-sell existing solutions to help accelerate value creation for our customers.","With regard to innovation and cross-sell, we are beginning to see early success from the integration of some of our more recent acquisitions into the Verisk family. To that end, we are leveraging technologies and capabilities across all of Verisk to deliver new innovation and leveraging client relationships to drive cross-sell. In the Insurance vertical, we are working with a number of clients in the London market to help them achieve an integrated workflow across a suite of Verisk products, helping them to be more responsive to their clients while at the same time improving the quality of their analytics. ","As an example, Verisk clients who ensure commercial properties are now able to leverage integrations that we have built between applications from Sequel, AIR and Analyze Re to review exposure accumulations, assess extreme event risk and determine the impact of a policy on the overall portfolio in real time during the quoting process. These integrated products enable insurers to perform such analytics in minutes, where previously it could have taken at least a day. We think this early success with clients can be replicated more broadly within London and the United States. ","In Energy and Specialized Markets, PowerAdvocate, our marketing cost intelligence solution, is seeing early success expanding out of their core markets of oil and gas utilities into new end markets, including metals and mining, by leveraging Wood Mackenzie's deep customer relationships. Neal will talk to you about these opportunities in more detail. In the Financial Services vertical, we've integrated LCI's comprehensive bankruptcy data with our proprietary Argus credit card industry consortium data to more accurately predict bankruptcy as much as 6 to 12 months prior to a bankruptcy filing. This should enable our bank customers to significantly reduce bankruptcy losses through the appropriate utilization and credit line management strategies.","We had a very active quarter with regard to customer engagement. In fact, in the quarter, we hosted 17 customer events and attendance and engagement were very solid. In February, we hosted our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City. The attendance included almost 1,000 insurance executive claims adjusters, contractors and vendors from the U.S., Canada and Europe. The event focused on artificial intelligence and automation to enhance the claims process and introduce the many enhanced features and new products offered by our claims team. Insurers clearly understand that disruptive innovation is taking place throughout the industry and they are intent on maintaining a competitive advantage. This is driving increased engagement and focus around increased use of data and analytics as well as digital engagement. The conference featured, first, the use of computer vision such as remote imagery and image interpretation to automate the claims cycle; second, utilizing natural language processing to better respond to policyholders through advanced analytics and chatbots to speed the claims process and better digitally engage with customers; and third, product demos of our enhanced solutions and an innovation lab to showcase our cutting-edge InsurTech. The unprecedented interest in these topics resulted in over 150 requests from customers to meet with our product managers, industry experts and account executives. This level of customer engagement positions us well for future growth. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Neal to provide some additional insights on our Energy and Specialized Markets segment. Welcome, Neal.","Neal Anderson","Thank you, Scott. It's a pleasure to be here this morning to talk to you about our Energy and Specialized Markets business. I will discuss the macro environment in which the energy and specialized vertical operates where the focus on higher businesses are performing. I will also highlight our recent success leveraging the expertise of our PowerAdvocate business and to the extent of Wood Mackenzie energy and mining customer base. And lastly, we'll give you an update on the customer response to Lens, Wood Mackenzie's new data analytic platform. Regarding the macro environment. As you are aware, the oil and gas industry has been through a very challenging time over the last few years due to the falling oil prices. However, the industry in 2019 is in a much better shape than it was prior to the oil price crash in 2015. The oil and gas industry responded with amazing speed and focus to the drop in oil prices, aggressively cutting costs and rebuilding balance sheets, divesting noncore assets, which allowed them to concentrate upon low-cost, long life things. In turn, free cash flow has become the key financial metric. Indeed, in 2018, free cash flow surpassed the previous peak seen in 2012 when oil prices were above $100 a barrel. In summary, our oil and gas customers are in robust health with their focus now returning to new investments. We estimate future capital investment will exceed $200 billion in the next few years. As a result, we believe the majors will deliver stronger production growth in the coming 5 years, are poised to recover stronger growth for 5 years down the pre-oil price crash. Simultaneously, our downstream and finance platforms team continued strong demand, particularly in emerging markets leading to new investment in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Our core energy customers are also grappling with opportunities and challenges presented by climate change and the need for an energy transition to lower carbon energy sources. As you are aware, we have established 2 breakout businesses to specially support and advise our customers in these areas, namely chemicals and power and renewables. The chemicals business continues to deliver strong double-digit growth as customers recognize that the primary driver of oil demand is likely to become chemical demand over the medium and long term. This is a far","chemical demand over the medium and long term.","This is a far cry from the world we've grown up in, where transportation demand was the key driver. Wood Mackenzie's data across the global energy complex helps our customers navigate this. The power and renewables business is also consistently delivering double-digit growth driven by our traditional renewable developers and operators, complemented by strong demand from Wood Mackenzie's core oil and gas customers as they strive to build material positions outside their core business. ","We believe global investment in power and renewables will continue its nascent, rapid expansion as the energy mix moves from the molecule to the electron. As previously mentioned, the 2015 oil price crash drove a focus on cost efficiency to bring down production breakevens. Our PowerAdvocate business is ideally placed to help customers through applying cutting-edge analytical techniques to diverse spend data sets, allied with unique industry cost benchmarks. Wood Mackenzie has been able to expand PowerAdvocate's customer set beyond its traditional U.S. utilities to the major oil and gas customers and more recently, into the mining and metals sector. As a result, deal sizes have increased significantly as have margins.","Lastly, I would like to talk about the market reaction to our new data analytics platform, Lens. We launched the first release of Lens late last year, namely the Lower 48 upstream that focuses on exploration and production and continue to work alongside customers to develop a unique offering, which is scalable, secure, mobile, dynamic, timely and integrated along the energy value chain. While we're still very much at the start of the journey, we have already secured 29 paying customers with a strong near-term pipeline of opportunities. But what is truly exciting is the quality of the anchor customers which range from the major oil companies through to the leading independents under both bracket bands.","With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Neal. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. The presentation provides background, data, trends and analysis to support our conversation today. One change you may notice in our disclosure is that we are no longer reporting the non-GAAP measures organic or organic constant-currency adjusted EBITDA margins. As the differential between our stated and organic margins decreased and given its complexity for investors, we have decided to simplify and just provide a single total adjusted EBITDA margin. ","We, of course, will continue to provide organic constant-currency growth metrics for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA as we believe these are the best measures to evaluate the health of our overall business and are the metrics we use in our own compensation plans. Finally, we have adopted the new lease standard, ASC 842, in the first quarter of 2019 and the impact to our income statement was immaterial.","Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 7.5% to $625 million. Net income increased 1% to $134 million for the quarter. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.81 for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 2.5% compared with the same period in 2018. GAAP net income and diluted GAAP EPS was impacted in the quarter by increased earn-out expense for a number of acquisitions that have been performing well relative to earn-out targets.","Let's now focus our quarterly discussion on our organic constant-currency results for all year-over-year growth rates and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations, recent acquisitions for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons, nonoperating acquisition-related costs including earnouts and nonrecurring items. On an organic constant-currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 6.7% in the first quarter of 2019, reflecting strong organic growth across the Insurance segment and improving results in Energy and Specialized Markets. While below our long-term target for organic constant-currency revenue growth, the results reflect the impact of some carryover nonrecurring storm and implementation revenue in the prior year period. Organic constant-currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.8%, reflecting modest EBITDA margin expansion on an organic basis. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 46.7% was up from 46.4% in the prior year period, reflecting the leverage in our business model and cost discipline. This increase in total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and organic revenue and EBITDA. Acquisitions reduced adjusted EBITDA margin by 27 basis points in the period, demonstrating our ability to absorb acquisitions and still expand margins through organic operating leverage. ","Let's turn now to our segment results on an organic constant-currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 7.3% revenue growth while adjusted EBITDA increased 6.5%, reflecting the impact of some storm revenue in the prior year period. Within our underwriting and rating business, growth was balanced across personal lines and commercial lines. We saw healthy growth in our industry-standard insurance programs, property-specific underwriting and catastrophe modeling solutions revenue. Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance in repair cost estimating solutions, claims analytics and remote imagery solutions. This was offset in part by modest weakness in workers' compensation claim resolution services. "," Total adjusted EBITDA margin declined 53 basis points to 53.1% from 53.7% in the prior year period. This decline reflects the impact of some higher-margin storm revenue in the prior year period in claims, which reduced current period margin and a negative 30 basis point impact from acquisitions in the quarter offset by an improvement in the underwriting and ratings margin. Our Insurance margins were also negatively affected by increased legacy pension expense related to year-end 2018 market performance. Energy and Specialized Markets delivered revenue growth of 6.7% for the quarter, building on the trend of continuing sequential improvement. Strong growth in marketing cost intelligence solutions and core research revenues drove the growth. We also had positive contributions from our environmental health and safety and global risk analysis business. As Neal mentioned earlier, we are continuing to drive growth opportunities by leveraging our strong customer relationships in the energy industry across all of our energy businesses as we have the data and solutions that can help our customers be more efficient and effective, driving revenue growth and delivering cost savings. "," Adjusted EBITDA increased a healthy 14.1% despite ongoing investments in breakout opportunities like Lens and our chemicals, subsurface and power and renewables breakouts. Total adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 29.6% from 26.8% driven by strong leverage on revenue growth with margin expansion at WoodMac and the inclusion of PowerAdvocate in the organic results for Energy and Specialized Markets. Financial Services revenue increased 0.7% in the quarter, ","for Energy and Specialized Markets. Financial Services revenue increased 0.7% in the quarter, led by solid growth in spend-informed analytics and portfolio management, but offset by weakness in our developing enterprise data management solutions. We continue to experience some challenging year-over-year comparisons due to some nonrecurring implementation revenues in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 7.6%, and total adjusted EBITDA margin declined to 30.8% from 33.5%, also a result of some nonrecurring, high-margin implementation revenues in the prior year period.","As we discussed previously, we have been transitioning Verisk Financial Services from a top-down orientation to a bottoms-up approach with an emphasis on steady growth, and this quarter represents both progress in that exercise and reflects the impact of a productivity and profitability review of individual business lines. We expect that investors will more clearly see the underlying growth and potential of the business over time as we continue with this transition. Reported interest expense was $32 million in the quarter, down 2.7% from the prior year quarter due to the repayment of our $250 million of 4 7\/8% senior notes in January 2019 with borrowings from our revolving credit facility.","Total reported debt was $2.6 billion at March 31, 2019, down from $2.7 billion at year-end 2018. Our leverage at the end of the first quarter was 2.2x. During the quarter, we successfully issued $400 million of 4.125% 10-year senior notes. The transaction was oversubscribed, reflecting the strong demand for our credit and our ability to easily access the unsecured investment-grade debt capital markets. We used proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $180 million at March 31, 2019.","Our reported effective tax rate was 21% for the quarter compared to 18% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to a lower level of option exercises. We maintain our estimate of our effective tax rate in the full year 2019 to be between 19% and 21%. Adjusted net income was $171 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.03 for the first quarter, up approximately 10% from the prior year in both cases. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and lower share count. The benefits were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a higher effective tax rate.","Net cash provided by operating activities was $366 million for the quarter, up 12% from the prior year. Capital expenditures were $45 million for the quarter, up 4.6% from the prior year, reflecting primarily increased software development to promote growth in organic businesses and recent acquisitions. CapEx represented 7.2% of total revenue, reflecting the expected decline in capital intensity as the result of reduced capital spending on the Geomni initiative following its initial ramp-up. Free cash flow was $321 million for the quarter, an increase of 13.1% from the prior year.","During the first quarter, we returned $116 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 637,000 shares at a weighted average price of $117.82 for a total cost of $75 million. At March 31, 2019, we had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we initiated a new $50 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the second quarter. ","On March 29, 2019, we paid our first cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. And on April 29, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.20 per share -- $0.25 per share of common stock payable on June 28 for shareholders of record on June 14, 2019. Before I conclude and looking ahead to the next quarter, I want to inform you of an accounting impact that will affect our financial results beginning next quarter. Based upon the vesting provisions in our share-based compensation plan, GAAP accounting requires that we expense the full impact of share-based compensation in the period for all employees upon the attainment of age 62 instead of amortizing the expense over the vesting term. Scott Stephenson, our CEO, will turn 62 during the second quarter of 2019. And as a result, we will incur non -- we will incur incremental noncash costs of approximately $6 million related to the expensing of a share-based compensation in the second quarter. That said, we will see a benefit in the remaining quarters of 2019 and into 2020. Also on an ongoing basis, there will be a discernible concentration of compensation expense and impact on margin in the second quarter as new stock awards are granted, but this will be consistent over time and simply reflect a timing impact. We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and continue to manage capital prudently through internal investment, strategic acquisitions and the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. ","[Operator Instructions] I'll ask the operator to open the line now for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America.","Gary Bisbee","Now the question on the energy business and sort of a 2-parter. Obviously, great margin as you're returning the business to growth, but it also looked like costs didn't grow and that was a sharp slowdown relative to the pace throughout 2018. So is that -- was there anything going on or is that sustainable? And the sort of Part B of that is just can you give us any sense how much you're investing in the newer areas and why we wouldn't see cost growing more quickly as you expand those businesses?","Scott Stephenson","Well, let -- this is Scott. Let me just give you a general characterization, then Lee, maybe you want to -- or excuse me, Neal, maybe you want to jump in with any particular comments. But the way that we are operating in that business, it's a very balanced agenda where we are actually investing a lot in the categories that we talked about before, where you've got Lens, you've got subsurface, chemicals, power and renewables. But then where the rest of the business is concerned, there's been a lot of discipline. And so this is back into say, the core of the research activities that we do and you can just see that in the way that the operation is actually moving forward. So no, it's an investment-minded agenda, but we're being selective about where we're spending. Neal, I wonder if you want to add anything to that.","Neal Anderson","No. Certainly, Scott. Also on the Lens side, the big focus of Lens is also to drive internal efficiencies, and we're really pleased to see that margin expansion as we roll out Lens.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Maybe I'll move to another segment on the financial side. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color and maybe help quantify a little bit what the growth of the underlying businesses that are doing well is. And when do you think the EDM piece stops becoming a headwind to the overall growth?","Scott Stephenson","So Lee, do you want to start with just kind of, at the results level and then I can provide a little color on the context?","Lee Shavel","Yes. Sure. So Manav, thanks for the question. We saw solid growth in that, the spend-informed analytics and fraud and credit risk management. So we described that as north of 10% year-over-year growth in that. The portfolio management was in the mid-single-digits range. That obviously is kind of the core of the business. And with regard to Enterprise Data Management, that is where we had a year-over-year decline but recognizing that, that reflects some of the implementation revenue in the first quarter. So that effect is concentrated within that sector. And it also continues to reflect across that business, the ongoing development and some of the greater choppiness associated with a new and developing business segment.","Scott Stephenson","Yes. No, that's, and all I would add to that is that's one of those parts of the business where we've given real attention to try to smooth out some of the cycle that can exist there. But it is inherently a little bit lumpy year just because it's moment in time really helping our customers improve their data analytic environment.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie.","Hamzah Mazari","I was hoping if you could sort of just quantify or give us a sense of how much elevated investment spend do you have going through your P&L and CapEx? So you talked about Cloud Migration, we talked about Geomni. Just trying to gauge longer term, how should we think about a step change in your free cash flow when this elevated investment spend sort of comes down to a more normalized level? Is there a way to think about that at a high level?","Lee Shavel","So Hamzah, thanks for the question. I think there is a way to think about it and it is, it revolves around CapEx. And so a lot of our investment takes the form in, of internally developed software and so that's captured in CapEx. And as we had discussed previously, a lot of the acceleration was associated with the ramp-up of Geomni and the purchase of planes and sensors to build scale in that business. And while we continue to invest in that business, it is at a lower level on, proportionally relative to revenues than it had been in the past. And hopefully, as you saw in this quarter, the capital intensity, in other words, the CapEx as a percentage of revenue, showed a decline relative to that level. And you saw in terms of the absolute growth rate a slower level of growth. And so I think that is one way to think about the level of capital intensity within the business. Beyond that, we have OpEx expenses associated with a number of our breakout initiatives and we expect that to continue to grow as we fund these new breakout initiatives across the business. Some of them are profitable, some of them are at an earlier stage where they may be lower-margin or not profitable yet. But across the board, we would expect that investment to continue to expand at a reasonable pace and scaled against our overall operating margin expansion that we seek to achieve.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Scott Stephenson","Toni, are you there?","Toni Kaplan","Can you hear me?","Scott Stephenson","Yes.","Toni Kaplan","Energy and specialized saw the highest organic growth rate in 3 years and Neal, you talked about how you see stronger growth in the coming 5 years. The data source that I use for industry CapEx trends has been revising down sort of growth rates in the next couple of years. So I wanted to sort of get a sense of, if you have any color on how you're thinking about -- are you outperforming the market because of the products that you're providing? Is your pipeline strong because of your sales process or products? I guess just what's the disparity between maybe some of the data sources and what you're seeing.","Scott Stephenson","Neal, do you want to take that?","Neal Anderson","Yes. No, absolutely, Scott. I think first of all, we see modest growth on investment of our key customers over the next 5 years, Toni. As I mentioned in the introduction, folks are now starting to look more at investment rather than being prudent on the cost side, which is a great operating environment for Wood Mackenzie. And as you know, the traditional strengths of Wood Mackenzie is the credibility with the market, our unique data sets, and then we're adding to that in terms of a really intuitive data analytic platform in Lens. And as I mentioned in the introduction, the launch of that in the fall of last year, we already have 29 paying customers. We continue to see that growth going over the medium term.","Scott Stephenson","Hey, Neal, just a thought or really a question for you at the contextual level, is there also some effect in the Lower 48? Maybe it's not so much about CapEx intensity as it is about kind of operating agility and the ability to rebalance your operations very quickly in the unconventionals. I wonder if there's just a little bit of a mix shift there also. Toni is looking at macro data sources. Maybe a little bit of the rebalance towards Lower 48. Maybe that's in the CapEx number a little bit also?","Neal Anderson","Yes. No, absolutely, Scott. Toni, I was referring to global CapEx. Scott is absolutely right. What we're starting to see is a little bit more discipline coming into the operators' plane in the Lower 48.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair.","TimMcHugh","Just wanted to ask on the insurance side. Maybe can you elaborate a little bit more on the claims side of the business? I noticed -- I guess given the tough comp, it seems like Xactware still grew even despite the comparison. So can you talk a little bit about what's driving the growth there? And I think this is one of the first times you, at least in the presentation, you've highlighted remote aerial or kind of remote imagery solutions. So have you seen a noticeable kind of pickup in adoption of that amongst the client base?","Scott Stephenson","Mark, do you want to take that one?","Mark Anquillare","Sure. So I think you've captured many of the themes. So first of all, I will let you know that across all of the businesses, that would be the Xactware business, where the repair cost estimate continues to be very robust and strong. There was a little bit of storm-related revenue back in 1Q of '18. So we kind of grew over that. Our ClaimSearch or claims analytics business continues to be very well penetrated but very nicely growing. We continue to add new customers outside of insurance as well as some of the analytic solutions. We signed a lot of very large contracts last year, which spurred growth. So those are onboard this year and we continue to do well with those customers. And thirdly, inside that category, Geomni is clearly a contributor to growth from an organic perspective, and we continue to do well in taking customers and expanding the breadth of Geomni in the aerial imagery. So strength across the board.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeff Meuler","So as I think about Lens or, I guess, previously WoodMac 2.0 and what was talked about at the time of the acquisition originally, I think part of it, and I think you were referencing this, Neal, was related to the way that data is aggregated and automating that process. So I guess where are you in that journey? Have you largely automated the data aggregation process from the large energy companies that are supplying you with data? And then related to that, are there new fields of data, additional data that you're getting now that the process is aggregated, or is automated?","Scott Stephenson","Neal, your favorite topic. Have a go.","Neal Anderson","Thank you, Scott. Absolutely a big win this year in terms of margin expansion was that automation that you referred to. We began the rollout of Lens, which is a truly end-to-end process of reimagining which data sets we want to secure, how we automate the capture and the transformation of that data and then for our analysts in turn to add their interpretation and produce the products for clients. We started an onshore U.S., Lower 48, exploration and production. And we're currently in the process of rolling that out to the global upstream this year. And the second part of the question, we're always looking for new data sets. But the wonderful thing about this automation and bringing on a new Chief Data Officer, Nabeel Azar, is he is tirelessly looking for new data sets, be them in the public domain, be them through partnerships or indeed, other routes.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","It's Andrew. Lee, Verisk score reported margin expansion in the first quarter and obviously, you're still investing in key growth initiatives. Higher levels of investment spending was accomplished in 2018. Lee, with that in mind, is Verisk placed to have reported margins to be up directionally this year?","Lee Shavel","So Andrew, I appreciate the question. Again, looking for guidance on margin. We are striving every quarter to increase our revenues at a higher rate than EBITDA. We achieved that this quarter despite investments and we'll continue to work to deliver on that. I think certainly as we said, the growth in this quarter was impacted by some tougher year-over-year comparisons, which I think diminish over time and so that certainly creates an opportunity for us to show some improvement ahead if we're successful there.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","The underwriting and ratings revenue piece of the insurance business grew 6.8% in the quarter, which was slightly slower than claims revenue growth and this is pretty typical. Underwriting typically grows at a slower rate than claims. Can you discuss internal initiatives that maybe accelerate the pace of growth for underwriting to the point where it could potentially surpass the claims growth?","Scott Stephenson","Mark, do you want to take that one?","Mark Anquillare","Sure. So I first need to highlight the -- what we will refer to as our business focused on the pricing and underwriting and its -- the forms and coverage. That's a business that is kind of the foundation of Verisk for many, many years. It provides a very, very solid base. But at the same time, we're well penetrated and it's difficult for that business to grow all that dramatically. So what we've been trying to do is grow around that, and we have added many new products and tried to go international to accelerate that growth. And in those areas, we are seeing very high double-digit growth to accelerate the overall growth of underwriting and rating. So we're pleased with the investment that's being made. We're very pleased with the progress that's happening. But to answer your question, international is kind of one way we're going to try to extend and expand analytics beyond those core solutions, very important. And as I described, inside this category, in the quarter, cat bonds and the cat bond market was a little slow. But nonetheless, our catastrophe modeling continues to, on a baseline, grow nicely with some of those efforts. So I hope I provided you with a little bit of the portfolio and how we think about it to answer your question.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Drew Kootman","This is Drew Kootman on for Joe. You guys mentioned that the integration, you guys have been having a lot of success on recent acquisitions. I was hoping you could highlight just a couple of those and discuss the pipeline you're seeing moving forward.","Scott Stephenson","So Neal talked about some of the ways that we've been able to get the cost intelligence side of the business and the supply side and demand side of the business all synchronized in the marketplace. So that's kind of the view on the energy front, and we also talked about how we pulled together LCI and Argus data sets in order to work on some of the more fraud and bankruptcy-related topics that you got in Financial Services. Mark, anything you want to -- do you want to talk a little bit more about sort of the trifecta, Sequel, AIR and Analyze Re?","Mark Anquillare","Yes. I mean referenced kind of in a high level. From an international perspective, I think we found some very nice opportunities in the U.K., specifically in the London market. We are seeing customers who kind of see the vision, like the ability that consumer analytic and data in a way they see most comfortable, but know that we are behind the scenes seamlessly integrating it, which has created an opportunity to walk into a customer, talk about a suite of solutions and them coming to us and saying, Geez, don't you also have this product? Wouldn't that fit in? And in a surprisingly and very good way, contracts and opportunities are growing, and I give a lot of credit to the team in the UK and how all of our business have really thought about a way to satisfy our customers. That has been reassuring and it continues to show a lot of promise.","Scott Stephenson","And Mark, we said it but just adding on to this. The Sequel tools which relate to understanding exposures and their accumulations, that is sold almost exclusively in Europe today. Yet the integration that you're talking about ties it in with AIR, where a very strong part of our AIR franchise is in the United States. So there's a real pull together there.","Mark Anquillare","The opportunity is not just the UK","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Oscar Turner with SunTrust.","Oscar Turner","So my question is on Lens. I was wondering, what's the go-to-market for that product? Has the focus been on cross-selling to existing customers? And then can you give some color into what aspects of the product customers have been most excited about?","Scott Stephenson","Neal, do you want to take that one?","Neal Anderson","Yes. No, absolutely. And it's a dual track. We're really excited about Lens both in terms of cross-selling into our existing customer base, and also we've had huge interest from new clients, new logos to Wood Mackenzie. So it's certainly been both. And the feedback that we've got from Lens, and it ranges very much customer by customer, some really love the user experience, how intuitive it is, that they can use it on their laptop, iPhone, iPad. Other folks love the dynamic nature of it. So we have put in various assumptions with our unique data sets. And if they want to change, then they can change that on the fly and recalculate valuations which would have taken minutes before in a matter of seconds. And then other folks really value that true integrated approach along the value chain, which we will continue to build and build and build over time.","Scott Stephenson","Neal, maybe you comment also on just kind of the, it's the same sales force that is taking Lens out to the same customers that is already taking all of our other solutions out to market.","Neal Anderson","Yes. No, absolutely. This is just one other avenue for sales force in terms of how they can support and service our customers.","Scott Stephenson","The point being that there's leverage here.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo Securities.","Bill Warmington","So I wanted to ask about the two motion partnership. Basically, how does having a smartphone telematics platform impact your product capability? And does it let you expand your addressable market? Can you go after segments that you couldn't go after before?","Scott Stephenson","Mark, that's something for you.","Mark Anquillare","Sure. So let me try to, so reminding you, what we have done is we've partnered with a lot of the OEMs, Honda, Hyundai, GM. And from the vehicle, we've harvested data. We're up to 5 million cars, 90 billion miles, and that is helping our insurers do either modeling themselves or use our programs to understand behavior of those drivers so they can get a better price with regard to insurance. There's also some insurance claims use cases where we can help get assistance and actually initiate a claim. What we're trying to do is provide this consortium of all data available around the vehicle to help our customers understand the risk and price it better. So what the mobile devices do is they can provide that same type of information with, by the way, consent from users, so that we have information about distance traveled, information about the quality of the driving, all of that about both the vehicle connected to the driver. In some cases in idea identified ways; in other cases, we know the vehicle. So it is a part of a broader strategy to aggregate as much information about a vehicle and about a driver to help the assessment of that risk. So hopefully, you can understand the expansive nature of what can be involved with telematics from the standpoint of the mobile phone as well as telematics from the vehicle itself, harvesting from OnStar, as an example.","Operator","There are no further questions.","Scott Stephenson","Okay.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer, Corporate Finance and Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.","Eva F. Huston","Thank you, Steve, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our fourth quarter 2012 financial results. With me on the call this morning are: Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Frank, Scott and Mark, highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.","The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the 10-K, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days until March 28, 2013, on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And now I will turn the call over to Frank Coyne.","Frank J. Coyne","Thank you, Eva, and good morning. In fourth quarter 2012, we delivered strong overall performance of over 18% total revenue growth and 26% diluted adjusted EPS growth. For the full year, total revenue growth was 15% and diluted adjusted EPS growth was 20%.","Our consolidated organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 6.7%, reflecting strong growth in healthcare and good growth in insurance solutions, offset by weakness in mortgage. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth was 9.4% in both the quarter and for the year. Profitability was strong with an EBITDA margin of over 45% in the quarter and for the year. Free cash flow was also strong, increasing over 25% in 2012, even after our pension funding in the earlier part of the year.","In the fourth quarter, our Risk Assessment revenue grew 5%, after adjusting for the impact of a transfer of some revenue to Decision Analytics in 2012, and also grew 5% for the year, reflecting the value to our long-standing insurance company customers of our industry-standard insurance programs and property-specific data. In Decision Analytics for the quarter, our revenue grew almost 30% and our insurance solutions grew about 10%, even as transactional claims activity related to Sandy and other storms was captured under existing contracted customer minimums.","Our healthcare solutions continued their excellent organic growth, growing revenue about 28% organically in the quarter. Total healthcare revenue growth was almost 90%, including the contributions MediConnect continues to make. In the quarter, we generated over $70 million in revenue from our healthcare business.","In financial services, we continue to be pleased that Argus' performance has been on target and our future expectations remain on track. Within our mortgage tools, we are seeing recent trends continuing. Our origination-related revenue continues to grow ahead of the origination market, while our overall mortgage revenue declined, although slightly less than we expected it to when we talked to you last quarter. We will continue to face challenges in mortgage in 2013 as the forensic business moves back towards normalized level. But overall, our business is now more diverse in both customer and solution set.","We remain disciplined on our use of capital and are focused on delivering shareholder returns. In 2012, we spent about $800 million on acquisitions, primarily MediConnect and Argus. We find the results of our acquisitions encouraging and believe our shareholders should be pleased by this use of capital, as evidenced by strong initial results and strategic fits.","Our share repurchases remained moderated in the quarter at $35 million as we continue on the path to meet our commitments to our debt holders. Total repurchase activity in 2012 was $163 million. We continue to be active in looking at M&A but also continue to maintain our discipline, focusing on assets with a true strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth prospects.","In this quarter, and more importantly, for the full year 2012, we had strong financial results. The ongoing experience, knowledge and dedication of our employees across our enterprise position us well for 2013.","You've also seen the announcement last week that I will be transitioning the CEO role to Scott Stephenson in April. I am pleased to continue to serve on the board as Non-Executive Chairman. Scott has been a key member of our management team for over a decade and is the right person to carry forward our culture of performance.","Now I'll turn it over to Scott for an update on some of our initiatives.","Scott G. Stephenson","Thank you, Frank, very much. These are exciting times for Verisk, and I'm really very pleased that we will have the continued guidance and counsel that Frank will be providing as Chairman of our board.  As you all know, we have strong team running our businesses on a day-to-day basis, and you'll be hearing directly from many of them at our Investor Day on March 7.","Our deep industry expertise has made us successful and will continue to help us enhance and develop new analytic and data-driven solutions for our customers now and into the future. Another driver of our success is our culture of innovation and continuous improvement. About a month ago, our leadership team was together and we had a chance to talk about the ways we can continue to drive innovation and the analytic mindset throughout our 6,500 employees.","Our teams are energized, and we have a good crop of investment opportunities that we will be funding in 2013 and beyond. For example, remote-sensing and imagery is one of those. We are gathering images that can be used to identify risks beforehand and then quantify them afterward. Something else that we talk about a lot is the idea of the N+1 data set. At Verisk today, we have about 5 petabytes of data, which definitely qualifies us as a big data shop. Our creativity in analyzing these data to develop new solutions will allow us to make our individual proprietary data assets into new data sets by combining them with other data sets. If there are N data sets in the world, we can have more insight by creating N+1. If our customers have N data sets, we can create more insight by creating N+1. Always, always looking to add more value.","With that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover some of the financial results in more detail.","Mark V. Anquillare","Thanks, Scott. As you've heard, we are pleased with our performance for both the fourth quarter and full year 2012. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 18.2% total revenue growth and 6.7% organic revenue growth. For fiscal year 2012, total revenue growth was 15.2% and organic revenue growth was 7.3%. Excluding our historical mortgage business, our revenue growth organically in the quarter and the full year was 9.4%.","For the fourth quarter, our Decision Analytics segment revenue delivered 28.7% growth, of which 7.9% was organic, excluding the acquisitions of MediConnect, Argus and Aspect Loss Prevention, as well as the transfer of revenue for the mortgage appraisal tools. As a reminder, in 2012, we transferred revenue related to mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment's property-specific revenue category into Decision Analytics' financial services revenue category. Going forward, in 2013, we will discuss growth rates treating the appraisal tools revenue as a part of Decision Analytics. Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category revenue grew 9.6% in the fourth quarter and 9.3% organically, excluding the acquisition of Aspect Loss Prevention.","We continued good growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions in the quarter and finished 2012 with 95% market share for public property catastrophe bond modeling. We also saw growth from our loss quantification solutions. As discussed in our third quarter call, we did not expect to see a bump in growth due to Sandy because many of our customers were below minimum contracted claims volumes, and that proved to be the case. Claims solutions delivered good growth. Our underwriting solutions continued to add strong growth.","In financial services, which include both Argus and the mortgage business, revenue grew 41.8% in the quarter. Argus is an excellent business, and we remain pleased with the performance since the acquisition in the third quarter, which has exceeded our estimates provided at the time of the acquisition. After adjusting for the acquisition of Argus and the transfer of the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment into this revenue category, in the fourth quarter, revenues declined 19.6%. For all of 2012, revenues declined 11.3%, a result that was slightly better than our expectations as discussed with you last quarter.","Consistent with recent trends, mortgage origination tools grew nicely in the quarter and reflected the growth in the mortgage origination market. But revenue from forensic solutions declined in the quarter by more than offsetting them. In thinking about the mortgage portion of financial services for 2013, I believe it's possible we could see a similar decline to the 11% we saw in the full year 2012.","Healthcare continues its strong revenue growth, 89.1% for the fourth quarter and 115% for 2012. Healthcare organic revenue growth was 28.5% in the fourth quarter and 36.2% for the full year. Our total revenue growth benefited from the second quarter addition of MediConnect, another acquisition that has performed strongly in 2012.","The performance to date validates our strategy of combining our Revenue Integrity and HEDIS reporting solutions with MediConnect to create a comprehensive solution, RQI, or Revenue and Quality Intelligence. Organically, we continue to add and implement new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers. The 2011 acquisitions of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners became a part of our organic growth calculation in the third quarter.","As a reminder, we do have seasonality in our Revenue and Quality Intelligence revenue. As you recall, we generally expect the first half of the year to be seasonally low with more revenue to come in the second half. This means for Verisk Health overall, the shape of our business is going to be in the 60-ish percent towards the second half of the year. Split across quarters can vary depending upon customer needs. Also it means margins are seasonally lower in the first half. And as Verisk Health is scaled, you'll see that more in Decision Analytics.","If you are looking at quarters, I would also point out that the performance of MediConnect in the first quarter of 2012 includes $3 million or $4 million of overflow revenue from 4Q 2011, which you should assume won't occur in 1Q of '13. The revenue from 1Q '12 was prior to our acquisition and disclosed in our filings. We continue to feel very good about our growth prospects in the healthcare vertical.","Our specialized markets. Revenue grew 4.4% in fourth quarter with good growth from our weather and climate analytics and more modest growth from our supply chain solutions due to customer timing. The revenue category grew 8.3% for the full year.","Turning to Risk Assessment. For both the fourth quarter and full year 2012, we reported revenue growth of 2.9% and 5% after adjusting for the impact of the transfer we discussed earlier. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew 5.8% in the quarter, reflecting our 2012 invoices and strong growth in our premium leakage solutions. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we have included the actuarial services and statistical agency service categories as a part of industry-standard programs, that they are closely tied to, and build as a part of our same customer invoices. Our property-specific information revenue declined 6% in the quarter as reported, but excluding the transfer, grew 2.6%. Our customers have received and began paying their 2013 invoices, which are modestly higher than 2012.","EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $189.6 million, as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 19.4% for the quarter and our EBITDA margin was 45.6%, reflecting good expense management. We produced $695.9 million of EBITDA for the full year with margins of 45.4%, including a $13 million decline in pension expense due to the freeze versus 2011, or an 80 bps margin expansion.","The margins in Decision Analytics were 40.3% in fourth quarter 2012 versus 40.7% in fourth quarter 2011. Full year margins were 39.8%, flat with 2011. We continue to see a mix shift that impacts margins, as our faster-growing businesses have not yet scaled to the margins of our more mature businesses.","In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 55.4% versus 51.7% in fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year, Risk Assessment margins were 54.6%, up from 51% in the prior year. We benefited by about 180 bps in the margin due to the lower pension costs related to the freeze of our plan.","Our business continues to show scalable profitability, but we also continue to invest in developing new solutions. We continue to see opportunities for investing in the future growth. And as you remember, those can create some near-term pressure on margins. In 2013, we expect to invest in remote imagery, in Touchstone, our next-generation platform for catastrophe modeling, and united -- unified healthcare platform and in several interesting data initiatives.","We expect that these investments, which will be primarily reflected in the Decision Analytics segment, will be weighted more towards the first 2 quarters of 2013 and could impact the P&L in those periods by about $10 million to $15 million in total, which would also have some impact on lowering margins. However, these are very positive long-term initiatives, and rest assured, we're very happy to be able to invest behind these promising opportunities because they'll ultimately grow EBITDA and cash flow over the long term. We expect our corporate margins will be impacted more modestly, if at all, for full year 2013, as our incremental EBIT margins from existing solutions offset investment.","Our interest expense was $5.9 million in the fourth quarter and $18.7 million for the full year versus their respective periods in 2011. This increase was due to the higher debt balances related to our acquisitions. We ended fourth quarter with a total debt of $1.5 billion and had repaid all but $10 million of our revolver borrowings.","Our reported effective tax rate was 29% for the quarter and 36.6% for the full year. We have been actively working on our tax planning strategies and were rewarded by the benefits resulting from this effort. The lower tax rate in the quarter contributed about $0.07 to EPS. And we received a favorable state private letter ruling, which contributed about $0.04 in EPS for prior years and about $0.01 for 2012. We do expect this ruling to reduce our taxes in 2013 and future years by about $2 million annually. We also saw another $0.02 one-time benefit due to additional successful tax initiatives. For 2013, as we think about the tax rate, around 38% seems to be the right level for use in your models.","Coming down to the net income line. We focus on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we define in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense less the income tax impact on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 27.1% to $108.7 million for the quarter. Full year adjusted net income grew 19% to $361.3 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.63 for the quarter, an increase of 26%. This included about 7% -- $0.07 related to the tax benefit discussed earlier. Full year adjusted EPS was $2.10, up 20% from 2011.","The average diluted share count was 171.9 million shares in the quarter and 171.7 million shares for the full year. On December 31, 2012, our diluted share count was 172.2 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased about 715,000 shares for $34.8 million. For fiscal year 2012, we repurchased 3.5 million shares for $162.6 million, an average price of $46.57.","At quarter end, we had about $144 million left under our authorization. As we discussed the last couple of quarters, we moderated our buyback program after acquiring Argus to ensure we meet our deleveraging commitments. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs of about 25%. For 2013, we anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution.","Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, our cash and cash equivalents was about $90 million. Total debt, both short term and long term, totaled $1.5 billion, reflecting debts borrowed to fund the Argus acquisition, which closed on August 31. Today, our incremental debt capacity is over $800 million and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Also in December 2012, we made a purchase for $27 million of technology and service application, underlying a long-standing product, as our agreement with a vendor came to an end.","I'm pleased to report that our debt to pro forma EBITDA at December 31 was 2x, reaching our steady-state leverage rate well ahead of our stated goal of second half of 2013. This is down for the pro forma ratio of 2.35x at the time of the Argus acquisition. As we have stated before, we are willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt to EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities because our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly.","Free cash flow in 2012, which we define as cash from operations plus capital expenditures, was $388.5 million, an increase of about $81.1 million, or 26.4% versus 2011. This increase was despite the funding of our pension, which we have mentioned previously. Excluding the impact of our pension funding, net of tax benefit and certain year-over-year timing items, our free cash flow is up about 19%. Our capital expenditures were about 5.2% of revenue for full year 2012. Free cash flow represented 55.8% of EBITDA for 2012, reflecting improved conversion rate compared to the 51.8% in 2011, despite the $72 million pension funding.","As we think about capital spending for 2013, we're expecting $115 million for the full year. This includes the capital related to some of the initiatives I discussed earlier, as well as the consolidation of our data centers into 2 primary locations. The special projects are approximately $20 million of that total capital spend. So you would see the steady-state CapEx closer to $95 million in 2013. Overall, our business is performing very well, and we have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals and continue to invest in the future.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Congratulations, Scott. Within Decision Analytics, the healthcare organic growth was significantly higher for the fourth quarter than what would have been implied by your outlook on the third quarter call. What differed from your expectations from late October, early November? And is the rate of growth we saw in the fourth quarter sustainable going forward?","Mark V. Anquillare","This is Mark. Let me just give you a quick overview. I mean, I think we continue to feel very optimistic about healthcare. It's a combination of new customers, as well as growth and penetration within existing. So as we think about the overall health of healthcare, seeing a combination, both increased penetration as well as new, is healthy and reassuring. So all I could tell you with regard to the interpretation from the quarter is I think what we try to do is be realistic, and our healthcare assets continue to perform very well.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I see. And then just a follow-up, Mark, related to your comments regarding pension expense. You called out a $13 million reduction for 2012. What should we expect for 2013 and beyond? Is pension expense going to come down again this year?","Mark V. Anquillare","So what we did back on March 1, 2012, we froze our pension. So that was really kind of a one-time decline because we now have, in essence -- I don't want to say off our books, but the actual increased liability is gone. So we should find steady state into the future as long as discount rates remain relatively unchanged and the stock market doesn't do anything wild that would affect our asset value. So I would suggest basically flat into the future.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I see. And then you called out a modest increase in 2013 invoices for Risk Assessment. Can you bracket what modest means from a pricing standpoint this year?","Mark V. Anquillare","Well, I think what we've always tried to do is really focus on our insurance customers as a whole. And we don't want to think of Risk Assessment industry standard as a silo. So we've commented on kind of inflationary type of increases there with a focus more on the overall insurance customer and growth there. And I think we do anticipate increasing growth or increasing organic growth in insurance across the board. But I wouldn't attach too much to the Risk Assessment [indiscernible].","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. Just a final housekeeping question. You called out a 38% tax rate assumption for 2013, which would be up from the 36.6% last year, despite the tax benefit you expect this year. So I'm curious, why would the tax rate go up, given the tax benefits that you're seeing in 2013?","Mark V. Anquillare","Yes. So what we try to call out and identify is some of that tax planning strategy had the benefit of a lookback. So we gained some benefit looking back from 2007 to 2011, and we got to pick that up in the quarter, and we get about a $2 million benefit going forward. So what you see is the normalization of that amount. And the lookback is about $0.04, if that helps you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Mark, just to clarify, did you make some comments about full year reported healthcare revenue growth? I think I may have missed what you said.","Mark V. Anquillare","So full year 2012?","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","'13. Sorry, looking forward.","Mark V. Anquillare","I think we feel -- again, feel the opportunity is promising. We feel good about the growth there. But I don't think we're going to give any specific numbers around healthcare.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I wasn't sure if you had specifically quantified anything. And with regard to the investments in Decision Analytics in 2013, you mentioned they're kind of front end-loaded. So I guess, this is kind of a two-pronged question. Should they be somewhat linear in the first couple quarters? And then Scott, how long do you think the payback is on some of these initiatives? Because it seems like this is the first time you're calling out and specifically quantifying investments in specific initiatives and really giving us a clear sense of timing and magnitude.","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes. So let me ask Mark to just address the pace of the investments, and then I'll come back and talk background and talk about payback.","Mark V. Anquillare","Yes. I think one of the things that we feel good about is as we look for innovation across our businesses, we've had people step up with some interesting opportunities. So we obviously want to invest quickly around good long-term prospects. I would tell you that it's probably a little bit more first quarter than second quarter but not by much.","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes. And with respect to payback, you have to differentiate among the things that we're talking about. So some of them are for efficiency. And those are going to kick in relatively sooner. So for example, the consolidation of our data centers down to 2 primary data centers is the kind of thing that should be paying off even as we do it. So that's a '13, '14 kind of an item. Some of the things we're doing that are essentially clipping more value into existing product platforms should also have relatively faster paybacks. I mentioned in my remarks upfront, making use of remote imagery. Basically, what we're doing is bringing more data into existing solutions, data which our customers have very clearly indicated they'd like access to. So again, there, you've got categories where the paybacks are pretty quick. Some of the other things we're doing are kind of replatforming existing solutions, where we're creating a much more comprehensive environment in which our customers can do their work, their decisioning work. And those are going to be a little bit longer. Those might be more kind of 3-ish, 5-year kind of windows even though benefits will start to occur closer to today. But the profile of the revenue is probably going to be a little bit further out. In all cases, we think we're talking about very strong value propositions. And I just want to comment on, again kind of following up what both Frank and Mark said, I mean, it's really great, actually, the fact that our existing businesses are generating these very substantial organic growth opportunities. I mean, it's coming from within the businesses. We're definitely asking for investment. We're definitely asking for emphasis on growth and organic growth. But it's really encouraging to see the quality of the thinking and the scale of the opportunities that's coming from our existing units.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one last one, if I may. Should we expect to see the insurance theme within Decision Analytics bounce back into double-digit organic revenue growth in '13, all else being equal?","Mark V. Anquillare","So let me -- I'm not sure I'm going to quantify, but let me qualify it. I think we are feeling good about an increased level of organic growth in insurance across the board. So I'm talking about both the Risk Assessment, as well as the category of insurance inside of Decision Analytics. So I think the answer is yes to your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Could you help us -- or just remind us again the potential runoff you talked about in Q3 for your mortgage business? And then within the forensic piece, can you help us understand the nature of those contracts? Are they multiyear deals?","Mark V. Anquillare","Sure. So let me first talk about the mortgage question. When we last got together, I think what we were talking about was 2 things. On the front end, where we talked about underwriting and kind of the analytics focused on applications, that's both refinances and originations, we continue to grow nicely and really kind of ahead of market trends. On the back end, we continue to see a more than offsetting dropoff. And at third quarter, we had talked about potentially the full year being down as much as 12% to 15%. And I think we came in at about 11%. So just to look back, one of the things that we benefited from and now kind of seeing the downside from was in that forensic review. As all these defaults hit the industry, people started to use our services in a material way. Remember, using our services helps a mortgage insurer, as an example, rescind coverage and push back that obligation to the lender. The business, when we bought it, was rather small. And it grew nicely during a time. And we've kind of gotten back to the point where we said it went up dramatically and it's kind of coming down. And we just tried to quantify what the back end looked like. So we kind of gave a range as to how big that drop could be. And that kind of is consistent with what we continue and what we've said even into '13, where we said that it could be down as much as 11% again. I think the second part of your question was about the contracts?","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right.","Mark V. Anquillare","Here, it's a little bit different. It's more transactional. So you do contract for multiyears with either a mortgage lender or a mortgage insurer. And you get integrated, so you're tightly integrated, you're tightly embedded inside their processes, but it is transactional. So there's no guaranteed minimums. There's nothing that would guarantee an amount. It's just you're the source when they choose to run that type of analytic.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just back on the mortgage runoff again. I mean, if you were down like you projected, 11% in '13, would you kind of be back to that rate before you saw the spike in activity?","Mark V. Anquillare","I would need to actually kind of work through the details, but I believe that we're getting back to that normalized level, maybe a little bit. We're still above where we were back at that day because we've grown the business, we have more customers. One thing I want to let you know, and we've talked about this, is we used to have what was a couple very big and concentrated customers. The level and nature of the solutions now is much more spread across customers and products. So the quality of the revenue is improved, as we think about kind of into the future.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then finally, just on the overall margin. You talked about the investment in Decision Analytics in the first half. But then it may not have much of an overall impact to the overall margin. Is it fair to kind of assume a flattish type margin for '13 overall for the corporate EBITDA margin?","Mark V. Anquillare","I think we try not to give real specifics. But I think there is probably -- I think we've tried to talk about the investment kind of offsetting the scale, so I think we should be around there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Raymond James.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First of all, congratulations to Scott on the promotion to CEO. And then also congratulations to Frank on taking Verisk from a monoline private company to a diversified $9 billion public company.","Frank J. Coyne","Thanks, Bill. I had a lot of help.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Now there's been talk in the industry about you guys developing an all-claims fraud database for healthcare similar to the ISO Claims database for insurance. And I'd like to ask if you could give us some color on that and also some thoughts on that opportunity in healthcare versus insurance.","Scott G. Stephenson","So we are working on that. It's extremely important for us in the healthcare space. And it's not something that actually we're going to put a lot out in the public about right now, Bill, because it's a very critical thing that we're doing and it's very proprietary to us. I will say that it builds upon 2 strengths that we've got inside of the company. One is the fact that we already aggregate claims data on the P&C side, so there's a methodology there that we can reference. And secondly, we're already aggregating medical claims in the P&C domain. And it's really quite obvious that streaming together medical claims from the P&C domain with the formal healthcare space is actually a very powerful thing to do that has not been done before. With respect to who it is that's coming into our approach and the rate at which they're coming into our approach, I mean, that really is kind of -- we're right in the middle of all that, Bill. And we're really not sharing very many -- we're not sharing very much about that right now because it is so critical and sensitive. But I will say that it is an idea that seems intuitive for the healthcare space.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then of course, I couldn't not ask a question correlated to mortgage. So I just wanted to ask one of the clarifying question on 2013, when we talk about the 11% decline. That's for the combined forensic and origination, is that?","Mark V. Anquillare","That's correct.","Scott G. Stephenson","That's correct.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Correct, okay. And then for the -- your thoughts in terms of your ability to offset the decline in the forensic piece with increased penetration on the front end.","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, I mean, basically, the work that we're doing is to look at all of the lines of service that we provide and to think about which of them are most valuable to our customers and which of them can be [indiscernible] the most. And actually, there are some lines of service that haven't even really been much a part of the business previously than in 2013, we're going -- we expect to do some merging. So it's even a little more nuanced, Bill, than just front and back end. It's also sort of multiple ways in which we can serve the originator.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then one housekeeping question, just the share count exiting the quarter.","Mark V. Anquillare","I think, exiting the quarter, give me one second, Bill, I referenced it. I want to just get you [indiscernible]. So exiting the quarter, we had 172.2 million shares.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First, I wanted to ask about the catastrophe modeling. Can you elaborate a little more on the strength there? And how sustainable is that as we go into next year? I imagine the comps are much tougher after the improvement you've seen this year.","Scott G. Stephenson","I didn't actually understand the point you were making there at the end about the comps.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just the comparison. I mean, it's had such a strong year. Can you continue to grow on top of that?","Scott G. Stephenson","Okay. Within our own experience. All right. I thought maybe you were referencing the market. Yes, catastrophe modeling is a very important discipline inside of the P&C space, and it is going to remain one. There, something to understand about it is that there are multiple ways that, that set of services grows. One way is by modeling new combinations of perils and geographies. And it's -- we're considerably far away from all perils and all meaningful geographies being modeled. And so there's growth there. One of the investments we're making to replatform what we do is actually inside of what we do on the catastrophe modeling side. And fundamentally, what that's about is taking the discipline from being aimed at making portfolio kinds of decisions, carriers working on their reinsurance with their reinsurers and vice versa. All of that will continue to be the case. But it's also about taking the same modeling capabilities and actually applying them on a risk-by-risk basis in the underwriting process for the primary carrier. And that also is going to represent some growth. And so there are just a number of things which are involved in it. And I just want to help everybody to understand that it's actually a very multidimensional thing that goes on there. And so we really believe that it is a -- it's a category with legs over a long period of time. And we believe that we have a very leading position. You may have noticed that we had a very, very disproportionately high share of all the cat bond issuances in 2012. We think that in many ways, that's the purest form of competition in the cat modeling space, representative of who has the best science and technology.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then Argus, can you talk about it? It seems like just even on a sequential and year-over-year basis, at least what I can back into in the run rate of revenue for that business, seems like it picked up a fair amount this past quarter, or at least it was better than I expected. Is that -- is there anything special going on there? Or was it just kind of the ongoing growth of that business?","Scott G. Stephenson","You want to go ahead, Mark?","Mark V. Anquillare","Well, let me just -- I think what we've seen is -- let's do full year, I'll go kind of a pro forma basis. I think we saw greater than 20% growth at Argus. I think we see them delivering. And you're right, the actual results for the 4 months that we own them was greater than what we originally advised. Scott, let me turn it back over to you.","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes. Just, it's a kind of -- I'm going to almost repeat myself what I was saying about cat modeling. What Argus does is multidimensional, and it's important that you understand that. So the business has historically been aimed at aggregating data to understand the credit card product line. There's a big opportunity to try to understand demand deposits and other products which come from the retail banks. There's a geographic expansion dimension. And then there's also moving from focusing primarily on product design and pricing considerations also to --  because of the data that are a part of what the supply that Argus receives, there's also a big opportunity to move into looking at issues of fraud. And so again, please just understand it as being very multidimensional. And essentially, what's going on is a number of those themes are active. They were active in the fourth quarter of 2012, and they'll remain active going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to talk about the status of the unified healthcare technology platform. What has been accomplished? What still has to be accomplished? And how does that lift healthcare organic growth?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes. So it's something that we're very focused on. We review this very routinely with the business unit, and we're pleased with where we stand overall. We have customers who are live, being served with the unified platform, powering our solutions on the back end. That is particularly true in the payment accuracy part of what it is that we do. Next up, and importantly for us, is having the same unified platform hooked up to and supporting our solutions in the Enterprise Analytics division of what it is that we do. Ultimately, it will be all of Verisk Health. But Enterprise Analytics is up next, and that's a 2013 deliverable, so -- and where we have activated customers against the platform, we and they have both been very, very pleased with the result.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And it lifts revenues when you do that, right?","Scott G. Stephenson","Say again?","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Does it affect revenues?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes. I mean, the primary benefit of what we're doing there is that we create access to our data stores for all of our existing solutions, as well as the next one that we develop. And because of that, in effect, what we'll be able to do is to say to an existing customer -- and I think you all know how important cross-selling is to our growth. What we'll be able to say to an existing healthcare customer is, \"Because you're already contributing data, you're essentially already in our environment.\" So if you want to turn on another solution, the cost and time to do that is extremely negligible. And we believe that, that's going to help accelerate cross-selling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Congrats to Scott and Frank, as well. Just a quick follow-up on the Argus side. I guess, you gave us sort of what the pro forma full year revenue looked like. Can you maybe give us some color on how the margins performed there? I think you had given us the first half margins at the time of the acquisition. Was it somewhat similar to that, better? Any color on that front?","Mark V. Anquillare","Yes. I mean, the margins that you saw in the first half, or what we did as part of our filing, that continued into the 4 months where we owned. And I think we -- I think very similar to a lot of the Verisk products, that you have a wonderful brand with some real value add to the customers that will ultimately provide leverage and scale as it grows. So we feel good about the margins then. They are very strong and consistent to what you saw in the first half.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And is Argus, I guess, for the early stages, I think as you discussed some acquisitions, still is roughly going to be -- I guess, the way to put it is more a stand-alone company? Like is there -- I was thinking -- trying to think looking forward, are there any cross-sell opportunities between Argus and the rest of the businesses?","Scott G. Stephenson","It is more stand-alone, though it's not entirely stand-alone for a couple of reasons. One is, we are, at the enterprise level, looking to integrate substantially all of our data assets. And so what we should have the opportunity to do then is to make observations about consumer credit, consumer demand deposits, the personal line side of the insurance space, even potentially healthcare, make integrated observations in order to, for example, do an even more comprehensive job of rooting out fraud. And so I think Argus has a big data shop in and of itself, has something powerful to contribute on that front. And then I would also say that we are certainly exploring maybe individual product level opportunities, where Argus observations about consumers might be able to be tied into work that we're doing, particularly on the P&C side as it relates to fraud findings. But the shape of the P&L, I think, will be substantially based upon the customers and the product sets that Argus has.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And Mark, if I may, on the mortgage side, what sort of origination estimate are you using for the market in your numbers?","Mark V. Anquillare","So we're looking back. We typically focus on the MBA forecast, Mortgage Bankers Association forecast. Is that was your question is, I'll make sure.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Yes. No, fair enough. So that's what's baked in. And I guess, just related to that in terms of the overall segment, just your thoughts on sort of strategically, it seems like that's the least set of all the businesses and it has been a drag for a couple of years now on overall growth. Just strategically, how you view that unit?","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, I'll say a couple things. The first one is that we apply ourselves to making the mortgage business a distinctive Verisk-like business, just as we do with everything we do, which means always trying to infuse it with higher-level analytics, with more proprietary data and a robust stream of new solutions. So we don't take any different approach in terms of the running of the business nor will we take a different approach. What I would also say is that we're just always alert to thinking about the shape of our whole portfolio. We try not to think of anything as being sacred but always putting things to the test of: Is there value? Is there increasing value? What's the nature of the external market that we face, et cetera? So in that sense, mortgage is always being reviewed in the same way that the whole business is always being reviewed. And we don't ever turn off that part of the thought process.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Flynn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question relates to your comments about industry-standard business, Risk Assessment overall as well. I just want to clarify what you said because, Mark, some of your comments tailed off a bit at the end. Are you saying you expect growth for industry standard to accelerate in 2013 at kind of an inflationary rate, which would mean a few hundred basis points of acceleration would be reasonable? I mean, I know you don't want to give guidance, but pulling together everything that you said, is that kind of the right picture?","Mark V. Anquillare","No. Let me just make sure. I'll say it again. I said that we expected the industry-standard program, the invoices are out, and they grew at an inflationary pace. There was an increase. It was an increase, just inflationary kind of similar path. The point that I was making was that we just don't look at industry-standard programs as a silo. What we're interested in doing is making sure we sell more to and grow our relationship broadly across Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics to our insurance customers. And we do see an increase in growth rate across the total relationship as we think about '13.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then another question I have that relates to G&A and it ties in your comments about investments. Another way to look at this, your G&A was down a couple million sequentially. First of all, why was that? And how should we think about that line item in the model next year as we layer in investments?","Mark V. Anquillare","Well, I think one thing you do need to factor into this is the pension freeze that we talked about, the $13 million, is a combination of cost of goods because there's people working on product. But it's also about the people that are providing support functions. And remember, if you think about pension, a lot of those people are, in fact, retired. So that affects the SG&A number also. I would generally expect SG&A to grow slightly slower than the top line. We would expect leverage and scale there.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then for Argus, I know we've touched on it a couple times in the call. But just to ensure accuracy, I mean, can you actually give us the revenue number that Argus generated in the quarter?","Mark V. Anquillare","I think that is...","Eva F. Huston","Kelly, it's Eva. You can parse that out of the K. Let me just give you the specific number. I'm just getting to the right page. $16.7 million in the fourth quarter.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I might be able to calculate this, too, but I'm not positive. The -- as far as the growth rate, the pro forma growth rate for Argus, I think you just said a few questions back, Mark, it was more than 20%.","Mark V. Anquillare","That's correct for '12.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Are we able to get any more detail on that? I mean, was it -- can you give us the exact number? Or can we calculate it from what you've disclosed?","Mark V. Anquillare","I mean, I think it's a little bit above 20%. I think what we did -- said at the time of the acquisition, that we kind of saw mid-teens growth in the future. We still feel good about that.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So when you say above 20%, it's close to 20%. It's not like above 20%, could be 40% or anything like that?","Mark V. Anquillare","I think that's right, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suzanne Stein from Morgan Stanley.","Unknown Analyst","This is Brian [ph] in for Suzi. Do you have any sort of government exposure? And is sequestration at all an issue here?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes, not very much at all. Very, very de minimis. And the effect would be just negligible on the P&L, if it did occur, I mean, we -- mostly through our weather-related analytics, we do a fair amount of work on Earth-orbiting satellites, et cetera. Apparently, these are more considered to be critical programs. But the real point is just the absolute amount of business we do there is so small that it just won't have much of an effect.","Unknown Analyst","Got it. And just from an pipeline -- from an acquisition pipeline standpoint, can you comment generally on any sort of plans for increased activity in healthcare or any other verticals that you may be kind of focusing on?","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, we remain very active in the marketplace overall. Our team is constantly proactively engaging with companies that potentially fit with our strategy. Absolutely no difference in approach from where we've been for years and years and years now. Just a general point I would make is that as we have diversified our business, as we've moved into new market segments, et cetera, we've just given ourselves a broader playing field. And we're just going to continue to pursue it. You've seen a fair amount of M&A activity in the healthcare space from us. And there's certainly no reason to expect that, that would change. But we're -- we've got our headlights out there against the whole business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with SIG.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","It's such an exciting time for the company, Frank and Scott. I wanted to follow up on some of your preliminary comments about the N+1 initiative that you made at the outset. Just I know you're going to go into this in more detail next week, but if you could just share with us in a minute or so, what specific end markets you envision addressing with those initiatives.","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, we've talked a lot about the fact that we feel the need to be very deep in whatever vertical markets we're serving because it is really, really important that we be intimate with our customers. In fact, we can't even -- N+1, as it relates to our data sets, is interpreted in several ways. It means that we're one layer further than our competitors. It means that we're one layer further than any one customer. It means that we're one layer further than the data assets that we've got today in terms of what we're building towards in the future. So it's a lot of -- it has a lot of different dimensions to it like that. Unless we are intimate with our customers, we don't actually know what N is, so we don't know that we're at the N+1 level. And so that's just by way of saying that we are in 4 domains right now, as you know: the P&C market, the healthcare market, supply chain and financial services. And we'll talk about this more at Investor Day. But we've got plenty of distance to run inside of those marketplaces. And we would not claim that we've achieved the very greatest amount of intimacy that we can with all of our customers. That's good work that we're still engaged in. So that's all by way of saying that while we're always asking questions about the shape of the business and where are we in terms of the markets that we serve, we have a great deal of focus on going further inside of the segments that we already serve. And I think you can expect to continue to see that from us.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Thank you for that context. And then I have some pension-related question maybe for Mark or Eva. With regards to the pension, just so I understand, that -- the freeze is on current. Or is it current or new employees where the pension -- the movement in the pension is accruing?","Mark V. Anquillare","So just to give you a feel. We've gone through a couple reiteration [ph] of freezes. But back in March, that was put in place across the entire Verisk enterprise. So there's nobody accruing any additional benefit related to pension. Obviously, what anybody earned in the past is obviously theirs, but there's no more benefit accruing.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. So should we expect significant movement in 2013 as we had in 2012?","Mark V. Anquillare","So no, what happens is we receive the benefit and what we would expect now is it would be generally flat going forward, as long as discount rates and market results or how the assets are invested don't change materially. So we would expect a flatness to that cost, which is negligible these days.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Mark, just a quick follow-up. On that lower tax rate for '13, is that something that's sustainable going forward? Or should we expect the tax rate to kind of move back up again?","Mark V. Anquillare","No. We feel that, that is a sustainable rate in light of these tax planning strategies we've taken on.","Operator","And this concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll turn the call back over to Frank Coyne.","Frank J. Coyne","Yes. Thank you. And thanks to all for joining us today for our fourth quarter results.

This will be my last earnings call as I transition to solely a board role effective April 1.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Lee Shavel. Mr. Shavel, you may go ahead.","Lee Shavel","Thank you, Heidi, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our fourth quarter 2017 financial results. With me on this call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and myself highlighting some key points about our financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. ","Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. All discussions of EBITDA reflect adjusted EBITDA, for which you can find a reconciliation in our press release. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-K, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. ","A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect the future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. ","Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott Stephenson","Thank you, and good morning. It's a real pleasure to welcome Lee to his first earnings call as Verisk's new CFO. Lee's experience and insight from his time as NASDAQ CFO are already contributing to developments at Verisk. One of the first jobs he and I agreed on was for him to do a listening tour of some of our major institutional shareholders to hear your candid feedback about your likes and dislikes for owning Verisk is concerned. This has been the healthy exercise we expected, and we believe your feedback will be expressed in our evolving policies and communication practices in the coming quarters. Lee has already been able to complete an annual budget cycle with us, and so he has quickly become grounded in the rudiments of our business. ","As we described in our recent Investor Day, Verisk advances by achieving strong levels of organic revenue growth, and the primary driver of high-quality organic revenue is the sale of multiyear subscriptions. A multiyear subscription is the best demonstration that our solutions have moved from nice to have to must-have. Over the last 90 days, there have been several encouraging developments, to name three, First, Argus acquired a large multiyear subscription agreement along with the associated data rights with the only major credit card issuer in the English-speaking world that was not a customer. Second, WoodMac saw good progress in the number and value of subscription agreement signed. And third, in the insurance vertical, against a backdrop of many contract signings, we had 3 companies choose to focus exclusively on our catastrophe models and saw 2 other companies make an exclusive commitment to our Geomni program of imagery capture and analysis. But perhaps most important of all, we have the chance to see the value of our industry standard solutions tested in the context of the merger of 2 carriers and are very pleased with the degree to which our value and subscription price points stood the test as we finalized that new agreement. ","Subscriptions, of course, can cut both ways. When they are lost, it takes even more sales success to compensate and grow. In 2017, we had such conditions at work at Argus, where 2 government and 1 legacy subscription agreement rolled off with a reduction of about $11 million in annual revenue. As we assess our business into 2018, we observed the following across our several thousand customers, we see no material risk at this time of a lost customer relationship in the insurance and financial services verticals. And in energy, two accounts that produced subscription revenue in '17 will be combined into one as a result of a merger with relatively immaterial impacts. The substantial majority of our customer relationships are showing year-over-year increases in revenue related primarily to the adoption of more of our product suite. We are aware of only two accounts, one in financial services and one in energy, where we expect year-over-year revenues to be down materially in 2018.","In the financial services example, this is due to the phenomenon we have previously described, where first year revenue spike due to implementation, thereafter followed by a steady but lower level of high-quality subscription revenue. In the case of energy, the customer no longer exists due to merger. ","Our industry-standard solutions will show growth in 2018, but at a slightly lower rate than in '17. Because of general softness in the insurance environment and to preserve our cross-sell opportunities, we deliberately moderated growth for '18 to a modest degree. However, we see hardening in the market, and we expect that in '19 we will be at or above the growth rate of '17. ","WoodMac growth continues to move to the positive. In '18, the growth will primarily relate to cross-selling and expansion of exciting product sets, including subsurface analytics, renewable energy sources and chemicals. We are still minimizing price increases in '18 in support of cross-selling opportunities, but expect the '19 and beyond to make more use of pricing in our overall growth mix. ","One of the best leading indicators of our organic revenue growth is the number and quality of meetings we had with senior decision makers at our customers, in which we explore new opportunities for value creation. In that context, it is encouraging that in the last 90 days, we, on 3 occasions, had company CEOs asked to bring themselves and their senior teams to our offices to observe Verisk's InsureTech and jointly develop new or bespoke solutions. ","Another leading indicator that has meaning for me is our success in winning business with the newer entrants into the markets we serve. For example, the world is alive with interest in the InsureTech space. Of the 8 leading InsureTech firms founded in '16 and '17 that operate as risk-bearing or risk-managing entities, 6 of them are currently customers of Verisk. I take that as evidence of the freshness of our value proposition. ","We're busy at work integrating the companies we acquired in 2017. The work of integration have 3 different flavors at this moment, first, we acquired seven regional image capture companies with the intent to merge them into one integrated national entity. Success in this endeavor is really entirely a function of integration since this is core to the value proposition. I'm pleased with our progress here. At the end of last year, with all the extreme weather events, the flexibility and integration of our operations was tested. And I was pleased to see that the quality and responsiveness of our image capture, which is driven by the integration of our platform, permitted us to image Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria with such speed and precision that we unlocked business with mortgage lenders who were not previously customers.","At the other end of the spectrum, PowerAdvocate and Sequel are relatively mature organizations, where, in addition to financial and HR integration, the primary work is to link their platforms to those elsewhere in Verisk. Specifically, PowerAdvocate to WoodMac oil and gas analytics and Sequel to AIR's Touchstone modeling platform. Teams are well underway on this work. In fact, we've recently signed a major contract with one of the world's largest national oil companies, which involves deliverables on the part of both PowerAdvocate and WoodMac. Both teams report this sale would not have happened had the 2 companies not come together. ","The third category is a series of smaller product organizations, most of them in insurance, where the immediate work is to harness the Verisk distribution channel to increase sales. We are well underway with this work. ","At our recent Investor Day, I described the 5 qualities that make our company a moated business, which can produce strong organic revenue growth on a sustained basis, those being, one, vertical market expertise; two, unique datasets, ideally contributed by our customers; three, deep integration with customer workflows; four, global reach leading to an expanding customer account; and five, synergies arising from the sharing of methods and capabilities across our enterprise. I see progress on all fronts. And over the last 90 days, I'm particularly struck by our growing effectiveness in overseas markets, particularly the U.K. As a result, our organic revenue growth in the quarter was 7.6%, consistent with our longer-term goals. Our rate of organic EBITDA growth in the quarter was about 5%, lower than revenue growth and a function, particularly, of the significant investment we made in Geomni as we continue to ramp up that operation. In 2018, I expect that relationship to be reversed, meaning enterprise organic EBITDA growth greater than organic revenue growth. ","I'd like to comment on the corporate tax reform that was enacted at the end of 2017. Lee will take you through the specific implications for Verisk as regards our tax rate and the after-tax cash flow and accounting implications. From a strategic perspective, we are treating this as an opportunity to reinvest in our people. And so we have taken the decision to double our training budgets in most categories and to materially increase our contributions to long-term wealth for our people in the form of greater 401(k) matching and expanded employee stock purchase programs. We have built all of these investments into our 2018 budget and still expect a strong bottom line this year. After the additional free cash, we intend to be disciplined with our investor's money, looking for the highest-return investment opportunities and looking favorably on opportunities to return capital to shareholders. ","With that, I'll hand it over to Mark for some comments on the insurance business.","Mark Anquillare","Thank you, Scott. In our insurance business, we had another strong quarter, with all insurance-facing businesses, industry standard programs, catastrophe modeling, repair cost estimating, planes analytics and remote imagery contributing to the growth. ","Let me highlight a few areas that drove top line growth and update you on several initiatives to aggregate new sources of data to better position us for growth in the future. Our claims businesses, repair cost estimating and claims analytics experienced a nice uptick in growth in the second half of 2017. We have been successful expanding our insurance fraud prevention business, claims analytics, by broadening our use cases, aggregating additional information, licensing our antifraud analytic tools and extending beyond our traditional insurance customers to entities such as self-insured companies and third-party administrators. In most cases, these opportunities take the form of multiyear contracts, but in some instances, start as a paid proof of concept. We're optimistic about these extensions of our business. ","We've also experienced a surge in opportunities in our workers' compensation solutions business, bringing on several major new accounts during 2017. Over the past couple of years, we've invested to provide increased automation and enhanced [indiscernible] to our customers. This investment has proven successful as we implement new customers and attract a growing sales pipeline. ","During the fourth quarter, Geomni, our business that harnesses remote sensing and machine learning technologies to provide information about residential and commercial structures, deployed one of its regional hubs to proactively capture aerial imagery in response to the Southern California fires. Imagery collected helps document the areas affected, provide operational efficiencies and accelerate the damage estimation and restoration process for homes and commercial buildings, helping insurers protect people and property. As Scott mentioned in his earlier comments, we have made significant progress at Geomni, signing new customers, advancing the analytics and building geographic coverage. ","We were thrilled to sign an exclusive agreement with Honda to join the Verisk Data Exchange in the quarter. Honda will provide Verisk with driving data from consenting owners of Honda's connected cars. Honda customers can access the Verisk Driving Score, a simple metric that rates the driving behavior. Insurers can use the data from the Verisk Data Exchange with their usage-based insurance programs, typically designed to reward safe drivers or use Verisk driver behavior scores that are filed and approved for use today in 43 states. With the addition of Honda, the total market share of automakers participating in the Verisk Data Exchange increased to 27% of vehicles sold in the United States. The exchange now has close to 3 million cars, with 30 billion miles of driving data. And it's growing at more than 150,000 vehicles each month. This telematics information is a key component of our broader mission to aggregate remote sensing information and find insights to help our customers. This remote sensing data includes information from mobile devices, connected homes, connected buildings. For example, with connected homes, our research using IoT data has shown opportunities for Lyft or improved underwriting results for our customers writing homeowners' insurance. ","International expansion is an important part of our long-term growth plan. AIR continues to lead our international expansion efforts as PICC Reinsurance Company Limited, a leading Chinese reinsurance company, has collaborated with AIR to better assess and manage its growing portfolio of catastrophe risk reinsurance business. Another positive on the international front was our introduction of a new inland flood model for Japan, along with enhancements to our Japan typhoon model. The integration of our new international acquisitions has progressed smoothly. The newly acquired businesses have gained immediate benefit by leveraging Verisk's technology infrastructure and cloud capabilities.","Specific to Sequel, we work conjointly with clients to enable seamless data transfer from Sequel's business intelligence tools to AIR's Touchstone Solutions. In the longer term, our goal is to integrate Sequel's front-end exposure management and visualization platform with ISO's underwriting information and portfolio assessment and modeling features of AIR. This modular approach will allow product cross-sell with Sequel customers as well as existing Verisk customers. Our integration efforts at Sequel are also working in 2 directions, as evidenced by an opportunity for our claims analytics business to leverage some existing Sequel software to serve our U.S. claims analytics customers. ","All in all, both qualitatively and quantitatively, we are pleased with the performance of the insurance business. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Mark. Let me start by saying what an honor it is for me to be here and to have the opportunity to serve this great company and its shareholders and work with Scott and his management team. As Scott mentioned, I've had the opportunity in the past 2 months to meet or speak directly with 18 of our top 25 active investors, representing 50% of the active voting interest of our shareholders. We spoke about a wide variety of topics, and I've received many thoughtful perspectives, but 2 areas came up consistently, one, a desire to better understand our capital management discipline; and two, improve transparency and communication of our financial and operating performance. In both areas, I'm confident that we'll demonstrate improvements in 2018. And to that end, we'll be implementing a quarterly earnings presentation for the first quarter of 2018 that will provide a consistent structure for reviewing the company's performance across our business lines, and we are considering other enhancements based on the feedback I've received. ","Moving to the financial results for the quarter. I'd like to start by focusing at a high level on the two key financial metrics that we discussed at Investor Day, organic revenue growth and organic EBITDA growth. Verisk demonstrated very solid growth performance and momentum in the fourth quarter. Organic revenue growth of 7.6%, 7.4% on a constant-currency basis, was consistent with our long-term guidance and was an increase in the comparable third quarter 2017 year-over-year growth of 6.5% or 7% on a constant-currency basis. Average quarterly organic growth on a constant-currency basis in the second half of 2017 of 7.2% compared to 3.3% for the first half, substantiating the expectation we had of acceleration in the second half. ","I would note total acquired revenue in the quarter from all deals that haven't moved into organic was $26 million and revenue from the 3 August acquisitions, G2, Sequel and LCI, contributed $16 million in the quarter, with combined margins of around 36%, as expected. ","For the full year, Verisk delivered organic revenue growth of 4.5% and 5.3% on a constant-currency basis, below our targeted level as the result of industry headwinds at WoodMac and the contract expirations at Argus that reduced revenues from 2016, particularly in the first half. ","A quick side note on revenue accounting and as required, the company will be adopting the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, in the first quarter of 2018. We expect the impact to be immaterial to our financial results. ","So breaking down the organic revenue growth. As you will see in Table 2 in the press release, Decision Analytics and, particularly, Decision Analytics insurance was the primary contributor to this organic growth at 12.9%, with strong growth in repair cost estimating and claims analytics solutions, with good growth in underwriting solutions also. The positive financial impact of severe weather on our business in the third quarter spilled over into the fourth quarter and contributed about $8 million in repair cost estimating and imagery-based solution revenue. Even excluding this revenue, organic insurance revenue growth was 8.2%. ","Decision Analytics energy demonstrated an improvement to 5.2% organic growth in the fourth quarter, up from 0.2% in the third quarter. Given the currency impact for energy, principally WoodMac, I would note that, on a constant-currency basis, energy revenue growth was 4.7% and has increased for each of the prior 3 quarters. We are pleased to see the trends in our subscription business continuing to be positive, complemented by good consulting revenue number, which is typically a leading market indicator. ","At Decision Analytics financial services, they delivered growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter, which represented a reversal from the prior 3 quarters of year-over-year decreases as a result of contract expirations. Organic growth was driven by strength in analytical data warehousing products, share of wallet model algorithms and media effectiveness solutions. We continue to win significant new business with clients, as Scott described, in media effectiveness, analytical solutions, competitive benchmarking, decisioning algorithms and regulatory solutions. G2 and LCI continue to integrate well, with joint product roadshows underway, which have been well received by clients. Fintellix has also contributed by driving new products in the insurance sector. We believe that financial services demonstrated clear progress in the fourth quarter, and we remain confident that it will contribute to organic growth in 2018. ","Risk Assessment generated 5.3% year-over-year growth for the period, also up from 4.9% in the third quarter and having steadily increased over each of the 4 quarters in 2017. Organic growth was driven by the annual effective growth in 2017 invoices as well as new solutions in industry-standard insurance programs and an increase in underwriting solutions subscription revenue. ","Organic EBITDA growth was 4.9% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis compared to organic revenue growth of 7.6% and reflected organic cost of revenue and SG&A expense growth of 9.7% as the result of continued investment in several internal opportunities, including Geomni most notably. For the year, EBITDA growth was 4% over 2016 compared to organic revenue growth of 4.5% as the result of 5.2% full year growth in the cost of revenue and SG&A, also reflecting continued internal investment in several growth opportunities and organic revenue growth below targets at Argus and WoodMac relative to expense growth. ","Excluding the impact of expense related to internal investment initiatives, organic EBITDA grew at a higher rate than the organic revenue growth in 2017. ","Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations margin was 49% for 2017, down slightly from 50% in 2016, primarily of -- as the result of the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, EBITDA margin was essentially unchanged. ","Depreciation and amortization was $64 million in the quarter, up 25 -- I'm sorry, up 28% from the prior year quarter and $237 million for 2017, up 12% from 2016, reflecting the impact of acquisitions and increased capital expenditures in both periods. We expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $150 million to $160 million and amortization of intangible assets of about $130 million in 2018. ","Interest expense was $32 million in the quarter, up 13% from the prior year quarter, and $119 million for 2017, down 1% from 2016. ","Total debt was $3 billion at December 31, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.7x, and we expect to bring our leverage back to our reference level of 2.5x over time. Our cash and cash equivalents were about $142 million at the end of 2017. ","Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was a negative 14.1% and a positive 19.7% for the full year of 2017. These effective rates reflect an $89 million benefit from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities resulting from recently enacted tax legislation. We estimate our effective tax rate in 2018 to be between 21% and 23%. ","Diluted adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $1.34 for the fourth quarter, up from $0.80 in the prior year quarter and $3.74 for 2017, up from $3.11 in 2016. The increase in both periods primarily reflects, naturally, the impact of 2017 tax reform. Excluding the tax reform benefit of $0.53 per share in the fourth quarter, diluted adjusted EPS was $0.81 for the quarter, up 1% from the prior year, and $3.21 for 2017, up 3% from 2016. The average diluted share count was 168.3 million shares for the quarter, and our diluted share count at the end of 2017 was 168.7 million shares. ","Moving to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $744 million for 2017, up 34% from $556 million in 2016. Capital expenditures from continuing operations were $184 million in 2017, up 26% from $146 million in 2016, reflecting primarily increased investment in Geomni. We anticipate capital expenditures to be between $220 million and $230 million in 2018, including the continued investments in our aerial imagery solutions at Geomni that will peak in 2018. Subsequently, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenues to steadily decline. ","Free cash flow was $560 million for 2017, an increase of 9.8% after excluding $100 million of taxes paid related to the sale of the health care business in 2016. We repurchased 3.4 million shares in 2017 for a total return of capital to shareholders of $270 million at a weighted average price of $80.39. At December 31, 2017, we had $366 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, and we expect to continue share repurchases in 2018. ","So in summary, the results for 2017 reflected some growth challenges in the first part of the year at Wood Mackenzie, resulting from the cyclical decline in the energy sector along with FX headwinds and from certain contract expirations at Argus. Both businesses demonstrated revenue progress in the second half, with strong performance in our insurance business, helped in part by revenue generated by an exceptional level of severe weather in the third quarter. We returned to our targeted organic revenue growth in the second half of 2017. We remain confident in our long-term organic growth targets, particularly if growth continues to improve at both WoodMac and Argus as we saw in the second half. We are pleased with our 2018 plan. We're excited about the opportunities to invest, looking to drive long-term profitable growth. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investments for the long term. ","We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh","Can I ask about the comment, first, related to industry standard programs? I guess, one, just elaborate on why, I guess, take a little bit more cautious approach to, it sounded like, pricing, essentially. Because I think in the past you've talked about kind of the -- your pricing capability being somewhat separate from the kind of the environment for the insurance industry. So maybe just elaborate on what drove that. And anything about how significant that might be in terms of the [indiscernible] program?","Scott Stephenson","Thank you, Tim. Let me start with the end. It's not a particularly significant effect, but of course, folks will be watching our year-over-year progression as we go through 2018. So we have visibility into this, so we just wanted to note it. It's not a very material effect. We're talking about basis points. And the reason that we did it was that we've just in the round have accounted for where our insurance customers were as they exited '17, there -- the state of their own businesses. And the most important thing in the growth of our insurance business by far, and I hope that's evident to everybody, is the cross-selling of our total suite of solutions. And so, essentially, we made a decision about where we're going to take our gains in 2018. And at the margin, we're leaning a little bit more towards the other parts of the suite facing our insurance customers. So we just wanted to note it for you. It's not a big effect at all. We wanted to call it out just because it's a line item that we report, but it's not highly material.","Timothy McHugh","Okay. And just to be clear, that's driven by -- just that you were talking about industry standard, not the broader insurance kind of including Decision Analytics and so forth?","Scott Stephenson","That's correct. I was only talking about our industry standard line item within the overall insurance suite. The -- we feel very good about the overall insurance business.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird.","Jeffrey Meuler","So just on the comment about organic EBITDA margins expanding in 2018, I guess, just two related questions. So is that before the reinvestment of some of the tax savings? And if so, can you just help size up roughly the magnitude of the reinvestment? And then can you also just give us any sense of the acquisition effect on 2018 margins? There's a lot of moving pieces with acquired\/deferred revenue headwinds and some prior acquisitions being anniversaried in that regard in 2017 transaction expenses. So I guess the first question is, on the organic revenue -- or organic margin outlook, does it include the reinvestment? And then if you can help us size up those two pieces, please.","Scott Stephenson","Right, thanks, Jeff. I'll start, then I'll bump it over to Lee. So with respect to the statement about the projection of organic EBITDA exceeding that of organic revenue, that is before any tax effects whatsoever. So that is net of all the investing that we're doing in the business in total. And so hopefully, that's responsive to your question. With respect to some of the detail underneath, Lee, do you want to add anything to all that?","Lee Shavel","Yes. Jeff, so I think part of the question is prior to the reinvestment of the tax benefits. And so I think our expectation for the organic EBITDA growth reflects kind of the core business as we are looking at the investment in the growth initiatives. We expect that, that will contribute to margin expansion over time as we reach the fruition on those investments. But as I indicated in my comments, when you exclude those investments, we saw, in 2017, actually an expansion of organic EBITDA margin. And that's where we're really focused currently is, one, what does the -- how is the core performance? How is the core business performing? Secondly, how are the investments performing? And then with regard to acquisitions, what we had provided is the impact of acquisitions in the fourth quarter. It's difficult to predict the overall impact of the acquisitions on the margin over time.","We'd like to focus on that organic EBITDA margin because that's really what we're managing to. Naturally, as we make acquisitions, as you've seen from some of the disclosures, at their level of EBITDA margin, initially, that will have a dilutive impact, but what we're really focused on is that year-over-year improvement that we will see once those businesses come into the organic fold. So hopefully, that gives you some color on the organic EBITDA margin question.","Jeffrey Meuler","That's helpful. And then on the Argus -- or financial services organic outlook, I think there was a moment at the Investor Day where there's a question about should 2018 be an outsized growth year. And I think, Scott, you said it was your expectation, that Nana was nodding his head yes. And then there was a comment today about, I think, a grow-over effect from the onetime revenue in '17 as in -- a large new client comes online. So is the expectation, even including that 2018 Argus, has an outsized organic growth year?","Scott Stephenson","Yes, it is.","Operator","Yes, your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","The first question, just broadly on, I guess, organic revenue growth in '18. Scott, you answered a lot of, I guess, moving pieces and comments. And I think, in insurance, you said 2019 would be bigger than '17. I was wondering if I heard that correctly. Just in the context, Lee, you also walked through -- obviously, second half in line with the long-term organic growth, a range that you'd set out. So I guess, just trying to put those all moving pieces you laid out in front of the call, how should we think of '18 exactly?","Scott Stephenson","Right. So again, this was Tim's question as well. My comment about moderating price increases related only to one part of what we do insurance, and that's industry-standard insurance programs. And I called it out only because it's a line item that we report separately. So you get to see it. It's a relatively immaterial impact. So hopefully, everybody is clear on that. With respect to the sum of everything that we do in insurance, which is both that as well as all the things that we do in DA insurance, we see '18 as a very positive year. And so the only thing you should add to that, with respect to my '19 comment, is there will be even a little more wind in our sails in '19 with respect to the industry standard insurance programs because of the hardening that is taking place in the premium environment in insurance. So we see '18 as a good extension of what you saw in the latter half of '17. And in '19, there's one macro factor that will actually be positive as we go forward from '18.","Lee Shavel","So Manav, just to address some of the comments that I was making, first, the targets that we have set out of 7% to 8% organic revenue growth and the EBITDA expansion beyond that, I think, if you look at the fourth quarter, I think the summary that we offered is that we've achieved those targets even though we continue to have progress to be made at both WoodMac and at Argus. And so that is something that we feel positive about the -- our ability to continue to deliver on those expectations in 2018. And clearly, there is continued upside for us factoring in all of the elements that we discussed.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. And then my second question is just more on these organic investments you are making and sort of the time of phasing in which we should expect some of the results. So obviously, Geomni sounds like you've already seen some of the fruition with the extreme weather activity. But when do we see telematics, connected home, all these other things you talk about, start giving you that return you're expecting?","Scott Stephenson","Right. So let me start here. And Mark, if you care to add anything. Because -- and something that I'd like to just highlight here is that Geomni and telematics both represent a very important theme inside of our business, and that is new types of data that can be pulled in for new forms of decisioning. And one of the things I want to say from the outset is that both of those data types have application in the insurance vertical. They also have application outside of the insurance vertical. So as you think about how we're going to monetize the investments that we're making, I believe what you'll see is -- I believe what we will see is that they will first express themselves mostly in the insurance vertical, but then as we go forward, they will both expand inside of that vertical, but also find ways to grow in other marketplaces. So that's kind of the general story here. So now back to your question then.","Yes, we're seeing the fruits of the Geomni investments write down very exciting developments. And so that's really very realtime. We're encouraged by what we see on the IoT front, but it's going to be more of a progressive build in terms of the absolute amount of revenue dollars which are generated by IoT. There are reasons for that, I'll highlight one, Mark, maybe, you'd like to add some others. So we talked about the connected car movement. I feel very, very pleased with the leadership that we're showing in that category. We are the leader in that category. But the rate at the which connected cars grow as a percentage of the total population of cars in the United States, that is a longer-term trend. It will take a while for all of the automakers to essentially have turned over their existing fleets and for all cars to be natively connected. So that's kind of a long -- a big wave, but it's a slow wave or steady wave that is moving through the auto world.","The effect of IoT in the home, in some ways, may be a little bit faster, but in some ways a little bit slower because of the value associated with the signal that you take off of a car is, in some ways, may be greater than the value of the signal that you take off of a washing machine or a toaster. And so I think IoT -- we are seeing IoT today. It's building, but I think it's kind of a long -- it will be a longer-term sort of a build. Anything you want to add to that, Mark?","Mark Anquillare","I think it's well said. I mean, I think the vision is that the rating paradigm will shift as to how automobiles and more importantly people are underwritten in the premiums determined. And we hope to have all that information for every vehicle and every person. At the same time, today, it's a little bit about claims, and so it's a little bit about bespoke modeling to help insurers kind of perfect their own internal behavioral scores.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital.","Hamzah Mazari","My first question is just broadly on pricing. I know you mentioned the insurance piece, and it's not significant. But you also mentioned minimizing price increases on cross-selling in WoodMac with some potential in 2019 on pricing. So just broadly speaking, do you guys view pricing as an underappreciated lever for the business as we look long term? Or is it just you have very high market share and pricing is not a huge lever here because of cross-sell?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. So let me state this in two ways. Pricing is a part of the progression of our revenue every year, including in 2018. I noted the relative degree to which we're making use of the price mechanism in 2018 in one part of what we do in insurance and in energy. But even in that part of insurance and in energy, our pricing is up year-over-year. So please be sure to note that. And then all I would add to that is, in 2019, I believe that there will be, relative to 2018, yet more opportunity where price is concerned for the reasons that I stated. The insurance environment generally hardening on the one hand and Wood Mackenzie's customers continuing to cycle to evermore strength as the commodity cycle has improved. So '18, there is a price effect. It's relatively in line with what was there in '17. I noted the differences. And in '19, I believe the price effect will be even stronger than it was in '18 -- it will be in '18.","Hamzah Mazari","Very helpful. And just a follow-up question, maybe for Lee on tax reform. Could you remind us -- I know you gave the book tax rate, 21% to 23%. Could you remind us what the cash tax savings impact is in 2018 from tax reform? And in relation to that, you guys are going through a heavy CapEx cycle and that comes down in 2020 or 2022, I guess. Do you pull forward CapEx because of tax reform rules? Just give us a little more detail on tax reform.","Lee Shavel","Sure. Thank you, Hamzah. So the answer to your question on the tax rate, so we would anticipate that the drop in our U.S. tax rate resulting from tax reform will generate approximately an incremental $90 million of additional cash flow in 2018. And with regard to whether that has any impact on our CapEx timing, I think the answer is no, that we view each of those projects as pursuing their natural life and our expectations of investing in them from a business standpoint. So no anticipated change on that front.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","You had indicated your overall insurance growth in 2018 should run at a similar pace as the second half of 2017 organically. Given some of the strength in the second half of '17 came from weather-related catastrophe modeling, is the expectation that you'll see incremental strengthening from other areas within insurance?","Scott Stephenson","Yes, that's right. And Mark, I don't know if you want to expand on that.","Mark Anquillare","I think we feel pretty good across all of our businesses. Clearly, we did benefit from the severe weather. It's tough to predict severe weather in the future, so I note your point. But I think we feel like both contract signings, which were strong at the end of 2017. And most of our businesses are deeply engaged with customers and that ultimately pays benefit.","Scott Stephenson","You'll remember that Mark started his comments commenting on the claims side of our business. So for example, there's a lot that is in that, that actually is not related to severe weather impacts. And so as we look at the portfolio of solutions across everything we do in insurance, yes, we do see broad performance on to the rate of organic revenue growth and insurance that you've seen in the second half of '17.","George Tong","Got it. Very helpful. And then secondly, you've obviously made a number of acquisitions in 2017. Can you elaborate on your overall progress in integrating these acquisitions, particularly as it relates to realizing synergies? And when you might expect these acquisitions to be margin-neutral to the company?","Scott Stephenson","Yes, so you're actually asking -- yes. And you're asking two very different questions. So one of them is the integrations are well in hand. You'll remember I commented on sort of the three different categories. So there's the category of integration as it relates to image capture, where we needed to create a national capability out of a set of regional businesses. That is substantially achieved. And I was earlier recounting some of the success we had in the fourth quarter of 2017 in using that capability where it was really put to the test because we had -- third and fourth quarter, where we had to move -- we had to keep our feet moving really quickly to keep up with events.","And so I think we've demonstrated that, that integration has really been achieved. At this point, the margin progression of what we do at Geomni is a function of just growing the business. It is -- it's not entirely a fixed-cost business, but substantially a fixed-cost business. So as we grow it, the margins will naturally ripen. The other question that you were asking was about the likely intermediate and longer-term progression of margins at the acquired businesses. With the more mature businesses, for example, Sequel and PowerAdvocate that we talked about before, their margin profiles are already good. They're not at the level of the rest of Verisk, but we would expect, as they grow, they will tend to move in that direction. And then there's a handful of smaller acquisitions that were more in the nature of product organizations, and we don't necessarily hold those to the test that their margins have to reach the absolute level of the rest of what we do across Verisk. But incrementally, the growth in the EBITDAs will be positive.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William Warmington","So a question for you on underwriters and automation. There are a number of tech start-ups looking to accelerate automation in underwriting. They have some catchy names, like Pie Insurance and Lemonade. And how does Verisk interact with these start-ups? Do they collaborate, compete, wait and see?","Lee Shavel","So I'm happy to start there. I think, first of all, you should understand with a lot of these start-ups, from an InsureTech's perspective, there's two types, right. There's some that are risk-bearing entities. And I will tell you, in many cases, as Scott highlighted, they are customers. There's a couple instances where the amount they spend on us was actually more than they actually wrote in premiums. So those are good relationships, and they're very dependent upon us as they want to become very analytic. I think your other question is really around the InsureTech world that is kind of very blossoming now. And we talk frequently, most of the ones that have started to get a little bit of lift or actually have a customer or two are usually at our door. And I think we are very well in tune with that environment and that world. The other thing I'd like to highlight, I think a lot of our customers, and I think we believe ourselves to be kind of, in many cases, the ultimate InsureTech.","We do a lot of this. We spend a lot of time on R&D. We have a lot of cutting-edge analytic methods, some in search of application, some with ideas around application, and we share that with customers. And I think that thought leadership is something that is well respected.","William Warmington","So for my second question, congratulations on the Honda win. You have 27% share. I guess, my question is, when do you hit the tipping point for more accelerated adoption?","Lee Shavel","So I'll do that again. Let me try to highlight. I think we have, for the most part, most insurers now focusing on us as a source of that information. What we need to do, and the industry is going to transition over time, is that not all cars -- as a matter of fact, smaller fraction of cars are connected today. So the way we get information about the car and the vehicle and the driving behavior is a combination of the connected car, which I think is going to be very relevant over the next 5 to 10 years, but also through devices. Your phone has a lot of pertinent information. You opt in. This is all obviously opt-in type of service. And with that information, today, insurers are looking to fine-tune and build models to underwrite. But ultimately, I believe that every pricing decision will tap a database of some form, I hope it to be ours, to understand what that driving behavior was over the past 6 months, and rates and pricing and premiums will change. I think that's the way the rating paradigm will shift for insurance, and we think we're well positioned.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","I want to come back to the margin outlook because, quite frankly, I'm still a little bit confused with all the moving pieces. So, Lee, I guess, when you put it all together, the organic expansion, but also kind of the impact of investments and the acquisitions, I mean, where roughly should we be shaking out for the margins? I mean, it sounds like margins should be down overall a little bit. Is it really just a Decision Analytics story? Or is the Risk Assessment also margin decline? So any incremental comment you can give about the magnitude would be helpful.","Lee Shavel","Sure. Thanks, Alex. So the way I would summarize it, Alex, and building off of Scott's comments, is that we expect, in 2018, that, on an organic basis, our EBITDA margins should expand. And that is a combination of kind of the total organic business, meaning the core business and the growth initiatives at Geomni and the chemicals and the subsurface at WoodMac and the others that we've described. And so the function of continuing to target the 7% to 8% organic revenue growth and continued improvement in WoodMac and Argus, we believe, will enable us to achieve that EBITDA growth in excess of overall revenue growth. ","As it relates to the acquisition impact, obviously, that's a variable that is more difficult to anticipate, and the overall net effect will end up being a balancing of what we can achieve from an organic standpoint in terms of margin expansion, offset to some extent by the impact of the acquisitions that are coming on. And so we are trying to give more focus around that organic EBITDA margin, so that you can see meaningfully the progression that we're making in the core business. And then over time, what I would emphasize is that all of the acquisitions that we look at, similar to our business, have great operating leverage. And so that we expect that they will contribute to overall EBITDA growth in those businesses in excess of their organic revenue growth. So hopefully, that answers it. I know that probably what you're looking for is what is the net impact on the acquisitions to the whole, but that becomes that net impact between the 2. The important thing that we feel we want folks to focus on is that organic EBITDA margin, which we feel confident, will expand in 2018.","Scott Stephenson","Right. And maybe just to add to that, I write upfront and then Lee also emphasized that we have benefited from the listening tour that Lee has engaged with our investors. And one of the messages that was very clear was that our investors, in general, would like to hear us talk with increased emphasis about organic results, organic revenue growth and organic EBITDA progression. And so you're going to hear that more as a part of our presentation. But we're very excited about the acquisitions also, which are contributing in 2018 to the overall top and bottom line of the company. And we're excited about the contributions they'll make this year and the contributions they'll make in the future. But you're hearing an emphasis on organic because that's what our investors have told us they like us to have.","Lee Shavel","And let me add one thing just to allay any concerns. It's not because we don't want to be focused on the financial returns or the acquisitions in -- as I've talked about with a lot of investors, the focus there has to be, \"Are we generating good returns on capital for that component of the business?\" Clearly, it has a financial impact overall, but I want to make certain that we build on the disclosure that we provided at Investor Day around the performance of those entities from a capital standpoint in addition to the financial performance. And so I think that will be something that you'll see in 2018, where we'll be working to enhance disclosure around those components. So just wanted to add that point.","Alex Kramm","All right. Looking forward to more disclosures then, I guess. And then secondly, maybe just shifting to WoodMac for a second. I think you gave some commentary at the beginning, Scott, but I think the fourth quarter -- and I think you highlighted it at Investor Day, again, was kind of like the last renewal cycle post kind of cyclical challenges in the energy market. So I think you said it was good renewals. But can you maybe just add a little bit more color if the worse is now behind us, how that last renewal went? And then looking forward, it tells to me like 2018 is still going to be a transition year, but 2019, maybe, we'll get to the point where this can be the fastest-growing business? Or do how you feel about WoodMac, generally speaking?","Scott Stephenson","Yes, thank you. And you got me substantially correctly in terms of the message at Investor Day. Let me tune it for you just a little bit. So there are -- it's typically the case with WoodMac that there are a lot of renewals in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So the quarter we just went through and the quarter we're going through right now always carry a fair amount of meaning in terms of the progression of the subscriptions year-over-year. So you've heard the report about the fourth quarter, which was a positive quarter overall. And we're in the middle of the first quarter, which feels, I would say, substantially the same. There are some larger customers whose renewals are being negotiated right now.","So we're moving through that. But you got me substantially correct from Investor Day in terms of as we round out 2017 and into 2018. And I want to emphasize that there are a lot of positive signals at Wood Mackenzie. Lee referenced one that we watch a lot, which is the progression of consulting revenues, which tend to be a leading indicator of our customers' appetite for everything that we can do. And then yes, you also heard me. I think that '19 will be even more removed from the effects of the commodity cycle that we saw in '14, '15, '16 and even into '17. '19 will just be just 1 more year removed from that. And therefore, I do believe that, in addition to all of the new product opportunities and the cross-sell opportunities, I believe that the price mechanism in '19 will be more available to us than it was certainly in the '15, '16, '17 time frame. And we're choosing to be thoughtful about how we use the price mechanism in '18 as well because we want to get these new products sold. We want to enhance the cross-sells.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","I wanted to know what percentage of Verisk insurance revenues are related to reinsurance clients? And how is that segment of insurance revenues doing?","Scott Stephenson","Mark, you want to take that one on?","Mark Anquillare","Yes. So first of all, I think what we did experience, and we highlighted a few times in 2017, the reinsurance premiums, it was a very soft market, meaning reinsurers were under pressure. It was difficult for our customers. What that led to was some industry consolidation against -- across a couple of those more major reinsurers. And when 2 become 1, especially on our cat modeling side of the world, that did lose -- it did cause us to lose some revenue as a result of those mergers. So I'm not sure I have an exact answer for you. I would say that in the ISO, or industry-standard programs, insurers, as well as reinsurers, use it, the reinsurer piece rather modest. So I wouldn't call that material at all. But inside of our cat modeling business, that probably represents a rather substantial minority of the revenue, and that's where we experienced a little of that headwind back in 2011.","Scott Stephenson","When you said -- can I just add, Mark? When you said it's less than 10% of everything we do across insurance.","Mark Anquillare","Across everything, absolutely. I was trying to be a little specific.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane","Sure. Just following up on some of the comments around WoodMac. I wondering if you could give us an update on the annual contract value trends that you saw in the fourth quarter.","Scott Stephenson","And thanks for the question, and that really was our comment before about the progression of the business overall. There is a cumulative effect of contract signings. As you know, WoodMac signs multi-year agreements, but you're seeing the progression in the annual contract values in the reported fourth quarter result, which, as Lee pointed out, is substantially greater than the effect -- the overall outcome for all of 2017. So it has got progression over the course of 2017, and that is because of the effect of the renewals that we're signing in '17. So it's been a positive trend.","David Ridley-Lane","And then at Investor Day, you mentioned, I believe, 8 multi-year agreements signed in the Financial Services segment. You, obviously, had another win -- a credit card win in the fourth quarter. Wondering if those contracts had started to yield revenue in the fourth quarter or if that is all to come in 2018.","Scott Stephenson","Mostly to come in '18.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani from KBW.","Arash Soleimani","Just first question is, when you look at improvements in the resolution of satellite imagery, to what extent could that challenge Geomni's aerial imagery offering?","Scott Stephenson","Right. We don't see any material risk of substitution at any intermediate period of time, and it's actually likely that it will never be a substitute. And the reason is that you are able to get a degree of precision in your image when you're imaging an object on the face of the earth from, say, 2,000 feet up as opposed to miles and miles up. Two of the major differences, one is geometric. So what you need to be able to do is to be able to observe three-dimensional structure in 3 dimensions. And to be able to do that, you have to image it both oblique -- orthogonally, but also obliquely. When you're miles and miles and miles away, it is very difficult to get an oblique view of anything. So that's the first point. And the second point has to deal with radiometry.","Basically, any signal that you capture, which is a function of looking through the atmosphere, is going to have different properties than if you're not looking through miles and miles and miles of the atmosphere. So now satellites do have one benefit and that is that potentially you can image the same spot on the face of the earth a couple of times a day potentially with satellites. Now it's not as easy as that because you have to actually -- you actually have to change the commands for the satellite to cause it to image something specific, if it wasn't otherwise going to do that, and that's not necessarily inexpensive, but you do have the potential benefit of frequency. So we think there is a role for satellites, in that they can sort of help you with comprehensive global kinds of general laying the foundation of a set of observations. But in terms of the precision that we need to give the answers that we're giving to our customers, we don't see satellites as a substitute.","Mark Anquillare","And maybe just a friendly addition, our solution set includes satellite, aerial, drone, and I'll call it, ground truth, your phones and other type of images. So we are comprehensive in solution.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. Great. And just quick numbers question. I know you mentioned the 21% to 23% tax rate. Should we still be using something slightly different for amortization?","Lee Shavel","I would recommend that you use the 21% for the amortization of intangibles.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","I want to ask the margin question again in a different way. So you mentioned doubling the training budgets and rewarding employees with the tax savings. That sounds to me like it rolls into OpEx, and so that would impact EBITDA. So just want to confirm that organic EBITDA includes these -- this extra spending.","Scott Stephenson","That is correct. It does include those -- these extra categories of spending.","Toni Kaplan","Okay. Great. And then I think, when you answered Hamzah's question earlier, the $90 million of savings, is that all going to be spent on this? Or are there other areas as well?","Scott Stephenson","I'm sorry. What was it?","Lee Shavel","Your question is whether the full $90 million is being spent on the educational opportunities?","Scott Stephenson","No. The way I would put it to you, Toni, is that the very vast majority of the tax benefit is available to our shareholders.","Toni Kaplan","In the form of buybacks?","Scott Stephenson","Well, we'll determine how we're going to deploy capital, but it is free cash flow that is available to invest on behalf of our shareholders, whether it's buybacks or M&A activity.","Lee Shavel","It will be deployed in the same process that we use for the capital we generate internally within the business, which is where do we see the best returns on -- returns for that capital across the range of internal investments, external investments and share repurchases.","Scott Stephenson","Let me try to summarize. I realize everybody is trying to put it all together really quickly. Let me try again. Lee, keep me honest. Our rate of organic revenue growth in the second half of '17 overall was 7-plus percent. We're happy to compete with that as our benchmark for 2018 overall. Full stop. The second statement is, we expect -- and that's an organic revenue statement, that's the first statement. The second statement is, we expect our rate of organic EBITDA growth to exceed our rate of organic revenue growth, and that is with all of those educational and wealth opportunities for our employees built into what we're talking about.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi","I guess what we're wondering is what do you expect the reported margins to be in 2018, up, down or flat? And it sounded like, by your comments, I guess we're wondering how to start our model and maybe any order of magnitude around those. It sounded like, by your comments, that acquisitions could depend on -- or could determine where they end up. Are we really wondering about the reported margin.","Lee Shavel","Yes. So Joseph, as we've indicated, we are focused on the organic margin. We expect that to expand. The impact of acquisitions is difficult to predict. We aren't making a prediction or a forward-looking statement as to what the reported impact is. We wouldn't anticipate that, that is going to have a material impact on our overall margins, but it's something that we aren't providing any expectations for 2019 on at this point.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. And then you talked a little bit about some contracts that are moving around, and maybe some slowness in FS and energy in the beginning. I'm wondering, could you talk about the cadence of revenues and margins throughout 2018? And do you expect it to be linear? Anything that we should be aware of from contracts rolling on and off? Anything around that nature?","Scott Stephenson","Yes, let me come back to what I said upfront. We have thousands and thousands of subscription agreements, many of them multi-year. The report that I was providing upfront was that, as we look across all of those, virtually 100% of those relationships are remaining intact in 2018, and the vast majority of those relationships are showing year-over-year progression in growth and value. That's what's happening in our business in 2018.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","You've highlighted capital management discipline as the number one point of feedback from your top investors post your listening tour. Could you expand upon that a little bit in terms of how you expect capital allocation priorities to change going forward? Historically, they've been very focused on buyback and acquisitions. Are you going to toggle more toward buyback going forward?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. So thank you for noting what has been our practice, which is we've always been very comfortable with return -- and we lean into returning capital to shareholders, and we've also found the program of acquisition to be very productive over time. Hopefully, everybody had a chance to see our presentation at the most recent Investor Day, where you saw that, for both the largest deals that we've done over a 10-plus-year time period but also the small and medium ones that we've done, the rate of return on both of those has been in double digits, somewhat higher for, actually, the larger deals. But that whole program has been very productive for our shareholders. So we remain alert to the opportunities.","At any given moment, we're going to take account of what are the conditions in the market. What is there that when you put it together with Verisk you actually get something special, which is different? Hopefully, you caught the reference in my remarks earlier to the fact that you put PowerAdvocate together with Wood Mackenzie, and you have a significant sale that would not have happened if we had not put those two companies together. So that's the logic behind the M&A program. But of course, we're also going to reference what are prices in the market. And we're going to be thoughtful about ultimately what is the rate of return that we expect for the capital that we invest? And so it's not -- so I think what you can expect from Verisk over long periods of time is a balanced approach, where I believe that it will be the case that it will make sense to return capital and it will make sense to deploy capital thoughtfully in the M&A program. And at any given moment, the balance will be a function of the real-time conditions. I -- hopefully, you've heard Lee say that we definitely expect to be returning capital to shareholders in 2018.","David Togut","Understood. As a follow-up, could you update us on your joint venture with Total System Services, Argus and TSYS? And any extent and more broadly of Argus' business in the card issuer processing market in terms of joint ventures in particular?","Scott Stephenson","Right. So first of all, we're very pleased with where the TSYS relationship stand, and it is fully on course, exactly what we expected when the relationship was put together last year. And you're right. There are other processors out there in the world. And as you would imagine, we're in dialogue with them. And actually, we have not sort of named all the folks with whom we work even today. So that is a -- there are several companies in that category. We talked about TSYS because it was a large event. They're not the only company with whom we work today in that category. And we are definitely in pursuit of additional relationships in that category.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC.","Gary Bisbee","Let me -- I hate to do this, but I need to go back to the margins. So I think we all appreciate the focus on organic, but of course, we model to all-in, including the deals. And I guess I struggle to understand why it's so difficult to project the acquisition. So if we look at the Decision Analytics, nearly 300 basis point margin decline in 2017 and a lot larger decline in Q4, specifically. Can you break out for us, looking backwards, how much of that was deal costs and short-term integration payments that maybe somewhat less likely to recur versus just dilution from bringing on revenue that had an initial lower margin attached to it that will likely persist until you annualize these? And a second part of the question is, how material -- maybe the answer is it's not, but the actual integration spending that you're doing, as you've discussed, a key to a lot of these deals is linking them into your existing systems and offering.","Scott Stephenson","Yes. Thank you for the question. Let me take the second part of that and then bump it over to Lee. Integration costs are really not material. And this is an enduring statement about Verisk. And the reason is, if you think about the nature of the integration that needs to be achieved, back to kind of the three buckets that I gave you upfront, when you're talking about product organizations, companies that have unique products that are now a part of Verisk, there are two ways that we link them to us. One of them is getting them on our sales platform, and that integration cost is about nothing. And then the other form of integration is, if and when we integrate the solution, so we have a preexisting encoded solution and the acquired company has an encoded solution, and now you're going to find a way to blend code in order to present a new integrated solution into the marketplace. And those are moment in time.","Generally, those will be accomplished relatively quickly. And in many ways, you're leveraging the development budgets you've all ready got. It's now you're just thinking a different set of developments because you've now got this bigger code base and you have to bring it all together. So the literal integration is not so great. There's a different part of your question, and here now, I'll turn it over to Lee for his comment, but yes, there are deal costs, for sure. And so when you do deals in the moment, there's all the lawyers and et cetera that have to get paid in order to bring the thing together. So there are definitely deal costs, but the literal tying together of Verisk and the company that we just bought, in an operational sense, generally is not material.","Lee Shavel","And so Gary, I think the thing that factors into this is all of the integration upfront costs that we're dealing with that tend to be onetime in nature are an element of this, but there are also two other elements. One is, generally, these are earlier-stage companies, and so they have ability to predict immediately in the near term that -- their immediate performance as we're going through that integration as well as across the number of acquisitions that we have. I think it creates noise that we would suggest is not as relevant to our overall organic performance. And we'd like to focus on that as opposed to trying to predict what that relatively small impact is of those acquisitions. We -- as I indicated, we think that the overall focus should be on the capital efficiency and the returns from that business, and then what they will be able to ultimately contribute on an organic basis when they get folded into the business. So happy to talk more about that with you separately.","Gary Bisbee","Yes, I mean, I think the issue, as you probably heard in your tour, is you have a business that's so heavily subscription, people believe you should have extreme visibility relative to a lot of other companies. And the reality of it is, it's been extremely difficult to predict your quarter-to-quarter financial performance. This kind of inability to really be helpful on the forward-looking numbers, I think, it's a big reason why. But I'm sure you've heard that, and I'm sure you're thinking about ways to improve it. So I appreciate the color.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Silber","I know it's late. I've got one quick question. What should we be modeling for interest expense in 2018?","Lee Shavel","Yes. So Jeff, we've specifically not provided guidance around that. I don't think it's going to move materially. But as we're thinking about debt levels and our target aside, I just didn't want to set a specific expectation. I think you can look at the balances and at the rate historically, I don't think it will vary significantly.","Jeffrey Silber","And I guess, the lever from the PowerAdvocate acquisition, that's really -- is that on the balance sheet at the end of the year? Or is that not been on the balance sheet yet?","Lee Shavel","No, it is on the balance sheet. We funded that substantially with debt.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","You've talked about a lot of newer, I would say, growth drivers relative to Verisk's historical businesses. I haven't heard a mention of cyber. And I wonder how you think about cyber risk? And whether there are some organic opportunities to grow in cyber or whether M&A is something you're looking at?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. Thanks for the question, and I'll start -- and Mark, if you want to jump in. Cyber is very definitely a part of what we do today. Those of you who are familiar with the P&C insurance industry may be aware that sort of, interestingly, the cyber line -- for all the talk about cyber risk, et cetera, in the world, the cyber line is actually not that highly expressed so far. It's actually -- it's a relatively modest line of insurance. It gets a lot more discussion than it actually gets premium dollars at the moment. We expect cyber will continue to grow as a line, and we already provide modeling of the cyber line, and we have customers for those models. So we're engaged. We're already in that. The 2 interesting questions for us, and Mark, maybe, please feel free to jump in here. Interesting question number one is, how rapidly will the cyber line grow as an insurance offering? But then number two, all the other things that we could potentially do to help operating companies with cyber exposures even beyond helping to manage the insurance policies. So I don't know. Mark, do you want to add anything to that?","Mark Anquillare","So we have been kind of the industry standard as it relates to the coverage language in those policies. And I think we have a lot of customers we highlighted at the Investor Day, where I think the more promising future growth is going to be is inside of the models. As people try to grow, and for the most part, underwrite some of that cyber, some of the models, which we historically called cat models, are now being used for, what I'll refer to as, more of the liability side. And cyber is very prominent there. We've made some great progress in working inside of the folks in the London market as well inside of the United States insurers. And that will be a growth driver for us. I would tell you that it's probably more marginal in '18, but it will and should kick up in the future years.","Scott Stephenson","Okay. Well, I think we're at the end of the questions. Thank you all very much for enjoying us -- joining us. And we've enjoyed the conversation, look forward to being with you again to report out the next quarter. And Lee will be doing a lot of follow-up with many, many of you. So let's continue to have a dialogue, and thank you very much for your time today.","Lee Shavel","Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.","Eva F. Huston","Thank you, Shirley. And good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2014 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.","All numbers we discuss today, unless stated otherwise, will reflect continuing operations and exclude the results from Interthinx, our mortgage services business which we sold in March. Interthinx is classified as discontinued operations in this quarter and previous periods. In our 10-Q filing, revenue is reported from continuing operations only, but EBITDA is shown including Interthinx and the related gain on sale, per the SEC requirement. In our press release, we report EBITDA from continuing operations to assist you in your analysis. As you will recall, last quarter, we included in the back of our press release a reconciliation of continuing operations to the total, as well as the quarterly detail for 2012 and 2013 excluding Interthinx.","The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC.","A replay of this call will be available for 30 days until May 29, 2014, on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott G. Stephenson","Thank you, Eva. And good morning, everybody.","Our first quarter revenue growth was good, driven by very strong performance in our insurance units. Our innovation and analytic agenda is active in all of our verticals, and I'm very confident it will lead to new solutions for our customers and that these investments will deliver good returns over time. You can see some impacts of these investments in our margins this quarter, although our margins continue to place Verisk in an elite group of companies.","We consider our organic growth rate to be the single best measure of our vitality as an organization. Over the course of the last couple of years, we have improved our mix of assets and supported continued organic growth. In particular, we divested our mortgage services assets and acquired Argus, shifting our focus from the challenged mortgage market to the expanding global payments market. In addition, we have added health care assets that align with the fundamental trend toward improved efficiency in health care spend in both the government and private markets.","We remain focused on making sure our health care business delivers excellence. In February, we successfully concluded the Medicare Advantage review season. Ensuring we deliver the results our customers expected in the form of reimbursement from Medicare came with a cost to Verisk, which you see in the margins for the quarter. We did the right thing for our customers in the fourth and first quarters and believe our relationships with them are stronger for the effort. We continue to make progress in demand planning with our health care customers and we are reassured by these positive customer interactions, and continue to expect mid-teens revenue growth for the full year of 2014.","On the inorganic side, we remain excited about the opportunity to add EagleView Technologies, or EVT, to our existing solution sets. We are also active in evaluating additional opportunities to align with our strategic vision and focus on strong organic growth over time.","We continue to run the business with a long-term focus while remaining aware of the need to execute everyday. The data and analytic mindset informs our strategic thinking, as well as our approach to solving the immediate challenges our customers face. Our approach to managing the business is well aligned with our innovation agenda, as innovation works in long cycles. We will continue to invest prudently in order to drive both top line and free cash flow growth over time. Our twin goals of organic growth through innovation and operating with efficiency remain key focal points for the entire Verisk management team.","As you know, on January 14, we announced the signing of an agreement to acquire EVT, who are a leader in imagery analytics and they offer solutions in the property and casualty, contractor, government and commercial spaces. On March 28, we received a request for additional information from the FTC. We are responding to the second request and currently expect to close our acquisition during the third quarter of 2014.","As we've stated, our strategy is to allocate capital to the highest-return opportunities for shareholders, and EVT is one of those opportunities. The business has grown strongly, leveraging the foundation of the government and municipality business into new markets in insurance and other commercial sectors. And we have significant opportunity to continue to grow the business both in the United States and, over time, internationally.","We continue to evaluate additional M&A opportunities, as we remain focused on our core principle of creating shareholder value through innovation, discipline and execution. We have capacity for additional acquisitions that meet our strategic agenda. We also have continued to repurchase our stock, a sign of our confidence in the future and in our capital capacity.","We talked to you last quarter about the number of ideas coming forward from our business units for creating new solutions and enhancing existing ones. These initiatives are moving forward and we continue to maintain strong margins while doing so. We also continue to spend to ensure that our current solutions remain excellent, including re-platforming initiatives in areas such as catastrophe modeling, repair cost estimating, P&C underwriting and health care. We still expect margins to be flattish for the year, with strength building in the second half, as is typical.","In the first quarter of 2014, we delivered good overall performance, with total organic revenue growth of about 9% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of about 6%. EBITDA margin from continuing operations was about 45% in the quarter.","We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders and we remain disciplined in our use of capital. As I mentioned earlier, we remain active in looking at M&A. We continue to focus on assets with a strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth. In the quarter, we returned capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases of about $89 million. Our remaining authorization at the end of the quarter was about $77 million. We will continue to use our authorization consistent with our capital allocation strategy, as previously outlined.","And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.","Mark V. Anquillare","Thanks, Scott.","In the first quarter, total revenue grew 8.7%.","For the first quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 10.4% revenue growth. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in financial services and insurance. Our Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 11.8% in the first quarter. The increase was driven by strong growth in loss quantification and catastrophe modeling solutions. Underwriting growth in the quarter was good, and claims solutions also contributed. Overall revenue growth was driven by increased adoption of the existing and new solutions.","In financial services, we were pleased to see growth of 21.6% in the quarter. The growth outlook at Argus remains positive, including through international expansion, additional penetration of existing customers and partnering opportunities, in particular related to advertising effectiveness with traditional and new media companies. We continue to expect financial services to grow at least mid-teens in 2014.","In the health care vertical, revenue in the first quarter grew 8.2%, an acceleration versus last quarter led by growth in Medicare Advantage-related solutions. As you know, there's some seasonality in the business relates -- which relates to the second-half review season for Medicare Advantage plans. So looking at half years when comparing to the prior year is generally more relevant than comparisons on a per-quarter basis. As we discussed with you last quarter and at Investor Day, the 2013 Medicare Advantage season ran through February of 2014, so some of the challenges we faced in late 2013 continued into the first quarter and impacted margins. We continue to work with our customers to jointly improve demand planning and expect an improvement in 2014. We still expect the category to see mid-teens revenue growth in the full year 2014.","In the specialized markets category, revenue declined 1% in the first quarter. Good growth in the quarter in environmental health and safety and commercial weather and climate analytics were more than offset by lower activity related to government sector customers.","Turning to Risk Assessment. For the first quarter, we reported revenue growth of 6.4%, indicating the value to our longstanding insurance customers. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew revenue 6.3% in the quarter. This reflects our 2014 invoices which were effective January 1.","In addition, we saw a contribution to growth from newly adopted solutions such as predictive modeling, electronic rating content and workers' comp solutions. We also had an above-average amount of transaction revenue in the quarter, which we would expect not to recur at the same level for the rest of the year.","Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 6.5% in the quarter. This increase was in the form of new sales, including those resulting in higher committed volumes and contracts transitioning transactional revenue to higher, longer-term subscription-type commitments.","EBITDA from continuing operations for the first quarter increased 3.5% to $182.8 million, and our EBITDA margin from continuing operations was 44.6%.","There was some carryover spending in the first quarter related to Medicare Advantage busy season, which ran through mid-February. This is a continuation of the additional spending to deliver for our customers that we had discussed with you last quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to work to execute on our demand-planning initiatives with our customers.","The margins in Decision Analytics were 36.2% in the first quarter of 2014 versus 40.4% in the first quarter of 2013. The lower margin was primarily the result of increased costs in our health care business, as well as some investments to support our innovation agenda, partially offset by revenue growth in the segment. As Scott mentioned, costs in our health care segment allowed us to meet customer needs in the short term while building long-term relationship success as we work to scale our operations.","In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 57.5% versus 56.4% in the first quarter of 2013. Our margins were advanced in the quarter by revenue growth, good expense management and lower pension costs.","Our interest expense was down $2.7 million in the first quarter versus the respective period in 2013 due to lower debt balances as a result of repayments made in 2013. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate using our revolver and cash on hand, as well as proceeds from the sale of Interthinx, to fund the purchase of EVT.","Reported effective tax rate was 35.7% for the quarter. The lower-than-expected tax rate was primarily due to a favorable state legislative change.","Adjusted net income increased 3.6% to $93.3 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.55 for the quarter, an increase of 5.8%. The average diluted share count was 170.4 million shares in the quarter. On March 31, 2014, our diluted share count was 169.8 million shares. In the quarter, we repurchased about 1.4 million shares for $88.7 million. At quarter end, we had about $76.5 million under our authorization left.","Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs of about 20%. For 2014, we continue to anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution.","Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents were $427.4 million as a result of our seasonally strong first quarter cash flow, as well as proceeds from the sale of our mortgage services business.","Total debt, both short term and long term, was about $1.3 billion. Today, our incremental debt capacity is about $1 billion and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow.","Our debt-to-pro forma EBITDA from continuing operations as of March 31 was 1.7x, below our steady-state target. With the acquisition of EVT and sale of Interthinx, we anticipate our leverage will rise to 2x at the close of the transaction.","Free cash flow, adjusted for 2 items that I'll discuss in a moment, grew 6.8% compared with the prior period to $212.9 million. This represented over 100% of EBITDA from continuing operations in the first 3 months of 2014 due, in part, to the typical prepayment for some of our solutions. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. To facilitate comparability to the prior period, we adjusted free cash flow to the timing of excess tax benefits from exercised stock options in the first quarter of 2013, and for the sale of our mortgage services business this year.","Cash provided by operating activities, as reported, increased $41.6 million. This increase was the result of a $6.3 million increase generated by improved profitability of the business, a $2.7 million decrease in interest paid due to lower debt balances, a decrease of $33.7 million in taxes and $13.4 million from working capital and other balance sheet changes. This was partially offset by other outflows of about $14.5 million.","Our capital expenditures were 8.6% of revenue year-to-date 2014. We continue to expect about $147 million in CapEx for the full year.","A greater use of capitalized software related to new solutions will modestly raise the capital intensity of our business when compared to historic levels, although capital expenditures in 2014 are expected to be lower than 2013. We aim to grow free cash flow at or above the level of our EBITDA growth.","As you think about your models for the full year 2014, we expect flattish margins for the full year, excluding Interthinx. You should expect to see that margin building in the second half of the year. As we remain focused on our innovation agenda, we are maintaining our longer-term view of margins in the 45% to 47% range. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be about $57 million, fixed asset amortization and depreciation of about $75 million to $80 million and an effective tax rate between 37.5% and 38%.","We aim to keep share count flat through our share repurchase program. At our current level of debt, our quarterly interest expense is about $18 million. Based upon the strength of our cash flow generation and the divestiture and the resulting cash balances, we anticipate borrowing $300 million or less for the acquisition of EVT, depending on timing of the close and other events. After the close of the EVT transaction, we will update you.","Overall, we are pleased to report that our business is performing well. We have a nice mix of growth across multiple verticals, and we continue to invest with discipline for the future to continue strong organic growth.","I will turn the call back to Eva for a comment before Q&A.","Eva F. Huston","Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Suzi Stein from Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you just help us understand how sustainable the acceleration of revenue growth in the insurance portion of Decision Analytics is? I mean how much of that is transaction versus subscription? And would you expect the level of growth, which had been quite a bit slower the last -- last 2 quarters, to stay at the double-digit rate that it's at this quarter?","Mark V. Anquillare","Suzi, this is Mark. I think we feel pretty positive about the insurance segment. I'll call out a few things. First of all, there's pretty good stability inside the industry-standard programs. We did have a little bit of a transactional blip, not significant, but that would probably not recur in the second quarter and beyond. But to further your point, our repair cost estimating, loss quantification and the catastrophe models, those businesses are performing very nicely. We see good activity. And to kind of follow up on your question, these are subscription-type of businesses where people prepay for a year or more of service, so not a lot of transactional volume related to that. And that's about wins. That's about new products. It's reasonably strong across the board.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then can you help us maybe with what you're doing with share repurchases? It looks like this year -- that at the pace you are going now, share repurchases will be finished, based on the authorization, maybe this quarter. But -- so does the EVT deal impact your view on how aggressive you'll be with that?","Scott G. Stephenson","Not really. I mean, we have confidence -- this is Scott. We have confidence that we will complete the EVT transaction. And so we've already factored that into our thought process. And we continue to believe that the share repurchase program is a very reasonable use of capital. And we talked to you about what our authorizations are. We're always taking account of the facts on the ground, but no, I think we've -- we already know where we're at with respect to EVT. And we will continue to manage the share repurchase program with the same goal as we've always had, which is at least to limit dilution and opportunistically, to go beyond that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little more on the Medicare Advantage inside of health care? And you talked about demand planning. Can you get clients to do this earlier in the year? And I guess, what's been the holdback from them? I guess, just any more color on how you're going to change that process and, perhaps associated with that, automate any additional parts of the process to improve the efficiency.","Scott G. Stephenson","Tim, it's Scott here. So to your basic question, yes. Actually, we do believe and we are engaged in exactly this, which is trying to be more -- for there to be more clarity and transparency in our relationship with our major customers on the Medicare Advantage side. And what helps us in that is that they actually have incentives to get to exactly the same place, because they have so much at stake in getting all of this right. They really want to know that they're important vendors. And I think that -- I know that we are an important vendor to an increasing number of players. They want to know that their important vendors are going to be there for delivery. And so as both Mark and I said earlier in our comments, one of the things that happened was we were really, really focused on making sure that delivery up to the moment that the process timed out on February 14 was really good so that our customers got the results that they wanted, and they did. And as a result of that, inside of these relationships, I think it's fair to say there is even more of a sense of confidence and mutual confidence. And I think that, that encourages the -- our customers to be more planful with us basically. It's good for all of us, them and us. So I think that we're in a situation where it makes sense, and our customers know that it makes sense.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And is this a -- you talked about margins still being flat for the year but building in the second half. I guess, is this the -- there's obviously a lot of factors, but how important is convincing clients to do this and to you actually achieving that and those better margins in the second half of the year? It would appear like this is one of the big swing factors to getting margins back.","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, I think you may be tying together 2 things there a little too tightly, Tim. So first of all, yes, I mean we're focused on growing the business and working very hard at that. And obviously, there's a relationship between top line growth and the bottom line. But as it relates to sort of the ebb and flow of our margins, if you look at us through time, we've typically been a back-half kind of a company for quite a few reasons. Some of it relates to seasonality. Some of it relates to the fact that we take a little bit of a step up, usually in the second quarter, with respect to our people costs. And so there's actually a lot of factors in there. And I actually -- it sounded like what you were trying to do was sort of tightly link those 2 observations. I think that's a little too tight. There's a lot of things that go on that describe our margin profile.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So just on the health care side, real quickly, the additional costs this quarter in health care, was that more than what you had initially expected? I know you talked about it last quarter. I was just curious if that came in more than maybe what you had initially planned. And is basically the lack of that investment a big driver in terms of the second-half margin improvement?","Scott G. Stephenson","I would not describe us as surprised by what happened. I mean there's a process that we're working through with our customers that plays out over a long period of time. And the fourth quarter of 2013 -- the fourth quarter of any year and the first quarter of the following year are both sort of peak moments inside of this [indiscernible]. We were executing in the fourth quarter and we knew where things were. And so no, I would not describe it as a surprise.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, just on the margin front, like is that -- is basically the lack of an investment a big driver in terms of -- a big component at least in terms of the margin improvement you're expecting in the second half?","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, same answer that I just gave Tim, which is there is the -- there is some seasonality inside of health care, and that is a contributing factor. But there are a -- I mean we in general have seen higher margins in the back half of the year for a whole variety of reasons.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Again, can you give any color on that request by the FTC on EVT? I know you said you responded, but anything else you can add there?","Scott G. Stephenson","No. We're at work.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I guess I want to ask the health care question a little bit differently, Scott. I mean recognizing that every Medicare Advantage season seems a little different and you guys are kind of learning as you go along here in this business, what gives you confidence that you can ultimately scale those customer costs? Are we looking at something that's structural, recognizing there's seasonality? Or is this -- do you get better every year, you go through the process? Do you get more efficient? What -- how do we think about that longer-term in terms of being able to scale what is still a really big piece of your health care business?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes, so there's really 2 parts to it. One is the synchronization of our capacity with our customer's actual demand. And I'll just highlight that it's a little hard for them to know sometimes also, actually, so -- but we do have opportunities to do a better job of that in close collaboration with our customers. And we've already spoken about that. Secondly, there are opportunities to try to automate certain elements of the process overall. And we're certainly at work at those as well. So it will really be a combination of both of those.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And switching gears a little bit to Argus. Mark, one of the things I think you called out when you were going through the drivers is international expansion. How much of that business is rest of world now? And what are the relative growth rates when you look at the 20%-plus organic you put up this quarter?","Mark V. Anquillare","So the Argus business, I think we've always described a couple different ways they grow. And part of it, they do what are kind of like industry-standard study inside of either the card space or the debit card space. And we've talked about taking that platform and extending it into other geographies. About 30% of the business is that international flavor. And we think we can kind of move out into a couple other regions, and we see promise there. With that industry-standard study, I'll refer to it as that, there's been solutions in specialized products that come with that because people want to dig deeper. So that's the second act inside of a kind of a new country or a new set of customers in a different geography. Separately, as we talk about growth, we've talked about things that have been very positive around kind of advertising effectiveness. And with partners, we've started to make some nice progress there to kind of work on the side of kind of more traditional advertising and then kind of the newer-way media. So those have been kind of ways we've grown. And I think we've talked about at least mid-teens growth there. And that's a promising kind of third act inside of what we think is a very, very great business model that Argus has.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On the DA margins, can you just help give us order of magnitude of how much of the year-over-year contraction is due to the Medicare Advantage side of things and how much of it's due to the investments in the innovation agenda?","Mark V. Anquillare","So I would -- let me try to parse it a little bit. I think Scott has kind of given a lot of this in broad terms. But some of the margin erosion that you're seeing from year to year, I would say more than half is health care related. And then I would say the other half is kind of that innovation agenda and scaling up so that we are able to continue to satisfy and grow our businesses more broadly across that DA segment. So a little more than half on health care, a little less than half on kind of that innovation and re-platforming agenda that we're on.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then with the website relaunch, couldn't help but notice that it seems like you're featuring retail as a market more prominently. Can you just talk about the go-to-market there, how tailored the solutions are and if it's repurposing existing capabilities and data assets or if at some point you may need to do something from the acquisition standpoint to move more aggressively into that market?","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, maybe your -- taking your question back to front. We do think there are some interesting assets out there with respect to retail. And maybe just a word on why retail, why interest in retail. Our method, the kind of what we do works best when we are inside of large markets that have a relatively large number of players that are relatively homogeneous with respect to the way they operate and the problems they confront. And all of those statements apply to retail. So that's the fundamental basis for interest. We're already in the retail business. We already serve retailers. And most of the -- sort of the energy that you're picking up from us is our interest in trying to find a way to essentially deepen the analytics that retailers make use of as they try to run their businesses, to move from something which is more sort of kind of elegant reporting about what's going on to something that we're really making kind of more forward-looking statements. And that's really the Verisk way. That's what we do, is we capture more data, we deepen the analytics and we move towards forward-looking statements for our customers. And that's -- and we're just on the march in that way inside of retail. So that's the energy that you're picking up from us on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So back in March, CoreLogic acquired Marshall Swift\/Boeckh. And I wanted to ask whether that changes the competitive landscape for that piece of the business. With MSB with about 80% of underwriting and Xactware with about 80% of claims, what happens next?","Scott G. Stephenson","So yes, thanks for the question, Bill. First of all, I just -- without getting highly specific, I think the way that you sort of laid it out there on sort of the relativities on claims and underwriting, not really quite where we see it, first of all, just you so you know. I'll also just say kind of at a high level and then I'll kind of get a little bit more specific. At a high level, that we actually think the privileged position in all of this work is actually being deeply into the claims process because that's the -- there, you observe the literal facts of loss. And having a genuine understanding of loss is very, very important to making statements about potential future loss, which is part of the underwriting process. So we just have a view of the integration of those 2 businesses, the way they work together, and a view of kind of where's the highest and driest and strongest place to stand in order to create value for customers. So that, by way of context. We really think that our case in this category is -- it's really on us. In other words, we feel like we have great relationships with our customers and all the scope in the world to bring more value to them. And we feel like we have their full attention. And basically, therefore, it's up to us to be innovative and to be meeting their every need as they try to apply our tools. But we don't walk around feeling like the sort of the cap or the constraint on our growth opportunity is a competitive one. It's really on us and it's really a function of how well we execute our innovation agenda.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then is international expansion an opportunity that you think about for that business line?","Scott G. Stephenson","Very definitely. And back to the earlier comments, especially in the whole area of estimatics, replacement and repair cost estimating, amplified by aerial imagery and all of the analytics around that, which fundamentally have the effect of creating more automation inside of all of that. That whole combination feels to us like a business which has as much global potential as any that we've got inside of the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Mark, I wanted to follow up on your comment about the RA industry standards growth rate and getting it influenced by above-average transactional revenues. I still would guess that even when you take that out, this would be a year of acceleration for RA industry-standard growth. And the thinking there would be while it's not a one-to-one relationship, I do assume that the 2012 acceleration that -- within premiums does inform 2014 RA growth rates. Is that still a fair way to think about it when you take out the above-average transactional revenue growth that you were trying to call out for the first quarter?","Mark V. Anquillare","Thanks for the question, Bill...","Scott G. Stephenson","Andrew...","Mark V. Anquillare","Andrew. I apologize. I just want to quickly just draw a distinction. I think we've always talked about kind of the value our customers see in the overall invoice. So certainly, premiums factor into it. I don't think 2014, which relates to 2012 premiums, was the foundation for kind of a more substantial increase. I think we've kind of tried to keep this consistent with the value our customers see. So the process, the approach remains unchanged. What I will kind of draw upon is I think the innovation agenda that we've been discussing here is not just a Decision Analytics agenda. It's also inside of Risk Assessment. So what we try to call out is the predictive modeling solutions that we've now kind of extended beyond personal auto, into homeowners, even the commercial lines, we're starting to gain some traction. We've tried to take some of our rating content and we have created what is a completely automated approach for insurers to bring that content through electronic rating content into their solutions. That has been meaningful. And finally, even inside of some of the workers' comp solutions that we're starting to put out on the market, we're finding traction. And that is contributing to that industry-standard program growth for the year. So some small but good signs of innovation on the Risk Assessment side, as well as Decision Analytics.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I didn't quite -- how much should we think of the kind of growth rate without the element that you tried to call out, the above-average transactional revenues in the first quarter?","Mark V. Anquillare","Yes, Andrew, we're not going to get into that level of detail, I apologize. But I hope you appreciate that we feel that, short of that transactional type of onetimer in the first quarter, we would expect a kind of a continuation into the remainder of the year, as you see Risk Assessment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Anj Singh dialing-in for Hamza. I was wondering if we could get an update on your M&A pipeline. Do you view the near- and mid-term pipeline as having more tuck-in acquisitions? Or is there a probability of larger ones like EagleView?","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, maybe I can go back to sort of the principle that we're working on, which is that it all sort of flows from our strategy. So what we start with is a view of the verticals that we're serving and the mix of solutions that our customers are looking for. And fundamentally, the reason we engage in M&A is that if there are great solutions out there which we feel we can amplify by tying them into what we already do, and if they're -- and if that's positive for our customers, that's really why we're on the M&A agenda. So we're proceeding from really a market-driven, customer-driven view of what's needed and wanted and then how does our current portfolio stack up against that. So inside of that, we don't really start by filtering on size. I mean, even yesterday, we had a very deep session looking at a very large number of companies that are in our pipeline. And the filtering mechanism does not begin with size. It begins with relevance. And so there's an openness to what it is that makes sense. Having said that, one of the things that we have to give attention to is the integration of anything that we acquire. And so I would say that, all else equal, something which is a little bit smaller is a little bit easier to integrate. And so that's always running in the back of our minds, but again, the point of departure is where are we strategically in the market, what do our customers need. And really, size is -- size obviously gets consideration as we think about our capital structure and where we're at, at any given moment, but it's down the road in terms of the thought process.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And as a quick follow-up, are you still comfortable with the July closing that you'd outlined for EagleView?","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, earlier in my comments, I said third quarter, and that's still where we are.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman from SIG.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I'll just ask a couple upfront, if I could. The first one is, was there any weather, Scott, that you might call out in the first quarter results? The second one is, Mark, you had articulated some of the costs that seasonally recur in the second quarter. Maybe if you could refresh us on that. And then third, to go back to the health care question, Scott, did the first quarter results come in -- first of all, congratulations on the acceleration in health care. But I wanted to ask, did the first quarter results on the revenue come in consistent with your previously articulated expectation of mid-teens growth on the top line. So I know it's a lot upfront, but the first, on weather; the second, on costs; the third, on health.","Scott G. Stephenson","All right. I'll take the first and the third, and then if Mark can remember your second question, he'll address that one. So weather sort of is always in the mix of things that we're doing, but I would not call out weather as a -- as having particular explanatory power in terms of the first quarter, meaning there are always weather events, always. And sometimes, they fall in the first quarter, and sometimes, in the third quarter; some years, a little bit more, some years a little bit less. At any given moment, you can actually almost trace a line between events and claims volumes and how that relates to some of the things that we do by way of estimating. But overall, I would not call weather as something that really has much explanatory power as it relates to the quarter. And just more generally, there's just sort of the long sweep of kind of what the weather is doing. Actually, if you want to understand the impact of weather on the insurance business, for example, you actually have to look at 2 things. One is the nature of damage caused by weather, which to some extent -- meaning the intensity of the weather event itself, the intensity and frequency of the weather event itself. And there has been some trend towards increase. But what's actually even more important is the amount of insurable property and its proximity to where weather-driven events tend to occur. Then it's actually -- that actually has greater explanatory power. So for example, Americans' desire to live on the coast of Florida has a lot to do with the increase in hurricane losses through time, as well as what's happening with respect to hurricanes. So I hope that's clear. With respect to the health care question, no. I mean we feel very comfortable observing the first quarter and reaffirming we're expecting mid-teens. So Mark, maybe you want to take on the second question.","Mark V. Anquillare","Sure. Thanks. So second quarter, if you recall the way we manage our compensation at Verisk, second quarter is kind of the introduction of salary increases. So we kind of have across-the-enterprise performance reviews. And salary increases are effective with the beginning of 2Q. So that's an uptick from 1Q. What we also do kind of on April 1 is we provide and grant equity. That's both in the combination of options as well as restricted stock for our senior team, and that amount would also hit second quarter. Obviously, 4 years ago, grant would come off. There's a little bit of kind of ebbs and flows based upon an approach we have with PRH62 [ph]. You accelerate vest, but usually, that number is generally up a little bit, trends up. And the other thing that affects quarters is the nature of the health care business does have some seasonality, right? The second half is a little stronger than the first half. There's the Medicare Advantage plans kind of go through that review process we described. That runs through kind of Valentine's Day. So second quarter is a little bit of a trough, and there are some variable costs associated with that. So as a result, you would think of the costs being generally down or in line with kind of that top line. So those are the 3 things that kind of ebb and flow with regard to expenses in 2Q relative to 1Q.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Foresi from Janney Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","This is Jeff Rossetti on for Joe. Just if I could ask a question back on health care. I just wanted to see, as you target mid-teens growth, how do you expect some of the acceleration for revenue and quality versus population and payments?","Scott G. Stephenson","We need the whole suite to be performing in order to achieve our goals. And we -- if you -- when you look at the way that our performance builds, and we've had a chance to share this with folks in forums like Investor Day, the cross-selling of our full suite is a big, big focal point for us. And it goes in all directions, so an RQID customer adopting Payment Accuracy solutions or Payment Accuracy customers adopting Enterprise Analytics solutions, et cetera. All those connections are meaningful to us. And it's not that we focus on some and deemphasize others. They all matter.","Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just maybe a bit going back to you mentioned at the analyst day just those drivers. I think you'd called out coverage expansion. I just wanted to see if there was any updates on signings and the update on the product that was launched recently for ACOs with respect to your quality suite.","Scott G. Stephenson","I'm not quite sure I understand what you meant when you said coverage, but with respect to the ACO suite, we continue to make progress on that front. That's a very exciting part of our business. Those of you who are familiar with health care know that, that is a very sort of nascent and emergent part of the health care mix. But we -- one of the leading indicators to us, our relevance in the space, is our ability to do work with emerging ACOs. And we have a good team working on that. And so that's meaningful to us.","Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I was just referring to -- on the other question on the exchanges, insurance exchanges, like meaning expansion of a potential...","Scott G. Stephenson","Oh, I understand. Yes, we consider -- yes, so we consider exchanges as essentially another segment of customers. And we're on that, as we are on the other segments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Sorry to go back to health care, but your guidance for mid-teen growth in the unit implies some sizable acceleration from the 8-plus-percent growth you saw in the first quarter. Is that something we should expect to gradually see through the year? Or do you think you'll finish the year at much higher than the mid-teens rate in order to get there?","Mark V. Anquillare","Let me just come back to, I think, what we were trying to describe. I think we feel that from a capacity planning perspective, we're making good progress, and Scott highlighted this. But even with the way we think of our suites and our solutions, we are trending more towards focusing on the customer needs and what solutions plug in. We were running the business a little bit more around the various product sets. And now we're working more closely with what does the customer need. So it's a focus that is, I think, more directly attributable to customer, as opposed to product. Inside that, kind of across the board, the seasonal aspect of it is still that Medicare Advantage. So that does ramp the overall volumes towards the second half of the year. So just remember, it's a first half versus second half as we always described, the second half being more on the 60% and maybe 40% on the front. I would tell you, though, that the mean -- the quarters, from a growth perspective, I don't see them as meaningful. I think we are looking for, yes, a growth in the ramp from what is 8% up to mid-teens, and that should kind of be across the quarters.","Scott G. Stephenson","All right, just for absolute clarity, ramping in a way that the average for the whole year is mid-teens. So you're -- you've done the math correctly.","Mark V. Anquillare","Yes.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, all right, that's helpful. And then just going back to the EVT acquisition, can you remind us what milestones are needed before closing? Are these things that you're going to be discussing publicly?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio.","Scott G. Stephenson","Sorry, ma'am, we just wanted to -- we wanted to answer that question. So the -- so EVT -- pardon me?","Unknown Executive","[indiscernible]","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes. Principally, we -- what we're in is in the FTC review process. And we commented on the fact that we got the second request. And we're in that -- in the process of working through the second request right now, and that's pretty much it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.","Adrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Adrienne calling in for Paul Ginocchio. I was wondering if you could comment on what the impact of the U.S. government's pending approval of allowing the sale of high-resolution satellite images would have on the EagleView acquisition, and also any expected changes that would have on the competitive landscape.","Scott G. Stephenson","Right. Thank you for the question. No impact. There remains a distinction between what can be gleaned from an image captured from the sky versus an image captured from a satellite. And without sort of belaboring the technology: It's a different sensing mode on a satellite than it is a camera in the belly of an airplane. And the satellite is looking through the atmosphere in a way that the camera in the plane is not. And so you sort of start with that and you have different properties in the image, and then beyond that, a lot of what applies as well is the ability to get a number of orthogonal and oblique images of the same structure. And aerial imagery is advantaged in doing that in a way that satellite imagery is not. Satellite imagery has advantages, for sure, but as it relates to what we're trying to do, it's the kind of precision that one can get from an aerial image. And what are called the radiometric properties of the image are very significant in what we're looking to do, so really no impact. But I will say also, however, those of you who are going to be following our company through time, as we try to mine aerial images, there may be different modalities in which they're gathered. So for example, all the discussion about drones is interesting to us. And fundamentally, if there's a way to get the precise images that we're looking at in a more efficient way, a la a drone, that's actually a good thing for us. We would be open to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","This is Rayna Kumar, for David Togut. Could you please quantify your price increase this year in Risk Assessment?","Scott G. Stephenson","We don't actually think of it that way. That's not even how we work on it, really. I think that maybe there are some folks out there who are aware of our pricing algorithm, which has in it a -- one of the terms in the algorithm is to reference industry premium volumes. And that, I can certainly understand where that would create an impression, which is effectively there's just sort of a ratchet in the invoices that we're sending out year-over-year, but that's actually not the way that it works. What we do is we take account of the amount of value that we've added in the suite. And so there's actually a great deal of work that goes on every year to have as much relevant and timely information inside of the underwriting rules, inside of the loss costs that we publish, and that is part of the work that we do each year. I will go back to what Mark said also, that inside of Risk Assessment, there are new categories of solutions. And the growth there is really a function of adoption. But back to the industry-standard programs that we talked about in the past, it's not really about price. It's about value. It's about what did we do to improve the product.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Do you expect margin improvement in 2014 to occur in both your Decision Analytics business and your Risk Assessment business during the second half?","Mark V. Anquillare","So this is Mark. I think what we tried to describe is the fact that we would say flattish for the full year 2014. That's an enterprise-wide view. I think what you've also heard is that we did spend a little bit more inside health care satisfying some customers. So there's probably a little bit more expansion in the DA side of things than the RA side of things. RA is obviously pretty special with regard to margins today.","Scott G. Stephenson","And again, we've said that we're a back-half company as it relates to margins generally.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I apologize in advance if this question was asked in some form, as I'm jumping on a bit late here. But I'm sure -- I heard there were a number of health care questions asked. I was wondering if there was any specific color you can provide on how the individual businesses are doing, what the trends have been, even if it's just, say, a range, as opposed to a specific percentage. I know there's a focus on cross-selling and selling at the needs of the customer, but it'd be helpful to understand if there is a material difference between, say, Payment Accuracy and RQI.","Scott G. Stephenson","We haven't really sort of broken it out in that way, but -- and I'm not sure if you heard the comment before, but we really are very focused on all parts of the suite performing, both because of the growth that can be contributed by the different elements of the suite, but as well, we believe that we actually become a more compelling partner to our customers the more that they actually make use of our full suite. And you all know that we have been at work for some time to make sure that we have commonality operating underneath the product platforms with respect to data definition and rules, warehousing. And that remains our view, that it's sort of the -- that we really are greater than simply the sum of our parts explicitly. And that is very much our view of the business and what matters and where we're at and where we're going.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, even understanding that you're going to market as a cohesive suite, are you guys seeing more requests or responsiveness to certain parts of the suite? Or is that just not something you're willing to get into?","Scott G. Stephenson","I think the measure for us is whether or not we can get into a deep dialogue with the leaders in the business and have something relevant to say across essentially all of their decisioning needs. And that is our focus. And we work very hard to make sure that we can go out and have conversations which are very broad with our customers. And I think that we're encouraged by that. And I think that we feel we see the fruit of that in terms of our enhanced standing with the name-brand companies in the health care space.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the back -- call back over to the -- our presenters for any closing remarks.","Scott G. Stephenson","Thank you.

This call is being recorded, at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk\u2019s Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Chief Knowledge Officer, Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.","Eva Huston","Thank you, Lisa and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our second quarter 2014 financial results. With me on the call this morning are; Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark, highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.","The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investor section of our website at verisk.com. The earnings release results have been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, until August 30, 2014 on our website and by dial-in.","And finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday\u2019s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to. Scott","Scott G. Stephenson","Thank you, Eva and good morning all. Our second quarter revenue growth was good, again driven by very strong performance in our insurance units. We remained focused on our effort to continue to innovate and deliver predictive analytics for our customers, which will in turn lead to solid organic growth and shareholder returns over time.","As we\u2019ve discussed with you, we consider our organic growth rate to be the single best measure of our vitality as an organization. I believe our assets makes us the best, it has been in my years with the company. And we believe our assets will allow us to deliver the kind of organic growth you\u2019ve come to expect from Verisk.","I want to share with you a couple of recent highlights, across some of our key themes. A wonderful example on the innovation and investment agenda is the launch of Touchstone 2.0 which is the next version of our next generation cat modeling platform, released earlier this month. As you know we\u2019ve invested in Touchstone and are very pleased with the customer adoption, we\u2019ve seen in the course of 2013 and 2014.","With this second release, we\u2019re introducing many new capabilities, including support for non-cat risks, such as fire, lightening, explosion and vandalism. Having this information in a single platform, by leveraging other parts of the Verisk insurance solutions group, provide some more comprehensive view of risk, thereby expanding the value to our insurance customers, by giving them a more holistic view of their portfolio.","Second, we\u2019re focused on the large and long-term opportunity, related to international expansion. We\u2019re in the very early innings with international comprising a small piece of our revenue today. Our units within existing presence outside the U.S are working to expand. We generate revenue outside the U.S today from analytics-related to catastrophe modeling, environmental health and safety, payments and insurance claims. Our other units with solutions and analytics which are applicable or adaptable to international markets are exploring the best ways to enter those markets.","A recent example of our international efforts is the Risk Symposium, we held in London, in June. We were pleased with the quality of the attendees and the strong interest in our solutions from the insurance industry. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, our international efforts will reflect the mix of both organic growth and acquisitions where they make strategic and financial sense.","M&A remains high on our agenda and our team is actively evaluating opportunities, while we remain focused on our core principle of creating shareholder value through innovation, discipline and execution. We\u2019ve meaningful capacity for additional acquisitions that meet our strategic agenda, both through our significant free cash flow, as well as our borrowing capacity. We also have continued to repurchase our stock, a sign of confidence in our future.","We continue to work through the SEC approval process, in connection with our announced acquisition of EagleView Technology and still expect to close the acquisition in the third quarter of 2014, likely towards the end of September.","In the second quarter of 2014, we delivered good overall performance with total organic revenue growth of about 9% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of about 8%. EBITDA margin in the quarter was about 46%. We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders and we remain disciplined in our use of capital.","In the quarter we returned capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases of about $30 million. Our remaining authorization at the end of the quarter was about $346 million. We will continue to use our authorization consistent with our capital allocation strategy as we previously outlined.","And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.","Mark V. Anquillare","","Thanks, Scott, and good morning. In the second quarter, total revenue grew 8.5%. For the second quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 10.8% revenue growth. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in insurance. Our Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 14.2% in the second quarter. The increase was driven by strong growth in loss quantification and catastrophe modeling solutions.","Underwriting growth in the quarter was good and claims solutions also contributed. Overall revenue growth was driven by the increased adoption of existing and new solutions as well as a strong quarter for tax-free bonds, although even without that benefit, our Decision Analytics insurance growth was double digits. Because of the cat bond revenue, which is based upon market transaction, I would expect growth to moderate a bit in the coming quarters, but will be strong for the year.","In addition, we have seen the benefit of new contracts and adoption of new solutions in our repair cost estimating business. These began in 2013 and will come full cycle in the second half of this year.","In financial services, revenue growth of 11.6% in the quarter was in line with our expectations. Second quarter growth was below our first quarter growth rate due to larger than usual project revenue in the second quarter of 2013. However, overall this is a highly recurring revenue business which offers us a very good visibility. We are confident that the growth outlook at Argus remains strong.","This includes opportunities related to international expansion, additional penetration of existing customers, and partnering opportunities, in particular related to advertising effectiveness with traditional and new media companies. We remain confident that financial services will grow at least mid-teens in 2014.","In the healthcare vertical, revenue in the second quarter grew 6.6% led by growth in revenue and quality solutions. We are focused on the Medicare Advantage busy season, which will run through early 2015. We have much better visibility into our customer volumes for this year than we did last year at this time. We\u2019ve improved our operations in support of the business and we have achieved over 50% more records in the second quarter of 2014 than in the second quarter of 2013.","Pulling the work of the busy season forward and staffing ahead in this way is precisely where we thought we\u2019d be and exactly where we need to be in order to deliver the mid-teens growth for the full year 2014.","In the specialized markets category, revenue increased 0.8% in second quarter. So good growth in the quarter in environmental health and safety solutions and weather and climate analytics to the commercial market. Growth in government space was offset by the shift of (indiscernible) contract from development to maintenance mode.","Turning to Risk Assessment for the second quarter, we put revenue growth of 5% indicated the value to our long standing trend customers. Our industry standard insurance programs grew revenue 5% in the quarter, this reflects our 2014 invoices which were effective January 1.","In addition we saw our contribution to growth from newly adopted solutions such as predictive modeling, electronic reading content and worker\u2019s compensation solutions. We are putting a lot effort into our long standing solutions and building our culture continue our strong position into the future. ","Property-specific rating and underwriting information increased 4.8% in the quarter. This increase was from new sales including those resulting in higher committed volumes.","EBITDA from continuing operations for the second quarter increased 8% to $194.2 million and our EBITDA margin was 45.9%. The margins in Decision Analytics were 39.4% in second quarter 2014 versus 39.6% in the second quarter of 2013. After the dip in margin, the first quarter 2014 related to increased cost in our healthcare business as well as investments to support our innovation agenda. We are pleased to see the margin close to where we were last year in the second quarter.","Our preparation for the Verisk Health busy season has included earlier hiring to ensure appropriate staffing levels. So, this is a good result even with the front loading of these expenses. You will recall that as revenue picks up in healthcare business, some portion of these expenses were as well. These variable costs is something you may want to keep in mind, if you look DA margins for the rest of the year.","In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 56.3% versus 56.0% in the second quarter of 2013. Our margins were advanced in the quarter by revenue growth, good expense management and lower pension cost.","Our interest expense was down $2.2 million in the second quarter versus the respective period in 2013, due to lower debt balances as a result of repayments made in 2013. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate using our revolver and cash on hand, including the proceeds from the sale of Interthinx to fund the purchase of EagleView Technologies."," ","Our reported tax rate was 37.9% for the quarter. Adjusted net income increased 5.1% to $96.9 million in the quarter, adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.57 for the quarter, an increase of 7.5%. The average diluted share count was 169.5 million shares in the quarter. On June 30, 2014 our diluted share count was 169.5 million shares.","In the quarter, we purchased about 0.5 million shares for $30.4 million. At quarter end we had 346 million left under our authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to-date generating annualized IRRs of about 20%. For 2014, we continue to anticipate at a minimum buying shares to offset dilution.","Turning to our balance sheet as of June 30, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents were $419.4 million. Total debt both long-term and short-term was about $1.3 billion. Today our incremental debt capacity is about $1 million and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow.","Our debt-to-pro forma EBITDA from continuing operations as of June 30 was 1.7 times below our steady-state target. With the acquisition of EagleView Technology using in part cash on hand, interest paid or leverage will be about two times to close the transaction.","Free cash flow just for two items discussed below grew 4% compared to the prior period to $228.1 million. This represented over 60% of EBITDA from continuing operations in the first six months of 2014.","As a remainder, we\u2019ve defined free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures to facilitate comparability to the prior period we just did free cash flow for the timing of excess tax benefits from exercised stock options in the first quarter of 2013, and for the sale of our mortgage services business this year.","Cash provided by operating activities, as reported increased $40.1 million. This increase was the result of $20.6 million increase generated by improved profitability of the business, a $5 million decrease in interest paid due to lower debt balances, and a decrease of $46.2 million in taxes. This is partially offset by a $10 million use of cash for working capital, another balance sheet changes and other outflows of $21.2 million.","Our capital expenditure was 9 or 9% of revenue year-to-date in 2014. We continue to expect about $147 million in CapEx for the full year, a greater use of capitalized software related to new solutions or modestly raised capital intensity of our business when compared to historic levels. We aimed to grow free cash flow at or above the level of our EBITDA growth.","As you think about your models for the full year 2014, we expect flattish margins for the full year, excluding Interthinx. As we remain focused on our innovation agenda, we are maintaining our longer-term view of margins in the 45% to 47% range. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be about $57 million, fixed asset depreciation, amortization of about $85 million and an effective tax rate between 37% and 38%.","We aim to keep our share count flat through our share repurchase program. And at current debt levels, our quarterly interest expense is about $18 million. Based upon the strength of our cash flow generation and current debt to cash balances, we anticipate borrowing about $300 million less for the acquisition of EagleView, depending on the timing of close and other events.","We are expecting to incur $4 million to $5 million of higher legal and professional services fee related to the transaction, most of which will fall in the third quarter. After the close of EagleView transaction, we will update you.","Overall, we are pleased to report that our business is performing well. We have a nice mix of growth across multiple verticals, we are executing on our operational plans and we continue to invest with discipline for the future and we continue our strong organic growth.","I will turn it back to Eva for a comment before Q&A.","Eva F. Huston","Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. And given the large of analysts we have covered, we ask you to limit your questions to one and one follow-up, this will give more people an opportunity to ask questions. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays Capital","","So the first question is just around the cat bond business, I was wondering if you could help us understand the size of that business because clearly it\u2019s been a nice driver for the DA insurance for some time and also if you could maybe help understand, I think you\u2019ve pointed a little bit, but just the one-time impact from just the issuance levels I guess versus the subscription base that moved up?","Scott G. Stephenson","Sure, so let me first describe a little bit about the way we think of cap on some. Those are very big function inside the opportunity where there is a model that is used for any type of insurance link transaction. We believe that the science is very important there it\u2019s probably the pure sense of the quality of the solution and in a very significant majority of the coupons AIR has own that business, so unfortunately it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to predict, it kind of gets up and down year and year out generally though the trend in insurance-linked transaction in coupons has been growing over time. So we think that is positive trend broadly.","I think the best way to kind of describe, the impact is, it is not a material part of the cat remodeling business, but it becomes increasingly more important. The overall growth that I wanted to describe inside of Decision Analytics insurance as a whole even without that would have grown about 10%, an excessive 10% actually in the quarter.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. And then, maybe just around in the financial services piece, you referred to the opportunity in the advertising effectiveness with media companies. I was wondering if you could just help us or elaborate just a little bit more on what exactly that mean?","Scott G. Stephenson","This is Scott. Basically through the work that Argus does we have a very comprehensive view of spending patterns by individuals and households. And the world of those who are trying to promote to individuals and households is interested in understanding what the reaction is when there is some form of media campaign. It could be traditional media, it could be new media. Argus data are useful in understanding what the reaction is in terms of consumer spending patterns. That\u2019s the linkage.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Fair enough. I\u2019ll get back in the Q. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Tim\u00a0McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company L.L.C.","Thank you. First, I guess I want to follow-up on the catastrophe business a little bit. Besides obviously the bond, can you talk about what\u2019s driving the strength there? If you look at the biggest competitor there, they seem to be growing more like mid-single digits. And then, I guess can you touch on, I guess, maybe Touchstone 2.0. I know they\u2019re in the process of trying to roll out their own kind of new technology platform. Just competitively how do you think about that there?","Scott G. Stephenson","Tim, your second question is actually the answer to your first. A lot of the growth that\u2019s going on now is innovation around the software platform that\u2019s used for not only delivering the cat models, but actually interpreting the cat models into workflows. And this is the change in the cat modeling business. It used to be more about the basic model, which was essentially around a stochastic view of the probability of disasters and their impacts on damage and then the damage impact upon insurance outcomes. Those are the core models.","The software, which is really \u2013 and this business has become much more software intense, I would say over the last year or two. The software is basically about graving those models and helping our customers to interpret them into their own decisions, whether it\u2019s at the portfolio level or the individual risk level. And the market is responding very positively essentially to all of the things that I just described.","Our models are seen as being great distinct, very grounded and really good signs. And our software is industry leading at this point. So there\u2019s really been just kind of an across the board very strong reaction by the market. And when I say the market there are lot of different customers segments here, there is global reinsurers, there is insurers, there is reinsurance brokers and all of the segments are responding strongly and positively to what we do.","Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company L.L.C.","Does that mean that you\u2019re displacing the competitors there, because they don\u2019t have a new platform out there and are they grabbing new shares? And I guess associated with that do you, I guess if you\u2019re displacing the competitors, what is the risk as they were out their own technology platform that it all stalled some of the pace of growth here, I guess that you\u2019re seeing?","Scott G. Stephenson","We are really quite sure that we\u2019re taking share, but it\u2019s also the case that the size and scope of the relationships with our existing customers are also growing. So, both of those are contributing to our growth. And, yes, we expect that RMS will eventually come out with their own solution and this is a \u2013 this will be a perpetual journey for us in terms of always upgrading the value of our solution. That is not really anything different from where the business has been in the past.","Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company L.L.C.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson","Welcome.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna.","James E. Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP","I guess I will ask mine up front, but the \u2013 I just want to clarify Mark, with regard to expectations that they would imply that this second half healthcare growth is either in excess of 20% and also at the same time that you\u2019d said you\u2019re expecting team\u2019s growth for Financial Services.","Mark V. Anquillare","So your math is correct? Correct, yes we are expecting both of those. We are doing the right things with regard to healthcare and position to deliver. And at the same time I just want to emphasize that how strong a business the Argus business is, and I think we feel that we\u2019re making great progress along lot of fronts.","James E. Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP","Great, I appreciate the clarification. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Follow up first on the healthcare outlook, I think it sounded like part of what gives you confidence is that you are better prepared for the busy season and maybe you\u2019re going to be pulling some revenue forward. Is that the primary sector that gives you the confidence and the re-acceleration in healthcare growth? And asking that from the standpoint that if there is kind of this one-time catch up benefit is the longer term outlook for that business still similarly kind of mid-teens plus.","Scott G. Stephenson","Let me, let me take your question kind of in the order they were placed. Our confidence about the back half of the year is really a product of two things; one is, we have had the benefit now of the first two quarters and the way that we operated to business and Mark referenced the fact that in the second quarter the quarter we just completed, we retrieved more than 50% of more records than we did in the prior period, second quarter 2013 and so, we have a strong sense of the arc of the volume of the business based upon the fact that we\u2019ve already moved a good number of transactions into the pipeline and as I think most of you know we moved from retrieving the records, coding the records on to the answer that our customers\u2019 needs by way of risk adjustment.","So we have observed what we \u2013 how we actually operated in the first two quarters that, that\u2019s one part of our confidence and the other is we know where we are with the costumers in terms of what they have access to in terms of volumes to the full year 2014.","With respect to the longer term and of course our business is made up of many different things we serve the Medicare Advantage space, we serve commercial payers, we have a variety solutions in our view of all those systems that were still a relatively small player in the healthcare data analytics space and essentially our view on that has not changed.","Jeffrey P. Meuler \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay, and then there is talk at the analyst day about Telematics, there was talk in this call about expanding internationally. I believe there was a Telematics international acquisition that got transacted in the quarter. Can you just maybe recap us on what exactly you are looking for in the Telematics space and whether it\u2019s likely to be a build or buy?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes, so we did announce an acquisition it wasn\u2019t in this quarter was actually a while ago, and it is a very, very small acquisition what we acquired was really technology, but our view on Telematics overall is, it is likely that with time our customers are going to be interested in how they rate auto insurance policies and that at some point which is very difficult to determine actually very difficult to predict, data derived via telemetry from vehicles, it can probably play some role in all of that.","And our first and most important goal here is to remind relevant in terms of auto policies get priced. And so we feel the need to be very familiar with the kind of data that are coming off of the installed devices that you kind of see today, the after-market devices and the mining of data from the OBD ports on the vehicles and but also \u2013 actually there is more interest now in seeing whether we can use our smartphones to also communicate some of the dynamics of the operation of the vehicle. So we\u2019re really interested in it, because we have a relatively large business today in the mechanics of rating a personal auto policy, net commercial auto policy.","And we see Telematics first and foremost as our ability to stay current with respect to what\u2019s happening there. So some of what we do in Telematics will express itself as sort of new factors, which are incorporated into our rating programs and won\u2019t necessarily emerge as separate revenue line items. But it\u2019s also the case that we think that as we continue to do work in the Telematics space, we\u2019re open to also finding ways to license some of the methodology to others that are also interested in mining telemetry data.","Jeffrey P. Meuler \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","","Okay. Thank you.","Mark V. Anquillare","","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question is going to come from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","","Hi, gentlemen. Mark, I wanted to ask you about some of the events hiring in Verisk Health \u2013 it\u2019s obviously \u2013 is it optimistic side about revenues, I want to talk to you about margins. My question is, has Verisk Health created better efficiencies going into this busy season, because I\u2019m still remembering from last busy season which was fourth quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014, that it was kind of a headcount intensive process for Verisk\u2019s part. I was wondering, as we go into this busy season, while always will require additional heads, will it be efficient?","Mark V. Anquillare","","So, thank you, Andrew. It\u2019s a good question and let me just describe a little bit about the plan that we have and how we\u2019ll roll this out. Because of the \u2013 a little bit kind of seasonal nature of the business, I think \u2013 we are doing right now is we\u2019re getting enough people in place to satisfy what I\u2019ll call the busy season which is the July through to typically into January sometimes in February, Medicare Advantage sweeps.","What we\u2019ve also done is we kind of work with some partners to handle overflow business. We have that both onshore and offshore to the extent that we need. And the expectation is because, a, we are hired and ramped up significantly more than last year. So that\u2019s why I referenced the additional costs in the quarter that we probably didn\u2019t see in the past. We should be better ready, better equipped to provide: a, higher quality service; b, the productivity should be there.","It is difficult sometimes to try to manage all these new hires and that kind of self staffing somebody who we have had some tenure with will be better equipped to be able to be efficient, be more productive. We\u2019ve also worked \u2013 we talk about a lot of effectiveness in efficiency, we\u2019ve also worked on internal processes, we have metrics, we have work flow solutions all of those should contribute to higher quality and more effective process in the latter half of the season but the latter half of what will be 2014.","That's what gives us some of the confidence as we talk about going forward. A lot of these volumes is about interacting with customers, making sure we know how they're going to give to us, when they\u2019re going to give it to us, so we can deliver on our promises and deliver kind of results for them.","Andrew C. Steinerman \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","And so there should be some operating leverage as the revenue grows picks up right.","Scott G. Stephenson","We clearly incurred some possible in the fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year I mean in 2014 to handle the volumes and to satisfy customers. Those are kind of excess costs we would not expect to continue, correct.","Andrew C. Steinerman \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to clarify and understand a little better in the Healthcare business. I think the reference was to having collected more than 50%, more volume or increased volume versus the first half of last year. I'm just curious as to how that ultimately translates into revenue. I know there have been some pricing incentives to drive volume. You clearly looking for an acceleration in that business in the back half, but can you just describe the dynamic between record volume and maybe price per and how that informs the revenue growth in the business?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes. Let me, you had a couple questions in there. So just first of all, to clarify the factual statement. What we were communicating is that the number of records that we retrieved in the second quarter of 2014 was more than 50% greater than the number of records we retrieved in the second quarter 2013.","Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, so q-over-q.","Scott G. Stephenson","Q-over-q.","Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Okay.","Scott G. Stephenson","And the way that we get, the way that we get paid is we actually have to work through not only the retrieval of the record, but actually through the coding of the contents which is really onto the interpretation of the content and deliver all of that to the customer. That is the point at which we get paid.","And so in a sense, you can see what we did in second quarter of 2014 and the growth relative to 2013 is essentially part of the priming of the pump where we will then sort of work through the completion of each of these units as the second half of the year moves that and that\u2019s when we will recognize the revenue. You should not understand a relationship overall between increasing volumes and price point. Last year we referenced the fact that there was one case in particular, where we made that tradeoff, but that\u2019s not fundamentally an explanation for why our volumes are growing.","Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","","Okay. So, revenue, all else being equal in that business should more or less track volume growth? Is that the right way to think about it?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes.","Mark V. Anquillare","","Just one quick clarification for you. Exactly what Scott said, yes, but it\u2019s also an illustration that we\u2019d accelerate the program and we\u2019re trying to move some of these work volumes forward too. So I\u2019d to describe to you a combination.","Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So timing in the year versus last year as well?","Mark V. Anquillare","That\u2019s well, as volumes. Correct.","Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, if you could just elaborate, Mark, a little bit on the nature of the project revenue at Argus. Is that business that comes on and off in some sort of predictable way? In on other words, could there be another quarter in the future where you\u2019d see a big jump in growth for these projects or is it much more episodic than that?","Mark V. Anquillare","So a very large percentage of the Argus business is long-term contracts. We recognize it greatly over the year, very high visibility, very high rate of recurring revenue. Around those benchmark studies the beauty of the Argus business is they get very deep and very close to the customers who then need some special projects done.","In many cases that work or that project work tends to flow a little bit more heavily into the fourth quarter. It represents a smallish fraction, between 10% to 20% of the business and it\u2019s pretty regular, but there is some timing elements as to when. And there was a pretty major project that took place in third quarter of 2013.","I would tell you that it wasn\u2019t anything we would call out because it is just kind of a part of the business. It happens all the time. So I would tell you we are not concerned by anything, but you see kind of slower growth here in the second quarter around the Argus business. I think we feel good about where we\u2019re going to be.","Scott G. Stephenson","One of the nice things going on at Argus is that we\u2019re continuing to find a home in non-domestic markets for our method, which is a real source of encouragement for us.","Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. So that business could be a little bit volatile quarter-to-quarters is what you\u2019re saying?","Mark V. Anquillare","Just on this small fraction revenue, we typically do not view it as all that volatile and I respect the comment.","Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","So, a question for you on EagleView the \u2013 I wanted to \u2013 to check and see if the company was still on the same trajectory as what we had talked about, early on the year when it has first been announced, and we\u2019ve been looking for revenue about $140 million in 2014 EBITDA running about $45 million, and then growing I\u2019d say, 10% to 2015 to about $154 million in revenue with $5 million to $7 million in cost synergies getting to around $54 million in EBITDA. And I want to see if those \u2013 if the company was still on that trajectory.","Mark V.

Anquillare","Not really, I mean we \u2013 there is one \u2013 there is one company that is \u2013 is very large and it\u2019s very interested in coming in and the building of the contributory data set is this is how it works, it\u2019s just kind of three yards and a cloud of dust, but every still often you sort of breakthrough and so we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re hopeful that the one that I\u2019m referencing here, where we actually have \u2013 contract papers in their hands will haven\u2019t sooner, rather than later.","William A. Warmington \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Well, thank you very much.","Mark V. Anquillare","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery.","Joseph D. Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","","Hi, I was wondering could you just tell us how depended your healthcare business is on macro factors like the amount of MA enrollment and the reimbursement in the Medicare Advantage Group, Medicare Advantage in general. Like how should we think about that in relation to \u2013 the trajectory of that business in any given year?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yeah, there is \u2013 there is definitely a relationship, I think your word dependent is a little bit strong because as is true of almost everything that we do in healthcare, part of our opportunity is defined by the fact that we are relative newcomer and so, we haven\u2019t really become the category leader in, I would say, almost anything that we do. And so, part of our opportunity is based upon taking our position inside of these markets.","But, yes, one of the confidence points for us on Medicare Advantage, the part of our business which faces Medicare Advantage is that on balance we think that the long-term trends are good. If you just look at demography in the United States and you look at the continued relative popularity of Medicare Advantage, we think those are positive factors as it relates to the long-term for our healthcare business.","Joseph D. Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And what percentage of healthcare now is Medicare Advantage or the work you do there? And then just adjacent to that. You said your visibility has improved. Can we assume that visibility in that business will always pickup, maybe here going forward? I actually think about that in general.","Scott G. Stephenson","So we put out in the past that our Medicare Advantage business is more than 50% our total mix of business in the healthcare space today.","Joseph D. Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","And then, just on the visibility side of things. Should we always expect that midyear it will dramatically increase? I mean just from a seasonal pattern, how should we think about that?","Scott G. Stephenson","There definitely is seasonality, particularly as it relates to the Medicare Advantage business. And something that we put out in the past is that overall our total healthcare business is about 40% in the first half, 60% in the second half as a rough general guideline.","Without question our visibility with respect to the part of the business that is seasonal increases as we move through the year. But part of what we\u2019ve been trying to stress in this call is that because of the substantial ramp in the overall volumes we have in the part of our business which is transactional, especially the Medicare Advantage business, we have been very diligent in the first of half of 2014 in trying to tune operations, anticipate the second half surge, if I can call it that, and to observe on where we need to be.","So, yes, there is more visibility, but the other part of the equation is preparedness and our team \u2013 I\u2019m very proud of our team. They\u2019ve worked very hard to get prepared for, to deliver against the successful selling that they\u2019ve been doing. And so, we feel good.","Joseph D. Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hello. This is Anj Singh dialing-in for Hamza Mazari. I\u2019m wondering if we can get an update on your joint demand planning discussions with your healthcare customers and what progress you might have made their during the quarter?","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve been reporting on throughout here, I mean our ability to as we mentioned a few minutes ago, the ability to retrieve over 50% more volumes in the same time prior period is directly a function of the coordinating that we have been doing with our customers, as well as our strong sense what the volumes will be in the second half, and so that\u2019s all the product of that of the demand planning, I was actually speaking with the head of our healthcare unit yesterday, and she was in touch with one of our important customer, they\u2019re all important to us.","But one of our large customers and it was just more of the same dialog that we're in with our customers in terms of where they're at, what they need. Believe me, there are a lot of operational metrics that get shared back and forth on a very consistent basis and it is that tied in quality us to them and then to us that really characterizes the way we're going about this business.","Anjaneya Singh \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it, and then as we look at your international growth initiative, I\u2019m wondering what are the milestones we should be looking for and as we think about M&A internationally, are there verticals that you prefer to grow organically versus an equivalent basis or will you just be opportunistic and pursue whichever strategy makes more sense?","Scott G. Stephenson","It\u2019s definitely, our M&A agenda is definitely not characterized primarily by opportunism, we have got very hard about which verticals we are in, and our first preference always would be to build out from the verticals that we\u2019ve already established, and so the reference earlier the international market is that\u2019s exactly what that\u2019s about, it\u2019s trying to find ways to take our existing capabilities and as they can relevant in other markets.","It\u2019s just a comment which I know many of you have heard us say before, but I think our methods if you think of it as the algorithms and the methods by which we operate the algorithms, I think they're completely applicable by and large in other markets. The issue is that other economy is don\u2019t have the same tradition of data aggregation that we have in the United States.","And so, a lot of what actually governs the rate at which we can move out as our ability to begin to cause data sets to flow. We're very open to using our M&A dollars in international markets, but I think you're putting two things together that kind of don't go together in our minds. We will use M&A dollars for international expansion and that\u2019s definitely a part of our thinking, that doesn\u2019t necessarily imply that we were moving into new verticals.","I think that it\u2019s our view, generally would be that by and large the set of verticals we are serving is a very adequate playing field for us. There are \u2013 there is I don\u2019t want to say too much about it, but there are, there is one vertical which is sort of adjacent to the ones we already in and there may be a linkage there at some point I really wouldn\u2019t want to disclose too much that lower.","Thinking that right at the moment, but because I would \u2013 I am mentioning that because I wouldn\u2019t want, anybody to be surprised, if it were the case in the future that we did, open up another vertical, but we \u2013 for a long time now we said that we are not looking to sort of add verticals without constrain, we are very thoughtful about what verticals we are in and I think we have a good set of verticals.","Anjaneya Singh \u2013 Credit Suisse","Very helpful. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Danny Caliendo with Morgan Stanley","Danny Caliendo \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question, I want to delve into expenses a little bit, they didn\u2019t jump as much quarter-over-quarter this year, as they have in the past especially on the SG&A line, and looking at the Q, and there is some of the salaries actually went down in the quarter there?","So, maybe if you can just give a little color on your expense control on SG&A? Is it something why may be the bonus is very low, but lower, what is there anything else going on there or maybe your down facto the sales force and focusing more on kind of improving the operational efficiency, let me try to color on the expense curve.","Scott G. Stephenson","Sure, I think there s I\u2019ll let Mark, answer that but I\u2019ll just say there\u2019s been absolutely no layoffs, we are on the expense then a number of parts of our business, so that\u2019s sort of the furthest thing from the reality of our business. But Mark do you want to take on this SG&A account.","Mark V. Anquillare","Sure, I think there is couple of things that we continue to do as we tried to fine tune all of our competition plant and in April we give out our Equity words, so one of the things typically affects is obviously you have an increase in equity that that will make the normal increase, I think what you will also find out is, in our program if your age 62 or alter you what make the best and I think we have fewer people in that bracket, or in that kind of category for 2014.","So I don\u2019t think we have that accelerated best in accelerated best that, would have historically taken place in the April timeframe so that may contribute a little bit to the SG&A item that you referred to. The only other thing that, does come to mind is we think about overall the compensation plans, I think we at Verisk probably have been a little bit more focused in 2014 on variable comp that would be in the form of our short-term cash programs as well as long-term equity programs and probably had a little bit less in the form of salary increases. So if you\u2019re repositioning, although, the overall comp increases were at least as good as in the past, but the way we went about it is probably slightly different this year.","Danny Caliendo \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","One more on the CapEx. Historically you were at the low 5%. Now you\u2019re kind of moving more towards this 9% of revenues number and you mentioned that you were spending more on capitalizing software.","Scott G. Stephenson","Right.","Danny Caliendo \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Is there anything one-time in this number or is this just for the next two years or is this 9% number really where you guys are going to be over the next few years? Maybe you\u2019re churning more into a software company than you were in the past or how should we think about the CapEx over time?","Scott G. Stephenson","So we don\u2019t think of 9% as the benchmark. We expect that number to come down as we move into 2015 and beyond. But it is also true that in general relative to, let\u2019s say, five years ago, just to pick a reference point, the software intensity of the business have gone up. I referenced, for example, earlier Touchstone, which is a very major movement inside of the whole cat modeling world and that\u2019s just a category of spending, which is tended to be much lower in the past.","I would also say that because of the desire to bring out these solutions in general across many of our businesses, we find are still spending somewhat more on the internal development of solutions, which we capitalized. There have been a couple of things, which I think have been a little bit more one-time. We\u2019ve basically been consolidating down to data centers and all of that, has required some special attention at the moment in time. And we built a major new facility now in Salt Lake City. In that we\u2019re cycling through that in 2014.","So, some of those things are going to kind of naturally come down any way. And then, I think as our businesses scale, I think we\u2019ll naturally find that that ratio moderates as well. So 9% is not the benchmark, but it is also the case actually that our business. If you want to be solutions oriented and if you want to be growth oriented, as we do, I think a natural implication is that you become somewhat more capital intense and we have.","Danny Caliendo \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, lastly, just a quick one. Going back to the insurance, you mentioned that the transactional revenue and you kind of indicated that the cat modeling were the big part of that, which you result in this particular quarter. I think you said something that would have been 11% without the cat impact. Number one, is that right? And then number two, just so we can kind of be aware of this in future quarters. With this cat transactional revenue, is it cat as the number of deals, maybe the face value on the deals or maybe the number of terms looking at the deals? Maybe a little color on how to think about predicting when a particular quarter might have higher or lower cat.","Scott G. Stephenson","","Yes, that\u2019s a little \u2013 your question sort of ended in sort of a funny place, because prediction is a little bit difficult. And I know you are using shorthand when you\u2019re saying cat, but just to remind you it\u2019s cat bonds. And so, its investors are anticipating that there is something in the market that would allow them to make a return based upon \u2013 in essence betting on the frequency and the depth of catastrophe activity, but we\u2019re talking about the investing in the bonds.","And the bond volumes tend to be a functional of a couple of things. One is, probably some very general sense of the intensity of catastrophe activity in the economy globally, but also a sense of different ways that you can lay off catastrophe risks. So how active is the reinsurance market with respect to ensuring against cat risk et cetera. So there\u2019s a number of factors that are actually in there. The market over time has tended to grow, but it also has tended to cycle around a little bit. Mark, I don\u2019t really have a predictive metric in mind. I don\u2019t know if you do.","Mark V. Anquillare","","No. I just will reiterate what I said, Danny. The growth in DA insurance is greater than 10% excluding the cat bonds and the way those cat bonds are priced to be exact. It\u2019s about the size of the deal and obviously that the number of deals that happen.","Danny Caliendo \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess my question was more about how the revenue hit, not necessarily the size of the cat bond market, but how did revenue actually hit your insurance plan? So I guess your answer to that is that if we\u2019re looking on cat bond issuance in a particular quarter, we would want to focus on the number of deals and the size of deals and then it could be taken by 3% impact to growth into this year versus the last quarter.","Eva F. Huston","Hey, Danny, it\u2019s Eva. Thank you very much. I think we got four questions in the set. So we\u2019re going to move on.","Danny Caliendo \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks.","Eva F. Huston","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks for the confidence around healthcare and talking about the increase you pulled for. It do sounds like it\u2019s more than 50% of your business. Can you just talk about the remaining parts of your business in healthcare, the kind of visibility you have there? And how you feel about that going to the third quarter? Anything you can give us to kind of help us feel more confident in that backend growth rate would be helpful. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson","","So I think most folks know that \u2013 so as we\u2019ve talking about Medicare Advantage that\u2019s really about our RQID division. We have two others. One is enterprise analytics and the other is payment accuracy. Payment accuracy is about diligence and claims to get fraud, waste, and abuse out of them and enterprise analytics is essentially about risk adjusting and including applications of risk adjusting into categories like population health management.","So those other businesses are very important in the mix of what it is that we do. And we\u2019re looking for really growth across the board in the business. I would say that kind of recently payment accuracy has had some nice win in the sales in terms of growth. Payment accuracy tends to have more of a transactional nature to it. Essentially our revenue is related to the amount of money that we thrift for our customers. Enterprise analytics tends to be very subscription oriented.","Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll give the same. But are those divisions with any healthcare growing at sort of a divisional average in the second quarter or was all the growth driven by Medicare Advantage?","Scott G. Stephenson","So I\u2019m not going to get into specifics, but they\u2019re growing. Yes.","Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great. Obviously those are a little more transactional basis. Is Analytics more subscription?","Mark V. Anquillare","Yes, that\u2019s what I said.","Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.","","Thanks so much. Just wanted to go back to the EBC transaction. I think initially you had expected the deal to close in July than mid-Q3 now. It\u2019s the end of 3Q. Are there any specific reasons for the delay?","Scott G. Stephenson","It\u2019s the government\u2019s process. I mean, we\u2019re answering questions and we respect our government and they\u2019re going to run their process the way they\u2019re going to run it.","Jeffrey M. Silber \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.","Okay. And it\u2019s just a follow-up. Just going back to some, I guess the front loading cost in Verisk Health, would that been in the cost of services line as opposed to the SG&A line?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes.","Jeffrey M. Silber \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Andre Benjamin \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","","Hi. Good morning. First, I want to know understanding that a lot of the business is subscription base. I was wondering if you\u2019re seeing any changes to demand trends in Argus\u2019 services from a push by some of the banks to get more aggressive lending to some less optimal or \u201csubprime lenders\u201d as the recovery matures.","Scott G. Stephenson","No, I don\u2019t see that as a factor.","Andre Benjamin \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Okay and on the healthcare side I am wondering in terms of how us think about the size of the addressable market and growth and I know these things don\u2019t change that much quarter-to-quarter, but if you have any thoughts on how those sides in the market is relative to the $4 billion that you discussed at the Analyst Day, how the three markets are growing, and are there any key capabilities that come up in your conversation with clients that you think will help you better attack those buckets relative to what you are capable of today.","Mark V. Anquillare","Well, yeah so our view of the opportunity really have not change as kind of implied in your question. Healthcare continues to be a very large part of the American economy and in general, it is an environment that is characterized by I would say an increasing interest in the use of data analytics to make decisions. Supported in, I would say in a background kind of a way by our government\u2019s seeming interest in pulling more data analytics and to the part of the cost tax of government is responsible for and by making data sets from CMS a little bit more available.","So, that kind of the overall sense of the market is that it remains as the opportunists as it has one of the big sort of issues on the horizon is, will the providers become more risk bearing and there is a lot more talk about that and then there is actually progress to-date if not that there has been none and there are more accountable care organizations than they are used to be, but when you look at the fraction of the risk which has been warned by the providers it still relatively low.","Another movement in the space that you got the rise of the exchanges there are the public exchangers there are also the private exchanges and we\u2019ve actually had some nice progress in terms of becoming the analytic inside of some of the exchangers. We actually see the exchanges as another customer segment in the same way that commercial payers or a customer segment in the way that state medicates our customer segment etc.","So you have those kinds of developments in the market. But the overall story is the effective reform is to have more people be insured and since the majority of our business is with insurers today on balance that is a relatively positive trend.","Andre Benjamin \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Thanks.","Eva F. Huston","Operator, last question please.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of David\u00a0Togut with Evercore.","David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners","Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a quick final question if I would, Scott and Mark. I\u2019m trying to piece together your comments, Mark, that you saw over 50% growth and records retrieved in the RQI business, and that you\u2019re expecting 20% plus growth in healthcare in the back half. Can you sort of correlate records retrieved with revenue growth? It doesn\u2019t really seem to be one-to-one. Is there is a ratio we should be thinking of?","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, one thing you should bear in mind. I know Mark is going to jump in at a slightly more technical level, but bear in mind that the record retrieval that we\u2019re talking about relates to only part of our business. So that characterization of a much greater rate of record retrieval is very accurate and augurs for growth in the third and the fourth quarter, but you can\u2019t do it one-for-one in terms of the growth of our overall healthcare business because those records and that retrieval relates to the part of our business, which is Medicare Advantage, which is we said is greater than 50%, but it\u2019s well shy of 100% of our whole mix. So, you can\u2019t complete those two.","Mark V. Anquillare","And, David, I\u2019ll just kind of reiterate what I was trying to describe earlier in terms of follow-on. I think we feel good about the increased volumes. I think it\u2019s indicative of a combination of: a, our customers and working with our customers to get things sooner and also it\u2019s partially indicative of the fact that we do had greater volumes apples-to-apples compared to last year. So, I can\u2019t tell you there is a direct correlation to revenue there, but it\u2019s certainly a partial correlation. And I think it\u2019s a set of good example set aside of several things that we\u2019re doing to make sure that we deliver on the results in the second half.","David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners","Is Medicare Advantage all of the RQI business?","Mark V. Anquillare","Not all of it, but most of it.","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes, yes.","David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners","So in other words the RQI business should growth well in excess of 20% in the back half?","Scott G. Stephenson","Not sure we said that, David.","David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay. That\u2019s just my interpretation. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.","Operator","At this time there are no further questions. [Presenters] (ph), do you have any closing remarks?","Scott G.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Ms. Eva Huston, you may begin.","Eva F. Huston","Great, thank you, [Tequila], and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2012 financial results.","With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Anquillare, our CFO. Following some comments by Frank, Scott, and Mark, highlighting the key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we\u2019ll open the call up for your questions.","The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investor section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be posted on our website and available by dial-in as well for 30 days until June 2, 2012.","And finally, as set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Frank Coyne.","Frank J. Coyne","Thank you, Eva, and good morning. In first quarter 2012, we delivered good performance of almost 11% revenue growth, 17.5% diluted adjusted EPS growth, and strong free cash flow growth. We continued strong performance in our businesses, and we are seeing benefits from our 2012 invoices and the improving performance of our P&C insurance customers.","In 2011, P&C industry premiums grew 3.6% versus 1.5% percent in 2010. While the 2011 industry premiums don\u2019t figure into our invoices until 2013, we are happy our customers are doing better because that does represent new opportunities for us.","In the first quarter, our risk assessment revenue grew 5.2%, after adjusting for the impact of a transfer of some revenue to Decision Analytics, reflecting the continued value we are delivering to our customers. In Decision Analytics, we grew revenue almost 17%.","And our Insurance Solutions and Decision Analytics grew about 11%. Our healthcare solutions continued on the growth trajectory we saw in the last half of 2011, growing revenue over 30% organically in the quarter. And we also were pleased to have the MediConnect team join and look forward to their contributions in the future.","In mortgage, we continue to see challenges in the market and our revenue declined apples-to-apples. But I would note that we grew our underwriting solutions at a faster pace than the origination market grew.","Overall, our consolidated organic revenue growth was 7.7%, consistent with the expectations we discussed with you last year, as mortgage continues to weigh on growth. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth was 9%. We continue to have conviction around our margin and overall profitability.","Our EBITDA margin was 45.9% in the quarter, and diluted adjusted EPS growth of 17.5% was along very strong. We remain disciplined about our use of capital and focused on delivering shareholder returns. We were pleased to acquire MediConnect this quarter and put about $350 million of that capital to work to generate returns.","We also bought $39 million of shares in the quarter as we manage our buyback as part of our broader capital allocation plan, including acquisitions. We remain consistent in our approach to balancing uses of capital. As I look towards the remainder of 2012, I am excited about all the verticals we face and the teams we have in place to deliver growth from our markets.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott to talk about our progress against some of our operational goals.","Scott G. Stephenson","Thank you, Frank. We have a number of things on our plate that we believe set us up for future growth, both from a sales and technology perspective.","First on sales, we continue to ensure that we have the best teams facing our customers, and we have made some new hires in that area. We are also ensuring that our holistic solution sets are being sold to decision makers. One of the powerful elements of our organization is solutions that can interoperate. Our competitors typically do not have this advantage. For example, our Verisk Insurance Solutions underwriting team has been in operation for a full quarter now, and we are getting good feedback from customers on this approach.","On the technology side, we\u2019ve recognized the importance of technology and are continuing to invest behind our platforms, in particular, to deliver better solutions to our customers.","We\u2019ve talked earlier about the unified healthcare platform, and we are on track for that to be completed in 2013, with a series of interim deliverables. As we mentioned when we talked to you about the MediConnect transaction, that acquisition does not impact this initiative, and we have other investments including our next generation platform for catastrophe models, which many of you saw as a part of our Investor Day.","And then we have host of new claims tools including mobile tools, which can be used to settle claims via smartphones and tablets, while standing with the customer next to their damaged property, as well as Aerial Sketch, which can be used to calculate the cost of repairing a roof without the timer hazard associated with having to climb onto the roof.","We remain focused on data and analytics, and recognize that the way they are consumed is tied to evolving technology. The power of marrying our long history of data with forward looking analytics by our customer friendly technology is unparallel.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark to talk about our corporate financial results.","Mark V. Anquillare","Thank you, Scott. As Frank noted, in the first quarter, we delivered 10.7% total revenue growth and 7.7% organic revenue growth. And excluding our historical mortgage business, organic growth for the new quarter was 9%.","For the first quarter, our Decision Analytics segments revenue continue to lead with 16.9% revenue growth, of which 9.6% was organic and excludes the 2011 acquisitions of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners, as well as the transferred revenue.","I want to remind you that beginning 2012, we have transferred revenue related to mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment\u2019s property-specific revenue category into Decision Analytics\u2019 mortgage revenue category to reflect a management reporting change.","The appraisal tools related to insurance customers will remain in the property-specific underwriting category in Risk Assessment. Because the amount is small, $2.9 million of revenue in the quarter, we have not restated historical numbers, but we\u2019ll provide you with an apples-to-apples comparison. As a final note, we closed the MediConnect deal on March 30, so second quarter 2012 will be the first time its revenue and EBITDA will report in our financial results.","Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category revenue grew 10.5% in the quarter, all organic. We continue to benefit from the growth in our loss quantification claim tools, with double-digit growth from customers and new solutions. Even after a year of almost 30% growth in 2011, catastrophe modeling solutions continued good growth, due to new customers and expanded use of our models, including out catastrophe bond projects in area in which our market share remains very strong.","Our insurance fraud claims solutions also continued good growth in the quarter, driven by 2012 invoices for certain solutions. The revenue in mortgage and financial services grew 4.8% as reported in the first quarter and declined 4.1% after adjusting for the transfer of the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment into this revenue category.","Underwriting tools grew in the quarter ahead of the approximate 5% growth in the origination market. The revenue from forensic solutions declined in the quarter, as new customers and increased usage by existing customers were not sufficient to offset a large customer whose volumes have been trending down in 2011.","Our outlook for 2012 from mortgage remains negative, as the current market makes it difficult to predict near term trends for the majority of our solutions, but we have confidence in the long-term value.","Healthcare continues strong growth 95% in the first quarter and 32.9% organic. Our total growth continues to benefit from the addition of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners in 2012 and starting second quarter 2012 will benefit from the addition of MediConnect.","Just a reminder for those of you looking at sequential revenue dollars first and second quarters are seasonally lower revenue and margin quarters for our HRP businesses and MediConnect followed a similar seasonal pattern. We are 30 days into our ownership MediConnect and excited about the prospects for the business.","Our specialized markets revenue grew 9.4% in the quarter from both our supply chain solutions as well as our weather analytics, both of these areas are delivering solid growth today, and we are optimistic about the opportunities to broaden their reach. Examples included repurposing our weather analytics into the insurance market, and building on our capabilities of 3E in conjunction with both internal and external tools to broaden our supply chain offerings.","Turning to risk assessment, we reported revenue of 3.1% in the quarter and 5.2% after adjusting for the impact of the transfer. Our industry-standard programs grew 6.8% in the quarter reflecting our 2012 invoices in good growth from our premium leakage solutions. As you know, we put up new invoices in December, and begin recognizing the new level of the revenue on January 1, and throughout the year.","I will note that we had about $1 million of revenue in the quarter related to the license fee which is non-recurring. Our property specific revenue as reported declined 5.6%, but excluding the transfer grew 2.8%, as new sales and higher volumes from certain customers offset (inaudible). ","Our 2011 industry premium will not affect our invoices until 2013, as Frank noted, it is nice to see the commercial premiums for 2011 almost 4.4% to the positive versus the decline of 1.6% in 2010.","EBITDA for the first quarter was $159.2 million, as outlined in table three of our press release, the increase 14.5% for the quarter and our EBITDA margins was 45.9%, an increase versus the 44.4% in first quarter of 2011, and 45% in fourth quarter of 2011, it\u2019s nice to see the scale in the margins. Please remember, as you model that our invoice increases and risk assessment comes through on January 1.","But our annual salary increases come through in April. So annual salary increases will be effective in the second quarter, and the increased corporate expenses by about $3.3 million per quarter beginning in the second quarter. Additionally, we expect incremental cost of about $4.7 million in second quarter related to our April 2012 equity loss, primarily resulting from an accelerated vesting upon obtainment of eligible retirement age by some employees.","About 70% or 75% of this option impact will be seen in this assessment. Finally, we do not anticipate much impact in 2012 margins resulting from the MediConnect acquisition, however because of the seasonality of its revenue MediConnect margins in second quarter are lower than the full year margins and we would expect to see an impact when the revenue and EBITDA are first reported in next quarter. In the quarter, our risk assessment margins were 55.1%versus 52.8% in first quarter 2011.","We benefited by about 1.4% on the margins due to the lower pension costs, on February 29, we froze our pension plan and in early April funded $73 million, bringing it closer to fully funded which will limit the growth in that expense going forward.","Our business continues to show scalable profitability, while we continue to invest in developing new solutions. The margin in Decision Analytics was 39.3% in the first quarter 2012 versus 37.7% in first quarter 2011, and 40.7% in fourth quarter of 2011.","Improvement in the underlying margins of several of our businesses including healthcare, as they scaled the revenue benefited us in the quarter partially offset by the adverse impact from the mortgage business. We also capitalized a few more dollars in this quarter, some relating to the technology initiatives that Scott had mentioned.","Our interest expense was up $1.6 million versus fourth quarter 2011, as the increased interest expense associated with our bond offering in December was fully reflected in the first quarter. We carried excess cash in most of the quarter from the bond offering and our free cash flow. But use them to fund part the MediConnect transaction bringing our cash balance closer to normal levels at $115 million at quarter end.","We ended first quarter with total debt of $1.2 billion, including $125 million drawn for the MediConnect acquisition, and a pro forma debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.9% times.","In early April, we drew an additional $75 million for our pension funding leaving us at about our long-term target capital structure of two times debt-to-EBITDA on a pro forma basis. Our reported effective tax rate is 39.4% for the quarter. For 2012, we are expecting rate in line with our historical rate of approximately 40%.","Coming down to the net income line, we\u2019re focused on adjusted net income and non-GAAP measure, which we defined in the current period as net income plus acquisition related amortization expense less the income tax effect on that amortization.","Our adjusted net income increased 12.4% to $79.8 million for the quarter, and adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.47, an increase of 17.5%. The average diluted share count was $171.4 million in the quarter, and on March 31, 2012 our diluted share count was $171.9 million shares.","In the quarter, we purchased about 900,000 shares for approximately $39 million. At quarter end, we had about $216 million left under our authorization. Our approach to share repurchase remained focused on limiting dilution and only going forward, when we believe we can purchase, we can deliver appropriate IRRs and not crowd out our acquisitions. Our share repurchase program has been successful to-date, generating annualized IRRs of over 25%.","Turning to the balance sheet; as of March 31, our cash and cash equivalents were about $115 million; total debt, both short-term and long-term totaled just north of $1.2 billion on March 31, reflecting the debt borrowed to fund the MediConnect closing on March 30, and was about $1.3 million after our pension funding in early April.","Post MediConnect and pension funding, our debt capacity is about $600 will continue to grow free cash flow. As we have stated before, we are willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of two time debt-to-EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities, particularly on the acquisition front. With that debt capacity available, we continue to look for the right opportunities.","Free cash flow in first quarter 2012, which we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $173.7 million, an increase of $46.8 million or 36.9% first quarter of 2011.","Free cash flow grew faster than EBITDA bolstered by the timing of cash interest payments on our bonds to our certain customers paying invoices in first quarter this year, then paid in second quarter last year.","Our capital expenditures were 4.6% of revenue, we continue our strong free cash flow conversion of EBITDA, which was 109.1% in first quarter 2012, reflecting the typical first quarter pattern in which a good portion of our customers pay their full year quarterly bill in advance. Overall, our business is performing well. We have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals and we\u2019re continuing to invest in future.","With that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open up the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo, LLC","The Insurance vertical within your Decision Analytics business, I think it was the first quarter since you\u2019ve been public where you didn\u2019t have your quarterly reported growth, can you help us understand the dynamics of going along within that segment, and when you think the year-over-year organic growth rate should reaccelerate in the drivers of that?","Mark V. Anquillare","Yeah, this is Mark. I appreciate the question, couple of things to note, first of all as you think about the verticals, a relative to fourth quarter of 2011 severe storms, and the seasonal weather patterns were pretty harsh in 2011.","So there was a lot of storm activity that did help us specifically on the claim side of things. We are kind of now into a normal or lower time of year with regard to the storms and those claims that are associated with severe weather. The other thing that typically happens at year-end or there so, I will call it more of the one-time project type work that typically falls inside of our catastrophe modeling solutions and those projects, which are usually completed for and focused on year-end we\u2019re also helping and historically helped the latter part of the year specifically for the quarter.","So those are a couple of dimensions that helps what is fourth quarter. I think we feel good about first quarter, where we were but to answer your specific question, it was a little bit about well over topic.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo, LLC","Okay, great. And then, I think you said you benefited in risk assessment, the revenue growth by $1 million for non-recurring benefit. I didn\u2019t catch what that was from. Could you just drill that again?","Mark V. Anquillare","Sure. Some of the insurance programs are licensed by vendors. So they incorporate our programs in their solutions. Their software solutions, as an example like Policy Admin Solutions and we had in most part fee that was paid in first quarter. That is a normal fees but it\u2019s a non-recurring type of item in the first quarter.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo, LLC","Okay. And then just with the MediConnect, could you help us better understand the ramp there, we\u2019re looking at more like a 30% first half or 70% the back half for revenue and EBITDA?","Mark V. Anquillare","I think that\u2019s a good approximation. It\u2019s a little bit tough to have that level of visibility, but we continue to believe that\u2019s about right.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo, LLC","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Mark V. Anquillare","Good morning.","Frank J. Coyne","Good morning.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.","Frank, you highlighted a sharp acceleration in direct written premium growth at your P&C customers in 2011 that will impact your own Risk Assessment revenue growth in 2013. Given that acceleration in direct written premium growth how you\u2019re thinking about pricing \u2013 how you\u2019re thinking about pricing for 2013 and can you get into the bottom of your long-term organic target range of 10% to 12% with that pickup in direct written premium?","Frank J. Coyne","Well first on the pricing, we look at our pricing every year based on enhanced value that we bring to our customers plus their actual growth for the year that we have in reports that they submit. So it\u2019s too early for me to really applying on what our pricing might be for 2013. But as you saw with our \u2013 on the second part of your question, I mean we\u2019re optimistic because we are you know we add that wind at our face now for few years and now it\u2019s turning, so it certainly gives us more flexibility.","And on the second part of your question, I\u2019m pleased that extra mortgage we had a 9% organic revenue growth for the quarter and that\u2019s a good sign and I like the assets that we have and I like the potential that we have for organic growth going forward. So, we still hold on to our aspirational targets.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc","We\u2019ll put in other way is there any reason to believe that you wouldn\u2019t have at least CPI type pricing in 2013 in the risk assessment business?","Frank J. Coyne","You know, as I said I really it will be premature for me to talk about pricing, but that\u2019s a reasonable assumption.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay, thank you very much.","Scott G. Stephenson","All right, you\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Raymond James.","William Warmington \u2013 Raymond James","Good morning everyone.","Eva F. Huston","Hi.","Mark V. Anquillare","Hi, good morning.","William Warmington \u2013 Raymond James","A couple of questions for the \u2013 the first is in 2010 and in 2011, the second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was the trough for the year and then third and fourth quarter margins were at or above the first quarter margin levels, and would it be reasonable to assume that pattern repeats in 2012?","Scott G. Stephenson","Bill, thank you. Let me just kind of recap a little bit what you\u2019re trying to get to there are two things that affect us in the second quarter. First of all, relative to first, we do have salary increases coming through, those salary increases as I mentioned is about $3.3 million. That's an item that we\u2019ll continue obviously into second, third and fourth, so that\u2019s something kind of model through the year. ","William Warmington \u2013 Raymond James","Okay.","Scott G. Stephenson","The vote of on equity awards that were just granted in April because of the nature of accelerated vesting on determined age; that does cause a bit of a one-time item that affects second quarter. So a, the 2012 equity awards are bigger than the 2009, that\u2019s kind of rolling off and these are rolling. So we talked about the 4.7, but a good majority of that 4.7 relates to this accelerated vesting. So that item will affect second quarter and then it will go away for the third and fourth very similar to last year or so.","William Warmington \u2013 Raymond James","Okay.","Scott G. Stephenson","To that point those are couple dimensions along the MediConnect that I mentioned that should probably cause a little bit of trough in the second quarter as you noted.","William Warmington \u2013 Raymond James","Gotcha, okay and then another question for you would be, you had very impressive growth in the Xactware segment 2011, over 20% and it\u2019s still delivering strong growth against that. And, can you talk a little bit about the new products and new customers in that segment that you\u2019re targeting, and what kind of growth you think you can deliver from the 10% level?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yeah, this is Scott, Bill. There is quite a few things that we\u2019re doing on the Xactware in front of you that rise to the top of the level would be, we\u2019re very excited about the content side of the business. You may know that Xactware historically has been about estimating the value of the structure, but something on the order of 40% of the value overall is in the contents. And the use of automated tools for estimating contents really has not emerged yet fully in the same way that it has on the structural side. And so, we\u2019re very excited about that.","Second thing is, the business is finding its way into overseas markets. We sort of have our launching pad into Continental Europe, pretty well established now in the UK and via existing customer relationships, we\u2019re actually reaching over there. And it\u2019s going to be a long march, but we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing.","Third thing is, the tools that we use on the insurance side are also useful in the OREO market where the property owner has to keep track of what a cost to maintain a property that\u2019s moved into OREO status. And so, we\u2019ve actually just introduced a line of solutions into that marketplace, and again it\u2019s kind of early days, but we\u2019re encouraged about that. And then, I think you know that the kind of the syncopation inside of the business today is that, our tools are now being used for the adjusting of well over 80% of all residential claims.","On the underwriting side, for ITV calculations our share is not that high, but it continues to go up and carriers find it very compelling to think about using the same analytic engine and same dataset for both underwriting the policy on the front end and adjusting the claims on the back end.","So we find that the market continues to come to us on that approach. So, a variety of things that are working side of the business, and we do remain optimistic about the growth potential for the business over longer periods of time.","There were some exciting things that happened in 2011 that contributed to that 30% plus growth rate, some very large customers coming over into our column. And so, there were something a little bit extraordinary about 2011, but we do remain very optimistic about the business.","William Warmington \u2013 Raymond James","Excellent. Thank you for the insight.","Scott G. Stephenson","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Mcveigh with Macquarie. ","Kevin Mcveigh \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Thank you. Wonder, if you give a sense of how much acquisitions impacted the margins in Q1?","Scott G. Stephenson","I will tell you. We have not spent a lot of time on it, because I don\u2019t think it was much of an impact. Remember we\u2019ve always been talking about the acquisitions of [property] in 3E, because they were purchased in December of 2010. So now as we go forward, 1Q '12, 1Q '11, we have an apples-to-apples and the combination of the newer acquisitions, MediConnect and HRP not affect the margins to bigger degree.","Eva F. Huston","Yeah, I think in Decision Analytics, it\u2019s about 60 basis points.","Scott G. Stephenson","Yeah, in just DA.","Kevin Mcveigh \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Great, thank you. And then, just as kind of the P&C market starts to firm a little bit, does that impact the selling process at all in terms of the type of product, your clients are looking at and just any derivative impact on the business from that?","Frank J. Coyne","Yeah, it does. It frees up opportunities for our customers to look at additional products of ours that they have and interest in, but didn\u2019t have budget for. And the selling cycle shortened somewhat when our customers are growing.","Kevin Mcveigh \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Riggs with William Blair.","Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s kind of an extension of the last line of question and you\u2019ve highlighted roughly $1 billion opportunity, additional opportunity in the P&C space. What are going to be the key drivers to seizing on that opportunity? Have you made any adjustments in terms of your sales force and in terms of driving that cross selling, and maybe where are you doing? Feel like you\u2019re doing a good job of pursuing that and where is there still some work to be done? Thanks.","Frank J. Coyne","Yeah, thank you. That\u2019s something we spend a lot of time on. One thing I would point to is you may have noticed that last year we reorganized some of our P&C assets. We pulled assets from actually five different operating units to create various underwriting. And part of the purpose of doing that is to present a more unified coherent face to our customers in the underwriting space.","If you look at our position in the P&C marketplace overall and you think about the different disciplines that are at work there, we\u2019re very, very strong with respect to rate making and all of the associated process that goes on in front of the regulators. We\u2019re very strong in the claims function; we\u2019re very strong in catastrophe modeling.","In the underwriting discipline, where a presence of the relative strength of our competitive position is not as great and so one of the things that we\u2019re emphasizing is just that and so the reorganization, the naming of a talented executive to run that business for us. All of that really reflects our ambition to become bigger, stronger in the underwriting function and it\u2019s early days, but we do think that this new approach is beginning to yield what we\u2019re hoping it would. ","Another comment would be that, we\u2019re just very focused on the cross-selling opportunity and so we\u2019ve done what we have done for sometime and have to really make sure that account management is a very strong function for us and basically representing the full range of solutions that we have for our carrier customers. And those are the kinds of things that we do, there is nothing, I mean the reorganization was obviously a point of time thing, but a lot of it is just as long steady approach presenting all of our capabilities to the customer base and being a good partner. ","Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi. The pro forma financials with MediConnect in spite of the revenue growth in Q1 was about 67%. Is there anything unusual there that would cause it to be so high and should we expect this rate of growth for the rest of the year?","Mark V. Anquillare","So, Suzanne, this is Mark. I appreciate the question. The first quarter, as we said, there is a little bit of seasonality to it. When we talked about seasonality at year-end, year-end also kind of rolls into January. So there is a little bit of positive wind that still flows through.","I think that we are still comfortable with the discussion we had. I don\u2019t know if we have any optimism about second quarter or view too much into what we saw in the first quarter. So, hopefully it\u2019s a little bit of a positive, but I would not change anything we described relative to the Mediclaim call where we talked about growth consistent with the past.","Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then, the organic growth rate in specialized markets have been very volatile, what do you think is a normalized growth rate for that business?","Mark V. Anquillare","Well, let me just describe. Last year, well, we did run into, inside of the specialized was government and budgetary constraints, but that caused a little bit of a downturn towards the end of the year as government kind of shutdown for a piece. The other thing that I will remind you is that we want a very sizable contract. It grows our contract (inaudible) so we had that growing very quickly until we got to a point where we had this growth on that contract.","So you saw last year towards the quarter, the fact that the contract did come, of course through the full year. I think what you\u2019re seeing now in first quarter, feels like a reasonable growth rate and I think we\u2019ve (inaudible) and I would call normalized, I think we found some consistency.","Frank J. Coyne","The climate and science part of our business is actually starting to find a little bit more traction in the commercial markets, which should overtime both get bigger as a percentage of the total and be somewhat steadier with respect to the revenue profile.","Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then, just one final question on the mortgage business. What are you expecting as far as declines for the rest of the year, and how far along is the customer that you singled out, just in terms of winding down the business?","Frank J. Coyne","So let me describe. I think what we said during the year-end call is that we can see the mortgage business declining similar to what we saw in the quarter, which was a 7% decline. We said we could see the negative aspect of the market being to that level throughout the course of '12. And to your point, I mean, what we\u2019re seeing is our business on the front end, just would relate to the underwriting side of things, growing faster (inaudible) build on the customers and that is growing faster than mortgage relation bonds as a whole, but, unfortunately the one customer trending down is more than offsetting some of that good news that we\u2019re seeing on the existing customers. So we think we are well positioned. I think we remain very optimistic for the future because we are improving our position inside the market, but it\u2019s a challenging one at this point.","Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley","So I guess, just to clarify on that customer that\u2019s trending down, are you kind of getting close to the tail end of that or will that continue for the foreseeable future?","Frank J. Coyne","It\u2019s going to continue through third quarter.","Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. ","Eva F. Huston","Okay.","Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Huang with UBS. ","Jennifer Huang \u2013 UBS","Thank you. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about the healthcare business, the growth was obviously very strong there. I was just wondering, how much of that do you think, maybe attributable to your efforts to integrate the healthcare platforms into just one? And then, maybe as a follow-up, I think you guys have mentioned investments in the integration process of about $10 million over the course of two years. Maybe you can quantify how much of that you saw in the first quarter or how much of that impacted the EBTIDA margins?","Scott G. Stephenson ","Yeah, let me take the first part of that, this is Scott, as it relates to healthcare. We are working hard on integration. I just would like everybody to understand that there are actually two different forms of integrations that are now working inside of what we\u2019re doing in healthcare. The first is that we\u2019re trying to unify the data analytic platform, off of which the individual solutions are built.","And that has to do with coming up with normalized data models and creating a data warehouse structure that can serve all of the different aspects of what we do, whether it\u2019s trying to add value to claims or it\u2019s trying to engage in risk adjusting, et cetera. So that\u2019s one thing which is ongoing. I mentioned earlier that that\u2019s a project, which continues through 2013 and that will hopefully and should and we plan for it to work to the benefit of all of the different sets of solutions that we provide into the marketplace.","There is the second integration, which we\u2019re now undertaking, which is related to the MediConnect acquisition and basically there is, and we are going to feature in a way that we operate, a strong linkage between three things that we do. One is chart retrieval and abstraction, which is what MediConnect does, HEDIS reporting, which we already do, and risk adjusting on behalf of plans that are seeking Medicare reimbursements.","Those three businesses actually have a lot of, logically relate strongly one to the other. And so, we are at work even now to try to pull those operationally together so that we can present yet more integrated and streamline solutions to our customers. I guess what I want to emphasis with respect to result is that we are just in the process of integrating right now. So I would not really attribute anything in our first quarter 2012 healthcare results to the integration work that we\u2019re doing. ","On your second question, which is the investing we\u2019re doing to achieve these new platforms. There\u2019s actually two major streams of investment, which are going on. One is the unified platform in healthcare, and the other is the next generation platform supporting our catastrophe models, and that\u2019s the number that you\u2019ve heard us reference before. It\u2019s not all just been healthcare.","Jennifer Huang \u2013 UBS","Okay, great. Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with SIG.","James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Mark, the cash flow from operations was up almost or above 30% year-over-year. It seem like some of that was related to a reduction in working capital. I was wondering how sustainable that is? ","Mark V. Anquillare ","Sure, well, thanks for the question. We did have very good first quarter, so two things or a few things that factored into it. First of all, let me remind you, in first quarter of last year, we talked about a refresh of our technology environment here in New Jersey City and that was a little bit about periodic thing. So we have a drop in CapEx in first quarter 2012 relative to 2011, so that helped us.","The other things that, we highlight or want to highlight is that the semi-annual aspect of bond interest did not run through the P&L in the first quarter, so that helped us sort of on catch up in second quarter, so that\u2019s about I think about $6 million. And the rest of it, I will call out maybe about $7 million, $8 million where we can point to customers who seem to be paying in first quarter of this year and paid may be in second quarter last year. ","So when I normalize all that, I think we\u2019re still seeing free cash flow growth about 20% which is very strong, very positive, since we have everyone in the call, I do want to remind you that second quarter we did make this $72 million funding of the pension for that $72 million will have to just normalize next quarter that will be considered in operating cash flow and reduce it, but the underlying trend in underlying seems quite positive and we\u2019re pleased with the first quarter results there.","James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","Okay, thank you and then Scott just for a clarification attribution perspective, the HEDIS reporting, the charting and the risk adjustment solutions that you described earlier, how were those going to be categorized between analytics and assessment? ","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, we\u2019re going to have to look at that, I think that \u2013 structure needs to follow function and I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve actually sorted that out, I mean the HEDIS is inside of enterprise analytics today, this is our own structure and then the other piece the Medicare is revenue integrity but will, we\u2019re working first on the organizational integration of those so we will see. ","James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","Okay, thanks for taking my question.","Scott G. Stephenson","Welcome","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Eva F.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's SVP and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.","Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Chief Knowledge Officer","Thank you, Chris, and good morning to everybody. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2016 financial results.","With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.","Unless stated otherwise, all the results we discuss today will reflect the classification of the healthcare business (0:53) operations. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors section of our website at verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.","And finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Eva. Good morning, all. In the first quarter, we delivered strong overall results, with total revenue growth of 28%, EBITDA growth of 24% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 19%. Organic revenue growth was 5% and was 7% excluding the first quarter 2015 nonrecurring project revenue at Argus and a one-time true-up of partner revenue this year in the Decision Analytics Insurance segment. Profitability remains strong with total EBITDA margins of 50%. We continued to be encouraged about the performance of our businesses in our key verticals of insurance, financial services and energy. This quarter is a good start to the year and we will look to build on these results.","On April 25, 2016 as you know, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell the healthcare business to Veritas Capital for $820 million. We expect the sale to close by the end of the second quarter. The returns we generated on the business reflect value creation for our shareholders with a pre-tax IRR of about 12% through our ownership period which began in 2004.","One of our most important responsibilities is the careful stewardship of our shareholders capital. We continually assess our assets and their productivity as well as opportunities to deploy new capital in line with our strategic priorities. Consistent with our capital allocation approach, we identified and evaluated a range of alternatives. We determined that we have better uses for the capital invested in the business and for any future capital which would've been required to make the operations more Verisk like.","Additionally, we believe that management time should be directed to areas where we can have the most impact in driving shareholder returns. This transaction will allow us to focus on data analytics businesses in our key verticals which are most closely aligned with our strategy, our distinctives and global ambitions and where we believe we can add the most value.","The majority of the proceeds will be allocated towards future acquisitions and repurchases, consistent with our long-term approach we've discussed with you in the past. We remain committed to our 2.5 times steady-state leverage. Pro forma for the sale of the healthcare business and related proceeds at March 31 we would have been at that level.","I'm glad to have found strong ownership for our healthcare business and very much wish the team continued success. We go forward from here better aligned with the key distinctives which mark excellent, vertical, data analytics businesses. We have higher margins, more stable revenue growth, less seasonality, a higher mix of subscription revenue and stronger free cash flow conversion post this transaction. Overall, we look even more like the Verisk business model that we all value.","During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through the repurchase of $116 million of our stock. At March 31, 2016, we had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we remain active, looking for strategic and financially sound tuck-in acquisitions.","As you may have seen, we recently acquired Risk Intelligence Ireland, a leading provider of fraud detection compliance, risk control and process automation services to the Irish insurance industry, which becomes part of our ISO solutions business. This acquisition advances our efforts to expand our insurance business beyond the United States. We remain constructive on the outlook and expect acceleration in our combined insurance businesses and double-digit growth at Argus.","WoodMac continues to perform remarkably well in an environment which is extraordinary difficult for our customers. The team is working very hard to achieve growth for the year, even as we acknowledge the macro environment continues to be challenging relative to historic norms.","In a recent achievement of note, Verisk was included in the Forbes list of America's Best Employers 2016. This follows are inclusion in the Forbes World's Most Innovative Companies list. Verisk is one of only 15 companies to appear on both lists. We are working hard to attract and retain great talent as we continue to make progress fostering a culture of innovation.","We apply that innovative thinking in working with our customers to find new solutions to their challenges by leveraging our unique data assets and methods. And I personally am inspired by the efforts of our people and I think that shows through in the results we have been delivering. We are well positioned to execute on our strategies and global ambitions in the future.","So with that let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Scott. In the first quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing for the future. Revenue grew 28.2%. Organic revenue grew 5%, excluding recent acquisitions.","If you adjust for $11 million nonrecurring project revenue in Argus in the first quarter of 2015 and several million dollars of true-up revenue in Decision Analytics insurance this year, organic revenue growth was 7% in the quarter.","EBITDA grew 24% to $248 million. EBITDA margins were 50.4% for the quarter. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 46.7% and 4.8% in the first quarter, excluding acquisitions. Adjusting for the nonrecurring financial services project revenue last year and true-up insurance revenue this year, organic revenue growth in the segment was 8.5%.","Revenue in the quarter was again driven by insurance. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew at 11.6% in the first quarter, increase was led by strong growth in claims analytics solutions with good growth in loss quantification, catastrophe modeling and underwriting solutions in the quarter. Even excluding the several (7:29) million dollars of true-up revenue, growth in Decision Analytics insurance was about 9%.","Financial services revenue decreased 19% in the quarter and increased 17.7%, after adjusting for last year's nonrecurring project revenue, with solid underlying demand for our core solutions and services, offset by prior-year project revenue of $11 million which did not recur in 2016. Energy and specialized markets revenue grew by over 350%, including the recently acquired Wood Mackenzie, PCI and Infield businesses.","Organic revenue declined 3.6%, as growth in the environmental health and safety solutions was offset by a decline in weather and climate analytics. WoodMac revenue, in constant currency, excluding PCI and Infield, increased slightly in the first quarter 2016 and, as reported, declined slightly, when including the effect of purchase accounting. We expect pro forma constant currency revenue to be flat in the second quarter, as reported. As we think about the full-year outlook as reported, we expect to be near flat. Also, as we move through the year, keep in mind that currency will have an impact on our reported results.","Risk assessment revenue grew 5.2%, continuing to demonstrate the value of our longstanding insurance customers. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.2%, reflecting our 2016 invoices, which were effective January 1 and continued contribution from newer solutions, such as predictive models and electronic rating content.","Our property specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 4.9% in the quarter. This increase was driven by higher committed volumes in our commercial underwriting business. EBITDA increased 24% in the quarter to $248 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.4%. Decision Analytics EBITDA increased 40% to $139 million in the quarter, as a result of acquisitions and profitable growth in the business. The EBITDA in risk assessment increased 8.3% to $109 million, as a result of revenue growth and good expense management.","Reported interest expense was $32 million in the quarter. Total debt was $3 billion at March 31, 2016. Our leverage at the end of the first quarter was about 2.6 times. After the sale of the healthcare business, we expect to be at the 2.5 times leverage target, ahead of plan.","Our reported effective tax rate was 31.7% for the quarter. Adjusted net income increased 26.1% to $127 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.75 for the quarter, an increase of $0.19 \u2013 19%, excuse me. Discontinued operations includes about $0.03 related to healthcare operations and a negative $0.11 for tax liability as a result of classifying healthcare business as discontinued ops. As a result, we reported discontinued operations adjusted EPS of a negative $0.08. The average diluted share count was 171.5 million shares in the quarter. On March 31, 2016 our diluted share count was 170.9 million shares.","For shares purchased in the quarter, the average price paid was $69.97. At March 31, 2016, the company had about $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to-date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital.","Free cash flow increased 20% to $256 million for the first three months ended March 31, 2016, including WoodMac. This represented 103.2% of EBITDA, as our first quarter is typically our strongest for free cash flow generation, due to invoicing patterns. These numbers are all for continuing operations.","Growth in free cash flow was driven by improved profitability of our business and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest rates and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Capital expenditures increased 22.7% to $25 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2016, driven in part by the addition of WoodMac. CapEx was 5.1% of revenue. We now expect CapEx of about $150 million to $155 million, pro forma for the divestiture of the healthcare business. We continue to manage our capital intensity.","We're pleased with the announced agreement to sell the healthcare business and the opportunity to focus on our core competencies and our distinctives. The sales price of $820 million consists of $720 million of cash, a $100 million subordinated promissory note, and other contingent consideration. As you saw in our 10-Q, the note has an 8-year maturity and a 9% PIK interest rate. The consideration, which is unrelated to the note, is tied to the future value of the healthcare business, and provides upside to our sales price under certain conditions.","We expect the deal to close by the end of the second quarter. We anticipate the after-tax proceeds of approximately $675 million, of which about $600 million will be received at closing, and the remainder on the repayment of the promissory note. The precise tax amounts will be determined after we've all adjusted for the working capital. On an estimated after-tax basis, the IRR generated exceeds our cost of capital.","Of the cash proceeds, we expect that the majority will be allocated to our longstanding capital allocation priorities. In the near-term, we intend to use the proceeds to repay our revolver drawings, but we'll then use that increased revolver capacity, as opportunities arise, for our long-term capital allocation plans. While we manage the transition, some of the corporate cost to support the healthcare business will remain with Verisk.","I'd like to thank all of our Verisk and Verisk Health teams for the hard work that has gone into this transaction. We are excited for the future of Verisk, and we wish our colleagues at Verisk Health the very best as they move forward.","As you think about your models for 2016 on a continuing operation basis, we encourage you to review Table 8 in last night's press release, which contains selected financial metrics for 2015 on a continuing operation basis by quarter. We expect that based upon current FX rates there is about a $10 million impact to full-year revenue relative to where rates were at the start of the year. As FX is a component that has become more relevant to Verisk, we would look to provide more insight going forward.","For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of about $150 million to $155 million. Fixed asset depreciation\/amortization of about $132 million and amortization of intangibles about $95 million. Based upon our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $123 million. We estimate the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33%. The healthcare divestiture may help that tax rate a bit, but by less than 50 basis points based upon the information we now have.","For the intangible amortization add-back and the adjusted net income calculation we will use 26% to reflect the tax rate applicable to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect the diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases.","Overall, we are pleased with our plan for 2016, excited about the go-forward financial profile of the company. We are executing on our operational plans, and we are well positioned for profitable growth in the future.","With that I'll turn it back to Eva for a comment before Q&A.","Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Chief Knowledge Officer","Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your question to one question and one follow-up.","And with that, I will ask the operator to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning Bill.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Bill.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And congratulations on selling the healthcare division and then also on crossing the 50% EBITDA margin threshold. And that's where my question is this morning is you've gone from a 43% to 45% range to a 45% to 47% range and, last at the Investor Day you talked about expanding margins over time. And how should we think about that? Are you still committed to expanding the margins over time? And then also how should we think about the quarterly margin progression throughout the year, now that you don't have healthcare there?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, so this is Mark, Bill. Thank you for the earlier comments. Let me just remind (16:48) some (16:48) \u2013 in the second quarter, this is just kind of the quarterly aspect in response to your question, second quarter we do have our salary increases. A majority of \u2013 a super majority of both married and promotional increases come in and effective April 1, so that typically hurts us from a margin perspective as you progress through the year. What we also do is we give out our equity awards. So what will happen is this year's equity awards will come in; the equity awards from four years ago will kind of move out because they're vested, so those two things will affect the rest of the year.","The other thing we always like to just remind, we continue to make progress, but we did, for the most part, had this talent realignment in risk assessment, so there's some staff that we are continuing to hire and that will ramp up as we progress through the year. We did some hiring in first quarter, but probably still a little bit behind the levels we expect. So those are the couple of points that I will call out.","The other thing that I think to your earlier question, remember, what we have as a business that's wonderfully scalable. It kind of comes to how much investment we wanted to do and we need to kind of talk about the opportunity to take advantage of that operating leverage. I don't think we see a lot of incremental investment relevant to revenue, so I think we have over the long-term an opportunity to continue to work on margins and move those in a positive direction.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for the insight.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys. Just, I guess questions on the insurance vertical. One, can you elaborate a little bit more on, you mentioned growth was led by the claims analytics part of Decision Analytics which I would've thought of as the most mature part of that business, so I guess, what's driving that growth? And then secondly, the true-up for I believe it was Xactware, can you talk about that? And I guess also from a margin perspective, does most of that revenue just flow through to the margin line? Just trying to understand how that impacted margins for the quarter? Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So Tim, it's Scott, and I'll take the first part of your question. There's something going on in claims, which actually is going on across many of the things we do in insurance, and that is we are as \u2013 implicit in your question, we are well-platformed, that is true. But what we've been doing is working to enhance the value in many cases by sort of building around the platform, adding features which help the customers get more value out of what we're doing. And that's true, not only on the claims side, but that's also true on the underwriting side as well. So it's not any one thing. It's actually very broadly based. New products that bring, for example, more analytic acuity to trying to figure out within the claims flows which claims should really get the most attention because they represent the greatest dollar recovery opportunity for the customers, and that's just one example. But the general story is think of it as embroidering on top of the platforms that we've already got.","And then, Mark, maybe you want to take the question about the true-up?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So inside of our healthcare \u2013 excuse me, inside of our insurance businesses we have a lot of licenses and partnerships which combine a kind of an upfront amount and then there's kind of true-ups based upon how much our partners sell. So inside the true-up we have kind of a royalty component, and sometimes we need to true-up past volumes or past royalty amounts and that's what you're seeing in the first quarter.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","And is it really from a margin perspective? Is it right to think there's not a lot of offsetting costs when you true-up?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That'd be true. Yeah, I mean, I guess we incurred the cost probably in the past, like 2015, but correct.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, thank you. Just first revisit what you said on WoodMac, I think you said flat for a full-year as reported, just wanted to verify that includes, I guess, an FX headwind? And then you're not adding back the acquired deferred from a purchase accounting standpoint, are there any other adjustments in that number? And if you could remind us roughly how much has the acquired deferred add-back been adding to the WoodMac year-over-year trends you had been reporting since the acquisition?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, just to clarify, what I said was on a constant currency basis we'd be flat as reported. So I just want to make sure you threw in the FX on top of that, so I just did want to call that out; we do try to factor that in. So, that hopefully is clarifying.","I think we could see growth, yes, for the year, but the environment is a difficult one for everybody, and we're trying to work through it. I think our team's done an extraordinary job to be where they are.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","But just on the acquired deferred, I think you had been adding it back to the numbers you had been quoting since the acquisition, and now that you are lapping it, it sounds like you're giving us a reported number. So just if you could help me with that differential?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, I mean, your point is valid. I guess, we are in the point where we can be a little bit above; we can be a little bit above. The difference between the two is not all that material since it's a few million dollars that we're talking about.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just finally on the healthcare divestiture, I think it's pretty easy to calculate the EBITDA multiple that it transacted at externally. But can you give us what the LTM free cash flow multiple of the transaction was if you have it handy just so we can do apples-for-apples with how you were talking about the WoodMac acquisition purchase price?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think we'll have to follow up, so we can get you the accurate numbers there. I'm sorry I don't have those in front of me. That was a little while ago.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just wanted to ask a little bit around the capital allocation you talked about. But firstly just, Scott, you mentioned an active, I guess, tuck-in M&A pipeline. And I'm just trying to understand or just get a little bit more color on where you're seeing these? I mean, I guess, my initial impression was it'll be more the PCIs and the Infields. But I don't know if I should be reading into the Ireland insurance acquisition you made that there's a lot more in some of the other verticals as well?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh it's, the M&A agenda expands all of the verticals and what I would say is very active across all of them. And, actually, the place where incrementally we have put in the most energy to raise our game on the M&A front, actually, has been in the insurance vertical. And I would say especially non-domestic. And so we're very much leaning in on that agenda and quite active actually on that front.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, fair enough. And then I guess just a follow-up on in terms of the outlook for Argus, I think at the beginning of the year you guys have said you expect double-digit growth there. I just want to confirm if that's correct? And if that's sort of a reported number and not backing out the one-time stuff that you had last year?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That is correct and that is not backing out the one-time stuff.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Scott...","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Scott, I think you were indicating last conference call that you thought within the insurance verticals that both RA and DA would accelerate this year. Do you still think that's the case?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep, we feel good about insurance.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Could you talk a little bit more about RA because obviously that would have to pick up throughout 2016 from first quarter levels to accelerate for the first year?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, it's \u2013 RA is a rich mix of the industry standard programs and the new solutions that we brought to market recently which would include our predictive models, our electronic rating content and also innovations around the \u2013 in the category of telematics. We're using our commercial property capability to spread out in the new verticals. All of those things are contributing to the performance of that segment.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your expectations for growth for energy for next year. I know that it is fairly early, but it seems like we've gotten to sort of a flat constant currency growth rate at this point. And so I'm wondering, how should we think about that in relation to the price of oil? And then I have one follow-up.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, here's the view about WoodMac. WoodMac, right now in our view, is laying the foundation for its next round of growth. So what's going on right now? Customer retention is very high. The new product pipeline is robust. The utilization of our portal offerings is growing strongly, and we're also opening up new channels of distribution for our proprietary content.","The challenge of the moment is the extreme pressure on our customers, who are almost two years into this down cycle, and they're still laying off some of their associates. And so they're seeking, even at this time, cost-savings anywhere they can find them. But our view is, because our customers are leaning out their staffs, when the market returns to more normal conditions, demand for WoodMac tools and solutions will escalate strongly, and that's why we are staying the course, and we're remaining invested in the present and the future at WoodMac.","Having said all of that, the one thing that we will never do is make pinpoint predictions of the commodity. We certainly expect more normalized conditions into the future, and we'll see when those occur, and we're hopeful about that, because it'll be good for our customers. But we've said from the beginning, and we still maintain that, in normalized market conditions, we expect Wood Mackenzie, and the pieces that we've added to Wood Mackenzie, to grow at or above the rate of organic growth of the rest of Verisk.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, on the margin side, what's your biggest opportunity to move margins up as you look across the businesses? I'm wondering if you could just maybe rank the top 3, and where you think that there's the largest opportunity to kind of move margins higher? And any commentary you can give on pricing? I figured I'd sneak one in.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's not three factors, it's one. And that is \u2013 it's the fundamental nature of our business. The way we do business is fundamentally scalable. So as long as we have a healthy business which is growing, and as long as we pay attention to tightly operating our business, that is where the margin opportunity lies. We've made some structural changes to the company where, for example, just systemically, our tax rate is lower, but otherwise it's basic to the way we do business. It's not \u2013 there's no one long lever.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning. Scott...","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","...earlier you mentioned your interest in doing international acquisitions, particularly in the insurance vertical...","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","...can you talk a little bit about the platform that WoodMac gives you internationally as you expand your presence in other verticals, outside of the U.S.? I'm thinking in terms of resources, operating leverage?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right, all that. I had the opportunity, the latter half of last year, to visit many of our WoodMac offices around the world. And it really caught my attention when I was in Beijing. So, in Beijing, we have about 30 to 40 WoodMac people. And at the moment, we have four or five people for our AIR unit, which is our catastrophe modeling unit in the insurance business. We brought them all together in order to just talk about the company, and just your typical town hall meeting and \u2013 to talk about the future.","You would've thought that these were long-lost relatives who had just found one another after decades. The pleasure of being able to pull together, in a single market, share ideas, and share just even infrastructure, so all those folks previously had not been co-located, now they're co-located. In an intellectual property business like ours, it's just absolutely golden when you can get people ideating with one another, and we remain very interested in the intersection of energy and insurance, and it is something that increasingly is going to be very important for us.","And so, just at a very basic level, the ability to pull together intelligent people, have them sharing what it is they're doing and finding the mutual opportunities, is so big. And we've commented many times in these calls that the right way to think about a global Verisk is as a multi-domestic Verisk. In other words, in many of the markets we serve, and I'll use insurance as an example; a Chinese primary carrier is not really all that interested in what happened in the United States last quarter, in terms of premiums and indemnity losses. They just aren't. It's not that relevant for them. So we have to be more Chinese in China. But the fact that we're already legitimate in China actually means quite a bit, and it's just very supportive.","And also, as we try to source new talent, the fact that we're a reputable, credible player in all of these markets is a very major factor. And we're experiencing that right now as we try to add new highly talented local-market appropriate associates in a number of places around the globe. So it's \u2013 maybe it's a little bit difficult to spot from a distance. It's a very powerful effect actually inside the company. Mark, I think you wanted to add something?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I was just going to add it just to give you a little color from kind of a little vignette. In the world of China just to kind of tag along that comment, we think we can do some things around buildings to help understand the risk associated with those buildings and what it would cost to underwrite them. And there were some reinsurance brokers that were interested in the tool that we were developing for China. I'm not sure we would've had a way to put that on the ground and actually respond to that without the offices we had there and it made for a \u2013 beyond the incorporation and we went there (33:02), we had people there with cards that were Verisk. So just a case in point.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Greatly appreciate your perspective. Just a quick housekeeping question for you, Mark. What was the March quarter EBITDA that the healthcare business generated?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is in the discontinued ops area. You can see it and I believe it was about 21%-ish. I think that was around there. It did include some transactional related costs.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thank you, very much.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Thanks, it's Jamie at Susquehanna. Scott, in your opening remarks you were talking about the Verisk distinctives and that was helpful. One of them that you had called out was the increase in subscription revenue as a percentage of the total pro forma for healthcare. I was hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Meaning, why we care about that or just where the number goes? Are you asking where the number goes, too?","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I didn't want to get too \u2013 I mean, if it's too specific quantitatively, that's fine, but directionally is that as significant?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I mean, I think we can \u2013 yeah, so let's, I think Mark is looking up the number right now. I'm not sure if you've got it there, Mark. But it's just part and parcel of what we do. The fact of the subscription revenue really goes to the nature of the relationship with our customers, which is deep and embedded. And it's when you're in that mode that you can move to subscription forms and just the recurrence and the visibility associated with the subscriptions is something that's very supportive of cash flow and operations and forecasting. So we do care about it. And it's one of the reasons why we feel good about the way our mix is rebalanced here now as we move towards the sale of the healthcare business.","Mark, I don't know if you wanted to comment specifically on the numbers?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it was 82%.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","82%. Thanks.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","So, Mark, just to clarify that, what's the denominating? Are you saying that healthcare was \u2013 oh, 82% of the revenue pro forma for the healthcare sale is now subscription?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Yeah. That's really helpful.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, hope that was responsive to your question.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah, that's what I was getting. I wasn't sure if you have that so I thought it might too specific.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we'll take 82%-ish. It's around there, yes.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Okay, and then I think also, Scott, you had suggested that it decreases seasonality or \u2013 yeah, decreases seasonality...","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right, right.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","...yeah, so could you remind us what the seasonal patterns were for healthcare with the sweeps and all that?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Healthcare was 40% first half of the second year and 60% second half of the year.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","All right. All right, you got all the answers. That's very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Scott G.

Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, how are you?","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","How should we think about growth in the specialized segment non-WoodMac, it seems like that has been jumping around a little bit?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, there was a little perturbation there in the first quarter. I think you're going to find that settles out as we go forward.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then I just wanted to ask one additional question on your plans for further international expansion in the insurance business. Which geographies would make the most sense, just given the structure of their insurance systems? Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep, yep. So you should think \u2013 that's a really good question, that's one that we think about quite a bit actually. You should think of us as a portfolio. So, the logical place for us to sort of drill down would generally be established economies that tend not to be overly concentrated in terms of market shares of leading players.","So for example, on balance, and also you have to concede that language issues are here a little bit also, U.K. is a little bit better for us than, say, Germany. So we can sort of pick our spots that way. Japan is a highly developed economy that also doesn't have an overly concentrated insurance market, so that would be another. So, that's kind of your first sort.","But the other part of it is, we are interested in emerging situations as well. And to that I would call out there, you would have to consider China still to be an emerging situation, so that's one that we look at. But it's also interesting that when you look at the sum of Southeast Asia, it turns that Singapore is becoming something of a hub. And so we're really kind of have both flavors inside of our portfolio. More of the energy will go into established economies, but we're going to feature both kinds in what we do.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Scott G.

Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","...I apologize if I had missed this, but could you help us bridge what's changed or wasn't anticipated in your outlook for WoodMac in 2016 versus last quarter? It seems you're now you're looking for a flattish growth versus some growth last quarter. And perhaps if you could give us some color on how your conversations with clients are faring in light of some recovery in the price of oil? Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So these are kind of small adjustments in our view, I would say. And it's really just a product of sort of the environment and the rate at which it does or doesn't change. Conversations with customers are overall very encouraging. I had the chance \u2013 I don't know, month, month-and-a-half ago to sit with the deputy CEO of one of the world's largest energy companies. And the stories they tell about how they make use of WoodMac content and their focus upon WoodMac as a partner, these are very, very encouraging kinds of stories. And then we just look into the data in terms of, for example, the number of users of our portal offering and the rate at which they're making use of our content, all of which are going up really pretty strongly.","But it's also the case that even now kind of well into the nosedives in the pricing of the commodity, there are still reactions in terms of our customers trying to get their own cost structures right. And so \u2013 and in the same way that there was a little bit of a lagging effect in terms of the commodity price coming down and then the reaction \u2013 excuse me, of the energy companies, you have to expect that there will be some of that also on the way back up.","So there will be some timing effects inside of all \u2013 I would not expect instantaneous reaction of our customers to what the price of the commodity is doing because the price of the commodity has to work its way into not only their forward plans, but also the way that they're actually spending their own CapEx dollars. And there just will be time dependencies inside of that.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, appreciate it. And as a follow-up as it relates to the DA insurance business, it looks like cat bond issuance reached a new quarter record after not a very exciting year 2015, could you talk about the tailwind that provided in the quarter? And what you would expect if these trends continue for the year?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, just first a comment, cat bonds are an interesting category and it's one that we participate in. And it definitely is there in the mix of risk transfer mechanisms that are out there in the world. But I would encourage all to not kind of overstate the amount of risk that gets managed through that mechanism. It's interesting to look at it, because you can sort of carve it out and identify it.","You're right, it was a good moment for cat bonds, and our AIR business did very well. The share of the identified cat bonds that our team analyzed was very high. And, as I think everybody knows, we almost always have the vast majority of that market anyway, so yeah, it was helpful. But there's movement also in the cat bond world, don't miss that. There's the move towards the so-called mini cat bonds, and there are different ways that you can actually analyze cat bonds. So, it's kind of a \u2013 it's a dynamic environment, I'll put it that way. But yeah, we feel good about how we did with the most recent issuances.","Anjaneya K.

Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, they're pretty modest in the scheme here. I don't think we've provided that detail in the past. They're not substantial. They're more tuck-in in nature.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, that's fair. And then, with WoodMac, is it fair to think there that the organic should do a little bit better in the second half of the year, given that, I guess, the discretionary consulting revenues were pressured in the second half of 2015? Does that comp get easier in the second half of 2016?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the answer is, as reported, it probably could get a little bit better. It really is, again, to the consulting side of things, it's a bit of a swing factor in this, so we continue to try to remain conservative, although it's performing well and the underlying usage is up and strong.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right.

And where do you think the relative growth rates of those two (44:46) are?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, the contributions to Argus' growth are very broadly based ,across not only sort of the traditional consortium model, analytic view, but also the specific analytic products that are being provided to customers, to the white labeling of our analytic environment, to the opening up of new markets, like media effectiveness, to the opening up of new markets geographically. All of those cylinders are hitting.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So there is no one call out per se?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. One of the reasons why Argus is such a wonderful business, and has such a bright future, is that it has many different ways to grow.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Scott G.

Your line is open.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks, good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Looking at the margin compression in Decision Analytics in the first quarter, it sounds like organic margins may have been up year-over-year. And so I'm wondering, first, if I'm reading that correctly? And second, if then the margin compression would be attributed perhaps to WoodMac and investments that you're making there?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","This is Mark. I think your observations are correct. Let me just remind you of two facts. First of all, WoodMac has very good margins. However, they have a tough comp in the rest of Verisk, so you are seeing that come into the quarter, that does work against us in Decision Analytics.","The other thing you need to look at is, in first quarter of 2015, we kept talking about that project revenue from Argus, and we also highlighted back a year ago, there were extremely high margins on that project revenue. And as a result, that kind of creates an artificially high margin in 2015 in that first quarter. So, those are the two things that I think, if you normalized out, you would see probably a pretty good story inside of organic DA margins...","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And so, as we think about margins in that segment for the rest of the year, it doesn't sound like we should necessarily expect to see significant compression?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I'll highlight the things I made before. We do have all of our salary increases that take effect in April. And we also give out our equity awards April 1 as well, and those will replace equity awards from four years ago. So those are some additional costs that are layered into the underlying structure from second quarter on. But, all else being equal, I agree with you.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then, sorry to bring this up again, but I just want to make sure that I understand your comments about WoodMac expectations. There are a number of moving pieces between purchase accounting and FX, as well as the timing of when WoodMac came in. On an underlying basis, excluding currency and excluding purchase accounting, is your expectation for 2016 trends lower than or worse than you had previously thought, given the overall environment? Or is your commentary about seeing it flat on a reported basis more a function of the purchase accounting mechanics?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think what we tried to describe is that we remain very optimistic on the business, but we do believe that there are some probably some market economics that are just difficult for our customers and us right now. So in both cases, we think that's going to be down slightly. But still have the opportunity to grow on a reported basis. So I'm just trying to give at least get a little bit more color to everyone.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is open.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Just had a follow-up question on the DA insurance piece, I was wondering if you could share any color on the pricing environment for your services? Just trying to better understand some of the acceleration and the growth there? Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would describe the environment as relatively unchanged, relative to last year and, actually, over many years. One of the hallmarks of the insurance industry is its stability. And so the regulatory environment has not really changed that much. Industry structure hasn't really not changed all that much. There have been a couple of larger mergers, but industry concentration still remains pretty much the same. The way that we price our products has not changed. Probably our pricing actually gets even a little bit tighter as we continue to grow the subscription based part of the mix. So there's really not \u2013 there's not a lot of change really in terms of what the environment yields.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, got it. All right.

Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Kavon Ravon (50:29) filling in for Hansa (50:28). Could you give us a little update on the Verisk telematics stat exchange and how many OEMs are currently signed up? And how large that initiative could be?","Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep, so you've actually got a couple questions there. So the current status is we're actually in the rollout phase with our first OEM, who we announced some time ago. And we'll be providing product to the insurance industry kind of right around the crossover from third quarter to fourth quarter. So that'll be the first fruits commercially of what we've been doing. We're very pleased with the discussions we're having with the insurers in terms of their interest in the data and the analytics. And we are actively cultivating other OEMs, and I think we feel very good about the prospect of this really being the industry standard.","But every OEM is going of kind of think about it in their own light and draw their own conclusions. But we're actively calling on all the name brand OEMs in the United States. So yeah, we feel good about it and the technical work has proceeded very nicely.

My name is Jay, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, all participants have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations Ms. Stacey Brodbar for opening remarks and introduction. Ms. Brodbar you may begin your conference.","Stacey Brodbar","Thank you, Jay and good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2019 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide a brief overview of the strategic direction of our business. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer will then provide an update on our insurance segment. Lastly, Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer will highlight some key points about our financial performance.","The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the investor section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Stephenson","Thanks, Stacy. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Verisk had another strong quarter of growth fueled by our market-leading innovation and continued focus on delivering an exceptional customer experience. Verisk reported organic constant currency revenue growth of 7.6% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.7%. This growth was driven by strength in our Insurance segment and solid improvements in Energy and Specialized Markets.","On the innovation front, I'm especially pleased to see strong revenue growth tied to the investments, we have made in platformed analytic environments. Such environments include our visualized ClaimSearch for fraud fighting and claims adjudication; our Touchstone platform for catastrophe modeling X1 for global property estimating, Lens for energy analytics; and our PowerAdvocate platform were adjusting and understanding supply chain costs in the Energy space. These platforms take the level of intimacy with our customers and their workflows to a whole new level and deliver enhanced growth and operating leverage.","Specifically at Wood Mackenzie, this month we released the second module to Lens called global upstream valuation, which expands screening and valuation capabilities across the whole world. This solution enables our customers to analyze and interact with out comprehensive global upstream data set to make faster data-driven commercial decisions.","We continue to be encouraged by the early results of Lens, but equally important is the fact that having a new and unique product in the marketplace has really energized our sales teams. This has translated into improving sales of our core research as well as strong growth in our breakout solutions, including subsurface, chemicals and the energy transition practice.","Our energy transition practice was previously known as power and renewables and this shift reflects our commitment to helping our clients cope with changes in the energy markets. In our PowerAdvocate business we are experiencing strong growth as we are helping our energy customers use data to more effectively spend their capital and save costs. We see opportunities to leverage the C-suite relationships from Wood Mackenzie to introduce PowerAdvocate at an enterprise-wide level and also to help bring our spend and cost solution.","One of my leading indicators of the health of our business is how we are doing with the new disruptive players in our verticals as well as the largest and most established players. We are doing well on both fronts. We continue to win new business with InsurTech as they find value in our full suite of solutions and we continue to see progress in the cross-selling of even more valuable solutions to the established leaders in all three of our verticals.","I spent several weeks in Asia recently visiting with client leaders across our verticals from Saudi Arabia to India to Japan. What struck me was how alert the CEOs of the leading companies around the globe are to data analytic innovation and their extreme interest in Verisk solutions. We see this driving an increasing level of inquiry and a growing pipeline of opportunities for our products.","I'm also pleased with the progress, we have made with respect to our infrastructure and analytic methods over the past 90 days. We continue to make steady progress in moving our computing infrastructure to the cloud.","In the past you've heard me talk about how cloud capacity grows in a linear fashion, whereas on-premise computing gets retired episodically at what I call shelves. Because of the great work of our team, we have now reached the first of those shelves and are seeing the expected efficiencies.","We will continue to pursue these infrastructure improvements and savings persistently by product over the next few years. The global expansion of our data science team is coming along nicely and we are delighted with the quality and capacity of our emerging data science team in Krak\u00f3w.","We are now out in the market with industry-standard insurance solutions that incorporate machine-learned methodologies which take the world of regulatory-ready methods to a whole new level.","On the strategic acquisition front our focus continues to be on adding valuable data sets within our existing verticals that can be leveraged across our enterprise to drive high returns on capital.","Genscape and BuildFax represent opportunities to both extend their businesses and enhance our existing products and relationships. Genscape is a market leader in sensed data for the power, oil and gas and maritime end markets. Genscape uses a network of sensors to gather for -- or near real time. We believe we can create value by combining Genscape's real-time short-term data set with WoodMac's longer-term asset valuation data sets.","We plan to develop new analytics solutions based on these combined data sets and ultimately see the data set incorporated into the Lens platform so that it can be seamlessly integrated into customers' workflows. We also see opportunities to cross-sell and expand into new client segments as there is limited customer overlap.","Ultimately, we believe that Genscape as a part of WoodMac will bolster our journey as the energy mix shifts toward more of a balance between molecule-based and electron-based.","BuildFax is a leading provider of proprietary condition and history data with a blue-chip customer base that is now part of our ISO underwriting business. We are excited to incorporate building property data and analytics solutions and see opportunities to develop new solutions as we partner with our insurance customers to help them drive their underwriting process to become quicker and more precise. We also see real opportunity to expand distribution and cross-sell BuildFax's core products across our customer base.","Finally I'd like to take a minute to clarify developments in the imaging space. In connection with the jury verdict and associated injunction related to the Geomni roof report business we have recorded a $125 million legal reserve. We were disappointed in the verdict and plan to appeal once we receive final judgment.","With respect to the current operations, the ruling pertains to only some of what we do in our Geomni unit and our roof report business represents about 1% of our annual revenues.","We are energetically working to develop a non-infringing alternative method to the current tech adjusting the cost structure over the next few quarters in light of the injunction. To that end, we are taking aggressive steps to minimize the negative impact on profitability and cash flow of the roughly $7 million in lost quarterly revenue and should see sequential progress over the next several quarters.","Perhaps the most important thing to note about our imagery business is the asset we have built in our image library and our image capture program. We now have a distinctive data asset on a national scale.","We continue to believe strongly that the combination of automated measurement through remote imagery and automated estimation and create great value for our insurance customers for Verisk and for our shareholders and remain committed to and is exciting about these technologies as ever.","Having gone through a number of specifics let me give you my overall assessment of where we stand. Our verticals are in great shape with a notable achievement of Energy and Specialized Markets exceeding Insurance's organic growth rate for the first time thus expanding our sticky recurrent subscription revenues.","Our technical infrastructure is becoming more efficient in real-time and the technical talent of our team has grown through tapping new talent sources. We've supplemented our data sets with two acquisitions that we can leverage across our enterprise. While we have lost the contribution to revenue growth provided by 1% of our revenue, we exit the quarter stronger than we entered it.","And now I'll turn the call over to Mark to provide some insights on our Insurance segment.","Mark Anquillare","Thank you, Scott. I'm pleased to share with you that we had another strong quarter in Insurance with all businesses looking to growth. Organic constant currency revenue growth of 7.7% was fueled by market-leading innovation and enhanced customer engagement. Our retention rates remain very high as we continue to focus on getting close to our customers and delivering a best-in-class customer service experience.","During the quarter, underwriting and rating delivered strong organic constant currency revenue growth across both personal and commercial lines underwriting, extreme event modeling, and industry-standard insurance programs.","We continue to see great success in market share gains in personal lines due to the strong sales of our LightSpeed Auto suite of products. We're excited about the new sales and growing pipeline for our data-forward LightSpeed platform, extended into small commercial and personal property.","In the industry standard insurance programs, we're experiencing growth in customer accounts. We've had success winning engagements with new start-ups and InsurTech. In extreme event modeling, we're experiencing solid demand for our detailed models, driven by signings with new clients as well as expanding relationships with existing clients. We're also seeing increased interest in some of our newer solutions including our global resilience practice which works with governments and NGOs.","During the quarter, we hosted several successful seminars for our catastrophe modeling business in Auckland, Sydney, London, and Zurich that touch more than 350 clients and prospects.","And in October, we hosted Verisk Velocity, our signature event for underwriting and rating. The event focused on the future of the insurance industry with an eye towards digitization and automation of the insurance process. The conference attendance increased 46% versus last year as we attracted attendees from 130 insurance companies from around the world.","Feedback was positive from participants. We're excited about the direction of our new solutions and our thought leadership in the property and casualty insurance industry. The agenda feature presentations and panel discussions by industry-thought leaders and allowed Verisk to showcase our latest pipeline InsurTech solution.","In fact, our customers are telling us that they look to Verisk to drive forward the innovation agenda because we not only develop leading solutions, but we can back them up with financial strength in a long and stable operating history. The claims business also delivered solid growth with contributions from claims analytics, repair cost estimating, remote imagery, and our international businesses.","As Scott mentioned, we're seeing nice success with our visualized ClaimSearch platform, which is delivering significant growth in usage and positive sentiment in customers. The platform offers customers improvements like real-time analytics, improved security and privacy protection, fast delivery, and is seamlessly integrated into workflows and claim systems.","On the international side, we're seeing solid growth from recent acquisitions like Validus in claims subrogation solution and ENI, claims automation, and fraud detection solution. They're now part of organic.","A steady stream of first-to-market innovations is one of the four distinctives at Verisk and also a key driver of our growth. In the quarter, we announced several exciting new initiatives including the launch of our Sequel product suite in the U.S. The early feedback from the market is positive and the pipeline of interest from among our specialty commercial customers is robust.","We also announced solutions in new partnerships within the life insurance market. These solutions utilize the most advanced data analytic methods including advanced voice analytics, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and will enable Verisk to develop new benchmarking risk-scoring solutions that can help life insurance on direct policies and managed portfolio risk with increased speed and precision.","With that, let me now turn it over to Lee to cover the financials.","Lee Shavel","Thanks Mark. First I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. The presentation provides background, data trends, and analysis to support our conversation today.","Moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 9% to $653 million. In the current quarter, we incurred some significant non-operating expenses including firstly, the $125 million litigation reserve related to our remote imagery business; secondly, $29 million in acquisition-related earnout expenses as many of our acquisitions are on target to achieve payments for exceptional performance; and thirdly, a $6 million loss generated from the sale of our retail analytics solutions business, which was previously part of our Financial Services segment. In light of these expenses, net income and diluted GAAP EPS decreased approximately 80% to $33 million and $0.20 per share respectively.","Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items including currency fluctuations, acquisitions for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons, acquisition-related costs including earn-outs, dispositions and non-recurring items including the litigation reserve, remained solid.","On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 7.6% in the third quarter of 2019, reflecting organic growth across all three segments and delivering on our long-term target of 7% growth.","Of our three segments, Energy and Specialized Markets recorded the fastest growth, while Insurance also delivered solid results. This was offset in part by softer growth within Financial Services. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.7% demonstrating organic constant currency margin expansion, while also continuing to invest in future growth opportunities within our business.","Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 47.4%, flat with the prior year period. This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenue and EBITDA. Acquisitions decreased total adjusted EBITDA points in the period. On an organic basis and particularly on the pre-investment organic basis that we've discussed before, we saw a margin expansion demonstrating the exceptional operating leverage at the core of our businesses.","On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 7.7% revenue growth, while adjusted EBITDA increased 7.9%. Within our underwriting and rating business, growth was very broad across our solution sets in personal lines and commercial lines.","We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, LightSpeed auto suite of products, property-specific underwriting and catastrophe model solutions revenue. We also had positive contributions from our international business. Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance in claims analytics, repair cost estimating solutions, remote imagery solutions and international markets.","Total adjusted EBITDA margin declined 25 basis points to 53.1% from 53.3% in the prior year period, reflecting leverage in our core business more than offset by investment in future growth opportunities and acquisitions.","Our fastest-growing segment was Energy and Specialized Markets, which delivered revenue growth of 8.7% for the quarter, representing record growth for that segment. Strong growth in market and cost intelligence solutions, as well as noted improvement in our core research and consulting revenues, drove the growth.","Despite volatility in the oil price and recent geopolitical events in the quarter, we continue to see a stable macro mat with new and innovative platforms that help our customers more efficiently drive revenue growth and deliver cost savings.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 10.9%, reflecting leverage on solid sales balanced with ongoing investments in breakout opportunities like Lens and our chemicals, subsurface and energy transition practice. Total adjusted EBITDA margin grew to 33.3% from 31.7%.","Financial Services revenue increased 2.7% in the quarter, led by solid growth in enterprise data management and fraud and credit risk management solutions. This was offset in part by decreases in portfolio management from non-recurring consulting revenues as well as some pushouts of certain projects.","Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3.5% and total adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 32.8% from 35.5%. We have discussed previously the journey we are on to transition this business from a top-down orientation to a bottoms-up approach, with an emphasis on steady growth.","Change at scale is never linear and as we work through this process we will continue to see quarterly fluctuations on revenue and growth, which are higher than in our other business segments. That said, we are confident in the long-term potential of financial services as we set the business up on a stronger foundation.","In the third quarter of 2019, the company completed an additional $200 million issuance of our 4.125 percentage senior notes due 2029 at an issuance price of 110.9% for an effective yield of 2.78%, into a fourth amendment to our revolving credit facility which reduced the borrowing capacity to $1 billion from $1.5 billion, extended the maturity date to August 15, 2024 and amended the pricing grid with lower rates and improved economics.","Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter down 3.2% from the prior year quarter due to the net repayments of our revolving credit facility. Total reported debt was $2.7 billion at September 30 unchanged from the year-end of 2018. Our leverage at the end of the quarter -- of the third quarter 2019 was 2.4 times.","Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $312 million at September 30, 2019. Our reported effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter compared to 13.9% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of a lower level of option exercises and nondeductible earnout expenses in the current -- period.","We maintain our estimate of our effective tax rate in the full year 2019 to be between 19% and 21%. Adjusted net income was $186 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.12 for the third quarter, up 2.6% and 3.7% respectively. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a decrease in interest expense and lower share count. The benefits were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a higher effective tax rate.","Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter down 5.7% from the prior year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $780 million year-to-date, up 2.5% from the prior year. Capital expenditures were $61 million for the quarter, up 10.1% from the prior year and CapEx represented 9.3% of total revenue in the quarter.","We now expect capital expenditures to come in at the low end of the $220 million to $240 million range, we provided for 2019. Free cash flow was $153 million for the quarter a decrease of 10.8% from the prior year, primarily due to higher income tax payments associated with a lower level of option exercises and timing differences related to the payment of certain expenses.","Free cash flow was $627 million year-to-date, an increase of 3.4% from the prior year. During the third quarter we returned -- reserves through share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 491,000 shares at a weighted average price of $152.84 for a total cost of $75 million.","At September 30, we had $228 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we initiated a new $50 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the fourth quarter.","And on September 30, we paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. This year, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on December 31, 2019 for shareholders of record on December 13, 2019.","We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and continue to manage capital prudently through internal investment strategic acquisitions and the return of capital to shareholders, being confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term.","We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning gentlemen. My first question is just broadly around innovation and I guess the existing contribution from those products. You mentioned a lot on the call today. And I think recently you launched the cyber data exchange court side etcetera, etcetera.","Is there any way to parse out like how much of the last several years innovation is contributing to the revenue growth today?","Scott Stephenson","It's kind of hard to separate the effects Manav and reason is that, some of the innovation shows us as an entirely unique product with a very discrete revenue stream, but it also shows up as increased penetration of an existing product or price realization related to an existing product.","So it actually shows up in several places and an example of that would be the Lens platform which is supportive of \u2013 solutions, but also represents a discrete revenue stream in and of itself.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. Scott, you discussed the impact of the litigation with regard to Geomni. But could you just give us a sense of if you feel the future opportunity is reduced? Or I know you mentioned you're trying to find non-infringing ways to address the roofing opportunity. But are you shifting some focus to the non-roofing opportunities? Or just I guess, how should we think about the future here?","Scott Stephenson","So we've always been interested in remote imagery for a whole variety of reasons and actually those reasons relate to use cases, which are even beyond the insurance vertical and we're -- well. So first of all by way of context what we do is a lot more than just roof reporting.","And we remain very interested in the category. We think that imaging remotely and then being able to in a very automated way translate what you've seen with the sensor is just -- that's an important technology for the world going forward, and we're intending to participate in it. We have participated in it and there are a number of ways to monetize the imagery itself. And so, no, I don't think that our opportunity is -- we don't see it any differently than we did.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you.","Scott Stephenson","Welcome. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra. Your line is open.","Ashish Sabadra","Thanks for taking my question. Can you just help size the annualized revenues for the two acquisitions Genscape and BuildFax? And then also just talk about the historic growth and margin profile for these two acquisitions. Thanks.","Lee Shavel","Yeah. Ashish thanks for the question. We haven't broken out the revenues for those acquisitions separately. It will become organic. We're still closing Genscape and expect that within the next couple of weeks. But I would expect for the organic components incorporated in the fourth quarter results where you begin to get some sense of the scale of that.","Ashish Sabadra","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas [ph]. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, Morning. Just wanted to stick with the Genscape acquisition. I was -- I know you guys gave some good color in your remarks and I appreciate that. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the product set, how it's complementary to your existing business potentially with an example. And then any synergies we can think about in pairing that with the Verisk business as it stands today? Thanks.","Scott Stephenson","Sure. So first of all just -- I want to make sure everybody understands the breadth of what we do in the energy space. So we work with oil and gas companies on a global basis. We work with those who are producing the alternatives in terms of the renewables and we also work with electric utilities.","So I wanted to sell that -- to say that the way that the Genscape business got built was by creating sensors, which actually talk about real-time flows in those ecosystems. So, for example, there are sensors that are literally measuring the amount of current running through the transmission line. There are sensors, which are literally metering the flow of liquefied natural gas for example.","And these real-time data sets, we think are very complementary to the data sets we've already got. So in what we do with Wood Mackenzie, we have really good granular operating data, for example, from the wellhead. But it's not as real-time as these other data sets that we're talking about.","So now pull those two data sets together and provide even more of a perspective about what's happening commodity by commodity, location by location. And we just know that that's going to be valuable for our customers.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","Yeah, thanks good morning. So, Scott you've been talking for a while now probably a couple of years about just the work you're doing with your technology infrastructure moving where appropriate to the cloud. You've also alluded to some efficiencies there and obviously, a lot of discussion of innovation. So can you just take a step back for us and talk about how you see the cloud and where you are in the process number one?","Number two, what you see the long-term opportunity? As I'm sure you're aware a number of your information services for have actually proven out meaningful cost saves but also have seen the ability to accelerate their innovation efforts by getting more of their data into the cloud and hooking customers into that. So, are you on that same path? Do you see those same opportunities? And where exactly are you today? Thank you.","Scott Stephenson","Yes. So, we -- yes, I mean so you really had there Gary the two categories of benefit that arise from rotating our infrastructure into the cloud. So, one of them has to do with agility and that has to do with we can compute anywhere around the world literally by going to our say AWS dashboard and turning on new servers. It's that easy and it's that fast.","So, the ability to spin up new products I would also say that our customers are increasingly interested in being able to interact with what we provide in a whole variety of ways.","To the extent that what they're interested in is the sort of API on demand kind of approach then being already platforms in the cloud just makes it even that easier for them to attach to it. So, you've got all those benefits and then you've got cost benefits.","And so we're very much in pursuit of both of those. With respect to where we are in the journey, so you're right. We've been talking about it for a couple of years. It's a lot of heavy lifting and it does play out over time.","So, what I said in my remarks earlier is we've reached the first shelf. So, we've seen the first return of efficiency on the investments we've been making in moving to the cloud. There will be several more shelves over the course of the next couple of years. And so we feel very good about where we are.","I'll just say that we have a very close relationship with one of the cloud provider -- convenient to sort of dig in, especially with one of them. And they give us a lot of feedback that says that we're actually in advanced implementation of cloud computing at the scale that we're doing it.","So, we -- there's a -- we still have a good distance to go. Actually I look forward to the next shelves. But in the meantime, I'm very pleased with the work that our team is doing.","Lee Shavel","And Gary this is Lee. Just to supplement that a bit. And one thing that I want to make certain that everyone understands is that this is a discipline in a process. It's not a monolithic project where you do every -- a hundreds of individual products that need to be the data sets the applications need to be moved to the cloud. The code needs to be optimized for the cloud and so it is an ongoing process.","What I can assure you is that the economics are very good both from an OpEx standpoint and from a CapEx standpoint. We are taking this with some kind of key projects that we've demonstrated what we can accomplish and that's guiding us in the future projects ahead.","So, we think this will be a very clear uplift for us from a capital efficiency and from a margin perspective that will factor into our ability to further enhance our operating leverage across the business. But I want to make sure that everyone has an appreciation. This is something that you literally have to go product-by-product in order to make sure that you're fully realizing the potential.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler. Your line is open.","Jeff Meuler","Yes, thank you. I wanted to ask about Energy and Specialized Markets and just make sure I'm not missing anything but it feels like the phrase solid improvement is underselling how good the numbers look to me. And when you describe it, I hear a lot of positive factors that sound recurring with I guess PowerAdvocate, cross-selling, the improvement in research and consulting and the Lens benefits.","So, is there any significant one-time revenue from consulting? Or I don't know if there's PowerAdvocate success fees or anything like that in the quarter. Or just curious on kind of the way you're characterizing the performance of that business. Thanks.","Lee Shavel","Yes. Thank you Jeff. We're obviously pleased with the results. I think I would try to break it down a bit by saying we saw solid improvement in those WoodMac -- in both the subscription and the consulting revenues at WoodMac. So, there was progress there.","And PowerAdvocate is clearly contributing and I would say had -- is having an exceptional 2019 as a result from some very good pipeline build at the end of 2018 and into 2019. And so part of driving through, we are seeing that reflected both in some of the implementation revenue as well as the subscription revenue, but over time we will expect to see a higher percentage of that kind of core subscription and recurring revenue within it.","Again, it's still primarily recurring revenue, but we are at the front end of some of their success early in the year in bringing new clients onto their solutions platform.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. I wonder Mark or Lee, if you could just remind us about the macro exposure and insurance. And I'm thinking about two factors: one, generally a hardening P&C market to the extent we go into that kind of environment, how that might affect the insurance business; and then two, if you could just give us an update on cat modeling. We heard one of your competitors perhaps if the reinsurance market continues to soften. Doesn't seem appearing in your results, but I'm just wondering if you could weigh in sort of at a high level on those items?","Mark Anquillare","Sure. So let me try to take those and you already ask them. So first of all, I think the general macro environment has been -- needs to be positive. There is a hardening in the market, especially around some of the commercial lines. Over the years, we have distanced our pricing from the actual premium. So if you have this history, I will tell you we are much more thoughtful about long-term contracts and -- but there is a little bit of a pull associated with more premium and there's more utility of the solutions.","So, there's a little more value on pricing that we would gain. But I think the bigger macro trend is as the markets harden everyone is kind of focused on the top line and growing it profitably. So the use of our solutions, I think continues to expand. People look to go into different lines and grow. And purchase is more easily -- it's easier to get through procurement in an environment where growth is happening.","So those are kind of the general trends that affect us inside the market. I would also tell you from a macro perspective the industry is very much focused on big data analytics. So we're right in the wheelhouse there. They're focused on automation. They're trying to become more efficient. There's a lot of technology projects in search of automation. That works to our advantage as well.","And finally, where we're trying to play more is inside the world of digitization. They're trying to make sure that their digital engagement with their policyholders continues to grow. And we had some solutions that help them.","I don't want to make this too long. On the sort of reinsurance side, we do see an opportunity or at least more consolidation among reinsurers. When that happens, it does cause a little bit of a challenge as we kind of renegotiate with the combined entity.","But generally, we have seen increased engagement with insurers and reinsurers on the extreme event modeling side of things. There has been kind of a little bit of a turn, where people are coming and moving towards our AR models and that is a broad kind of industry trend that we are very happy with and I think they recognize the power of the Touchstone platform that Scott was referring to earlier. I hope that responds to your question.","Andrew Jeffrey","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of George Tong. Your line is open.","George Tong","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Scott with respect to the EagleView ruling you've indicated that you're working to adjust the cost structure of Geomni. My understanding is that Geomni is running at a loss. Just to confirm are you planning to taper your breakout investment spend in Geomni? Or are you planning to stay the course but redirect your investments elsewhere in aerial imagery?","Lee Shavel","Yeah. So George, thanks for the question. So as we described recognizing that we have this impact on the roof report revenue, our objective is to look for efficiencies that we can achieve in reducing the costs related to that dimension of the business. And again, that's just a part of the business in order to minimize the impact of that revenue -- the revenue loss.","At the same time, as Scott described, our commitment to the technology, our investment in the broader application of that business will continue. So we're trying to accomplish both of those, maintaining that commitment exploring the other applications and developing those dimensions, while at the same time offsetting as much as possible on that loss of revenue.","George Tong","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Christopher Campbell. Your line is open.","Christopher Campbell","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just kind of a follow-up question on the Geomni question before. Is there -- I'm assuming that the margins are lower in the Geomni roof than your legacy P&C business. So with, like, kind of the rightsizing of this business, would that be accretive for Insurance segment margins?","Scott Stephenson","Well, we're not making a forward statement about where the margins are going. But what I will say is, it has been a category of heavy investment on our part. And one of the things I was trying to emphasize in my comments upfront, because we made a lot of investments in image capture. We now have a national image capture capability.","Lee Shavel","And I would confirm your assumption that on some of the non-roof report legacy businesses, that those were positive margin businesses and that the -- in development on the roof report, given the scaling up of those expenses, we're -- as we've indicated before, had a negative impact overall to our margins as we were in investment phase. So I think that observation is accurate.","Christopher Campbell","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what the second shelf that you're referring to looks like, either from a margin or cash flow perspective. And what are the puts and takes on the margin side as we head into 2020?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. So maybe, Lee, you'd like to conclude and respond to that. But I'll just open by saying that there are really sort of two discrete things that go on as we hit these shelves. So one of them is -- and I'm pretty sure we've talked about this before, there's been a mainframe intensity to the way that we compute at Verisk.","That's because of our long legacy as an extremely data-rich company. And when this company first got going the mainframe configuration was very definitely the logical way to try to manage large data sets. But that's not true anymore. There has been change there.","So one of the shelf-creating developments is when we retire mainframe capacity and that is an ongoing activity. So that's one. And then, the second is, when we close data centers and that also will contribute shelves at moments in time as we go forward.","There are really no trade-offs, actually. I mean, in -- as I've said before, obviously, we build in a linear way the cost associated with cloud computing. But when I say there are no trade-offs I'm really saying two things. One is, the unit economics of computing in the cloud are just superior, period.","But the second thing is, actually, and Lee mentioned this when he took on the topic before, we actually are taking this opportunity to think about the very nature of our platforms. Literally, how does the calculation work? And as we move things up into the cloud, we're actually sort of peeling open the applications and reconsidering, you do this, you do this, then you do that, are there ways to be more efficient in capacity.","And so, it's actually a very constructive exercise. We just have to continue to be vary in touch with the way that the algorithms tool and the way that the -- the very nature of our data and how we put together our data sets. So there are no trade-offs. Actually, it's constructive microeconomically. It's constructive in terms of responsiveness to customers. And actually, we're just treating it as a journey to tighten up a lot of things about the way that we operate.","Mark Anquillare","And the only thing that maybe I'll use, tiers or shelves, there's a lot of investment that's required to do it right, right? You need to make sure you tune the application, so you use the cloud properly, so you don't overuse the processing time and effort. And as you transition, besides kind of this code rewrite, you're also taking advantage of cheaper database management systems and things like that.","So there's a ramp-up of cost before you see the benefit. And some of those are kind of trading off inside of our P&L and CapEx. And I just want to share that perspective with you about the timing of the shelves.","Joseph Foresi","From a quantitative perspective on, what the margins -- what this means for margins, going forward? I would assume that, Geomni kind of continuing to be more and more profitable and the data centers shifts going on.","And we're moving towards the second shelf, that the margins would naturally start to improve. But I just don't want to get ahead of myself from a modeling perspective. Thanks.","Lee Shavel","Yeah. So let me try to kind of give some context around that. So, I think, what you heard in Scott and Mark's comments are, that yes there certainly is a cost savings in terms of achieving the shelves. But also it is kind of the net effect of taking on the cloud costs, and then also optimizing the business.","And so, there is a complicated dimension to this. I want to underscore one thing. There clearly is a margin opportunity for us. But it consists both of greater OpEx efficiency, but also overall improvement in the operating leverage of the business itself in terms of what the applications can do and their ability to integrate other data and expand that.","And again adding another layer of complexity, we have a large number of products and businesses that we are moving to the cloud of how applicable cloud is to what they do, and with different time lines.","And so, it is impossible to extract what the quantum of that margin improvement is. We're learning as we go with each individual project tackling the biggest ones first. But we will see that positive margin improvement that we manage as part of our overall core objective of increasing margin over time. And then also investing that margin expansion to some level, where we are investing in future growth.","So, there is a lot of that. But it is clearly a very strong component of what will allow us to grow our core operating leverage further. And I know it would be great if we could provide some quantification. But it's just too large a project. And too complex for us to pin that to a specific number.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington. Your line is open.","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone.","Lee Shavel","Hi, Bill.","Bill Warmington","So a question for you on Financial Services, the -- just wanted to ask about the product push outs, whether those go into Q4 or whether they're going into 2020? Or is it indefinite. And then, sort of along those lines on the EDM transition to more of a subscription model, what inning are we in there?","Lee Shavel","Bill on the push outs I think, we had some of the third quarter revenues. And some of them are longer development products that got pushed out into the fourth quarter. There were some that I think they pushed out into 2020. So I think a combination there.","And with regard to EDM, I think it is still a development project for us. We continue to see a very strong response from customers. And we're dealing with really substantiating this as a broader opportunity within the business on a client-by-client basis.","So very early stage, but everything that we have seen and continues to keep us enthusiastic about this as a core service, that is additive to our most important and largest clients.","Bill Warmington","Well, thank you very much.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Presenters, you may proceed.","Scott Stephenson","Yeah. Thank you. So, thanks everybody for joining us. Appreciate the questions, and the dialogue will be following up with several of you. And have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"21509":["Verisk Analytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSK) Q3 2015 Earnings Call October 28, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Eva F.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's SVP and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.","Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President and Treasurer","Thank you, Jackie, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2015 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer.","Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.","The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance.","Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Eva. Good morning, everybody. Before we turn to our third quarter results, I want to highlight two recent milestones in our journey. Forbes included Verisk in its list of the World's 100 Most Innovative Companies, and Verisk was added to the S&P 500 index. Both of these achievements are recognition of the foundation that's been created over decades and the hard work being done by our colleagues to add value for our customers every day, and evidence of excellence at scale.","Yesterday, we announced the exploration of strategic alternatives for our healthcare analytics business. We've spent much time and thoughtful consideration of how Verisk Health fits within the broader Verisk. Our process of exploration has been underway for over a year and we are running a deliberate process. Verisk Health is an excellent business with a large market opportunity. Given our strategy and global ambitions, along with current market valuations per assets of its type and quality, we may have an opportunity to both refine our strategic focus at Verisk. We will update you on the strategic process in the future.","Now on to some high-level results.","In the third quarter, we delivered strong overall results with total revenue growth of 23% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 33%. Profitability was strong with adjusted EBITDA growth of 32% and margins that continue to be industry leading. We grew the top line, excluding the healthcare analytics business and recent acquisitions, over 7%. On that basis, and excluding the gain on the sale of third-party warrants, adjusted EBITDA grew about 10%. We are well-positioned to execute in the future, and we'll have more to say about that at our upcoming Investor Day in December.","As we think about long-term shareholder value and capital allocation, an essential filter for us is the set of distinctives, which are part of the Verisk way. These distinctives are: one, unique data assets; two, domain expertise; three, first-mover advantage; and four, deep embedment in customer workflows. These distinctives define successful data analytics businesses and will continue to inform our approach, and our long-standing approach for the allocation of capital, which is a mix of acquisitions and share repurchases.","We also remain focused on delevering to our long-term target of 2.5 times by December 2016 with progress in the third quarter. Even as we delever, we have flexibility to make acquisitions and return capital to our shareholders through repurchases of our stock. Our existing authorization at the end of the quarter was about $190 million.","I'd like to make several remarks about Wood Mackenzie. This is a very unusual moment in the oil and gas industry. Even though a challenging energy market has increased the demand for WoodMac's analyses, our customers have reacted to the current circumstances by being very careful with all forms of spending, ranging from capital expenditure to more discretionary services.","We have certainly felt that impact most strongly seen in our non-subscription revenues, which have softened at this moment, and somewhat sooner than we had anticipated. And yet, I believe the true quality of WoodMac is shining through particularly brightly right now because of the current challenges.","This is a highly moded business providing must-have content to customers and doing so in ways that highly engage our customers. As a result, the challenging circumstances notwithstanding, WoodMac has grown 7% year-to-date. I find that to be extraordinary performance under extreme circumstances, and I couldn't be prouder of my WoodMac colleagues. This business is even better than I thought it was at the time we bought it.","Renewal rates are extremely high, same-store use of our content is up around 25% year-over-year, channels for distributing our product are expanding and customers are being well-served. It is my view that the moat around this business is widening at this moment.","When customer spending patterns return to normal, we will be an even stronger partner to our customers and our growth will reflect this. In the intermediate and long term, I continue to expect this business to produce strong growth that equals or exceeds that of Verisk overall.","An investment analyst recently said it well. Businesses like ours are about very strong end-market positions and compounding organic growth. WoodMac has proven that even in unusual and challenging circumstances, it can deliver both.","I can also report that we are beginning to see all of the benefits that we expected, in addition to WoodMac's own performance. The integration of WoodMac and Maplecroft has been achieved, and we are beginning to see the first examples of cross selling. WoodMac is serving as the hub of our supply chain thinking, and we have added oil industry experts to accelerate our work there. WoodMac's global footprint is being used to strengthen and integrate the overseas operations of other parts of Verisk, and we are collaborating well to extend Verisk's strengths with respect to core competencies like large scale data integration.","Speaking of which, at our upcoming Investor Day, you will hear more about our focus on our five core competencies, which are: number one, large scale data integration; number two, multitier, multispectral imaging; number three, data visualization and consumability with an emphasis on geolocation; number four, stochastic methods leading to prediction in complex environments; and number five, localization of solutions, including the sourcing of relevant local data.","During the past several months, our progress advancing our competencies agenda was well-aligned with the distinctives, as you would expect. For example, we announced General Motors, through its subsidiary OnStar, as the first auto manufacturer to sign on to the Verisk Telematics Exchange. Auto insurers will have expanded access to connected-car data in an easily useful format, paving the way for new and innovative usage-based insurance programs. Insurers that have their own telematics models will also be able to connect to the exchange for data about their consenting customers. The exchange will create new opportunities for customers who choose to deepen their relationship with auto manufacturers.","More recently, we announced a new ISO ClaimSearch integration model for claim system vendors. The model provides claims handlers an unprecedented interactive view of over one billion industry claims and allows them to navigate seamlessly across a series of interactive analytics in order to improve efficiency.","This deep claims systems integration represents an important evolution of real-time claim analytics and processing and is an important part of a multiphase project to create a more intuitive, robust ISO ClaimSearch System that offers cutting-edge solutions fully integrated throughout the life of the claim.","Finally, AIR is collaborating with leading security, risk and cyber data providers to build an advanced cyber risk model to help the insurance industry better manage the evolving threat of cyber attacks. AIR will leverage terabytes of data gathered by a partner from sensors deployed across the Internet.","Another partner has provided AIR with historical infinite data on more than 16,000 breaches. In addition to probabillistic loss estimation, the AIR Cyber Risk Model will offer a set of deterministic scenarios that will allow companies to begin to truly understand their aggregated risk from large-scale cyber attacks.","We will continue to build out our solutions to benefit our customers in the industries we serve, further developing the core competencies aligned with the Verisk ways for distinctives. We view these as critical foundations for the most successful data analytics businesses and a lens through which we have made and continue to make our capital allocation decisions. We're very confident in our path and our ability to execute.","So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Scott.","In the third quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing for the future. Revenue grew 22.7%. Organic revenue grew 7.3%, excluding the healthcare analytics business and recent acquisitions. EBITDA grew 31.9% to $279 million. EBITDA margins, excluding healthcare, acquisitions and a $15.6 million gain on the sale of third-party warrants, were over 50% for the quarter and year-to-date. Third-party warrants related to our ownership position in the EagleView.","Within Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 31.8% and 8.1% ex-healthcare and acquisitions in the third quarter. Decision Analytics insurance category revenue grew and led the organic growth in the quarter both in percentage and dollar terms. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 8.6% in the quarter. The increase was well-balanced across our solution areas and reflected the close integration of our teams as they serve our customers.","Financial Services revenue increased 7.3%, driven by continued underlying demand for our core solutions and services. Year-to-date growth was 30.2%, and as we noted last quarter, we continue to expect Argus to grow in the high-teens for the full year 2015. The underlying growth rate of the core business continues to track in the high-teens as well. The variability around the quarters has been driven by our activity in the media sect of this space, an area we continue to see opportunity to develop and monetize.","The healthcare business is tracking to our internal full year revenue and EBITDA forecast. It is an excellent business in a growing market. Energy and specialized revenue increased 5.6% on an ongoing basis, reflecting continued success in our environmental, health and safety business. Including the recently acquired WoodMac and Maplecroft businesses, growth in the category was over 400%. As a reminder, WoodMac's revenue contribution continues to be impacted by a purchase accounting reduction.","WoodMac's revenue, in pounds, grew 1% in the quarter and approximately 7% year-to-date through September. You'll recall that we indicated a conservative approach to our model for 2016 and into 2017. For the more discretionary part of the business, some of those headwinds materialized sooner than we had forecast.","However, despite these earlier-than-expected headwinds and because of the strength of the subscription business, we expect full year growth, in pounds, excluding deferred revenue impact, to be in the mid-single digits and modestly below our prior expectations. Including the adverse impact of the exchange rates, we expect WoodMac's reported revenue under our ownership for 2015 to be about $210 million, lower than we have previously discussed.","We continue to focus our efforts and resources on the long-term development of our business for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. We are pleased with the work that Wood Mackenzie and Maplecroft have begun to do together.","Risk Assessment revenue grew 6.4%, continuing to demonstrate the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Industry-standard insurance programs grew 6.7%, reflecting our 2015 invoices which were effective January 1, and continued contribution from newer solutions such as predictive models and Electronic Rating Content.","Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 5.2% in the quarter. This increase was driven by new sales and increased prices. As a reminder, sequential growth in the fourth quarter last year was higher than normal as a result of a few one-time items in the quarter.","As I mentioned earlier, EBITDA increased 31.9% in the quarter to $279 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.7%. Decision Analytics adjusted EBITDA increased 49% to $177 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions, growth in the business and lower professional services fees.","EBITDA margins for the healthcare analytics business were 27.6% in the quarter and 24.1% year-to-date. The third quarter 2015 EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 10.1% to $102 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management including the impact of lower cost resulting from the fourth quarter 2014 talent realignment.","Reported interest expense was $33 million in the quarter. Total debt, both short-term and long-term, was about $33.2 billion at September 30, 2015. Our leverage at the end of the third quarter was about 3 times. We remain committed to bringing the leverage down to 2.5 times by the end of 2016.","Our reported effective tax rate was 32% for the quarter. This rate reflects the benefits of our tax planning efforts and the lower foreign tax rates. Adjusted net income increased 35% to $146 million in the quarter. The intangible amortization in the quarter was lower than expected because of our updated valuation for the WoodMac-related intangibles and longer average useful lives. The longer lives reflects the unique proprietary and embedded nature of the WoodMac data.","The average diluted share count was 172.2 million shares in the quarter. On September 30, 2015, our diluted share count was 171.8 million shares. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.85 for the quarter, an increase of 32.8%. Excluding the gain on the sale of the warrants, adjusted EPS was $0.79.","Free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations less capital expenditures, increased 50.3% to $414 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 including WoodMac. This represented 56.5% of EBITDA. Capital expenditures increased 2.7% to $106 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 and were 7% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx to be about $170 million including WoodMac. As of September 30, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents were $169 million.","As you think about your models for the full year, including WoodMac purchase accounting from the time we closed, we now anticipate a diluted average weighted share count of 169 million shares, fixed asset appreciation and amortization of about $125 million and amortization intangibles of about $95 million, and we'll provide an update when the purchase accounting is finalized.","In addition, for the fourth quarter, based on the current debt levels, we expect interest expense to be about $32.1 million. For the intangible amortization add back and the adjusted net income calculation, we're using a 26% tax rate as we discussed last quarter. And finally, we expect the tax rate to be around 35% for fourth quarter of 2015.","Overall, we're pleased to report the WoodMac integration is proceeding ahead of schedule while executing our operational plans, and we're positioned well for profitable growth in the future.","With that, I'll turn it back to Eva for comment before the Q&A.","Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President and Treasurer","Great. Thank you, Mark. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us now, we would ask that you ask one question and one follow-up. That will give more people an opportunity to ask a question during the Q&A.","And with that, I'll open the line to the operator to open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair and Company. Your line is open.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Excuse me. Thank you. On Wood Mackenzie, can you just give a little more color? You, I guess, talked about non-subscription growth slowing, but did you see any slowdown, I guess, in the subscription side of the business, and I guess, any way you can help us kind of quantify more the different pieces impacting that?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We're not breaking out those two parts of the business, Tim. But I will say that the subscription revenue growth has held up very nicely, and the full year view and the quarterly view are both good and strong.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then in healthcare, I guess, one, your comment that it's tracking to your annual guidance or annual expectation, can you just elaborate? I think it was probably slower than most people expected, and maybe we had the wrong view. But is there anything that's changed in the environment, whether demand or competition wise? And secondarily, can you give us any sort of help with the profitability of that business as we think about the potential sale of it? Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So let me take the first part of that, Tim. So the comment that Mark made earlier was that the business is tracking with our expectations, meaning, our portfolio forecast for the business, and so that was his comment.","With respect to the business, the environment is relatively unchanged. The dynamic with the customers is relatively unchanged. As you know, there's seasonality in this business, and it's also the case that this business has more transaction volume than the rest of Verisk. And so you find the timing can play a role in what happens. And that's fundamentally where we sit at the moment.","So, Mark, you actually commented on healthcare EBITDA margins a moment ago. So maybe you want to come back around.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So just to clarify, the third quarter healthcare margins were 27.6%. So hopefully, you have that in your math and I just will reiterate strong business, competitive nature, has not changed, I think, we are still currently well-positioned into a very nice, big market.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Well, can I just ask is there any seasonality to that margin? I guess, as we think about the full year, I guess, a full year run rate or is that (20:01)?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So the healthcare analytics business in the third quarter was 27.6%. Historically, because of some additional volumes that we've seen for what we refer to as the Medicare side of things, it has been a little bit bigger, maybe margined a little bit better in the second half. Year-to-date, we're at 24.1%. I will tell you, though, there is a little bit of noise in there because of the transition of accounting from what we refer to as gross versus net. But hopefully those couple of factors will help you out.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So I guess, with regard to RA, which is doing very nicely, can you talk a little bit about the sustainability of that faster organic revenue growth, say 6%, 6%-plus, and what exactly is underpinning that improvement over what we've seen in the last few years? Is it all invoicing, or is there some specific customer ROI call outs that are driving that?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Definitely not just invoicing. This is the time of year where we actually set the pricing for the kind of the industry standard program, rules, forms, lost cost, the part of it that relates heavily to just the overall regulation and structure of the insurance industry. But we are working very hard to expand that suite of solutions, bringing new solutions to the market and growing newer forms of putting the content and the analysis out there.","So predictive models are growing very nicely. Electronic Rating Content is growing very nicely. We're searching for all opportunities to expand the business to international customers, and we've made headway on that front as well. So it's broadly based, and we're very optimistic about the future profile for this business.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And as a follow-up, just from a big picture, now that the strategic nature of healthcare is something you guys are thinking hard about, kind of down to three core businesses, in the long term, do you start to rebuild from there? Are you looking for new areas strategically long term that are a good fit or is this really probably the right sort of core business set with which Verisk runs going forward?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thank you for the question. And that is something that we've spent a lot of time on, and we feel very good about these three core verticals. And I think what you can expect from us is that we will continue to grow and expand inside of them. Our thesis is, and I referenced this in my comments up front, that there are things that make Verisk, Verisk; those four distinctives.","One of the things that I just feel so strongly about is Wood Mackenzie is absolutely aligned with those four distinctives. And we'll do a better job of both feeding off of core competencies that we have at Verisk, but also feeding them.","And so, for example, Wood Mackenzie is a business that definitely will benefit from our strong and growing expertise in multitier, multispectral imaging in a way that actually the healthcare business wouldn't. Another comment along the same lines is that the global energy business is inherently global, whereas healthcare will always remain a domestic business.","And so we think very hard about who is it that we want to be. And I think that the right way to frame us is the verticals, the distinctives and the core competencies that I laid out for you. And we feel that the three verticals that you focused on are very, very nice steps with that, with all of that.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So I just wanted to step back and just try to understand what changed, in a little bit more detail, so both WoodMac and healthcare. So with WoodMac, I mean, last quarter the energy environment was challenging as well, but it sounded like you guys were confident with the growth rate there. So trying to understand the delta there.","And on healthcare, I guess, I understand the rationale that it sounded like you said, you guys were looking at this over a year ago. But I think around that time, you guys were pretty committed to the long term, like selling it wasn't in the sights, and I think you had that focus on Investor Day. So I guess what I'm really trying to get at is from last quarter to today, what are the real changes that have led to the WoodMac result and the healthcare decision?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So in order. On WoodMac, the thing that I would call out for you is just that there are different profiles to how the energy market works basically, and we had said for some time that we thought that 2016 could represent some softness, and the question was what might be the timing. And we just found that the timing has been pulled forward a little bit, probably related to things that are going on with our customers as they make decisions about spending in light of the current environment. And it's really that simple.","On healthcare, we've been asking \u2013 well, we're always asking the question about the deployment of capital across everything that we do. So even a year ago, we were thinking critically about what are the highest and best uses of our capital and how does healthcare fit into that picture?","Since that time, what has happened? Well, there has been a public offering of a company that is very analogous to ours. There has been the activity in the healthcare M&A market generally. And we just take account of all of that basically, and with deliberation at a moment in time, we've drawn a conclusion about an exploration.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then just a quick follow-up. So just on WoodMac, how should we think about the trajectory of that 1% growth you called out in the quarter? Is that where your initial 2016 expectations were or was that even worse than maybe what you had modeled there?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So we're going to talk in more depth about WoodMac at our December Investor Day, and I would encourage everybody to come and be with us. But what I would point you to, as Mark put out there, our view for full year 2015 and that's what we've said about it so far.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President and Treasurer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","When you said that 2016 softness in WoodMac may have been pulled forward, I know you're not breaking out subs versus non-subs. But does that include some weakness being pulled forward on WoodMac bookings trends for the subscription business?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then on the healthcare decision to, I guess, explore, at least, the strategic alternatives announced last night, the disclosure or the timing of the disclosure, should we view that as being driven by press reports or by reaching some step in the process relatively recently? And if it's the latter, can you just comment on, and I know you've talked about the timing over the last year, but can you talk about the timing of reaching that conclusion just given how trends are right now as you think about maximizing value for your shareholders?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We've been in a long and deliberate discussion with our board. And the process has accounted for a lot of different things, a lot of different considerations and driven by our own considerations, definitely not by the press. Not at all. It's just in our own timing, we decided that we were comfortable making the statement that we made last night. But it was entirely our own thinking and developed, again, over a very \u2013 we've been talking with our board about this for some time.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, Scott.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Within WoodMac, could you just give us a better sense of what services clients are pulling back on, and also, just what types of customers are tightening their spending the most? Is it the NOCs or is it more broad-based?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'll start, and, Mark, you might want to jump in as well. So we have commented on the difference between the hardcore data analytic business and then the services, and it's definitely being felt on the services side.","The hardcore data analytic, which is subscription-based, has performed very nicely in this environment. With respect to within the customer base, there is some segments that are doing very nicely, actually. But it is among the companies in the industry, the oil companies themselves, and I would point particularly to NOCs and also the focused E&P players. That's where it's been felt most strongly.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I will just highlight, I think, something Scott said earlier. I think the silver lining, the good news in there, besides the subscription rates being extremely high, the renewals of those. We've seen a lot more usage. This is about what the analytics and the actual people looking at the content of about 25%. So you can clearly see the value of the solutions they provide despite what is an interesting time in the market.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, sorry. I just wanted to correct something I said. I didn't mean to say the NOCs. I meant to say the integrated global oil companies. National oil companies have actually been pretty strong in the current environment.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And just on healthcare, just looking at fourth quarter, like, should we expect sort of a similar expectation to what the growth in this quarter, is there any reason to think that it will be better than this quarter was? Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we've just tried to highlight that we did expect a deceleration in the second half of the year from a growth perspective. We are continuing to track internally. We think it's a very good business, very big market, and we have confidence in that team.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","(32:09 \u2013 32:13) usual about EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter, including healthcare. The way I just want to make sure I understand the third quarter number for EBITDA margin, the 50.7% includes warrants. So if I exclude the warrants of $15.6 million, gains in the third quarter was $47.8 million, right? And how should I be thinking about the fourth?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Your math is good. I got $47.9 million, but I'm sure we're probably just rounding. I would tell you that we continue to see a strength in the margins. I think you saw that in third quarter. There's operating leverage throughout. We do have beginning of some of the hiring that we had identified earlier on with that realignment inside of risk assessment. So some of those costs will come back into fourth quarter. I want to mention that. And I think the natural ebbs and flows of expenses as it relates to fourth quarter should feel generally like the third.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Bill.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So first question on healthcare, just to ask. If you go through this process and you do decide you want to sell the asset, what are your thoughts in terms of the use of the proceeds?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, you can expect from us the same approach that we've always taken, which is when we put out a leverage target, we're going to meet that leverage target. And then we continue to lean into the M&A agenda. That's our first best use for available funds. And we've always felt very good about the share buyback program, and you will continue to see that featured in our capital deployment as well.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And now the second question to ask about, financial services and Argus. Basically, if you could comment on the pipeline that you're seeing in demand for media effectiveness and then as you \u2013 I understand it's a lumpy business because of the project-related apportion of some of the revenue. So I'm trying to understand how we should think about the annual revenue, the growth rate for revenue on an annual basis.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Yeah. So the overall profile for Argus, when you account for all the different ways that this business can grow, it can grow internationally. It can grow by new customer acquisition for the existing solution. It can grow by more applied analytics for individual customers. It can grow by the expansion of the media effectiveness business.","All of those things are at work. All of those things are powering the performance of Argus. I expect Argus in 2016 and beyond to be the same Argus that you've known and that we've known. It is a very innovative team that is working on top of a very proprietary set of intellectual property assets and doing a great job with them. And so the outlook is completely unchanged.","And there is this somewhat lumpier quality that will be there from time-to-time when the very large, particularly, I would say, new media players get interested, their entry tends to have a pretty substantial effect and then it sort of normalizes as you go forward. So there probably will be lumps going forward, but the overall profile of the business is going to look very much like it has.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch","First, a question on Decision Analytics margin. When we adjust for the benefit of the healthcare pass-through revenue change and the investment gain, it looks like the underlying margins in that segment were down year-over-year. Could you talk about what might be driving that and whether or not we should continue throughout next quarter?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Let me take that. There was some reduction in the margins for the third quarter relative to last year when you do do that math. I would highlight that overall, margins are extremely strong. I think the Decision Analytics margin is based upon kind of the overall way the business is set up should, into the future, continue to grow. But obviously, a consistency to fourth quarter as you saw third quarter, that's probably a good parallel.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch","And is there anything that changed versus the first half of the year that would be driving that?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I mean, there's a few things that we did highlight up front. If you were to think about the Touchstone investments, some of the work that we're doing to kind of integrate platforms and bring Touchstone together, that is one item. The other thing is some OpEx and CapEx as we bring on new initiatives like the Telematics data exchange. There's cost in there that we need to incur now and revenue is following. So these are long-term investments that will prove fruitful for both our top line and bottom line in the future. But there's some cost to be undertaken.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW. Your line is open.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks, and good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Couple of questions here. You mentioned in the press release on healthcare that it'll give you the opportunity to pursue some of your global ambitions. I just wanted to know if you could talk a bit about that. Is that mostly on the insurance side and just see if there's any more color you can provide there?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So you're going to see the deployment of capital having a couple of characteristics going forward. One is it will be spread across everything we do at Verisk. So it's not going to be concentrated in any one part of the business. And the other thing that you'll see is that we are going to try to deploy the capital disproportionately in non-U.S. markets in order to support the expansion of everything that we do globally.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And this is Mark. So just trying to, and sorry to do this, but even to Sara's earlier question, some of the margins that you were referring to on last question, we have put some resources into international business development and, also, to localize our solution, so that we can attract and attack various international markets. So let me add that to be as the third bullet to some of the cost we incurred. Sorry for that, Scott.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No. Thanks.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And my second question is just back on to the tax rate. It was 32% this quarter. I think you guided to 35% for the fourth quarter. So it seems like it's starting to trend below the 36% we were expecting on the last call. I'm just wondering, where could that end up? Is there is still opportunity to improve that in 2016?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So this is Mark. We do believe that the rate, the effective rate, in the UK should come down by potentially a point come 2016. So that would add to the, from a balance or weighting perspective, that should add to some good news in 2016. And I think we'll try to provide you a little bit guidance as we get closer to 2016 with what our expectations are.","So a little bit down, but still we're pretty much a U.S. taxpayer with a lot of footprint in New York, New Jersey, California and Massachusetts. So the U.S. operations kind of come with high state tax rates.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks for that.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much. In the 10-K, when you're talking about the lower growth in healthcare, you say that it was due to changes in our customer contract language in the healthcare revenue category. Can you elaborate a bit on this? Is that something that just happened in the third quarter, and is that something that's going to impact growth going forward? Thanks.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I think what we're referring to there is with a customer beginning, like, first quarter of this year, we went from basically a gross accounting for certain services to net accounting. So we did not want to, for the most part, continue to provide the service. We went to a third party. So we transitioned because of the contract, because of the nature of the contract. The bottom line, let me say, did not change. The EBITDA did not change. I think this is just the notion of how we account for it, gross versus net, from a revenue perspective.","Same contracts, same revenues, same pricing, it was just simply the nature of the relationship caused a change in the accounting methodology.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And I'm sorry. Roughly, what was the impact this quarter?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hang on. Give me a second here. Maybe David can follow-up with you, but I do believe that it was probably about $10 million to $11 million, but we'll get back to you.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. I'll follow-up on that. And then just one question on WoodMac. Sorry. You had mentioned that you're looking for I think it was $210 million in revenue contribution on a dollar GAAP basis. It was lower than it was before. Can you just remind us what it was before?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We were at $225 million.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. I first wanted to ask about the expectations for the Telematic exchange even though I know it's not supposed to launch until summer 2016. I was wondering what is the go-to-market and how you actually plan to charge insurance companies for this service. And then given it's really not until 2016, how much still needs to happen? Is it still primarily development work that needs to be done or is it just signing people up, et cetera?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me start with the answer of kind of what we're doing and where we're at and then Mark can talk about the revenue model.","So we are in the process of actually dimensioning the data sets and the UX so that our insurance customers can make use of the data that we'll be compiling inside of the data set. So there is root and branch work which is going on right now, and Mark mentioned that before and I'll just mention more.","Here's the general theme where Verisk is concerned. I think we're doing a very good job of running the business tightly, which I think you can see in the margins. And we're doing that at a moment where, actually, the software intensity of a number of our businesses is actually going up. And so it's kind of a fine balancing act, but I actually feel very strongly positive about the way our operation has been able to actually raise efficiency while, at the same time, actually deepening investment in some of these ways.","So there is root and branch development work of all of the processes associated with extracting, transforming and loading the data then the management of the data inside of the exchange and then the return of the analytic to the user community. That is going on. That's part of between now and December 2016.","The other thing I would comment on is, as you would imagine, when the announcement was made of our partnership with General Motors, it created quite a stir among all the OEMs. And so there is a very brisk set of conversations going on right now with the other OEMs. The focus at the moment is the U.S. But our hope is that with time, having built out this capability in the United States, we will be able to work with the same OEMs, particularly those that are not headquartered in the United States, and bring the same method into other markets.","So I think you can think of it as two streams of development going on at the moment for the domestic market, the infrastructure and the participation of the other OEMs. And then subsequent to that, there will be a pushing out globally with respect to all of that. So that's kind of what we're doing with the business. Mark, do you want to talk a little bit about the revenue model?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So what we've put in place is really this wonderful consortium model that will ramp up for those people who choose or opt in. What we do expect to do is monetize this by providing this very useful N+1 type data to our insurer customers in, really, two forms. We'll play the part of if you need the data like we would serve that up to them. But what we also do have the opportunity to do is provide a lot of analytics around that.","So as you know, we have some very interesting Telematics scoring models, whether it's about the behavior of the driver or about the location in which that drive happens from point A to point B. All of that factors into the underwriting and pricing of the risk, meaning the pricing of the policy.","So we have an opportunity to provide those analytics along with the data to our customers. And I think we have a very unique position to aggregate a lot of industry data in a very unique way. So I feel pretty excited about the opportunity here and the relationship to bring basically all of these OEMs together with the insurance industry and be the hub of that consortium.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","As a follow-up, I know you've talked in the past about the efforts to build up the imagery capabilities and you've listed out a number of areas that you hope to talk about at your Analyst Day. But just wondering, any detail about how you're thinking about that today, given it has been something you talked about in the past would be helpful.","And as we think about cost, I was wondering what the impact these investments in that effort are having on costs. And should we see a step up or a step down from current levels over time as you roll those out?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So our interest level remains very high. And our goal is to have a number of use cases. Some of the most important use cases in the nearer term relates to the insurance industry. And we've already actually seen our ability to create material revenue streams in what we're doing. But to my way of thinking, we're still kind of right at the beginning, basically.","Our methods are very good. Our methods will be expanding because, as you know, sort of the heart of the paradigm today is to make use of an image coming from the belly of a plane 2,000 feet or 3,000 feet above the ground. When we say multitier, multispectral imaging, we're talking about using an image from a satellite, which is 30 miles to 50 miles up a plane, an unmanned aerial vehicle. And something else which is going to be occurring going forward will be the use of handheld devices to also provide imagery.","We're not very far away from the day when all of us may use our handheld device to image the interior of the places where we live. And that information also can potentially be used in the insurance process. And then there are a lot of other use cases: the solar industry; municipalities; and on and on.","So I think we're just at the beginning of this march. We have made efforts, and we continue to make efforts to step up the availability of relatively precise aerial imagery today because that relates to today's use case. I think what you're going to find from us is that with time, the relative importance of the other forms of imagery will go up, and so the mix will probably modify as we go forward.","With respect to the cost of sourcing aerial imagery today, we are sourcing more images and it will be there in the cost structure. But I don't think it's going to be a huge factor, partly because we found new and different ways to sort of contract for the sourcing of the images. So it'll all remain relatively dynamic, but the category remains very, very interesting to us.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I was wondering if you could discuss the dynamics behind why there was such a latent impact on the services businesses for WoodMac in light of where the oil prices have been and some of your competitors dealing with this pressure for a few quarters now.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. You know, I'm not really going to comment on the competitors except to say that we observe in what we're doing the relationship that we have with our customers. And what we see is that the content that we provide is a must-have, and the depth and quality of the customer relationships remains unchanged. The renewal rates are enormously high. They're actually higher than found in several other parts of Verisk. And so we're very, very pleased with where the business is in terms of making a difference for customers and the content being meaningful.","And as you know, the revenues at WoodMac are weighted heavily towards the recurring subscription-based data analytic, and that continues to do very well. In this moment, I would think particularly our industry customers, our oil and gas industry customers, are attempting to respond to an unusual set of circumstances.","They've decided, in this moment as they've right-sized their own teams, as they have modified their capital expenditures, they've also taken hard look at that which is discretionary. And the kind of services that we provide, which is the minority of what we do, those have been under pressure at this time. But I think the true measure of the business is the underlying recurrent subscription business and that's held up, I think, very nicely actually.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And one other one on WoodMac. You recently announced an e-commerce service for WoodMac.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Curious to see how much of this decision here was something that you're being proactive on, or is it more about pull-type of function from clients interested in one-off or \u00e0 la carte types of products and services. Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So glad you asked. And actually you're going to see more of that from us. So we actually put out there an announcement about the first one, but there will be many, many more. There are a number of ways to put the content out there, and it is definitely us pushing not other's pulling.","In other words, we've said we can slice and dice our content, which is the thing that we look \u2013 that's one of the plays we've run across everything that we do. Particularly relevant here is not existing customers saying, I want to get it differently or I want different discrete packets of what you've got. You've already got a very highly featured menu that you can already shop when you're an existing customer. This is really about trying to move the content towards entirely new user communities. Mark, you wanted to say something else?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think we highlighted this even at the last quarter call. If you actually look at the number of customers that WoodMac has in that 800 to 900 range, that's a very small number relative to the number of people who could potentially benefit from the content.","So moving downstream, not in an upstream\/downstream perspective, but kind of to the smaller customers has been a constant push that we're on. It comes in the form of some new sales reps to attack that, but as well, the Internet or e-commerce approach to providing a smaller package of solutions that people can access through the Web is another approach to doing that. So we remain optimistic about ways we can get downstream to maybe provide opportunities to a bigger set of customers.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As much as WoodMac is the leader in its category, this is an undersold business.","Anjaneya K.

Your line is open.","Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Scott, there's a couple concerns have come up with the results around healthcare in the call today on energy and the lack of guidance has created probably even more uncertainty around both of those.

Information about the factors that could affect the performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott G. Stephenson","Thank you, Eva, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot of exciting initiatives underway, and we are energetically pursuing our data analytic agenda.","Before I get to the future, I'd like to talk a little bit about our results in the quarter, with which I'm pleased. In second quarter 2013, we delivered strong overall performance with total revenue growth of approximately 13% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of 17%.","Our consolidated organic revenue growth in the second quarter was approximately 8%. Organic revenue growth was 9.5% in the quarter, excluding our mortgage analytics business with its macro challenges.","Profitability was strong, with an EBITDA margin of over 44% in the quarter even while we continue to invest in innovations as discussed previously.","Year-to-date free cash flow growth, adjusted for last year's voluntary pension payment and the timing of a tax benefit in the first quarter of this year, was about 8% as we continue to generate strong operating cash flow, while we also elected to invest some of it into capital expenditures related to our investment initiatives.","We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders, and we remain disciplined in our use of capital. We also remain active in looking at M&A. There have been a few sizable assets on the market recently, which you no doubt are aware of, but none of these met our criteria. So we declined to pursue them. We continue to focus on assets with a strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth prospects.","In the quarter, we returned capital to our shareholders through repurchases of $116 million. We also refreshed our buyback authorization in the quarter by $300 million. We will continue to use our authorization consistent with our capital allocation strategy, as we've previously outlined.","As we look to the future, we need to continue to be thought leaders in analytics. As we've discussed, we are making significant investments in certain areas this year, including Touchstone, which is our catastrophe modeling platform; the unified platform in healthcare; aerial imagery; and supply chain analytics. All of these are going well and are in various stages of development and rollout.","The first 2, Touchstone and the unified platform, are active with our clients. We're getting a great response on Touchstone, and we're seeing incremental value in our contracts with customers who have moved to the new platform. The unified platform in healthcare is also leading us to better results for customers and payment accuracy, where we have completed that phase of implementation.","Aerial imagery is a wonderful initiative. It involves gathering images, but much more importantly, using those images to generate data that can be analyzed via computer vision. Initial customer feedback from pilots and evaluations have been very positive. And we're very excited about the imagery initiative, and we may choose to pull some of the intended 2014 investment forward into the second half of 2013 and the 2015 investments into next year.","In addition, the supply chain platform is progressing well with very good conversations with customers on the functionality, as they're looking for it. We also are putting a lot of energy in deleveraging the value of our data and analytics across our enterprise. Everyday, we're discovering new ways in which different parts of our organization can collaborate for the benefit of our customers.","We're able to do this effectively with our current leadership, and I've recently asked some of our leaders to bridge to added responsibilities that logically relate to their current responsibilities. For example, we're looking to do more work related to climate science across our AIR and AER businesses. We're also increasing our efforts to drive growth in Risk Assessment across the various categories, and we're adding to our leadership teams in the supply chain and corporate marketing areas.","In this way, we have the best chance of remaining in touch with our markets and our customers, while expanding our collective ability to see and pursue our joint opportunities. Leadership is a key principle of the Verisk way, which you've heard me talk about before; and this is a natural way to ensure the development of our people.","So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.","Mark V. Anquillare","Thank you, Scott. We're pleased with our performance in the second quarter, in which we delivered both revenue growth and increased profitability while also investing for the future.","In the second quarter, total revenue grew 12.9%, and organic revenue grew 7.8%. The results reflect the continued excellent revenue performance in healthcare, accelerating revenue growth in Insurance Solutions and another strong quarter contribution of -- from Argus. Mortgage revenue growth remained a headwind to overall growth. Excluding our historical mortgage business, revenue growth organically grew at 9.5%.","For the second quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 16.6% revenue growth, of which 8.3% was organic, excluding the acquisitions of Argus and Aspect. Beginning in the quarter, MediConnect is a part of the organic revenue growth in the healthcare category.","Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category grew 9.5% in the second quarter and 8.9% organically, excluding the acquisition of Aspect. We had discussed our expectation of accelerating growth in the combined insurance this year and are pleased to see results headed in that direction with 7.9% organic revenue growth, including Risk Assessment.","Our underwriting solutions delivered strong growth, and we saw a continued double-digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions in the quarter. Our claims solutions also contributed to the growth.","In financial services, which includes both Argus and the mortgage analytics business, revenue grew 43.1% in the quarter. Argus is an excellent business, performing very well since the acquisition in the third quarter of 2012. You will recall that Argus is a very ISO-like business, serving as a trusted, neutral intermediary using a contributory data model to help create analytics, which are deeply embedded in our customers' processes.","The growth outlook in Argus remains positive, including through international expansion and partnering opportunities, as well as additional penetration of existing customers. We have seen growth of over 20% year-to-date at Argus on a pro forma basis and feel good about delivering or exceeding our estimate of mid-teens growth in 2013.","The mortgage portion of financial services revenue declined 8.9% in the second quarter. Our origination revenue continues to grow, while our overall mortgage revenue declined due to the ongoing normalization of the forensic piece of the business.","We're glad to see the decline in forensics slow this quarter. In addition, while early stage, we are seeing strong growth in some product sets that are an extension of the type of work we do in the forensic side, but aimed at the underwriting market. As we've said previously, we continue to believe the full year 2013 results may be similar to the revenue decline of about 11% we saw in 2012.","Healthcare continued to deliver excellent revenue growth of 21.3% for the second quarter, all organic. We were especially pleased with the growth in our RQI division, which reflects the combination of our Revenue Integrity and HEDIS Reporting businesses, as well as MediConnect, which is now organic. We continue to find traction with our solutions in the market. Our sales efforts in the quarter were strong and as we continue to add new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers.","In the quarter, of the new contracts we signed, 1\/2 were with new customers. We are winning sizable contracts even larger than we have won historically, with important new and existing customers, which we expect will benefit us in 2014 and forward.","We continue to be excited about the opportunity in the healthcare space, and we expect growth to remain well above the corporate average rate. As we've noted previously, the growth percentages naturally will be impacted, as we grow off of a larger base.","We're coming off of some tough comparisons from the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2012. There has also been some opportunity for us to trade off between near-term pricing for higher, long-term committed volumes. These are all very good customers, where we see these arrangements as win-win for our long-term relationships.","To provide you with some additional visibility as you think about your models, we expect full year organic growth in healthcare to be about 20%. And given the current pipeline, we expect growth in 2014 to continue in the same range, even when our businesses has more than doubled in size since 2011.","Our specialized markets revenue grew 2.4% in the second quarter. Growth in weather and climate analytics was affected by lower growth in government contracts. We are pleased to see continuing traction in our efforts to repurpose our intellectual property to meet strong demand from our P&C industry customers.","Growth in the environmental health and safety solutions was driven by ongoing customer agreements, moderated by lower volumes and some customer implementation projects.","We think about AER and 3E as long-term options on the growing use of analytics around climate and supply chain and see them as longer-term elements of our growth strategy.","Turning to Risk Assessment. For the second quarter, we reported revenue growth of 7%, indicating the value of -- to our long-standing insurance customers. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew 5% in the quarter, reflecting our 2013 invoices, which were effective January 1. The acceleration from this year's first quarter reflected the one-time revenue in the first quarter of 2012, which we've talked about before.","Our property-specific information revenue grew 13.9% in the quarter. This increase was from new sales and higher volumes from certain customers, as they commit to extended long-term contracts, as well as incremental revenue contributions due to the expiration of a revenue sharing agreement with a technology provider in the fourth quarter of 2012.","EBITDA for the second quarter was $185.6 million, as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 13.3% for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 44.1%, even as we invested in our business. Acquisitions did not have any material effect on the consolidated EBITDA margin in the quarter.","As we discussed with you last quarter, we have an ESOP in place, which was approaching its final distribution date in December of 2013. In May, we extended the allocation of the remaining unreleased shares through 2016. As a result, we will not incur a non-cash charge, as there is no termination distribution in 2013 in excess of our usual 401(k) match.","The DA, or Decision Analytics, margins were 37.2% in the second quarter of 2013 versus 38.3% in the second quarter of 2012. The margin in the quarter reflects investments we have previously outlined. We remain very comfortable with the margin and the modest near-term impact, as we see opportunity to drive faster and sustainable top line growth into the future.","In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 56% versus 52.8% in the second quarter of 2012. Our margins were helped in the quarter, partly as a result of higher levels of compensation in 2012 related to stock compensation vested for employees over the age of 62.","We told you at the beginning of the year that we expected our 2013 EBITDA margins to be flat to modestly down compared to 2012, and that is still our expectation. We will continue to invest in our business to be prepared to support our important contract wins from the first half of the year, even in advance of the 2014 revenue.","Additionally, we have been discussing some of the investment opportunities, including data acquisition for aerial imagery, which flows through our P&L. We expect these investments to help contribute to future top line growth and cash flow, as customer demand is supportive of our initiatives.","Based upon the positive customer response, we are considering pulling forward some investments from 2014 into this year and investments from 2015 into the next. The net effect of all of this is that we feel very confident that we'll be able to hit the high end of our 43% to 45% EBITDA margin range in 2013, and we will continue to drive EBITDA and free cash flow growth.","We can expect that in 2014 and forward as we continue to invest in new initiatives and accelerate them as appropriate, which will keep our margins in this current range.","Our interest expense was $2.3 million in the second quarter versus the respective period in 2012. This increase was due to higher debt balances taken on during 2012 related to our acquisitions. We ended second quarter with total debt of about $1.4 billion and no outstanding revolver borrowings. The debt balance reflects the repayment of -- in the quarter of about $45 million of outstanding long-term private placement debt that matured in April of 2013.","Our reported effective tax rate was 36.2% in the quarter. As we've discussed with you previously, we've been actively working on our tax planning strategies, and we're rewarded by the benefits resulting from this effort, again, in the quarter, as well as some small-time, one-time benefits. We now expect the full year tax rate to be between 37% and 38% for the full year 2013. We expect the normalized rate to be about 38% in 2014 and forward.","Coming down to the net income line. We focus on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we defined in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense, less the income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 17.6% to $94.9 million for the quarter.","Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.55 for the quarter, an increase of 17%.","The average diluted share count was 172.5 million shares in the quarter. On June 30, 2013, our diluted share count was 171.7 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased 1.9 million shares for $116.1 million. At quarter end, we had about $306.6 million left under our authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized rates of return of over 25%. For 2013, we will continue to anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution.","Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, our cash and cash equivalents were about $172.6 million. Total debt, both long term and short term, totaled $1.4 billion. As I mentioned before, the debt balance reflects repayment in the quarter of about $45 million of our outstanding long-term private placement debt that matured in April 2013.","We have another $100 million in private placement debt maturing in August, which we expect to repay from cash on hand or other debt. Today, our incremental debt capacity is over $900 million and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow.","Our debt to pro forma EBITDA for June 30 was 1.9x, a little below our steady-state target. As you know, we're willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt-to-EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities because we feel our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly.","In the first half of 2013, free cash flow, we which we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $182.6 million, an increase of about $33.2 million or 22.2% versus the first half of 2012. Free cash flow year-to-date, adjusted for the timing of excess tax benefits and the prior-year voluntary contribution of -- to our pension was $218.7 million, reflecting growth of 7.8% compared to the first half of 2012.","Our capital expenditures were 7.8% of revenue in the first half of 2013, consistent with the incremental investments we discussed last quarter. Free cash flow represented 50% of EBITDA in the first half of 2013. Adjusted for the timing of items we mentioned previously, free cash flow represented 59.9% of EBITDA.","As we think about capital spending for 2013, we are still expecting $115 million for the full year, including the $20 million of investment initiative spending. As you think about your models for the full year 2013, we anticipate amortization of intangibles of about $64 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $74 million and now a tax rate between 37% and 38%. We aim to keep share counts flat through our repurchase program. And at our current debt balances, our current quarterly interest expense is $19 million.","Overall, our business is performing very well. We have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals, and we continue to invest for the future.","With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My first question was just on the comments you made on the aerial imagery investments, pulling that forward. Is there going to be any -- I guess, maybe just a little more color on what those planned investments were that you're pulling forward? And would there be any associated revenue through those initiatives that will come along with that, or is it just 1 investment for the future?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes. This is Scott, Manav. Thanks for the question. So the investments we're making in aerial imagery, they really fall into 2 different categories. One is we're actually acquiring a lot of aerial images. And so, we have to pay for that, and we pay for that in 2 different ways. We work with third parties who have already sourced images. But much more importantly, we're sourcing our own images, which are much more granular and precise than what generally tends to be available. Our sweet spot is in image, where a pixel is about 1 inch to 1.5 inches. Whereas, most of what you see, for example, if you look at Google Earth, when you're looking at a building on Google Earth, a pixel is about 6 inches and not adequate for the kind of automated analysis of the image that we want to engage in. I mentioned computer vision before. That's the field of science and technology that is related to automatically extracting data from a photographic image. So, a, we have to acquire the images; and, b, we're building the capability to both house the images and the technology associated with their automated rendering. So that's the investment program. The part of it which becomes more significant, where the P&L is concerned that becomes more period expensed, is the acquisition of the images. And, yes, we definitely expect that there will be a revenue response to the images that we're acquiring. What we are working on right now is at what rate do we need to acquire the images in order to respond to what we see as the growing demand for the category. This all relates very strongly to what we do with Xactware in the repair cost estimating category. So to date, we actually do relate aerial images to all of the repair cost estimating we do in Xactware. But it's not at the level of analysis or granular detail that we're moving. And so, it's an extension of our -- it's an extension of the business that we're already in. We do generate a little bit of revenue from aerial imagery today, but we see it as a very, very substantial opportunity. So, yes, we do definitely expect that revenue will follow. But since it's a relatively new category for us, that's where the investment, particularly the acquisition of the images, may need to lead the revenue to some degree.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And you guys, I guess, maintained the full year CapEx. So does that mean that this will substitute some other investments, or is that subject to change once you guys do decide that you're going to pull forward these investments?","Mark V. Anquillare","Yes. Let me just take this. This is Mark. There are parts of this initiative and many others, where there's actual programming time that could be capitalized and put on our balance sheet. However, when you purchase data, it is required to be expensed. So when we talked about the CapEx numbers being relatively unchanged, I think that's consistent with what we said in the past. This, that we're calling out, actually has direct effect on the P&L because we are expensing the aggregation of images.","Scott G. Stephenson","And do let me just clarify on one thing. Mark talked about purchasing data. In the case of aerial imagery, most of what we're doing -- we're not buying it from someone else. We're actually generating the data ourselves. But it is, as Mark said, a period expense.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then, one more for me. Could you -- Mark, could you remind us of -- in the past, you've talked about the seasonality on the healthcare side with, I guess, the more weighting in the second half. Any changes to that mix or, sequentially, anything that you can help us model it?","Mark V. Anquillare","Yes. Historically, it has always been a -- healthcare, as a whole, has been a 40-60 type of seasonal split. So 40% on the first half, 60% on the second. We continue to try to bring that, kind of, more in line over the course of the year. But that is just the nature of the business right now.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When talking about the 20% growth in healthcare -- and thank you for clarifying your goals in that segment. Is that an organic growth initiative? Meaning, is that the organic goal? And then, additionally, since you said 20% this year, 20% next year, I just wanted to ask, is it kind of a lumpy business with new customer implementations? And so, we probably could expect some volatility quarter-to-quarter, right?","Scott G. Stephenson","So, Andrew, it's Scott. So first of all, yes, we are talking organic growth rates when we're talking about the view for 2013 and the view for 2014. I'm not sure I would say lumpy exactly, but one thing that is going on in the business is, because of our growing presence in the healthcare field, one of the things that we're finding is that the size of the contracts that we're able to sign, in some cases, are becoming substantially larger than the average contract size that has to date applied in the business. And I'm talking about sales that we have secured and sales that we're very close to securing, neither of which have actually worked their way into the P&L yet. So I'm not sure I would use the phrase lumpy when talking about it in that way, but I do think that we're finding that the scale of the opportunities that were in front of us is getting bigger.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And also, when you speak about new customers, are we mostly talking about Medicare Advantage Plans being added or new customers a lot broader now?","Scott G. Stephenson","More broader than that. It's still the case that the lion's share of our business is with the health plans. But we've actually seen some very encouraging things happen with respect to the EA suite moving into the provider world.","Operator","Your next question is from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First, I just wanted to ask on the most recent comments about seeing the bigger contracts. Is that a reflection of seeing broader solutions being adopted, kind of, all at once by the clients? Or is it that they're taking on a bigger chunk of the claims activity or some other factor? I guess, what's driving the bigger contracts?","Scott G. Stephenson","It is both. Although, I would say that the primary effect in the contracts that I had in mind with the prior comment is a deeper penetration inside of, in 1 case, an existing customer and, in another case, an entity that was not a customer previously.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay...","Scott G. Stephenson","[indiscernible] with an existing solution side.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And as we think about organic growth for healthcare, what impact does MediConnect being rolled into that overall organic growth rate have? I don't think it was growing quite as fast as the rest of the healthcare channel...","Scott G. Stephenson","Actually, MediConnect's organic growth rate is very healthy. And the fact that it has moved into the organic category is not having any downward effect on the overall organic growth rate of the group.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then, just 1 follow-up on mortgage is -- the lessening -- or the smaller pace of decline -- I guess, you talked about some newer solutions you see growing there. But did you see -- I guess, is the smaller pace of decline related to those newer solutions, or is it that the fraud piece is declining by a smaller amount? Or did the kind of origination side tick up? I guess, I'm just trying to...","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, it's really both effects. So it's how big was the forensic piece. And now, as we move towards absolutely smaller numbers and the smaller fraction of what we do, any further shrinkage in the amount of business that we're doing there just proportionately is less impactful on the Interthinx case. And then, on the other side of it, yes, these new solutions are finding their place in the market and definitely having an effect on the overall outcome.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And, Mark, the 11% decline, does -- was that for the year, and does that factor in that Argus gets dropped into organic in Q4?","Mark V. Anquillare","So let me just describe the 11%. I was talking specifically about the mortgage analytics business. And what we did last year, that would be 2012 full year, the mortgage analytics business was down about 11%. What we've been saying is that the full year 2013, we think, it will also be down about 13%. So obviously, we'd be down more than that in the first quarter. And hopefully, we'll start to see some stabilization and some growth, as we progress towards the end of this year for mortgage only. That does not have any...","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. So not that overall practice, if you will? Just that piece of it? Okay.","Mark V. Anquillare","Correct. Negative 11% for both years for mortgage.","Scott G. Stephenson","And bear in mind, again, as Mark reported, financial services overall grew more than 40% in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from David Togut with Evercore Partners.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","It's Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Could you talk about the specific factors that drove the deceleration of your healthcare segment from 39% revenue growth in the first quarter to 21% in the second quarter? And maybe if you can just give us an update on business trends and the growth rate of each of your 3 major businesses within healthcare?","Scott G. Stephenson","So let me start off there, and Mark may want to add something there. Let me go back to second quarter of 2012 in order to kind of give you some perspective on the growth rates that healthcare -- the organic growth rates that healthcare has been turning in overall. So you'll remember that, in April of 2012, we acquired MediConnect. There's a suite of services that we provide, which are inside of the RQI division of healthcare. And essentially, what we're trying to do is to help health plans understand the quality with which they do what they do and to relate that to the cost that it requires them to do what they do. And we do that so that companies can be viable inside of the private insurance world, so that they can be viable with respect to Medicare Advantage. But that's the essence of what we're doing over there. There was pent-up demand for those services, and one of the things that we need to do to deliver the service is to access medical records. And so, we had a method. We have methods actually for doing that prior to the acquisition of MediConnect. But there was pent-up demand for those set of services. When we acquired MediConnect, what we -- and we talked about this at length, what we created was the ability to actually process faster because of the integration of the 2 businesses. And so, we began to respond to that pent-up demand as we moved into the third and the fourth quarter and even into the first quarter of 2013. And so, if you look at our growth rates inside of health, part of what was going on was that response to the pent-up demand. So I think what you're seeing when you compare, for example, first quarter to second quarter is that, that line of business is still healthy. It's still very growing nicely. But there was a particular reaction, which we expected based upon our increased capacity by virtue of bringing in MediConnect, and that was working very powerfully last half of last year and even into the first quarter of this year. And again, it's not that the effect has gone away, it's just that there was so much demand behind the dam. We don't really talk about specifically about the 3 divisions, but I'll just say that they're all important to the performance of Verisk Health. We're looking to all of them to grow. Just 2 weeks ago, we diligence-d the pipelines for each of the 3 divisions. They're all looking very healthy. And so, we have high expectations for all of them going forward.","Operator","Your next question is from Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","About Risk Assessment growth, how sustainable is the growth in the property-specific and underwriting piece of the business? I mean, do you anticipate staying at the high end of that 5% to 7% range that you have talked about in the past?","Mark V. Anquillare","So, Suzi, let me just highlight here. I think, common things that we've seen that have been reassuring inside of the property-specific is that we've been able to transition many customers from what are transactional type of purchases to longer-term contracts with higher committed volumes. So that has been a positive. I think we've found some stabilization even inside some of the transaction volumes that were causing some ebbs and flows over the last several years. So that's sustainable. That's positive. At the same time, I think one of the things that we've called out is that we did have a contract. It was a 20-year-old contract with a technology provider that came to an end in 2012. So as a result of that kind of rearrangement -- or change in arrangement, we had benefited from a new arrangement where there's more revenue for us, and we've taken over the partners of technology because we felt it's kind of core to the service. That, in 2013, will be here, will continue into the future, but we do get some benefit from the growth over what was a different arrangement in '12. So I think a good portion of the growth continues, a portion of the growth is onetime and will continue into the future. I don't want to say onetime, but it's more of a one-time growth. Okay?","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, on specialized markets, I guess, that's been running in the low-single digits. Is there any reason to think that, that should start to pick up?","Scott G. Stephenson","I think that, in the near term, we are still working to essentially transform the categories that those phase [ph] meaning, the supply chain domain and the commercialization of climate science. And so, in the near term, no. In the long term, we think of them as options against really kind of building new categories that don't exist today. And we'll certainly work hard to keep you informed as we feel like we've reached those moments where we've actually -- we've created something substantially new and different. And we're working very hard at that.","Mark V. Anquillare","Let me just -- to emphasize, I mean, I appreciate the question about Risk Assessment. I'd just like to continue to kind of reinforce the fact that I think we kind of think of some of the way we go to market for both the Decision Analytics and Risk Assessment customers. They're the same customers. We're trying to sell a suite. And I think we continue to be effective there with some accelerating organic growth, kind of, across the 2 categories.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Good to see the uptick in your insurance business within Decision Analytics. Could you talk a little bit about some of these newer solutions, whether it's Touchstone or the -- it sounds like you're in the market with that in aerial imaging, which maybe is more of a '14 event. But did we get back to double-digit organic revenue growth within that business this year? Or is that still the longer-term expectation? Or are we, kind of, at what you think is a steady-state for the insurance part of the business today?","Scott G. Stephenson","Well, I guess, I would put it this way. I -- we are excited about a number of opportunities to bring more value to our insurance customers. We are at a moment in the P&C industry where there is as much -- or more openness to technology-driven innovation in insurance as, I think, there's ever been. And I think that there's a very settled understanding now that data analytics is going to play a very important role in all of that. So we're -- we really appreciate the relationship we have with our P&C customers, and we -- it's, in many ways, a good moment to be a partner to them, given sort of how their world and, therefore, our world with them is moving. Some of the things that we're talking about, for example, aerial imagery -- just to again go back to that one for a moment, when it fully emerges, it's potentially a very large category. And so, it remains to be seen whether or not we're able to put the solutions together in such a way that they become so compelling that the full market opportunity is realized. But there's a great sense of promise there. Over on the catastrophe modeling side, to just pick another one, the businesses is becoming much more richly featured than it used to be. Basically, our customers used to be primarily interested in the stochastic models. Now equally, they are interested in the decision-support software and the ability to try to pull a lot of observations together derived from the cat modeling world and apply them even at the level of the individual risk. And so, that kind of movement, we think, naturally creates the opportunity to bring substantially more value to the customers than has been there in the past. We haven't really sort of -- a rifle shot, a number in terms of what the organic growth rate is that all of that implies. But the kinds of things that I was just talking about become material relative to the book of business that we already have. And so, we're optimistic. We're leaning into the opportunities in the P&C space.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as far as the investment pull-forward, I know you've made some comments about EBITDA margin this year. Mark, would the magnitude of the investment pull-forwards have the same sort of impact on your out-year EBITDA margin, whereby we might see revenue growth acceleration but perhaps flat-to-down margin over next year? Is that -- are you pulling forward that much spend, for example?","Mark V. Anquillare","So I think what we would probably need to do is really think about this in terms of we're building a product today, and we wanted to make sure we have a robust product come into market because we have had customers that are excited about it. As we think about, kind of, the pull-forward that we've just talked about, a little of that has to do with, now, customer reaction and customer response. So I think the answer to your question is we have some pretty big kind of CapEx or an expense that we're kind of bringing through in the first half. We would probably continue, as we described and what we kind of hinted towards in the second half. As I get into 2014, it's a little bit tough to marry up kind of the revenue and the expense around those categories. I would see that the investment would be large. I'm not sure if it's going to be materially larger than what you'll see in '13. So from a relative margin perspective, I don't have great visibility quite yet. But I don't -- I wouldn't put margin erosion on it. I would just say we should probably maintain [indiscernible] flatter.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful color. And one more, if I may. When you look at your healthcare -- unified healthcare platform, do you think that's an offering that can start to really move the needle for you next year? Or is this -- are we talking about a multi-year effort as far as revenue incremental revenue from that?","Scott G. Stephenson","I think you should think of it as multiyear, but I do believe the effects will -- I mean, actually, we've already seen the effects. Just to kind of recap for you, we have already implemented the unified platform for large customers in the payment accuracy division. Next up is the Enterprise Analytics, and that's a '14 deliverable. And then, we move into RQID in '15. So there are already effects, and we will see more effects in '14 than we have in '13. But it is -- it's a multi-year march. So it's kind of both, really. We will begin to see more and more benefit. I think that it's really when the entire suite has been enabled that the promise of being able to go to the customer and say, \"Would you like us to turn this on for you?\" is really -- I think that's when we're really there. And the third of the 3 divisions is a 2015 deliverable on that plan.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Earlier, you said about some of the contracts in healthcare hadn't -- aren't fully up to speed yet. You've just signed them, and you've [indiscernible] larger. So as you look at your comment -- we go back to your comments about the 20% growth this year and next. Could you just maybe give us some of the assumptions behind that? How much is some of those new contracts you won just coming up to speed? How much are sort of other contracts you've won kind of scaling up or what's new contracts or new clients?","Mark V. Anquillare","Sure. I think one of the things that we tried to highlight is that it has been a very good new sales year for the first half of '13. But the way customers adopt and implement, it's not always they can go right away. So we may pick up a little bit in '13, but a lot of these things are actually priming for and looking towards 2014. And in large part, because of the nature of this 40-60 revenue split, a lot of it does actually hang on the latter part of the second half of '14. The other thing that we've tried to, at least, mention a little bit, we've had -- some of these contracts for customers have come to us, and they've said, \"Let's have a conversation about us giving you bigger volumes and longer-term commitments. Is there a way to marry up kind of some price with these longer commitments?\" And we're willing to do that for the right customers and for the right type of volumes. And all of that kind of plays out in a way that probably helps us in '14, and it certainly kind of impacts kind of the way we think about into the future and beyond.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I guess, if I heard you correctly, you're just communicating that your visibility is better based on some of these changes you're talking about?","Mark V. Anquillare","Agreed. I mean, I just can't get into the details of contracts except that we're feeling very good about the pipeline, and it's more of a '14 type of new sales win where we see revenue.","Operator","Your next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Step back and focus on the insurance portion of the business. Can you just clarify what impact any changes in insurance premium growth has on your business and when that would occur?","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes. Can I -- let me talk about it generally and then maybe Mark would like to talk about where we are in the premium environment right now. But the thing that we would like you to understand is that there is nothing even close to a 1:1 relationship between what's happening in the world of insurance premiums and our revenue picture. And that's true for a couple of reasons. First of all, something like 40% of our insurance revenue references, in some way, what's happening with respect to premiums. Meaning, inside of our pricing algorithm is some reference made to premium volumes, only about 40% of our revenue is priced in that way. And of that 40%, there are 3 terms in the pricing algorithm. So there's the premium, there's a mill rate that we attach to the premium and then there's a flat fee. And we are annually assessing the 2 terms in that equation that we are responsible for, which is the mill rate and the flat -- and the flat fee. And we're very thoughtful about what we're doing with both of those. And so, it's not the case that there's a linear relationship even in that 40% between where did the premium move year-over-year, where did our revenues move year-over-year. There were actually several years where there was negative premium growth. Recently, several years where there was negative premium growth in the industry, and yet our revenues actually grew. And then, on top of all of that, I would go back to the point that Mark made a couple of minutes ago, which is we think of everything that we do in insurance as a relatively integrated whole. And so, when we think about setting the terms in that pricing algorithm, we have it very much in mind that we want to preserve and extend the opportunity to sell the other parts of our suite, which are not priced that way. And so, what I really want to strongly move you away from is a sense that the premium environment is strongly -- or, I would say, even modestly affecting what our business is doing. Mark, do you want to comment on kind of where we are right at the moment?","Mark V. Anquillare","As an example, I know that there's been some better news with regard to premium growth inside of 2012 relative to, say, 2011. The way we operate in a loose affiliation, 12 premiums would relate to some of our invoicing in 2014. But I will kind of reemphasize Scott's point. What we're trying to do is make sure that there's value to customers, and the customers are looking at the bottom line, how much the invoice is. And we want to make sure that that's fair. We want to make sure that, that is well thought of, so that we can sell other services and other solutions typically from the DA suite to them. And that's the long-term relationship building and the best way for us to win in the long term.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I appreciate the clarity. And then, on a different tact. I know you don't do a lot of government business, but if you can just remind us roughly what your exposure is to government business? And did you see any impact from sequestration last quarter?","Scott G. Stephenson","Sure. Government business is rather modest. It sits inside the specialized -- inside of '13, it probably hurt us to the tune of $2 million to $3 million in '13 -- or will hurt us.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","This is Jamie Friedman. 2 questions, 1 for Scott and then for Mark. First, Scott, I was just wondering, financial service, obviously, had a good print. I was wondering if you had any comments on the up-selling characteristics going on within financial service now? And then, moving over to Mark. Mark, if you could comment about the Risk Assessment margin, and your updated guidance was helpful. But specific to Risk Assessment, how we should think about the contribution margin, if you will, longer term? So first on financial service, then on Risk Assessment margin.","Scott G. Stephenson","Yes. The deeper penetration of existing customer relationships is a very important theme inside of what's going on in financial services. If I look at the business we do with the retail banks around the credit card line and demand deposits, essentially, up-selling is a very major part of what's happening in that business. And it's really -- and it continues to move through 3 levels. So the first level is the thing that we just love to do at Verisk, and that is build the contributory data set and create an industry-level set of Analytics around that contributory data set. And that's how the whole business got started. The next level then is to take the analytics derived from that and to find ways to apply them more precisely on a customer-by-customer basis. And so, that's the first level of up-sell that goes on. What we found is, even beyond that, we have created such a good analytic environment for retail banking analysis that, at the third level, we actually have a growing number of customers that, actually, in addition to purchasing level 1 and level 2, they also actually want to purchase the analytic environment. They want to license the analytic environment from us, which is, in no sense, cannibalizing what we were doing at the other levels. And so, that really is the story of what's going on with respect to those product sets inside of retail banking, and it continues to be a very important part of the growth that is occurring there. In fact, not -- there's -- we are acquiring new customers partly because that part of our business is actually finding its mark in overseas markets. But if you look at, for example, the United States market, a fair fraction of our growth is moving up that cross-sell ladder from the first stage to the second stage to the third stage, and that continues.","Mark V. Anquillare","Let me jump over to the Risk Assessment. I think what we continue to find promising is Risk Assessment does turn out very nice and stable growth to the extent that, that growth is kind of the above the cost of generally people. We've been able to have some high incremental margins on that business. The operating leverage is strong, and I think we feel very good about that. The one thing I wanted to just highlight, though, is that when we talk about investment, it is across the entire enterprise. And we have high expectations for Risk Assessment around trying to find new opportunities in markets too. And inside that, they have investment initiatives that should certainly be a part of all of this and be considered in. So what you saw in the second quarter was some strength. Remember, a bit of it was the result of the way we recognize expense around options. So if you compared second quarter of '13 to '12, that is -- that piece is a one-time effect. And I just want to caution you to just remember that as you do comparisons from '13 to '12. There is a bit of one-time amount in there.","Scott G. Stephenson","Hopefully, Jamie, that was responsive to your 2 questions.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over -- back over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott G. Stephenson","Thank you very much. And I just like to thank everybody for joining us for our second quarter earnings call here today.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's EVP of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen.","Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.","David E. Cohen - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, Teresa, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for discussion of our first quarter 2017 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities, the financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.","Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC.","The earnings release contains reconciliations of several non-GAAP measures, which we'll reference on today's call. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail, in yesterday's earnings release, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thanks, David. Good morning, everybody. Yesterday, we reported an unusual quarter with a number of items that we don't expect to recur that affected us at a moment in time. We are comfortable that growth will be better the rest of the year and into 2018. For the full-year of 2017, we continue to expect combined insurance and financial services revenue to grow about in line within historical trend.","Reported revenue grew 2% for the quarter. Organic constant-currency growth was 2.5%. Profitability remained strong, with total EBITDA margins around 49%. We chose to grow expenses at a measured pace in the quarter to support future growth. Diluted adjusted EPS declined about 1% as a result of unusual conditions influencing revenue growth. In spite of this, free cash flow in the quarter was up about 12%.","Revenue growth was muted because of one-time true up revenue in Decision Analytics in 2016, several contract completions at Argus and the cycling through of WoodMac contracts that were signed in the depth of the oil commodity down cycle. Looking ahead, our confidence is based on new contracts and new solutions layered on top of the stability our subscription revenue provides.","Specifically, we expect new sources of insurance revenue growth, several new Argus contracts where the signing slipped out of the first quarter and moderating effects of the commodity and currency headwinds as we move through 2017. We were pleased that in our resource businesses in the quarter, we saw a healthy and encouraging growth in contract signings for subscription products.","Our teams are working hard on all the new solutions in which we are investing and long-term opportunities remain robust. We are focusing on both acquiring talent and shaping our workforce, so that it reflects the right mix of capabilities to run our business. We are also investing in our new solution opportunities, because we're confident in the near and the long-term revenue outlooks, continuing to invest in our people and innovation as the prudent course of action.","We were pleased to continue repurchasing our shares through our long-standing program, an indication of our enduring confidence in our business. We bought 1.3 million shares for a total return of capital of $104 million in the quarter. At March 31, 2017, we had $532 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. With leverage below our 2.5 times reference level, we have plenty of capacity to make strategically relevant acquisitions as well as additional repurchases.","During the quarter, we spent $76 million on acquisitions, bringing trailing four-quarter total acquisition spend to $150 million. Since last quarter's earnings call, we closed the acquisition of Fintellix, further extending Argus' international end markets and enhancing our capabilities and global bank regulatory compliance.","The acquisition of Fintellix positions Argus to expand our data hosting and regulatory platforms and better address the increasingly complex needs of our clients. We will continue to focus on M&A that helps drive our strategy and embodies the Verisk distinctives.","At Investor Day in December, we began telling you about 20 internal investment opportunities we are funding to drive valuable solutions for our customers and growth for our company. These are promising new solutions, some of which have the potential to contribute significantly over a five-year time horizon.","These major initiatives have their own project champions, at least one anchor customer and dedicated teams. They involve machine learning, telematics, the Internet of Things, high-resolution imagery, predictive fraud modeling, claims automation, digital marketing and alternative energy analytics.","While the revenues in most cases will be slower to ramp up, the investments are already underway. We have identified these opportunities, which cross all our key vertical end markets as likely to generate attractive returns over the five-year planning horizon. We intend to move with speed and focus on these compelling innovation opportunities.","We're running our game plan of innovation driving organic revenue, which will result in the delivery of free cash flow growth. Our businesses are strongly aligned with the Verisk distinctives of: one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into our customer workflows. With these come network effects, scale economies and a large percentage of subscription revenue.","From this enduring foundation of strength, we are highly confident in the ability of our people to execute our strategy and plans, which ultimately relate to serving and adding value for our customers. You should expect our results to ramp as we move through this year and we are even more encouraged as we look to 2018 and beyond.","So with that, I'm going to turn the call over now to Mark for some additional comments.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, Scott. Across our businesses, we serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we have several key themes, including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. While the headline growth across our insurance businesses is a bit below trend during the quarter, both the underlying performance and outlook for the rest of the year and beyond is encouraging.","First, growth in the quarter was reduced by last year's true up revenue, which did not recur in 2017. Second and most important, the pricing environment and the competitive landscape remain consistent with the past. Third, as we look at the core solutions in each of our businesses, they're growing well.","For example, in our catastrophe modeling business, the dynamics in the reinsurance industry continue to be challenging. That has affected the cap on and consulting businesses. However, as we look at the majority of what we do there, extreme event modeling, we are growing in the high single digits as we continue to take market share. Big data message, integrated into our platform, are very compelling to the industry.","Looking at our claims businesses, our two largest solutions related to repair cost estimate continue to grow in the mid to high single-digits. This is a good example of continuing industry automation. And of course, fraud is evergreen, helping our anti-fraud related solutions continue to grow nicely.","As a final example, in our personal lines underwriting business, where our solutions are well-established, but still newer to the market than some of our competitors, we're making good progress in innovating and gaining market share. We're applying big data methods, which we expect will be a key differentiator even as we help our customers digitally engage more effectively with their customers.","Finally, in our important heritage ISO business, our normal course price increases went into effect in January and we're pleased with the uptake of our newer solutions. While many of you may think of the ISO solutions business as a steady, stable grower, which it is, we're really excited with the addition of new people who are helping us push forward with innovative solutions.","These are allowing us to address parts of the end market where we haven't historically served, but where we see a lot of opportunity to help our customers solve tough problems they face. As we look at some of the newer things we're doing, including expanding into international markets and with the recent acquisition, there's a lot which is very encouraging.","With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results in more detail.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, Mark. In the first quarter, we grew revenue and EBITDA on a comparable basis to the prior year, while also investing in solutions with meaningful long-term potential revenue streams. Our growth in the quarter was below trend as several headwinds affected us at the same time, consistent with our comments on our fourth quarter call and in presentations earlier this year.","Currency hurt revenue results in the quarter by about $7.5 million. As we move through the year, we're confident that revenues will improve. Revenue in the quarter grew 2%. Organic constant currency revenue grew 2.5% and 3.4%, excluding the prior year true up revenue.","We have included a new table in the press release to help you see the acquisition and FX results for each of our revenue lines more clearly. As a reminder, organic constant currency growth excludes the contribution from recent acquisitions and reflects current period exchange rates applied to prior period revenue. Total acquired revenue in the quarter was $5.3 million.","Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 0.1%. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 1.5%. This quarter, insurance was the fastest growing vertical and also the largest contributor of dollars to growth. Underlying the results are the continued resilience in our insurance business and some timing in our financial services revenue growth.","Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 4.1% in the quarter. Last year, had around $4 million of one-time true-up revenue. And adjusting for this, organic constant currency revenue growth was 6.5%. Growth was led by strong performance in underwriting solutions, claims analytics, loss qualification, and catastrophe modeling solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter.","We've spoken about reinsurance having an impact in some areas in terms of growth, but we are pleased that those trends aren't worsening and that the underlying growth in our subscription solutions and cap modeling remains very good, as Mark mentioned.","Customer retention remains very high and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. Energy and specialized markets category revenue declined 5.9% in the quarter. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue declined 2.1%. While continued energy end market headwinds and the British pound impacted revenue in the quarter, as expected, both of those trends have started to improve.","The benefits will be over time, given the multi-year subscription nature of the majority of that business. The WoodMac team continues to do a great job managing the business to outstanding relative performance. The category revenue growth was reduced also by a decline in environmental health and safety solutions due to lower demand following the late 2015 completion of GHS standard-related implementation.","Financial services revenue declined 0.5% in the quarter. The recent acquisition of Fintellix closed on March 31 and is contributing to revenue in the second quarter. Strong growth in media effectiveness and good growth in core banking solutions were offset by a couple of long-term government customers and a non-core customer who concluded their contracts in the fourth quarter. Those combined contracts contributed about $11 million for the full year 2016.","Additionally, we typically see a seasonal step-down after Q4, which did occur this year as well. We remain optimistic about delivering growth in 2017 and building on what is a great dataset and analytic capability.","Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.4% in the quarter. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 4.2%. The stable growth demonstrates the value to our longstanding insurance customers as well as contributions of new solutions that are in early stages and the recent acquisitions.","Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.9%, reflecting our 2017 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions such as predictive models and Electronic Rating Content. While still early, we're encouraged by the strong efforts to drive new product development in this part of the business.","Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 3.5% in the quarter. Growth was led by subscription revenues. We have some components of this line that are purchased transactionally, which is where we are seeing more variation.","EBITDA decreased 1.1% in the quarter to $246 million. The reported decline was a result of timing of revenue related to operating expenses, legal and acquisition costs, and the prior year true-up revenue in Decision Analytics insurance that occurred in the quarter. The combined cost of revenue and SG&A increased 5.9% or $15 million in the quarter. The increase was just 3.3% on an organic basis as we continue to manage expenses.","EBITDA margins as reported were 48.9%. Margins were reduced by about 80 basis points due to acquisitions and about 60 basis points due to legal and transaction fees in the quarter. Total acquired revenue \u2013 sorry \u2013 total acquired EBITDA in the quarter was break-even. Acquisitions we're doing are close to the core with well-defined paths to top-line growth and margin expansion.","Margins were also impacted in the quarter by our decision to grow expenses to support a multi-year view of revenue expectations as well as investment opportunities we've been discussing with you. Margins by segment were affected by rebalancing of our technology resources to reflect internal priorities as our Decision Analytics businesses expand the data sources they own and that serve as the foundation for their solutions. Our data storage needs are growing.","Reported interest expense was $28 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at March 31, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the first quarter was 2.2 times, below our 2.5 times reference level. Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 32.5%. Adjusted net income in Q1 decreased 1.6% to $125 million. The average diluted share count was 170.2 million in the quarter and we bought about 1.3 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $81.24.","Our repurchase program has been successful to-date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. On March 31, 2017, our diluted share count was 169.4 million shares.","Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.74 in the quarter, a decrease of 1.3%. Diluted adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased because the quarter's unusually modest revenue growth was more than offset by a higher tax rate and currency effects.","Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $318 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 12.8%. Capital expenditures increased 22.9% to $31 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.","CapEx was 6.2% of revenue year-to-date. Free cash flow increased 11.8% to $287 million for the three-month period ended March 31. Free cash flow was 116.7% of EBITDA as we continue to collect more cash in our seasonally strong Q1.","Growth in free cash flow was driven by strong working capital management, highlighting an important aspect of our business model. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and, therefore, shareholder value.","As you think about your models for 2017, currency will continue to be a headwind in 2Q, moderating a bit as we move into the second half based on current exchange rates. To help you look at the FX impact, the following 2016 total revenues are restated at the March 31, 2017 rate. If rates were unchanged from March 31, 2017, these would be the base for the organic constant-currency revenue growth for the remainder of the year. Most of the FX impact falls within the energy and specialized revenue line items in Decision Analytics.","For 2Q 2016, the revenue would have been $490 million versus the reported $498 million. For Q3 2016, it would have been $494 million versus the reported $498 million, and for Q4 2016, the revenue would have been $505 million versus the reported $506 million.","You'll also recall that merit increases go into effect April 1, which typically creates a seasonal step-up in the expense base. So there's a natural step-down in margins from Q1 to Q2, all else being equal.","The net of many of these factors is that we continue to expect growth to improve as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. In addition, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization of $130 million to $135 million, up from what we expected last quarter as we were able to move projects into service faster than we had planned and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million.","Based on our current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to be around $113 million. This includes non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. We estimate the tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 33%. And in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% for the tax effect on intangible amortization. And finally, we expect the diluted weighted average share count of about 171.2 million shares.","We look forward to ramping results through 2017 and beyond. We're excited about the opportunities to invest as we work to drive long-term free cash flow. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investments for the long-term. We also continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow up.","And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. First I guess, just want to follow-up on Scott's comment that, I think you said for the full year you expect insurance and financial services to grow consistent with history. But I think you also \u2013 given the loss of those contracts, can you help us understand \u2013 I guess more specifically, what you mean by consistent with history? And I guess, can you see Argus get back to the growth rates? I mean, that implies a pretty significant growth rate, so any more color, I guess, on the recovery from here?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Right. Well, one of the things to know about Argus is that it is sort of, I would say, a constantly dynamic environment in the sense that we are able to and are reaching out to new customers consistently. And so the right way to think about the business is that the customer list grows.","There were these rotations of the government customers that we noted for you. But it is a dynamic set of customers, as well as a dynamic set of offerings where the media effectiveness solutions are really finding their mark. And so it will be a combination of new names on the customer list and increased levels of spending with customers that are already on the customer list.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And I guess mathematically, I think in the past, insurance and financial services have combined to grow kind of 7% to 8% the last few years. Is that the number that you're thinking of?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes, that's exactly what we're saying.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","And is that an organic or including some of the acquisitions?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Organic.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Jeff Meuler of Baird.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","On financial services, it seems like growth or revenues maybe more dependent on large projects than I previously appreciated. So just \u2013 how much \u2013 how many large projects or what's the exposure to large projects do you still have in the revenue base there? And I heard that some slipped out of Q1, but just what's the visibility into the pipeline? And then I guess more importantly, how do you think about the long-term growth rate for Argus?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. So let me start with sort of the second question first, Jeff. We remain very positive about Argus' intermediate and long-term growth. The strength of where we start from, which is a very unique insight into patterns of consumer spending, we are continuing to find very good ways to commercialize that. And we're also finding ways to take the platform and expand it overseas.","And so those trends are going to continue, basically. And so we feel very good about the growth profile. There is \u2013 as companies become \u2013 I mean, our customers become more aware of and aligned to the opportunity that they have to make use of these newer kinds of data analytics that they haven't made use of before, there are moment in time effects where they kind of get into the new methods and so, you do tend to get a bit more lumpiness when that happens. It's really just the nature of the beast. And the rotations out by, for example, the government customers, I think are very, very specific to their situations and their conditions and really don't reflect the overall commercial potential of what's here. But there is that effect even inside of what end up looking like subscription revenues because there is sort of a moment in time at which customers get into the new methods and that will sort of create a lump of revenue at a moment in time.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then in terms of the moderating industry headwinds that you called out, I heard Eva's comment about reinsurance, I guess stabilizing, but could you just broadly characterize your view of the insurance end market right now? So I guess reinsurance stabilizing, but what are your thoughts on other areas of the insurance ecosystem headwinds getting better, worse, stable, et cetera?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Sure. This is Mark. Good question. So let me start with the reinsurance side of things. So clearly, it's a very soft market from a reinsurance perspective, which puts pressure on our customers. That remains. At the same time, what we have highlighted is there's a lot of industry consolidations. When industry consolidations happen that also commonly interacts with our contracts with what is now one as opposed to two entities. That headwind has kind of almost cycled through.","So that's good news with regard to cycling through. We've addressed kind of those concerns and how we want to contract with customers going forward and what we're also seeing is some volumes back into what I'll refer to as the securitization market. We see customers kind of ramping up to continue to do business as they always have. And as they look to expand and as they look to basically grow their businesses, both on the insurance side as well as the reinsurance side. They're looking at new avenues, whether it's cyber as an example. How are they going to move their books to new, what I'll refer to, is casualty-type of extreme events.","So that's a good, constructive approach for the industry and we're kind of on the cutting edge with a lot of that. So that's a positive. I would say to you that I don't see a lot of dramatic change inside the insurance industry, except for the ones I've highlighted in the past. There is a tremendous amount of technology \u2013 InsureTech that is happening. People are installing new systems. They're transitioning over. They're really looking to do the big data analytics thing. They're really looking to do digital engagement because people expect kind of better online engagement, like they would with an Amazon or when they're buying product on the web. All of that has created a nice opportunity for us to get involved in those \u2013 kind of those projects to redefine how they want to see the future. So, tough time, but good opportunities for us in light of the changes happening. So...","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you, both.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","My first question is, I guess in the past, you've given your expectations for insurance in that same 7% to 8% camp. And then financial or Argus in the mid-teens. And now, you're sort of grouping them together and giving that guidance and from the comments, it sounded like you already reiterated your confidence in Argus. And so is the missing piece here then the natural insurance slowdown until all your investable opportunities, whatever, start coming to fruition? Is that how we should think of it?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","No. Manav, it's Eva. Maybe I'll just take it up a level just \u2013 as \u2013 I know, we always try to have discussions at very detailed levels. But fundamentally, I think what we're trying to tie our confidence to in the statements that Scott made around insurance and financial combined and the growth targets we have there is, we've made comments in the past about our overall long-term growth targets organically for Verisk Analytics. And the statement that Scott made ties very closely to that.","Obviously, at the current moment in time, energy's at a moment where it's not at those levels. I think we've talked about that. I think the team is doing a great job. So really, how we've dimensioned it, I would think about it that way because we're \u2013 as Wood Mackenzie works through the energy cycle and is doing a great job, putting in that overall bucket at the moment in time would not be appropriate. So that's really what we're trying to message when we're talking about those two on a combined basis.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, got it. And then Scott, of those 20 opportunities, you mentioned a bunch of the different, I guess, bigger headlights and what \u2013 the stuff you're working on there. I mean, I think we've heard of telematics and imagery before, but is there any hierarchy or any sort of opportunity that stands out more than the others? Because some of the stuff like you mentioned like machine learning and Internet of Things seem fairly broad.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Well, the way that we're going to provide for our growth near and long-term actually is to operate on a number of fronts. And you've got some themes like Internet of Things broadly, like cyber as a theme, where the use cases, the path to commercialization is still sort of emerging. But that doesn't mean that the ideas are anything other than very good ideas and ones that we feel like we have special contributions to make.","But in the sort of intermediate term, two themes that are \u2013 the ones that you've heard us talk about a lot, actually, and we really do have a lot of enthusiasm for are the interpretation of remote imagery, which we think is a very important theme for any number of reasons, including remote imagery and the interpretation of it can apply across multiple verticals and actually, multiple geographies.","And the other one that I would point to is, in fact, telematics and especially vehicle telematics, where we just \u2013 we are \u2013 we can see, in our own experience, sort of the rising volumes of data and the increasing attention to those datasets and those analytics among our existing customer base. So, you've heard us talk about those two a lot. But that doesn't mean that they're tired in any sense. In fact, we think we're kind of in the early stages of both of those being important inside of our business.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. Just a question on the energy business, could you remind us what percent of your contracts are sort of multiyear? And do you see energy getting worse here or is that just primarily currency?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes, so on the first question, I would say, it's roughly half that are multiyear. And I think we've talked about in the past how we pick moments in time where we're responsive to customers and also market conditions where we choose to pull those out or shorten those. And what I would say is just with regards to WoodMac, we do continue, just in the reported results, to see some lag effect from the customer management in previous periods. But as we look at the business signing today, we're really seeing good growth in renewal signings, cross-sell, we have existing products. We have new solutions added from acquisitions over the past year or so. So we like how the year is shaping up so far.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And then just a question on capital allocation, leverage is pretty low. It doesn't seem like there's any significant scale deals outside of the current verticals that you're in. Maybe if you could just frame for us your appetite to put on a dividend here, given your highly reoccurring revenue base, and with regard to that, the $100 million buyback. Is that a run rate we should expect going forward?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. So, let me start with that. Eva might want to add a little something to this. But I want to go back to kind of the premise of your question. We actually have always seen the M&A program as being sort of the complement to our program of internal investment. One of the values that we believe that we bring to our investors that is unique is that we have hundreds of people walking the halls of our customers on a daily basis. And being in such close contact with our customers, we're able to see the solutions that are making a difference for them. First and foremost, our own, of course.","But, we're actually able to see other third parties and knowing where we think value lies and what our strategy is about and having this intelligence in terms of what else is going on in the market, we will always lean into the program of M&A. And in fact, if anything, we've really redoubled our efforts to enlist everybody to be a part of the M&A team.","And so, we don't see it as a world, a situation where there isn't opportunity. In fact, we think that there is opportunity. So I just needed to start with that because the way that we think about capital, we certainly care deeply about deploying capital effectively. The program of M&A has been highly productive for our investors and we believe that it will continue to be. We're very comfortable returning capital and we've done so and we've done so steadily.","Whatever is the right way to deploy capital is what we're going to do on behalf of our shareholders. To-date, it has not occurred to us that a dividend was necessarily a part of that mix. We ask the question routinely. We'll continue to ask the question. But so far, I think you've seen in our behavior that we're not only comfortable returning capital in the form of buybacks, but we have done so and I think you should continue to expect us to do so. So there will be a balance there. There always has been a balance there and there always will be a balance there.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","And maybe just to answer your specific question about run rate, I think just tying into how Scott described our capital allocation, our first filter that we look for is buying interesting companies that meet our distinctives that add to growth, that add to customer solution. And then after that filter is put in place, the next filter is our stock repurchase program and that's going to be keyed off, as it always has been, the value of the stock at the moment in time and we are managing that not to accretion\/dilution, but rather actually to the returns like our investors would as well.","So when you ask about run rate, we don't actually design our program as a run rate program. It's going to be a function of that initial filter around M&A and obviously, I think, as you know, M&A isn't sort of quarter-by-quarter, you chunk it in. And so that repurchase rate will vary across the year depending upon what that filter and what that pipeline looks like.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you so much.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Morning.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question. As I think about Verisk and my experience with the company, I would describe the business, insurance business generally, as being relatively unexposed or underexposed, I guess, to insurance end market fundamentals. I wonder if you can comment, sort of qualitatively on whether or not you think (35:59) changed and accordingly would it \u2013 does it influence the type of products you're developing, the time to market, our expectations for return on the investments you've been making and so forth. So I appreciate the comment on the reacceleration of revenue growth. I just wonder if there's something that's sort of fundamentally changed in the relationship between Verisk's insurance business and the end markets it serves.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. No, we really don't think that and as you would imagine, we actually are very alert to that and would be quite sensitive if we thought there was something there. But, no, actually, I mean, if you look at industry structure, there \u2013 I mean there's like one larger merger that is sort of in the process of ratcheting through.","And as we've discussed many times on these calls and in other forums, when something like that occurs, where those two companies are concerned, there may be a moment in time, adjustment. But, yes, I mean that's kind of normal course business from our perspective. And the regulatory environment really is not changing. It's not particularly dynamic. And so kind of from that perspective, the environment in which we do our business is more or less the same.","When I talk to the chief executives of other insurance companies, as I do routinely, what they are really about is changing their methods and trying to find ways to grow their businesses. That's fundamentally what they're giving attention to. And we stand in that stream of activity for them.","Do they have healthy amounts of self-respect and want to make sure that they're getting ultimate value from a partner like us and do they like to talk to us about the invoices that we send them, et cetera? Sure. And they always have. But I don't really think \u2013 if you go back 15 years, you could find moments when premiums went up pretty substantially year-over-year. That has not recurred for quite some time now.","So our mission is the same as it's always been, which is to do a fantastic job of relating to our customers and bringing them new sources of value. I think they're as open to that as they've ever been. I think that we are more innovative than we've ever been. And that's really what's going to determine the outcome as we go forward. I will say, we definitely need to keep our feet moving. Their issues modify and change and we need to be right there as they do. So it's not a question of staying where we are. We have to be extremely energetic. But I don't think anything has changed in terms of our standing with them.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And if I play devil's advocate and say, okay, Verisk has been investing in a lot of these new solutions, which I think you enumerated, Scott, for a while, and you just had a tough quarter with some external pressure. Why is it now that all of a sudden, at least it feels that way from the outside looking in, some of these new solutions gain traction? Are there specific contracts or customers to which you can point that create sort of a coincidental inflection point in the growth from some of these new offerings?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Well, that is why we have the view that we have of the rest of 2017 and beyond. As we know specifically what is going on in the business, specific customers, specific contracts and so, yes, I mean that's \u2013 whenever we're reporting to you, whenever we make a forward-looking statement, it's on that basis. That's how we think about our business.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I'll give a little color, if it's helpful. One of the things that we try to always do is take a look at what's committed from the standpoint of contracts, what's implementing, when and I think what we've seen is two things. About 2\/3 of our kind of need for revenue growth is committed in the form of kind of contracted price escalation, contracted new products, contracted new customers and what remains is kind of a new sale type of target that is reasonable in light of what we've done in the past and reasonable in light of what we have in our pipeline. So we continue to feel good about the full year.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Good morning.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, I just wanted to get delve a little bit more into Mark's good feelings about the rest of the year. So if we ended up at about, let's see look, so (41:01) 2.5% organic growth in Q1, you adjust for the true up, it will probably be about 3.3%. So, I wanted to ask about the pace of acceleration towards that 7% to 8% target and the 7% to 8% target being the level at which all businesses are firing on all cylinders. And are we thinking you could get there at the end of 2017? Or maybe we're thinking more of the end of 2018? I'm just trying to get a sense for the pace of the acceleration.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. Just to reiterate, that was a 2017 comment. So just to say it again, the rate of organic growth for our combined insurance and financial services businesses we think will be on a historic trend, in that 7% to 8% range for the full year.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","And as it relates to insurance, I'll reiterate to the extent that we think of the incremental growth that we need, about 2\/3 of it, we believe, are committed in the form of contract with 1\/3 or so of this incremental being, let's go, get it and that's new sales.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","And just to wrap on, I think you're asking a question about ramp, I think you know the nature of our business where we have a large portion of subscription contracts which is a real positive for us, but that also means is a subscription starts July 1, that starts contributing then. So naturally, as you layer in subscriptions, that layers into the growth across the rest of the year.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then for my follow-up question, I wanted to ask about the international expansion opportunity. You've talked in the past about an opportunity in banking, also an opportunity in insurance. I want to know if we could get an update on that and also maybe talk a little bit about how cloud receptivity by the client base is playing into that.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. So first of all, with respect to international, there are some \u2013 we're presenting differently internationally than we used to. WoodMac has always been international. But I'm \u2013 and actually, Argus has always had a strong dimension of that. But the \u2013 I just want to underline the Fintellix acquisition and the additional reach that that provides to the Argus franchise, which is a really good news.","Over on the insurance side, we are presenting credentials and presenting solutions at a level and to a set of customers that we kind of haven't before, basically. I mean we were aware of them. They were aware of us, but we are now in a position to be able to make large proposals to name brand companies.","We've always been able to do that in the reinsurance vertical. But now in the insurance vertical, we are increasingly positioned to be able to do that. It's really very exciting, actually. Nothing is going to occur overnight in vertical data analytic lands the way that we do things. But we are quite encouraged actually by what's going on there.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Scott, I was hoping if it's okay to look back to 2016. Looking back to early 2016, Verisk thought the insurance vertical, in total, would accelerate for full year 2016 and then later, contract starts seemed to slip and the insurance vertical didn't accelerate for full year 2016 and so what I want to know is the contract wins that you got from last year that you thought would ramp and then didn't ramp, are they ramping now?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. It's all a part of the overall view that we gave you. I mean, we've got thousands of customers. And it's depending upon which part of our company we're talking about.","But so the effect, the overall effect in our business is the accumulation of a lot of different things that are going on. But fundamentally, the relationships with the existing customers are as strong as ever.","We are pushing out internationally, which isn't yet an overwhelming effect but it's positive, it's constructive, and new solutions continue to find their way. And it's really at the intersection of all those things that our results occur.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.","Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. This is Patrick in for Toni. I wanted to go back to the stream of new products. How should we think about the relative commercial impact of the new products you're currently developing or rolling out across the insurance business, as compared to the classic products you developed and rolled out over the last three years? I'm wondering if there are just fewer home runs left to hit in that market.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","No. I don't feel that way at all. In fact, I think some of the newer solutions have probably above average potential. And it may \u2013 those of you who have sort of been with us for a while, if we keep saying the same things like remote imagery analytics and Telematics that may sound like there's nothing new there.","In data analytic land, particularly in vertical market data analytic land, it takes a while to get to the inflection point. And then you get to the inflection point. And so, that's effectively the dynamic that work inside of our business. So, don't misunderstand us going back to the same themes and as you try to interpret our growth in any particular time period, you may be trying to sort of create sort of a 1:1 equivalence.","Solutions, when they finally find their mark, actually have an unusual inflection relative to where they began. And so, as you would imagine, day-to-day, minute-to-minute, we're working on this absolutely as hard as we can to get established as well as feeding the pipeline with additional new solutions. I don't \u2013 it's not the case that the newer solutions have lesser potential than those that maybe we developed three to five years ago. I don't know if you want to add to that, Mark.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Only thing I was going to highlight, too, is I think we have a preference. I'd assume our colleague from the phone do that. We would prefer a subscription-type model. So as opposed to kind of going at it from a transactional perspective, we'd like to create longer-term contracts with customers and the revenue rec on that flow (47:57). So that is a way we feel that they'll use us for all of their transactions as opposed to selected ones, if you were to try to price it on a transaction. So maybe a little bit of a patient philosophy, but that's the way we typically worked up the side of the (48:14) solutions into our revenue mix.","Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. And in the Investor Day in December, you talked about a $2 billion TAM for Argus. I'm wondering if there are opportunities for you to go after that market in a bigger way with incremental investments in sales and new product development or perhaps more transformative M&A.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Sort of reverse order on your question. The acquisition of Fintellix for example, we really do believe it puts us on a different foot in global markets. And there are other solutions other \u2013 I would call them kind of point solutions, data analytic point solutions that relate strongly to things that we already today that we are interested in thinking about. And that would be a combination of buy and build.","But otherwise, the way that the Argus business advances is basically, we present credentials to companies that aren't customers. They find out the speed with which they can begin to commercialize the insight that we bring them from a data analytic perspective.","So in a sense, I agree with the tone of your question in that the more that we can do to present credentials to an ever-expanding set of customers, the more of that we can do the better. That said, I think we've got a great team and I think we're doing a good job with that. But we're always leaning into how can we take this wonderful platform and leverage it?","Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Appreciate the color.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about the margin outlook. Have you adjusted the cost based on the slow start? And how much of the margin outlook is dependent on the growth this year?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. Well, thanks for the question. I think as I've mentioned, as we're talking through the quarter, we were modest in the growth in the quarter. Expenses grew about 3.3%. We are within that investing in the new solutions and also making sure that we've got the capacity as revenue ramps.","So, I guess the way I would think about it is, we don't manage those expenses quarter-by-quarter because we are managing for the long-term growth. Certainly, as \u2013 if you see revenue ramp, that's helpful to margins as we go through the year. But what we want to make sure that we're not doing is that we're not being reactive to unusual, short-term events and disadvantaging ourselves for the long-term.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And then on the energy front, how much of the rebound is dependent on oil prices and CapEx versus selling the new solutions?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","It's a mix of both. But when we talk about pricing and we talk about the energy business, it's not the case that there's this one to one correspondence between what the price of the commodity does and our growth opportunity.","It is true that there has been \u2013 the shape of the price curve over the course of the last couple of years is one that hasn't been seen for several decades. It's a very unusual moment. Actually, if you think about it, the WoodMac business, there were two once in a generation things that have happened in the course of the last two years.","One is that, the shape of the price curve is extremely unusual. And the other is Britain exited the EU, and the effect that it's had on their currency. Those are two real big effects, both of which are relatively difficult to foresee.","In spite of all that, actually, I think the strength of WoodMac is seen more than it has ever been. But back to your specific point, I think that what you need is \u2013 what we need is essentially where we're getting to, which is a stable environment, one where our resource company customers are making money and leaning into investments on the front foot, basically.","And they got, understandably, very defensive beginning late in 2014 when several of them had to borrow money to pay their dividends. So, these very, very major macro effects. But as they wash out, one of the things about Verisk is we're in the business of growing faster than the underlying markets \u2013 vertical markets that we serve. And we've essentially always done that. We've been doing that, 2016, 2017 we will \u2013 I mean that's who we are, that's what we do.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Arash Soleimani of KBW.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. A couple questions. So first, I just wanted to ask, within energy and specialized, how much of the decline came from WoodMac versus environmental health and safety? And then just continuing on that question, how much of that was subscription versus transactional?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. So if you were to look in the segment, you're right. Those are the two key pieces within there. Obviously, WoodMac is a larger business than our environmental health and safety business. Although I would say that in the quarter, its performance was better than that smaller business. So there's sort of a balance between the two.","As I said earlier, we still have some lag effects from previous periods in WoodMac. I mean, that's the nature of subscription businesses. And so that did contribute to a bit of the decline in the quarter. Also remember, you've got \u2013 we've got a lot of numbers in front of you. Now you've got three different growth rates per line, so if you're looking at the absolute reported, the currency effect from WoodMac would be the largest impact. And I think I talked about that $7.5 million in the quarter.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And then I have a question that's probably very, very, very long-term in nature. But just as we look at technology that's making cars safer and that ultimately will even make cars drive themselves, which will increase safety even more, that could have a very negative impact on auto premiums longer term. I'm just curious how that impacts Verisk.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. Let me take that on. I mean clearly, that's on the minds of our personal lines of writers. The insurance industry as a whole, I think has a view that that's going to make for a safer long-term environment for people on the road. It can save a million or more lives per year. And I think there's some views out there, you can kind of do your own research that, now, the personal auto premium could be something that looks at maybe half of what it is today.","I think those customers are looking to ways to kind of reimagine their business and I think a lot of it has to do with moving into what I'll call small commercial lines, so micro business owners work on the cyber side of things. That very much fits our model. That's very helpful. They want to try to move into what is kind of a personal lines flow, meaning just, do it in an expert way without people involved, and they want to move that concept, which is on the personal lines side, to commercial.","So those fit well into what we're trying to help them do that. The other thing I think we should just remember as a whole, a large part of the risk throughout the world is either uninsured or underinsured. And I think that's the biggest opportunity for the industry as a whole. There's a need there and I think the industry needs to find ways to ensure what is a very, very large market opportunity with better analytics and ways to assess that risk. So longer-term, bigger picture, but (56:17).","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I would just add that one of the things that will always be the case is, almost regardless of the size of the segment, the participants will still need to understand where they stand relative to the overall marketplace and part of what we do is we really help get a handle on what's affecting that whole space and also the relativity \u2013 excuse me, the relativities between the players. That will be an enduring need. So it's not just the scale of the market. It's also the need to pick apart what's going on in the market.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you very much for the answers.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Sure.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, guys, morning. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Hi, Henry.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to make sure I understand in terms of the trends in insurance and the Decision Analytics side. I understand there's a number of moving parts in terms of the revenue growth. Just from an earnings growth perspective, is that tracking sort of in line with the organic growth post \u2013 or excluding the true-up revenue. And as a follow-up to that, in terms of the ramp-up that you expect from the new products in insurance, is that also a ramp up that you expect in earnings as well? Thanks.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. So, there are a couple questions in there. So maybe just to start with, I think your first question is when you say profitability, I presume you're speaking on an EBITDA level. And what I would say is \u2013 I mean, what you see across the company is, we're managing expense growth to both fund the existing solutions as well as new ones and I would say that's the same within insurance. So I don't think you'd see dramatically different trends if you were to sort of parse apart the profitability by vertical because we are investing across all of the verticals. I would also note that in the acquisition front, there are a number of new acquisitions. In the quarter, those were essentially across all the acquisitions breakeven. Those are things that we're clicking into our existing business and we think that those margins will ramp. So you have those two effects within the margin.","And then I think your second question was with regards to new products and the profitability of those as those sort of click in. Generally, similar to the rest of our solutions, the whole idea of build it once, sell it a lot of times. The more you put on the top-line, the greater the profitability expands. Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything additional about any of the specific solutions we're working on there.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So I think we were trying to address this a little bit before. I think we are seeing uptake in some of the remote imagery. I think we're seeing some uptake in our customers with telematics. I think we have good growth and opportunities internationally the way we contracted around that will be probably more subscription that it is on the transactional perspective. So as that uptake is more of a second-half story, we would also see that as hopefully helping margins because what happens here is we've already invested in or investing in a solution. So it's just the overall dynamic of the nature of our business. Yes, there is a lot of costs that are there and they'll remain because we're investing and once we start the uptake in revenues, there's not a lot of variable incremental cost sales.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Anj Singh of Credit Suisse.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you folks spoke to some of the contract signings slipping out of 1Q for your energy customers. Is that just timing randomness perhaps, or is this indicative of the end market that continues to stabilize? Just wondering if there's anything particular we should be taking away from that anecdote.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes, the comment was about the financial services segment, not the energy segment. And no, there is \u2013 it really was just timing.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, got you. And then another question on the 20 opportunities, Scott, asked slightly differently. Realizing these are longer-term opportunities, would it be fair to say that the internal augmentation or development focus is also primarily on remote imagery and telematics? Perhaps, if you can offer any color on which ones you've made the most progress recently aside from their good market traction. Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes, it really is remote imagery and telematics. Those are the places where they both represent very large opportunities and places where we're seeing commercial response to what it is we're doing. So we've talked about those a lot. We continue \u2013 we will continue for years to talk about those a lot because they're just that important. But there are a lot of things on the list of 20 that are very exciting across all the segments. And some of them are domestically-based. Some of them are globally-based.","They all really rely on advanced data analytic methods and in many cases, are being founded on new kinds of contributory data, unique data that will help us to do things we think others won't be able to. So it's an exciting agenda basically. You get to a list like that by being close to your customers and understanding where their needs are going.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Most of my questions have been answered. But, Eva, kind of housekeeping one. Could \u2013 you were going kind of quick there when you were giving the adjusted Q2, Q3, Q4 2016 revenues. I was wondering if you could repeat that. (62:32) the $490 million, $505 million.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. Sorry if I was going too quick on that. So, just to repeat, if we look to 2Q 2016 and restated it to today's currency rates, that would have been $490 million. The reported number was $498 million. For Q3 2016, it would have been $494 million. The reported number was $498 million. And for Q4 2016, it would have been $505 million, and the reported number was $506 million.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And can I just \u2013 did that also exclude the true-up \u2013 the true-up was in the Q1 of 2016, correct?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Correct.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. All right. That was my...","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","And that was just the reported number total translated at the currency rate.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. That's really helpful. Thank you very much.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC.","Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is Gunnar Hansen in for Gary. I'll be quick. I guess, just the timing of the Argus contract, I guess, for the deals, have those been signed already in the quarter? And I guess, are those new contracts with existing customers or were they \u2013 some of those tied to some of the contracts that were completed in Q1?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. Those are existing customers. And as we do multiple things for our customers, there is a layering of that. But I think, as Scott said, it's a timing issue and we feel comfortable and confident with that work moving forward.","Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, I guess, with the energy and Wood Mackenzie, obviously, there is still some lag from some of your customers and the multi-year deals rolling over. I guess, can you kind of give us some more color on whether you're seeing greater demand or usage in various regions or some of the pricing terms? Are you guys looking to lock in into more longer-term deals? Or maybe just give us some more commentary on some of the improving trends you mentioned. Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. Well, a couple of different things in there. One is the customer set continues to expand, as we've shared with you. The solution set continues to expand also where we're \u2013 you've sort of known us as the people that can describe the global supply curve, which is extremely valuable and very hard to do and a very, very nice sort of starting place \u2013 a strong place to stand. What we will get increasingly good at is and more of our business will be about is the underlying technical conditions and helping our customers sort of navigate those as well.","With respect to pricing trends, we're always just \u2013 the WoodMac product set as all of our product sets, we're always stuffing more value in there. And that's one of the things that is productive where pricing is concerned. So you've got that effect. So, basically, new solutions, new customers and improving environment where pricing is concerned. That's basically going to be the WoodMac story going forward.","The currency effects will wash out. And I do think that we'll see where this is the kind of thinking we're doing, but it may be that as the environment is improving, we may actually want to be a little lighter on our feet and actually sort of pull in the length of the contract so that we can \u2013 as things move, we can actually enjoy it more in real time.","Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks for squeezing me in here. My first question on the energy revenue, I know we've asked a number on this already but as you mentioned that there were some contracts signed the depths (66:20) of the market and there's a lag nature to them. I guess, I wanted to specifically ask, are we therefore at the end of the worst of these lag contracts and you should actually see revenue growth improve? Or is that something will be playing through for the rest of the year and therefore, growth really shouldn't pick up until closer to 2018?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","We would expect improvement as the year progresses.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And I guess, one housekeeping question. Just on the M&A contribution from Fintellix, if you are sharing that as we build our models?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. Typically, for the smaller deals, we don't share that in advance. It will come in April 1. So you'll see the numbers as we report in 2Q.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice-President and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.","Eva Huston","Thank you, Jake, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2015 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.","All the numbers we discussed today, unless otherwise stated, will reflect continuing operations and exclude the results from Interthinx. Interthinx is shown in discontinued operations reflecting the sale of the business in March 2014. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website at verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday\u2019s earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott Stephenson","Thanks, Eva, good morning, all. In the first quarter we again delivered excellent results with total and organic revenue growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 22%.Profitability was strong with EBITDA growth of 18% and margins that continue to be industry leading. We\u2019re pleased with these results which we believe reflect the strength of our solutions and their value to our customers.","During the quarter as you know we announced the $2.8 billion acquisition of Wood Mackenzie. We have received regulatory approval for the transaction and expect to close in the second quarter as we had previously stated after completing debt and equity offerings to fund the transaction.","I had the chance recently to spend time with many of our new Wood Mac colleagues in a variety of offices around the globe, and I came away more impressed with the debt, expertise and professionalism of the team. And we could not be more excited to welcome the Wood Mac team into the Verisk family.","Wood Mac is the global data analytics company with a culture very much like our own. We\u2019re adding a truly Verisk like business, one which offers its customers industry standard solutions based on proprietary data. The solutions are primarily provided through recurring subscriptions which benefit from network effects and scale economies. Like Verisk, Wood Mac has demonstrated an ability to grow by adding value through all of its customer\u2019s business cycles over a very long period of time.","In the first quarter, Wood Mac grew revenue in the high single digits as measured in pounds. Because of our combined free cash flow generating capabilities and the strength of the Verisk balance sheet we will be able to acquire Wood Mac with the benefit of an appropriate level of financial leverage. Our use of a prudent mix of debt and equity allows us to maintain our investment grade credit rating.","With regard to capital allocation for buybacks we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program in December of 2014, as a result we had no incremental repurchases during the quarter. And once we are on track to meet our commitment to de-lever to 2.5 times gross debt to EBITDA we will manage our repurchase program as a part of our balanced use of capital. Our existing authorization at the end of the quarter was about $190 million.","We continue to focus on innovation throughout our businesses as we believe this will enable us to deliver value to our customers and therefore strong financial results for the long term. A great example is our ongoing innovation effort that we announced recently with the launch of ISO ClaimSearch DNA. Some of you may have seen a demo at our Investor Day in March. With this new solution, PMC insurers can better visualize large networks of suspicious activity operating across the industry.","DNA magnifies the power of ISO ClaimSearch which recently passed the $1 billion Claims mark to find patterns of potential fraud in increasingly large data sets and the detect entire networks of organized activity among individuals and businesses including related service providers.","The patent tending technology provides a fully automated solutions proactive fraud network detection. The advanced analytics and predicted models work seamlessly to uncover hidden relationships across large data sets and to prioritize the networks of interest for each customer. ISO ClaimSearch DNA also provides insurers with alerts and actionable intelligence on their suspicious networks and claims for further investigation.","Organized fraud often affects multiple carriers. So an industry wide perspective is essential to helping companies fight large scale fraud by giving them the whole picture. This is one of many and various innovative solutions that we continue to develop. We continue to feel confident in our long term opportunities to grow shareholder value through a combination of innovation driven organic growth and prudent deployment of the capital including through our strategy driven M&A.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark to cover the financial results in more detail.","Mark Anquillare","Thank you, Scott. In the first quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing in the future. Revenue grew 12.1%. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, revenue grew 11.5%. The strong organic growth reflects the health of our business and the value we deliver to our customers through our mission critical solutions.","Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 16.6% and 15.6% on an organic basis. We saw organic growth across all four categories led by financial services. Decision Analytics insurance grew 8.7% in the first quarter, the increase was driven by strong growth in underwriting solutions and good growth of catastrophe models, claims and loss quantification solutions. Touchstone continues to be a growth drive in the quarter and we were pleased with the contribution from [Indiscernible] as well.","Financial services revenue from continuing operations increased 67.3% driven by strong overall performance bolstered by a significant onetime project around advertising effectiveness. This project yielded very nice profitable revenue in the quarter as well as intellectual property which we will leverage repeatedly as our advertising effect in this business grows. Excluding this project which had revenue around $11 million growth in the quarter was 15.1%. The advertising affect of this market is early in its development yet has significant long term potential.","Healthcare revenue grew 17.5% as reported which increases in all solutions group led again by payment accuracy. The results in the quarter came in ahead of our expectations as the transaction nature of much of the business means we have lower visibility than in our other businesses, and we saw higher levels pass the revenue than anticipated.","Our current forecast indicates growth will moderate as we move through the rest of the year. As you know our second half of the year is seasonally larger than the first half. We are expecting visibility in the Medicare Advantage business to increase as the year progresses.","The changes in contract language we discussed with you last quarter took effect later in the year than we had anticipated. As we told you last quarter the Verisk health revenues for the first quarter 2014 would have been $58.4 million if reported on the basis of the new contract language. On that same basis, the first quarter of 2015 revenue would have been $68.4 million. Growth on a net basis was 17.2% just below the reported growth of the quarter.","Specialized category revenue increased 16.5% in the first quarter and 4.3% on an organic basis. Maplecroft\u2019s $2.6 million in revenue in the quarter was in line with our expectations. We continue to see growth in the quarter from environmental health and safety solutions and we\u2019re seeing good traction from our commercial, weather and climate analytics.","Risk Assessment of revenue grew 5.3% indicating the value to our long standing insurance customers. Industry standard insurance programs grew 5.5% reflecting our 2015 invoices which were effective January 1 and continued contribution from newer solutions.","Our property specific rating underwriting information revenue grew 4.8% in the quarter; this increase was driven by higher transaction volumes from those customers who have not yet migrated through a subscription for a long term contract. We have focused on transitioning most of our customers to subscriptions over the past couple of years which provides us good visibility.","Total EBITDA increased 18.3% to $216.3 million. The 28.9% increase in Decision Analytics EBITDA to $115.3 million was the result of growth in the business and improved operations particularly at Verisk Health. Decision Analytics EBITDA was also helped by some non-recurring project at Argus which was very profitable.","And finally, Decision Analytics EBITDA includes about $4.4 million of fees related to the Wood Mac acquisition. Risk Assessment EBITDA increased 8.2% to $101 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management including \u2013 people led across following the fourth quarter talent realignment. We do expect to tie additional people as part of the realignment initiatives.","Interest expense was up $823,000 primarily due to increased debt related to the funding of the accelerated share repurchase program. Total debt of short term and long term was about $1.3 billion at March 31, 2015.","Our reported effective tax rate was 38.1% for the fourth quarter. Adjusted net income increased 15.2% to $107.5 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully dilutive basis was $0.67 for the quarter an increase of 21.8%, the average diluted share count was 161.5 million in the quarter on March 31, 2015 our diluted share count was 161.7 million shares.","Free cash flow defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures increased 25.2% to $146.2 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2015. This represented 113.8% of EBITDA. As you know this quarter is a strong cash flow quarter for us given our January 1 cycle of invoices and industry standard programs.","Capital expenditures decreased 31.5% to 24.8% in the quarter and were 5.4% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx of about $150 million up modestly from 2014. As of March 31, 2015 our cash and cash equivalents were $152.8 million. As you think about your models for the full year all of the following observations are before adding Wood Mac. You will recall that second quarter is when we have our annual increases and they cause a typical step up salary expenses.","As I mentioned previously the Argus project work was very profitable. In addition, we anticipate amortization of intangibles of about $53 million. Fixed asset depreciation, amortization of about $110 million and a tax rate around 38%. Higher expected deprecation, amortization is due to internally developed software leading to new solutions moving into services sooner which we view as a positive for our business. Because of the accelerated share repurchase our share count will be down year-over-year in 2015.","Based upon our current debt balances and maturities full year interest expense will be about $66 million. After Wood Mac transaction closes we will provide additional details to help you update your models with more granularity. Overall, we are pleased to report that our business is performing well. We are seeing growth across multiple verticals and we are executing on our operational plans.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Eva for a comment before the Q&A.","Eva Huston","Thanks Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow up. This will give more people an opportunity to ask their questions. Also, given that the Wood Mac acquisition has not yet closed we will appreciate you focussing your questions on the Verisk quarter and business. And with that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair and Company. Your line is now open.","William Blair","Okay, thank you. Just want to add on Argus the media effectiveness can you elaborate I guess in more detail what it was and I guess on the financial impact I guess how profitable is it and then I guess also elaborate on the future and I guess you talked about retaining the intellectual property you know maybe you can repeat the works in the future.","Mark Anquillare","Yes thank you Tim, let me take that. This is Mark. The Argus business is very subscription oriented, because of the nature of advertising effect in this there is some project work either direct with customers or with partners. This is an opportunity to really build out a very interesting capability that we will be able to leverage and use it in the future. And I would tell you that I think we are optimistic that both that capability and database will be leveraged but I think it also kind of set the stage hopefully in the future for a longer term subscription along the same line.","So, we are optimistic probably a little longer out. To answer your question, some of the work or a lot of the work that was performed in support of that project did take place or a part of it took place in 2014. So as you think about the first quarter in 2015 that was higher than our traditional margin it was a strong margin business as it affected the first quarter 2015.","Scott Stephenson","And Scott here, I\u2019ll just add that one of the things that\u2019s going on is the functionality that Argus represents any add effectiveness world is one that various players are becoming more familiar with more comfortable with and I think that probably from time to time there will be projects like this just because they kind of get started, they figure out what it\u2019s really about and then hopefully and often usually it matures into a longer term kind of a relationship.","William Blair","Okay, thanks. And then I guess on healthcare you made the comment that you expected to moderate I guess across the year, is it just tougher comparison is that something that you see I guess in the pipeline or something that\u2019s falling off that I guess it makes gives you that expectation?","Mark Anquillare","Yes sure Tim, let me take that. Obviously we were very pleased with the quarter at Verisk Health. As you kind of move forward, yes second half of the year is where a lot of the Medicare Advantage work comes in. We don\u2019t have quite the visibility on that as we said in the past it\u2019s a little more transactional in nature and we are just trying to make sure that we are going to appreciate that first quarter was a good one but we do see that there will be probably a little bit of ramp-down as we progress through the year as a relation to the comps and the lack of visibility into the perspective revenue streams.","William Blair","But is there \u2013 I guess would you be willing to frame it all I guess in the level of moderation than you expect?","Mark Anquillare","Tim, I think we tried to stay away from any specific guidance on this topic and you know as I said I think we feel good about the healthcare business. We like the fact that its growth is across all the segments but I think we\u2019ll stay away from any specific growth rate at this point.","William Blair","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open","Manav Patnaik","Thank you, good morning everybody and congratulations on another impressive quarter. I just wanted to follow up on that add effect discretion; I mean clearly you guys have been talking about this for a couple of quarters. And I think I understand what the opportunity there is. I was hoping you could help us frame what the addressable market is from your piece of the pie, your share of what that market potentially is just to understand you know how we could frame the potential size of this business for you down the road?","Scott Stephenson","Manav, Scott here. Just a couple of things, one is, I would say that while interest in advertising effectiveness has effectively existed as long as advertising has existed. In reality we now have data sets and methods which allow us to look at the relationship between the signals which are put out and the response which is given to those signals. And our August team is very well equipped to work in this field both because of the content that we\u2019ve got but also the methods. And our general excellence actually add to large scale in analytics.","So this is a category, down the way we are doing it that is relatively new. And so that to me is the primary framing thought here is that its\u2019 early days. The other thing that I would say is that the kind of work that we are doing applies to both traditional and new media.","And we\u2019re working to bring the capability into all of those different domains. And so, when you\u2019re talking about the new media space for example, you tend to find some relatively large players. And it\u2019s very much a part of our plan and our goal to be working with a good number of them. So, that\u2019s not giving you sort of a total TAM for the opportunity, partly again because we\u2019re in early days. But we see this is as a very major opportunity.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. Fair enough and just on the follow-up, on the Verisk Health side, you know, you mentioned that you saw some notable operational improvement on the healthcare side. I know you haven\u2019t given us absolute margins before. But can you maybe just help us understand the magnitude of that improvement, and if that is something we should see a sustainable going forward?","Scott Stephenson","We certainly expect that operational effectiveness will continue to grow at Verisk Health. It was a point of primary focus by our Verisk Health colleagues in 2014. It was reflected in what I would call material improvements in some of the core metrics that relate to for example, the RQI side of the business, and the team remains focused on taking it to an even higher level. So, you\u2019ve heard us say that we have felt and continue to feel that there is an opportunity, and that we will margin improvement in Verisk Health. And we stand by that.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. Thanks a lot for the time, guys.","Scott Stephenson","You bet.","Mark Anquillare","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning Scott and Mark.","Scott Stephenson","Good morning.","Mark Anquillare","Good morning.","David Togut","We saw very strong margin expansion in the quarter, EBITDA margins up 250 basis points year-over-year. Historically, Scott you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re very long term focus in your investment program and you perhaps you could frame this for us recognizing that you did call out some one time high margin revenue in the quarter. Is this potentially the beginning of a trend where we start to see positive operating leverage going forward?","Scott Stephenson","Yes.","David Togut","Can you elaborate?","Scott Stephenson","Well, we start with as I think everybody with us today knows. We start with a very highly efficient organization already. And we pay a lot of attention to that, benefited of course by the fact that we run our business in a way where fundamentally our model has scale and leverage built into it. So the starting point for the performance of our business with respect profitability is the nature of the business that we have and that we choose to build.","But having said that, I don\u2019t think that there is anything in consistent with our long-term focus and our focus on organic revenue growth as being a particular measure, our vitality as an organization and booking for ways to operate our business with even more efficiency. So we don\u2019t feel as if we\u2019re engaging in any sort of a trade off between the near term and the long-term even as we give a great deal of attention to the efficiency of our operations. Mark, I don\u2019t if you want to add anything to that.","Mark Anquillare","No. I agree. I just will kind of call out a few things that we try to talk about as we discuss here this morning, Argus, clearly that revenue was very highly profitable. Two, we talked about the [Indiscernible] Verisk Health for the most part that as it move gross to net that will actually help margins just mathematically. Offsetting that I want to highlight that there is an element of talent realignment in our industry standard programs and we will be hiring back. There we will also see some salary increases across the universe and the enterprise, so those are couple of things we need to consider in the second quarter and beyond. Finally, we did have about $4.4 million of fees related to Wood Mac that we called out here in the first quarter. Obviously there will be some more in second quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","Hi, thanks. So, I\u2019m looking at the Decision Analytics, insurance line, the growth rate tends to jump around there. So, I was wondering if there was anything that basically anything that depressed the growth rate in this quarter and how we should think about the full year for that one.","Scott Stephenson","Yeah. I mean, I would not point at any macro factors which would really have explanatory power there. Couple of things that are always just kind of there in the background but they kind of wash in one direction and they will wash in another direction. One would be just levels of claims activity which tends to related to both our loss quantification activities as well as our \u2013 it create a climate which is supportive for catastrophe modeling in the general sense.","And then, there can be from time-to-time consolidation particularly not really among the primary insurers but more with respect to some of the brokers and some of the maybe the second tier reinsurers. And so from time to time there\u2019s a little bit of that. And so you have those kinds of factors that are kind of in there. But substantially what we do is actually subscription base and long term in nature and that continues to be the case.","Toni Kaplan","Okay, great. And then just on the international expansion opportunity in financial services, just wanted to ask how you see that in terms of timing, I guess this is into Wood Mac question, but given that Wood Mac is global, does that accelerate your sort of process of expanding internationally and financial services and what steps you need to take in terms of adapting to new geographies in that product line.","Scott Stephenson","Yes. So, we do believe actually that we are in the process of re-platforming Verisk globally in a way that will be supportive of. We hope and expect many, many parts of our business, but specifically to Argus, the way you should think of that is it\u2019s a little bit of a step function and what I mean by that is that lying at the center of the Argus business just as with many other parts of Verisk. You\u2019ve got these very rich datasets which are contributory from the same companies that service our primary customers. And so there is kind of a critical math sort of a quality in any given market where once you get, once we get enough of the leaders saying that they want to come in to the consortium model it tends to then cause much of the rest of the market to come along.","And so, you sort of have these step function changes in state where you sort of aren\u2019t at critical math until you are. And once you are critical math it all begins to change a little bit. And so, even recently and confirming with our Argus colleagues we heard some exciting news about specific markets. But you should just understand it as there will be movements and time in which any given market, any particular market sort of becomes a part of the Argus model. And that is the way we build a market at a time.","Toni Kaplan","Thanks a lot. Congrats on the quarter.","Scott Stephenson","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","James Friedman","Hi. Thanks. Just ask my two upfront. One housekeeping, one Mark, the CapEx decline significantly year-over-year and I know you\u2019ve made some comments about the Q2 CapEx expectation if you could comment why that might happened in the first quarter. And then secondly, with regard to ISO, could you help quantify what some of the cost rationalizations might have been in the quarter that would be helpful? Thank you.","Mark Anquillare","Sure. Let me take the first from a CapEx perspective. We did do some moving of offices and we were moving also our data centers last year and first quarter, so we had some high CapEx in 1Q, 2014. And I think we also started or at least done from our [Indiscernible] inflows of a CapEx seems like there maybe a little bit of movement of CapEx to get some year-end deals from vendors pertain to 2014 which seem to keep the CapEx dollars really low relative to past history in first quarter of 2015. So, I would tell you that we kind keep \u2013 we kept our full year forecast generally unchanged. We just think it kind of moves into second and third quarter and I wouldn\u2019t really point anything expect for timing with regard to the CapEx number.","Second question I think was a little about the talent realignment inside of our industry standard programs. We\u2019ve have great people and great talent inside the iPass team, the iPass team represents one of the units that industry standard program. And I think we wanted to recognize the efforts of those people over the years and we from most part offer the package so that we could get some new talent that is focused on new opportunities.","This is an opportunity to become more efficient with our core business, be more effective with our core business. And at the same time kind of backfill position so that we can aim point to the future with new opportunities and expansion. And I think the hiring to backfill those position is a little bit delay. We want to get the right people and we wanted to get the right position filled as soon as possible but that\u2019s causing it. I would tell you that we\u2019re probably in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 positions, does that help, Jim.","James Friedman","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman","I want to review DA insurance, 9% looks very solid to me, but the question is around year-over-year comparisons in particular and when I look at 9% growth in the first quarter versus the 12% growth. The fourth quarter, I come away taking perhaps it has to do with the year-over-year comparisons being about 4.5% more difficult in the first quarter and what might be the implications going it into the second quarter here and there\u2019s also a larger year-over-year comparison for DA insurance?","Mark Anquillare","So, let me try to answer your question maybe more qualitatively and then I can maybe address that. So, couple of things always happen, one there is some project oriented revenue as it relates to the catastrophe modeling, the timing of cat bonds and things like that that we called out before, that cause I think a little bit of a comp relative to first quarter 2014 but not material, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s was anything noteworthy there.","The other thing some times relates to the timing of new customers, so its sometimes a bit of grow over as an example inside of the loss quantification I know that we had a reasonably large customer that came on in first quarter 2014, obviously that customer was customer 2014 also in 2015. So, I think as we think forward from an insurance perspective. I think second quarter you\u2019re probably right, a little bit tougher comp, but we have a consistency. We have a subscription and I think we feel that we\u2019re going to be in good shape probably a little bit more of a second half story from an DA insurance perspective.","Andrew Steinerman","Great. And 9% for DA insurance feels like a pretty normal growth rate for you, right?","Scott Stephenson","I think the business is substantially, well, entirely the same business that it was, the only thing I would add is as this year progresses I think we\u2019re going to have some very exciting things to be able to talk about in terms of the expansion of some of thing for doing specifically on the DA side of insurance, and we look forward to being able to talk about those. These are innovations and partnerships and customer relationships.","So it actually feels very good. The nature of those businesses is that they are very, very embedded with their customers and behind that we have a series of innovations that I think are really quite exciting.","Andrew Steinerman","Sounds good, Scott. Thank you.","Scott Stephenson","You bet.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you feel would be the trajectory or seasonality in healthcare. I know that\u2019s usually backend loaded, I know you have some different comps. So not really guidance but the way that it worked in the past has been more backend loaded, so I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color on sort of how this year looks, and if that\u2019s change versus other years?","Mark Anquillare","Sure. I will tell you that we\u2019ll probably see about the same split or the same balance between first half and second half. Second half is typically a 60% relative, first half being a 40% type of total. The swing or the nature of that disparity is really in the Medicare Advantage business. It\u2019s more transactional and because Medicare and what we refer to those Medicare suites typically runs from July through the beginning of \u2013 end of January that\u2019s what causes that. Now when those transaction volumes happens whether its third quarter or fourth quarter it lies in the first, it\u2019s a little tough to be very specific about that.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. And then just on the pricing in the insurance DA or other insurance business can you talk about your relative pricing power versus this year versus all the years and if there\u2019s been any change there.","Scott Stephenson","No change.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Bill Warmington","Good morning everyone.","Mark Anquillare","Good morning.","Bill Warmington","So, one question for you on the margin and very strong performance this quarter, if you add back to Wood Mac closing cost, it would put you about 48.1%. And I know that when you started out few years ago with the 43% to 45% long-term target and then after the Sale of Interthinx, that went up to 45% to 47% range. And then given that strong performance in this quarter adjusted through Wood Mac and in fact that the gross to net in the healthcare isn\u2019t yet in the numbers, should we be thinking about that upper end of that range moving up going forward?","Scott Stephenson","Again, we feel \u2013we were very committed to running the business with efficiency and we feel that we are steadily finding those efficiencies and we do a fire to run a business which is as profitable as it can be and at the same time is growing strongly especially organically over long periods of time and we\u2019re still on that March. And we don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t feel that we have exhausted all of the opportunities to operate efficiently. At the same time there is always the counter balancing points that we\u2019re introducing new innovations, even yesterday we were sitting down and looking at an investment that we\u2019re going to initiate this year to pursue one of those exciting opportunities that I was just talking about as it relates to DA. So there\u2019s always a balance there.","But just as was the case, when we started out in the 43% to 45% range that didn\u2019t mean that we relax our interest in becoming more efficient and profitable and we\u2019re still on exactly at that same mode.","Bill Warmington","Okay. And then my second question on the discrete network analysis module, just wanted to ask if you could frame what you thought that opportunity was and what kind of a contributor that was likely to be either to \u2013 and how we should think about the time frame there, 2015, 2016?","Scott Stephenson","Well, yes, the work is ongoing and I say by the way that is another good example of the Verisk way of doing innovation because one of our confidence points on this work is that its been done with close collaboration and consultation with customers, which is a very, very important part of our process.","I think what remains to be seen is how much the effect of claim CNA is reinforcing the overall ClaimSearch franchise versus how much it will generate incremental especially identifiable incremental revenue streams. But when I think about value to the customer, the opportunity to be able to essentially interrogate the data and there\u2019s much more big data kind of way, I think the value will be significant, how we chose to commercialize and monetize that, that\u2019s -- think that\u2019s a little down the road, yeah.","Bill Warmington","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm","Hi, good morning. Just, sorry to come back to the margin, but doing some of the math here myself, if I just look at Decision Analytics, and I assume that this project in Argus was about 80% margin and maybe that being conservative and I just for the one-timer and pass through, I get to about 41%.","So first of all is that in the ballpark and if I compare this to a year ago, I think that\u2019s about 350 basis points margin expansion. So, maybe you can just break this down where you think that margin expansion came from in terms of efficiencies and on the healthcare side and maybe scale you gaining and other things you want to point out?","Andrew Steinerman","Yes. Thank you. Let me try to help you out that. I understand your math and I think it\u2019s reasonable with regard to the project revenue. I think we try to call out that the nature of our business is across the board have natural scale to it and the incremental margins are extremely high, its how much investment we put in. We continue to have a consistent level there.","Verisk Health, I think was one of the nice positives inside the quarter. We would expect that to continue, obviously as revenue typically is a little lighter in second quarter relative to the other quarters that may work against us in the quarter, but Verisk Health is the biggest contributor to that, that good news. And I think we would as Scott suggested I think we would expect that to continue.","Alex Kramm","Okay. Helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just on the imagery side. I think you talked post-EVP that\u2019s an area that you still want to get better, there\u2019s some investments. So, A, is that meaningfully depressing margins right now. Are you still doing a lot of investments there and any update on where you at in terms of competing with that business and getting bigger piece of the pie?","Scott Stephenson","So, my earlier reference to some exciting developments in 2015, this category will definitely be one of them. The way that you need to understand this category is that they\u2019re really actually two things you have to do in order to be able to create commercial solutions for a customer. One is you have to have methods by which you can in a highly automated way take an image and turn it into data.","And the second thing is you need images which are sufficient to what it is that you\u2019re trying to do. Our methods are world class and you heard our or you saw our announcement about AMS Geomatics that\u2019s all part of that. And we really have a team and a set of capabilities we put up against anybody. What we haven\u2019t working on is how we are going to infuse those methods with a very comprehensive set of images.","And we are laying some extremely exciting plans in place right now not able to talk about them just yet, but we will come back on those, not really influencing margins very much at the movement and we actually think the approach that were coming up with here it probably will \u2013 there will be maybe a minor effect but we\u2019re going to manage this is a way that we believe there\u2019s a good chance, but as revenues mounts they\u2019ll be matching and exceeding ultimately the expenses, but that will be a little bit of build through time. But they were very, very focused on those categories.","Andrew Steinerman","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Andre Benjamin","Thank you. Good morning.","Scott Stephenson","Good morning.","Andre Benjamin","Question on the healthcare business, I was wondering if you can maybe give a little color on the drivers of the growth particular how much is from new clients versus your existing clients just running more volume through the business and\/or how much of it is from those same clients maybe buying more products from within the suites you offer?","Scott Stephenson","You always going to find those three things in the mix, Andre and I would say that something that is always very important to us and something that is always very encouraging to us is when we find existing customers moving into new parts of our suites. And we definitely all of those are represented in the mix including first quarter 2015.","Andre Benjamin","And I guess in conversation with the same customer I was wondering are there any notable thoughts or feedback that you\u2019ve gotten with respect to how they\u2019re thinking about the changes in Medicare reimbursement rules and the management of your products?","Mark Anquillare","Well you know that\u2019s always going to be a part of their thinking and they and we both pay close attention to what CMS is doing. I would say that I think what is really leading the thought process for our customers in this category it\u2019s probably less what\u2019s going on in the regulatory environment and it\u2019s more about their own thoughts on how to maximize their own performance basically. And so, it\u2019s literally then trying to do their good work and manage their businesses to highest level of performance and I think that\u2019s the greater factor in how they are choosing to manage the way that they engage with CMS and therefore that part of our business which is about that, which is over in RQI it\u2019s more their own thoughts about that own businesses that\u2019s really what is the leading factor.","Andre Benjamin","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Anjaneya Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya Singh","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. First off on just the advertising effectiveness project revenue you discussed you know the opportunity around this quite a bit in the past and on this call. I\u2019m wondering as we look forward if the project revenues are is what should be you know expected in these types of solutions or if subscription based engagements might also be possible at this early juncture?","Scott Stephenson","Subscription based engagements are definitely possible and are occurring even at this time. And really what we were trying to indicate with our comments was simply that it may well be the case that from time to time as the category emerges there will be individual larger players who get interested and there is sort of at a moment in time there is a high degree of engagement as they assess the methods and figure out exactly you know what they can do and what they will mean for them, which we hope and expect will sort of mature into ongoing subscription like relationships.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And a question for Mark, you talked about the risk assessment talent realignment savings being invested back into the business and I appreciate the comments on the 30 or 40 positions you need to sell. Wondering if you can discuss what your expected timeline is to fully work through those hiring plans just trying to get a sense of when RA margins may work back down to a more normalized level?","Mark Anquillare","Sure, I mean I\u2019ll give you my best timeline. I mean, our goal continue to be find the right people because we want to move and kind of create some exciting opportunities in markets, the new product ideas. But if you think about Verisk as a whole, it\u2019s about people and intellectual capital is so important, so we just need to right people. I think we would have hoped to have many of those position filled in the first quarter and if I said second quarter I know things will roll into the third, but I think we are actively kind of fill those positions with the right people and are looking to do so as quickly as possible.","Anjaneya Singh","Appreciated. Thanks you.","Operator","There are no further questions. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Scott Stephenson","Well, thank you. And we appreciate everybody being with us this quarter. Appreciate your support and your interest and we look forward to talking with you at the conclusion of the second quarter. Enjoy your day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

This call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's CFO, Mr. Lee Shavel. Mr. Shavel, please go ahead.","Lee Shavel","Thank you, Kyle. And good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2018 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and myself highlighting some key points about our financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. ","Before we do that, I\u2019d like to take the opportunity to introduce our new Head of Investor Relations, Stacey Brodbar. I am personally delighted as you all can imagine to have Stacey join us. Although as I reflected on it last night, you all maybe even more excited than I am to have Stacey with us.","She comes to us with 20-years of broad experience from the buy-side, sell-side and investment banking. Most recently she spent 11 years at AllianceBernstein, where she served as a Senior Vice President and Senior Equity Analyst covering the consumer discretionary sector.","Prior to that, she spent 7 years as a sell-side equity analyst at Credit Suisse analyzing the restaurant selector. She holds an MBA from Columbia Business School; and a Bachelor of Arts in History from Duke University. I know that she is looking forward to engaging with all of you in this new role and we will appreciate the same patience that you\u2019ve shown to me as Stacey comes up the learning curve with the businesses at Verisk. Fortunately she comes into the job with the benefit and knowledge of having been an investor in the company previously.","The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. And we have also posted our Investor Presentation for the second quarter on our website at verisk.com. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott Stephenson.","Thanks Lee. Good morning, everybody.","I'm pleased overall with the second quarter results we are reporting today and with the progress occurring across our business. I recently had two weeks in Europe with some of our largest customers and our leadership teams and come away encouraged about our situation and forward opportunities.","Let me summarize some of what I saw and heard. On the insurance front, we are a different company in the London and U.K. markets than we were just one year ago. Across many meetings it became clear that our customers see and understand the logic of the new solutions we have brought to market through a combination of organic developments and acquisition.","On several occasions I heard customers comment on the unique position we've achieved in the U.K. along with their anticipation of newly integrated offerings from Verisk. I hear customers referring to Verisk as a partner more frequently than in the past. They are asking for deeper dives into our solution sets and pipeline of new developments. Virtually every conversation with customers was forward-looking in nature which is a good sign for our future.","I also met with the senior leadership of some of Europe's largest energy businesses. I heard continuing affirmation of the must-have quality of the data and analytics we provide. Equally encouraging were discussions around the need to transform commercial decision-making in the oil and gas industry through the application of modern data analytic methods. This point is deeply felt by the energy companies who are awash in technical data but have yet to realize the promise of optimized commercial decision-making.","A goal of our energy business customers is planning cycles measured in weeks rather than years which can only be achieved with the level of cost and productivity benchmarking which is previously been unseen. Our customers in Europe and indeed everywhere see us as a natural partner in helping them achieve this transformation.","I spent an enjoyable afternoon in the offices of one of Argus's leading U.K. customers. It was great to spend time not only with our customers, but also our several person team who set in the customer's offices representing a wonderful level of intimacy","After reviewing the considerable value attached to our current solutions, the conversation with our executive sponsor then moved to future opportunities to harness machine learning to amplify their analytics. Again, the conversation was primarily about the future and how our two companies can partner.","A consistent message across customer meetings is that some of the most important work being done by our customers is harnessing data analytics to improve their business results and I see Verisk as a unique partner in doing so.","With that, let me hand it over to Mark for some comments on the insurance vertical.","Mark Anquillare","Thank you, Scott.","In our insurance business we had another strong quarter in all insurance facing businesses. Underwriting and rating, as well as claims contributing to growth. Let me highlight a few areas that drove topline growth and update you on several initiatives that better position us for the future.","To remind everyone of our new reporting segments, underwriting and rating consists of one, our ISO business unit which provides industry-standard insurance programs, property specific underwriting and rating information, and our personal lines underwriting solutions. Two, our AIR business unit which provides extreme event models; and three Sequel, our business unit which provide insurance software solutions.","During the quarter underwriting and rating delivered strong organic growth across personal lines underwriting, extreme event modeling, and industry standard insurance programs through a combination of cross-sell of existing solutions to new customers and the sale of new innovative solutions. Our legacy ISO business continues to maintain high customer retention rates while increasing its prominence as a thought leader in the property-casualty industry.","We have a series of new programs in product extension's fueling growth including cyber warning, our new program to address the growing cyber threat which represents a significant avenue of growth for insurers.","Two, [indiscernible] insurance where we launched both personal and commercial lines coverage to satisfy the underinsured and uninsured problem in the U.S. as evidenced during Hurricane, Harvey with two-thirds of flood losses occurred outside of FEMA's 100 year flood claims. These ISO programs put all areas in the contiguous United States regardless of the FEMA flood zone.","Three, LightSpeed our suite of underwriting data and analytics focused on personalized risks primarily personal auto and homeowners' risk. And for risk analyzer, our deeply analytic in highly segmented suite of tools providing fine pricing detail on specific risks. We continue to extend our risk analyzer suite and recently introduced a physical damage module for commercial auto.","In June we held our Verisk London Risk Symposium, an event highlighting our InsurTech capabilities across underwriting and rating and claims with a focus on key insurance and global risk issues. The number of follow-up opportunities was impressive as U.K. insurers and Lloyd syndicates are beginning be to fully understand the scope and power of Verisk offerings.","After a week together in London, our leadership team was energized by the meetings with customers developing strategy across our European businesses and prioritizing opportunities brought by these collaborative efforts.","Our claims businesses include one, claims analytics our fraud prevention solutions featuring ClaimSearch. Xactware, our suite of solutions focused on loss quantification and repair cost estimating; and three, Geomni, our cutting-edge remote imagery business. Claims experienced an exceptional quarter, with organic growth across all business units through a combination of cross-sell and sale of new solutions.","During the quarter, we acquired Validus, a leading provider of claims management solutions and developer of the leading subrogation portal in the U.K. Subrogation occurs when an insurer pays an insured roll-off caused by a third-party. Insurance companies then subrogate or steps into the shoes of the insurer to interact with the third party to recoup the loss suffered by the insured.","With the addition of a well-established subrogation platform to its existing claim solutions set Verisk is uniquely positioned to support U.K. insurance market at every stage in the life of the claim.","As I highlighted during our prior earnings call, we are focused on helping our customers automate the claims process to drive towards right touch claims handling. We are less complex and smaller dollar claims are handled with limited manual intervention. The subrogation process and coordination of benefits for bodily injury claims are areas where we can vastly improve the claims process, and create efficiencies for our customers.","Geomni, our business that harnesses remote sensing and machine learning technologies to provide information about residential and commercial structures, has advanced its massive library of high-resolution imagery and data for substantially all properties in the United States. The aerial imagery and property data including measurements of dimensions for commercial and residential property are seamlessly integrated through Verisk platforms for claims, underwriting and catastrophe modeling.","The image library, advanced analytics and tight integration with our repair cost estimating tools have resulted in exceptional efficiencies for insurers and strong growth added Geomni, as well as Xactware. Across all businesses from both a customer and financial perspective, we are very pleased with the performance of the insurance businesses.","With that, let me turn it over to Lee to cover our financial results.","Lee Shavel","Thanks Mark.","First, I\u2019d like to bring everyone's attention to the fact that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. The presentation provides background data and trends and analysis to support our conversation today.","Moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis revenue grew 14.9% to $601 million, net income increased 26.9% to $154 million for the quarter, diluted GAAP EPS was $0.91 for the second quarter 2018, an increase of 26.4% compared with the same period in 2017.","Having presented our summary GAAP results, I will now shift to focus on our organic constant currency results for all year-over-year growth rates consistent with our financial targets and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations and recent acquisitions for which we don't have a full year-over-year comparison.","Acquired revenue and adjusted EBITDA on the quarter from all deals that haven't moved into organic results were $36 million and $9 million respectively. Please note that nonrecurring acquisition related transaction expenses are included in these EBITDA amounts.","Verisk demonstrated very solid growth performance and momentum in the second quarter. Revenue growth of 7.4% was ahead of our 7% long-term target and it was our fourth consecutive quarter at or above that target. Adjusted EBITDA expense grew 5.9% enabling EBITDA growth up 8.9% and demonstrating the benefit of our operating leverage.","The EBITDA growth differential to revenue growth of 1.5% is also ahead of our long-term target of a minimum 1% differential. These results also produced an improved adjusted EBITDA margin of 49.6% up from 48.9% in the prior year reflecting the benefits of our skill and inclusive of continued investment across the business.","Let's now turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you will see in table 2 in the press release, insurance had a strong quarter with 8.4% revenue growth with underwriting and rating contributing 6.2% and claims contributing 13.2% growth. Adjusted EBITDA for insurance grew 10.5% reflecting in increased adjusted EBITDA margin of 56.6% up from 55.5% in the prior year.","Within our underwriting and rating business, we saw solid performance across our product lines. We also continued to invest in our breakout opportunities including telematics, LightSpeed data hosting, energy and global property with exceptional growth despite the relatively small-scale at this point.","Within claims the continued strong growth was a function of strong product growth in most of our claims businesses, offset by a slight decline in our employment screening business. In addition, Geomni continues to generate strong growth as they expand and improve data quality for clients.","Energy and specialized markets delivered improved revenue growth of 5.0% for the quarter up from 3.1% in the prior quarter as the energy industry continues to recover as many of you may have noticed with the recent reported results from the energy companies. Adjusted EBITDA increased 0.9%, also an improvement from a 5.9% decline in the prior quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.1% was down slightly from the prior year period 31.3% due to ongoing investments in the WoodMac 2.0 initiative and our chemicals subsurface, power and renewables and analytics breakout initiatives that increased headcount and associated compensation expense. These areas represent opportunities to leverage Wood Mackenzie's data and industry expertise more broadly and to deliver and develop products more swiftly and efficiently.","Overall growth was supported by research growth at Wood Mackenzie and strong growth in consulting with our 3E revenues. This improvement was achieved despite the ongoing 2018 revenue headwind from a global investment banking client that has substantially reduced their presence in the industry. The energy and specialized markets segment continues to enjoy core operating leverage and growth opportunities as demand for data analytics in its constituent markets continues to expand and has been demonstrated in the growth of our breakout revenues in the early new contract wins at PowerAdvocate.","Financial services also delivered improved revenue growth of 4.4% in the quarter up from 1.5% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 4.5% down from 5.1% in the prior quarter and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.1% unchanged from the prior year. These results are below our long-term expectations of the business but we believe the growth potential of the segment remains strong.","The organic revenue growth was supported by growth in portfolio management solutions which include our foundational benchmarking analytics and strong growth in enterprise data management solutions where we are leveraging our data management skills and expertise to support our clients.","Looking ahead to next quarter's financial services revenue results, we want to take the opportunity to remind everyone that consistent with our typical partnership revenue model, we expect to have a high level of nonrecurring license and implementation revenue in the early stage of our partnerships followed by the development of recurring subscription revenues over time.","In this regard, the third quarter of 2018 will represent the one-year anniversary of the formation of our thesis partnership which generated significant initial revenues in the third quarter of 2017 of 6 million with lesser amounts in the subsequent two quarters.","Consequently, our growth rates next quarter will reflect the burden of those nonrecurring revenues in the prior year. As we've discussed previously, the launch of our products through the partnerships had been delayed due to data integration challenges but we expect to commence marketing with clients this quarter with the development of the ongoing subscription revenue opportunity to follow.","Consolidated depreciation and amortization was $74 million in the quarter up 32.1% from the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of acquisitions and increased capital expenditures in both periods. Reported interest income was $32 million in the quarter up 12.1% from the prior year quarter due to the funding of acquisitions in 2017.","Total reported debt was $2.8 billion at June 30, 2018 down from $3.0 billion at December 31, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the second quarter was 2.4 times on the basis of our credit facility calculation.","Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were about $135.8 million at June 30, 2018. Our reported effective tax rate was 17% for the quarter compared to 28.8% in the prior year quarter as a result of recent tax reform. Our effective tax rate was lower than our targeted range due to significant exercises of outstanding employee stock options that produced a favorable tax rate impact.","We are maintaining our estimate of our effective tax rate in 2018 to be between 16% and 18%. However the timing and impact of employee stock option exercises depends in part on the Verisk stock price and personal decisions. We expect that this impact will be more pronounced in 2018 and that we will revert to a higher effective tax rate in 2019.","Adjusted net income was $179 million up 29.1% from $139 million in the prior-year quarter. Diluted adjusted EPS was $1.06 for the second quarter also up 29.3% from $0.82 in the prior year quarter. The increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and the impact of 2017 tax reform.","Equalizing the second-quarter of 2017 effective tax rate to that of second-quarter of 2018 both adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS were up 11.6%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $207 million for the quarter up 85% from the prior year, capital expenditures were $56 million for the quarter up 36% from the prior year reflecting primarily increased investment in Geomni and software development for recent acquisitions.","As we've discussed previously, 2018 will be the peak year of capital expenditure for Geomni. Free cash flow was $151 million for the quarter, an increase of 114.3% from the prior year. We returned $141 million in capital to shareholders through the repurchase of 1.3 million shares in the quarter at a weighted average price of $105.78.","At June 30, 2018 we had $686 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization including a $500 million authorization approved in May 2018. In addition, we initiated a 50 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the third quarter to accelerate the impact of share repurchases and execute repurchases at a discount of WACC over the period. We have the ability to repurchase additional shares during the quarter so the 50 million ASR should not be viewed as our total repurchases for the quarter.","The average diluted share count was 169 million shares in the quarter and on June 30, 2018 our diluted share count was 168 million shares. Overall the results for the quarter represented one organic constant currency revenue growth of 7.4% and EBITDA growth of 8.9%, both ahead of our targets. Two, improved organic constant currency margins. Three, continued investment in attractive internal opportunities, and four substantial return of capital to shareholders.","Insurance performance remains consistently strong in both underwriting and rating and claims. Our energy and financial services continue to make progress towards their growth objectives.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we want everyone to be mindful of the $8 million in storm-related revenue and $6 million in initial nonrecurring revenue from the thesis partnership in the third quarter of 2017 that will affect the third quarter 2018 year-over-year reported growth rates but don't represent a change in our underlying long-term growth expectations.","We also don't know what the 2018 storm season will hold for us. We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and remain focused on long-term profitable growth and solid returns on capital. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long-term.","We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk given the large number of analysts we have covering us. We ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up.","With that, I\u2019ll ask the Operator Kyle to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari","You touched on what some of your European clients are saying on the insurance offering. Maybe if you could touch on, do you still think you can double the insurance business internationally in five years I think you had highlighted that. And maybe some of the challenges and sort of headwinds to that goal. Just maybe update us how much bigger can that international business be and why you feel confident?","Scott Stephenson","When we think about the international opportunity as it relates to the insurance vertical, first of all it's not just about the London and U.K. markets. We\u2019re actually pushing out in a number of European and Asian markets. I was highlighting London and U.K. partly because that's where I just was with the customers, but also partly because that is the largest part of our non-North American footprint today.","I don't really see a lot of headwinds, I can tell you what the work consists of. The work consists of taking the methods that we\u2019ve developed in the United States tailoring - tuning them - not tailoring them, tuning them to the local markets. And then infusing them with a lot of good local data, we know how to do that that is in fact what we\u2019re presenting in these overseas markets today.","So it's organic, it feels very natural and what we need and what we have our great people on the ground in these markets that understand the local customers and local conditions and can just cause our solutions to be there most relevant and make clear the customers the value that they represent.","But it's not - it\u2019s mostly white space for us, I mean Verisk as you know it's about order of magnitude 25% non-U.S. today and it's a big world out there. So this is a long sustained march for us but I don't think of it in terms of headwinds. I think of it in terms of great people on the ground locally taking what we\u2019re already good at and making it relevant.","Hamzah Mazari","And just a follow-up I'll turn it over maybe for Lee. Lee I know you spend a lot of time on capital allocation and in terms of your analyst days investor outreach maybe just frame for us how you're thinking about that going forward, have you guys thought about a dividend. Are they going to be more acquisitions, are you going to add a third leg to the portfolio just broadly speaking I know the history has been a little different where you had a healthcare business than we bought energy now you're sort of focusing in on the core. Maybe just give us some feedback after your outreach program and how you're thinking about broadly capital allocation going forward?","Lee Shavel","So the way - what I would emphasize is at this stage what we\u2019re focusing on is starting with understanding capital generation where we\u2019re generating it, how we\u2019re generating it obviously optimizing that. And then looking at the returns on capital within each of the businesses and most importantly on an incremental basis how we\u2019re investing the capital that we have effectively to improve those returns and to support the growth initiatives across the business.","And that's where it's a combination of looking not just at acquisitions, but looking at our internal investment through CapEx, through investments in our breakout initiatives. And really just enhancing that as a discipline across the organization as a whole with the objective of trying to identify as many attractive opportunities to invest capital. And I really think at the core that's what's most exciting about Verisk. The opportunities that we have across the business and to put capital into growth businesses in the analytics and the data management sector.","Once we are doing that effectively I think the next step is thinking about how we manage capital and at this stage we think about all of our opportunities to return capital. We as you saw in the second quarter, we\u2019re very focused on repurchasing shares, and so you see a focus there that is determined on a quarterly basis based upon where we see opportunities, but longer term we are certainly going to evaluate all opportunities. But we\u2019re really at the preliminary stage of just thinking about how are we generating capital and how are we deploying it within the business.","The final thing that I will say I think that you have heard Scott and Mark in several cases talk about what we see on as the opportunities and the strength of our three verticals, insurance, energy and specialized markets and financial services. While we are always evaluating M&A opportunities that can create growth, we are very comfortable with the opportunities that exist within those three verticals. There is not an expectation at this point that there's any additional vertical that we\u2019re pursuing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm","Just I think Lee you ended your prepared remarks on kind of like reminding us of the second half outlook and the strong storms. I guess stepping back a little bit I think you highlighted that that's for quarter\u2019s growth with over 7%, but really if you back out the claims which has been really strong I think was more like 5ish or so.","So more holistically I mean claims growth is great but I think there is a question about sustainability, how do you feel this can continue to grow in the kind of like teens and how could that weigh on your growth rate going forward. I'm not just thinking the next couple quarters but more, holistically longer term?","Mark Anquillare","This is Mark I\u2019ll maybe try to address it. Clearly the claims area benefits from the severe storm activities occurred back in last year third or fourth quarter. I think what we\u2019ve seen is as a result of some of that storm activity. We\u2019ve had a little bit of a continuation of services to be continued and provided to some contractors. And we\u2019ve also seen insurers the most part by more.","So I don't attribute first quarter, second quarter results to storm activity. I see the underlying business is continuing to be strong. I see the investment that we\u2019ve made over the last several years in new products and new services and the extension into - all the parts of the insurance value chain to be working.","And I just wanted to highlight that I think we have a lot of good things going in claims and personally I wouldn\u2019t back it out in the way you just did. So I hope that provides at least a little context and maybe a little comfort on kind of the underlying solvency and strength of the business.","Alex Kramm","And then Lee just, secondly maybe on the cost side and I know to talk a lot about the margin and obviously organic versus non-organic, but stepping back I think you've been there for - I think almost nine months or so. Are you spending a lot of time on the how the cost base of Verisk looks holistically, I mean and I guess I'm asking because at your prior shop - the company was very well known for being very good on margin, very tight, very cost conscious. Have you looked at how may be processes at Verisk on if they are improvements just generally speaking not just from integration of acquisitions?","Lee Shavel","Yes, thank you, Alex. And so first off I feel obligated to say that I think Verisk starts with a very good discipline around cost management and you wouldn't see, I think the margins of this strength without that discipline throughout the organization. And so that isn\u2019t to say that there aren\u2019t always opportunities to improve and as I learned from my prior shop, cost management is a beast that you have to fight every day.","And in that regard, I have been spending time focusing on the cost structure one area in particular that has gotten a lot of focus and that we've been proceeding against has been against the broader migration mainframe to cloud migration which I think represents opportunities for us from a cost and from a capital standpoint.","And so that's one dimension of it, but interesting you raised it on the call we actually have also been evaluating a shift in our procurement strategy in which heretofore has been a very process oriented procurement strategy. And we are going to be shifting with some changes in leadership to a focus on the cost structure elements. And where we can attack data costs other technology costs and find other efficiencies across the business in order to improve the overall cost structure.","So it is something that has received focus there a number of initiatives that are underway, I'm focusing on that on that opportunity and we hope with a reorientation of our procurement and strategic sourcing function to make further headway against that.","Alex Kramm","Very good thank you, I\u2019m sorry\u2026","Scott Stephenson","It\u2019s Scott here, I'll just add that - kind of sort of the deep deepdrum beat where the cost side of our business is concerned, really hinges on a couple things. One is, as Lee was saying the nature of the computing infrastructure inside of our company is going to change. And we think productively. It only cost you about $40,000 to source a rock headed by our storage capacity in the cloud today. Only $40,000, tell me this is remarkable. And so as we move from on prem to not on prem, I think we are going to naturally see productivity there.","Another opportunity for us that it is at work now and I think we will make somewhat more use of it in the future will be to diversify where our talent comes from. There are talented people all around the globe and at the moment at least there are asymmetries in terms of what highly confident professional gets paid, we made less use of that than we might have.","And then two other things real quick, one is just sort of the strong and consistent drive towards effective operations, which we summarize thinking about Lean Six Sigma kinds of methodologies, which is really a quiet revolution that's going on inside of our company.","And the last thing is, the ability to change the very nature of knowledge work by harnessing machine learning. Today, most of that has been applied to making our solutions for our customers better, but the longer tails to the machine learning AI revolution is to actually change the way cognitive works gets done, and we have a lot of knowledge workers around here and I believe that we can really make them more productive by harnessing the machine more.","So bunch of things that underlie - these are all productive and they are not just quarter-to-quarter this is year-to-year. Some of them are probably decade-to-decade kinds of developments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik","My first question is on Argus. So, the $6 million one-time benefit in last year's third quarter, I guess is new disclosure for us so maybe me at least. And so it implies that the third quarter probably is not going to have a good number and so what I'm trying to understand is seven quarters of - we are under performing what we used to see from Argus, maybe I don't quite understand what's really going on there, like, what the issues are and I guess, even the margins took ahead of this quarter. So I just hoping you could may be just flush out again like what's going wrong there.","Scott Stephenson","Well, first of all, I don't at all think that things are going wrong at Argus. It\u2019s a great business, which is founded on proprietary content just like most of what we do at Verisk. So it's actually a great business and if you were to ask me which of our three verticals over the next five years is going to turn in the highest rate of growth, I think there is a very good case to be made that it could be Verisk financial services.","I actually find it hard to handicap the three of them. I think they are all going to do well. So, it's a great business of which we and I are very proud and provides wonderful levels of value to our customers so all of that.","Thinking about the last couple of years, as we have discussed in the past 2017, there were a couple of major relationships that cycled out. One part of that was the Federal Government consolidated its use of what it is that we provide and the other was a very large plan in the financial services were it had essentially been bulked buying some of what we do on behalf lot of the banks and they stepped out of their relationship and so underneath that we have been filling in with relationships with the banks individually, but that was a one-time effect over and done.","In 2018, you have to look across the difference segments of the business and one of things that is at work right now is and we did call this out last quarter also is the on the median effectiveness side, I'm going to summarize a lot here in just a few words, but basically the regulatory burden on banks includes really, really requiring a tremendous amount of disclosure around methodologies, which allow the discrimination of risk on an individual customer basis.","The size of the report you have to write to justify methods that you're using is really kind of astonishing. The banks want to do this differentiating and they find our method as valuable as it ever was, but consuming our methods in the form that we have traditionally provided them has just become backbreaking from a regulatory point of view.","So, we're in the middle of rotating right now, the way we present that underlying intellectual property to our customers. And so it's a moment where that shift is occurring.","And then lastly, as Lee pointed out again, in 2018, not only did he note the grow over point with respect to the implementation that we've talked about, the couple of quarter delay in terms of actually getting it productive.","Normally -- well, I mean -- and this a truth of the business. When we establish a new relationship, there's a big surge of activity for data integration purposes, and then there's very nice annuity stream kicks in thereafter. The annuity stream is kicking in a couple quarters later than we expected because of the integration issues.","So, that's what's going on inside the business. But our outlook on this business is over intermediate and longer periods of time, is completely unchanged.","Lee Shavel","And Manav, just to add, I think -- as Scott was describing, certainly it's an understandable question. And we understand the frustration from a growth standpoint. I do think it is important kind of starting at that level to step back and look at what the elements are that are driving it.","It has been a chunky and a noisy business. We have been in the process of focusing on how from a revenue structuring standpoint we can make this more sustainable growth business. I think part of the story is that early on several years ago, there were a number of large opportunities that naturally we were compelled to pursue. And that's created some of the large component noise.","Where we are now, is looking at each of these businesses across the portfolio management solutions, enterprise data management solutions, and the spend in marketing solutions, and focusing on how we deliver sustainable growth across those.","And when you eliminate the one time elements, and in this case, we certainly don't feel, we want to apologize about the upfront revenues. But I think it's important to understand that those are licensing and implementation revenues with the value of the subscriptions accruing over time that that's the underlying dynamic that I think we see as both underlying growth and ongoing potential, given the extraordinary dataset and the relationships that we have with our clients, and the opportunity to use that data to just broaden their applications.","I know all of that is looking ahead, but we believe that that opportunity remains undiminished despite the noise that we've experienced here over the past couple of years.","Manav Patnaik","My second question, Scott, maybe just to step back on the investments you're making in the WoodMac 2.0 platform. I recall, like, the year after you made the acquisition, at one of the investor days you talked about how there's already been investments made in a lot of new products, platforms rolled out. So, my question was more like, is this 2.0 initiative sort of driven by customer feedback or is this some sort of new gen you feel like it will help down in the future. Just wanted to get some more perspective there?","Scott Stephenson","Yes, it's both. And let me give you one other contextual point also, which is, the -- of the three verticals we serve. And I'm talking about customers now, I'm not talking about us. Of the three verticals we serve, the energy vertical is the one that is least transformed yet by large scale data analytics for commercial decision making.","The companies are awash in technical data. So it's not that they don't know big data, but they haven't harnessed it the way that insurance companies and banks have, to drive their commercial decision making. And we knew that at the time that we -- in fact that's one of the reasons why we were so excited to get into business with WoodMac.","And then of course the double tsunami hit in terms of the commodity price and to brag that with hard on a U.K. based Pound denominated sort of a company. So in the middle of these storms, we basically turn the sales and pull the boat into port. Now, the sky is clear, we're back out on the seas for sale.","So, I just want -- if folks haven't followed our story over longer periods of time, I just wanted to make that point. Because there's a degree to which WoodMac 2.0 was what we intended from the beginning. And it's -- we just know that it's productive to have a very nicely digitally based platform for all of your data, because you can build the next generation and then the next generation after that of products if your platform done that way. And I think that the WoodMac that came in the Verisk in 2015, reflected their customers basically.","In other words, sort of the volume and the speed of the data sets on the commercial side, were just not, it just was not the way that environment had been behaving. It's not that WoodMac was behind. I think they were reflective of the environment they were in.","But then the other part of it is, yes, it is responsive to customers because their worlds have changed. Essentially what's going on in the oil and gas energy space is that, you used to have these years under unto decades planning cycles, where you would have these bespoke offshore multi $100s of millions of developments and essentially every project kind of was on to its own. And so you planned in that context.","What's happened is that half of all the incremental supply has been added in North America. And in North America, the business behaves very differently. You can be drilling a well in location \"X\" and you could say, I want to move that, 1500 yards over there, and three days later you can have a 1500 foot well. And so planning cycles have reduced to weeks, and days, and that's actually exciting.","The other thing that has happened is, it's not so bespoke, there are lot of people in the Permian, there are lot of people in the back and your position is next-door to somebody else's position. And so the intensity of desire to sort of benchmark and use that to tune up operations and planning is much greater than it was.","So, in other words, to be effective you have to be bigger data, faster. And that's the conversion that's going on right now. So you can also pick up with WoodMac 2.0 as being not only the tuning up of our own environment, but it's actually creating this capability to serve the customers on these faster cycles with a greater amount of benchmarking against like activities. I mean that's fundamentally what's going on, and that is customer driven.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh. Your line is open.","Tim McHugh","Could I just follow up on the insurance growth rate, was there any contribution done in this quarter that you would attribute to the storm activity? And can you help us understand at all the contribution from aerial imagery at this point to the gross rate? Thanks.","Scott Stephenson","Question one was really around severe storm and impact in this quarter. There was no explicit benefit. I mean, I think what we've seen is contractors who purchased the solutions back during the storm seasons, some have extended that license, that has been good. It seems like that will continue. But there is nothing with around storms.","Let me now jump over to Geomni. Similarly, storm activity helped us during third quarter with the storms last year. I think what you're seeing now inside Geomni, is a very strong bit of growth driven by really customer adoption, where we're taking share. We had a very tightly integrated solution that for the most part brings in the imagery, turns it to data, and with that data we're populating the repair cost estimates.","At the very heart of what we're trying to do is, we're trying to increase dramatically the productivity of those claims adjustors at our customers. And by doing it in an automated way, whether that's from afar or having most of the information prepared into bands of visiting location, it creates tremendous opportunity and efficiency in that process.","We are more accurate, and I think we have really started to change the way those insurance companies are kind of automating their processes. And the Geomni organically is helping the overall growth rate of insurance, that is very true.","Tim McHugh","Can you help us effect that the growth of the research business versus the consulting side of Wood Mackenzie? And my impression with consulting was leading the growth rate versus the research side?","Scott Stephenson","Yes, Tim, that's absolutely true. The consulting side is the portion that responds the most immediately to the increasing investment levels on the energy side. And so I would describe the growth areas as strong growth. On the subscription side, that growth, there has been growth there. I would say it's more modest growth but clearly the consulting side, which represents about 20% of the revenues has been benefiting earlier from that upside. But we are seeing a steady improvement in our overall research subscription levels as the cycle continues to improve for the energy sector.","Operator","Your next comes from the line of Arash Soleimani. Your line is open.","Arash Soleimani","Quick question on Geomni, the $200 million total adjustable market there within insurance, is that on the claims side only or does that include both claims and underwriting?","A \u2013 Lee Shavel","So, as it relates to insurance, we have -- we've talked about both the claims business and the underwriting business. We were very specific in these cases when we provided that estimate. That is in the context of, what we refer to as, property characteristics on the underwriting side, helping to better understand the physical attributes of the buildings and the residential homes, and on the claims side as we described. So, it is a combination of the two with a kind of known use case for insurance.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks, and aside from Geomni, can you talk about increasing automation within the insurance industry and to what extent that presents an opportunity for Verisk?","A \u2013 Scott Stephenson","Sure, let me do that. I think we are\u2026","A \u2013 Lee Shavel","That's going to take about an hour and half.","A \u2013 Scott Stephenson","I will be quick. I think everyone in the insurance industry both on the claims side as well as the underwriting side, understand two things. One, they need to automate to get a lot of out -- to rid themselves of operational friction. The way they're doing that is to make an investment in technology and they're changing the way they go about processing.","What that also helps to address, to say, graying of the talent population inside the insurance industry, where there are most experienced claims handlers, need to be on the more difficult claims or the very difficult underwriting risk. That's where the experience needs to be.","So, they're trying to create expert systems to handle about 80%, this is a little bit -- our estimate 80% of claims in a no touch low-touch way. So that everything else flows on the underwriting side, 80% of those claims even on commercial, like personal, to be handled at point-of-sale with all the information so you can properly understand, assess, and price the risk.","And that transition whether its back office, policy men, claim systems, or in the world of data analytics, everyone is pushing in that direction with one overarching theme, digital engagement. They're trying to make sure they don't lose customers and they can stay close.","So, hopefully I was efficient and quick. But InsurTech, and all that that we're doing really is kind of making people expand and change the way they're doing business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. This is [Jude] on for Andrew. I just wanted to circle back on Argus. You guys gave some helpful color on some of the holdbacks to growth last year, and what's been going on this year. I wanted to ask about, outside of TSYS, you had mentioned eight large multiyear contracts at Investor Day, you had mentioned bookings that were as $30 million higher, at Jan 1, 2018 versus the year prior.","So, I was wondering how the rest of those contracts were going if you are seeing any sort of implementation delays with those or is that something that we could see coming on the horizon? Thank you.","A \u2013 Lee Shavel","Jude, thanks for the question. The last time we [indiscernible] our sense is that slightly over half of that contract had been worked into our revenue, with the balance expected over the remainder of the year. So I'll give an update on that, but that was kind of where we were previously. I suspect we've made some progress and so more of that has come in.","But probably the majority has been realized, kind of year-to-date, and there will probably be some carryover in the second half, but probably not a material impact on revenue growth.","Unidentified Analyst","One quick follow up on Argus. Scott, had mentioned the heavy filing burden that is weighing on some of your bank customers. Maybe I missed this point, but is any of this specifically related to GDPR, and similar types of regulations? One of your peers mentioned those regulations, those events as weighing, as being a headwind to some of their growth, that's similar to your marketing effectiveness. So, I was wondering if that's at play here?","A \u2013 Lee Shavel","No. This is specific to banking regulation in the United States, particularly. So, no. It's not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Bill Warmington","First question on WoodMac, the last quarter you guys had talked about a couple of gem cancellations. How the renewals been trending in general this quarter? And specifically how the trends been on a like-for-like pricing basis?","A \u2013 Scott Stephenson","Bill, I got to correct your facts there. So, last quarter we didn't talk about gem cancellation. We talked about two things going on in the business, when customers consolidate, that can have an effect on the combined entity revenues for us. And we did note that there was one of those.","And then the other, and Lee talked about in his remarks, was, one investment bank is just sort of rethought their position with respect to the energy vertical, and it's not that gem has gone away, it's just that they scale back their relationship with us. So, I just want to make sure I fact base is established.","A \u2013 Scott Stephenson","Carl, do you want to move to the -- I think we may have lost Bill. Can we move to the next question?","Operator","All right, I'll move to the line of Jeff Meuler. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Jeff Meuler","I guess I had a different take on insurance on that prior question. But it seems to me that the underlying insurance growth next to hurricane benefits is faster than it was a couple of years ago. How much of this is moving beyond the headwinds from the end market consolidation versus what other factors are at play? Like, is there generally an improved selling environment in the vertical? It sounds broad based in terms of product, but are there any specific big product needle movers or any cohorts from that perspective? Thank you.","A \u2013 Lee Shavel","So, thanks Jeff. Maybe I can start, Mark, please jump in. But -- first of all, I really appreciate the way you asked the question. Because there is no doubt that extreme events is -- the fact that there are extreme events is a productive factor as it relates to the rate of growth of our business, but it is a very long term sort of an effect, underlying our results over very long periods of time.","You can probably add a few 10s of basis points that are there, because there are extreme events. Sometimes they peak, sometimes it's much more modest, though but if you look over long cycles. There is something there but it doesn't really explain what's going on in our business. So, thank you for the way you characterized the question, first of all.","The only thing I would really call out as a point specific thing, actually is the movement in to remote inventory. That's news. And that's been productive for us.","Otherwise I do think of it as broadly based and really it is, it's fundamentally about how innovative can we be. Our customers are trying to revolutionize their businesses with data analytics. And so it's really on us to be relevant and fast. And that's what determines the rate at which we grow our insurance capabilities, footprint, customer list, are all stronger than they were a couple of years ago.","So, to your point fundamentally, and I think it's very broadly based. Remote imagery would be the one call out, Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.","A \u2013 Mark Anquillare","I think you highlighted the good products. I think we highlighted a few in here, but internationally I think it's just some kind of headline, some of the growth and I think the way you opened was strong. I mean I think we've always had great positions but with some industry consolidations that does run a bit to our negative and just kind of move beyond that point-of-sale.","Good product development, good growth internationally, limited headwinds, helping us along the way.","Q \u2013 Jeff Meuler","And then Lee, just to follow up on your answer to Judah's question. That wasn't clear. Were you saying the percentage of revenue that's worked its way -- the percentage of bookings that have worked its way in the revenue from the thesis contractor or we\u2019re you saying the other large multiyear contracts and basically signals are all coming in according to plan and this is all just the thesis delay and media effectiveness into banks? Thanks.","Scott Stephenson","With regard to the broader group of contracts that I think was referred to at Investor Day at the time. And so my last sense is that and that kind of separate from the thesis relationship and those opportunities and so far what we have worked into or have realized of that pool. And I don't have a current update because we don't track those as a group individually but our sense was that those were coming in according to plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","You\u2019ve highlighted across the years just the importance of cross-selling as a key growth driver. And in the past I think in insurance you\u2019ve sometimes mentioned the average number of products that your customers have bought. And how that's been trending, but basically I was wondering if there are some metrics may be that you could give us that would be helpful for us to understand just your progress with regard to cross-selling. Any sort of color will be helpful?","Mark Anquillare","So Toni I appreciate you remembering the slide which I\u2019ve used it every year. We actually started to prepare for this day and this Investor Day I think we\u2019ve had similar positive results. I think what we've done as you recall we kind of grouped the number of products we have into about 25 to 30 categories. And our sales team have this - kind of this checkerboard approach where we\u2019re looking to do project - account planning across all the different products.","And we have a little bit of - we call the competitive chalkboard we\u2019re trying to win business every day and we have realigned our sales force in such a way that we have a team that\u2019s focused outside of North America that\u2019s progressing. We have teams that are organized like our customer\u2019s personal lines and commercial lines and being able to sell a suite of solutions to the personal lines or commercial lines has been winning.","And I think it gives them a broader perspective on what customer needs, a broader understanding of products themselves and those are the type of things that we focus on. We focus on customer retention, we focus on revenue from our new products or billings from our new products and a combination of pipeline and closed sales. And we look at it basically monthly with a deep dive every quarter. So that process those metrics continue to be positive.","Toni Kaplan","And Lee I wanted to ask my follow-up on capital allocation again. And so you have 2.5 times gross leverage target, I'd say that's currently in line with the average of peers. Your business is very highly recurring, so one could argue that you could sustain a higher level but on the other hand may be in certain environments, you don\u2019t want to be higher or lower. So what are your thoughts around two times and is that a dynamic target is that the right target just wanted to hear your thoughts on it? Thanks.","Lee Shavel","And Toni very briefly, I think we are managing leverage generally within the 2.5 to three times range. I think that\u2019s what we believe is consistent with our run rate expectations for our ratings category. So I would think about it as kind of being within that, it may be towards the lower end or towards the higher end but that kind of is our target range?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong. Your line is open.","Allison Chou","This is Allison Chou on for George thanks for taking my question. Can you comment on the progression of integrating the various acquisitions you've made and more specifically how we can expect the process of integrating those deals to narrow the gap between organic and reported margins?","Mark Anquillare","Well you\u2019re actually asking two questions there so Lee may be would take on the second one in a momentum which is just the interplay between inorganic than becoming organic. I'm really happy with the integration of the companies that we brought in 2017 which fall into three primary categories. One as we stitched together a set of regional imaging companies into one national capability, very happy with the progress that we've made there.","Secondly, we acquired Sequel over in the London market that has been a textbook integration, and we already presenting the customers the integrated product opportunities that come from that. And then lastly as PowerAdvocate, as we've noted for folks PowerAdvocate has already made sales based upon relatedness to other things we do on the energy side.","And I would actually say that one flows in both directions because PowerAdvocate is I'll use a funny word very invasive where our customers are concerned and it gets right into their systems and draws data out of our customer systems. And is so good at managing large amounts of data that it actually facilitate other opportunities to help energy companies digitally transform. So it's just all green lights with respect to integration. Lee, just inorganic to organic crossover I don\u2019t if you want to comment on that.","Lee Shavel","So I\u2019m going to touch on that. There is really three components we wanted to provide the organic so that the analysts and investors could see that a like-for-like comparison without the influence of an acquisition before you have hit in both periods. But I think as you think about that delta, I think there are three components. One is going to be, we do have upfront costs associated with the deal that are nonrecurring. And so that will impact on those near-term reported margins with the expectation relative to dealers those pass on that will improve the margin.","Secondly, as we integrate the margin of the business into our overall, that may have a positive or negative impact on the blended margins generally at the scale of the acquisitions that\u2019s not going to have a material impact. But the most important component is what - with each of our acquisitions we hope to do by improving the operating leverage of the business, extending the distribution and improving the productivity.","And so that's something that we expect - well the historical margins are going to trend towards that reported margin. What\u2019s not captured is over time our expectation with each of these acquisitions that we will see margin improvement through their natural operating leverage as they grow plus the additional benefits that we can bring either on the cost or on the revenue side. So that's the way I think about the trend of that about organic relative to the reported margin in a given period.","Scott Stephenson","Thank you very much. In the interest of time so I think there were two questions there we\u2019re going to move to the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi. Your line is open.","Mike Reid","This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Was just thinking about the energy business and kind of mid single-digit growth we\u2019re seeing now. Just a good way to look at it going forward or could this potentially improve if CapEx turning improves with better oil prices and without the headwind from the large investment banking client when that rolls off?","Mark Anquillare","Yes, I mean two things one is as I said earlier we've got three verticals and it's hard to handicap which will be the fastest growing in the coming five years. I think energy has a lot of promise, we talked about the fundamental factors that work there. And those of you who have followed us for a while know that a lot of what we do in energy is based on multiyear agreements. And so we've been cycling through those agreements as we pulled out of the commodity down cycle.","And essentially we just think that with time, these effects - the constructive effects will continue to be seen in what we do. So we have a very positive outlook.","Mike Reid","And then I think you noticed previously this year price increases may be minimized, but would you still be looking to take advantage of pricing opportunities next year?","Mark Anquillare","Are you on the energy vertical.","Mike Reid","No, no I was talking insurance.","Mark Anquillare","Price is always a factor inside of what we do. Our products don't come back year-over-year the same and the customers know that. So there is naturally price progression in almost everything we do. Mark I think most of the multiyear agreements we write in insurance has year-over-year price escalation associated with them. So that's a persistent effect in our business. I don't see it as becoming more or less meaningful than it has been in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line off Andrew Jeffrey. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Quickly I wondered if you could articulate a little bit your Internet-of-Things strategy how you see that playing out, how it functionally affects your solutions and so forth?","Scott Stephenson","Sure. So I think you probably seen the announcements we are trying to aggregate a lot of information not just from telematics and from cars, but even things around buildings and homes. Two primary focus, let me start with the side of claims we feel that we can very much effectively and more efficiently handle the first notice of loss process as it kind of starts inside the car. We've put up relationships between what we have in the OEMs and the car manufacturers in combination insurers so that we can speed and claim process both the notification and the payment thereof. So that is a good news item helps policyholders, it helps claims department and saves money.","And on the underwriting side, it\u2019s about pricing. The information is available from connected cars from mobile devices can tell you about how fast and how good and the behavior of the driver and that information is effective in pricing your insurance policy. So we are taking steps to bring that information into both kind of personal and commercial lines pricing. So that our insurance customers can be better and more active in assessing that risk and pricing it.","Scott Stephenson","And I think we have one final question here Carl.","Operator","The final question will be coming from the line of David Ridley-Lane. Your line is open.","David Ridley-Lane","Within the energy segment, I'm hoping to understand how far the cyclical rebound and core research of WoodMac revenue has proceeded. And where are we relative to prior peak revenue or client counts in that core WoodMac area? Thank you.","Scott Stephenson","So client retention is very high. So and in fact we have more customers than we used to have. And as I noted before, the sort of the progression related to research it\u2019s really a function of multiyear agreements rolling off, new multiyear agreements being signed. That has been - since you could really call the turn of the commodity which is within the last year, we've seen that effective work.","It will continue to be at work as we go forward. Basically the condition of the commodity is no longer an issue. We consider this a normalized environment that we\u2019re in now. So it\u2019s constructive and productive for the work we\u2019re selling today and the work we hope to able to sell in the future.","Scott Stephenson","All right everybody, thank you. We appreciate your interest and I'm sure we\u2019ll be talking to a lot of you in immediate follow-ups and no later than next quarters. So thanks very much. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk SVP and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Houston. Ms. Houston, please go ahead.","Eva Huston","Thank you, Jennifer and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2015 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark, highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we'll open up the call for your questions.","The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors Section of our website at Verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K, that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dialing.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today.","Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our SEC filing. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott Stephenson","Thank you, Eva. Good morning, all. In the second quarter, we again delivered excellent results, with total revenue growth of about 18% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 35%. Profitability was strong, with adjusted EBITDA growth of 22% and margins that continue to be industry leading.","On an organic basis and excluding the Verisk Health pass-through revenue and expenses, the top line grew 9.4%. On that basis, adjusted EBITDA grew 16%. We're pleased with these results, with good contributions from our existing and our acquired businesses.","During the quarter, we completed the $2.8 billion acquisition of Wood Mackenzie. As we've told you since announcing the transaction, WoodMac is very much Verisk-like, a subscription business built on proprietary data assets and benefiting from network effects and scale economies. For the full second quarter and on a comparable accounting basis to last year, WoodMac grew revenue over 10%, measured in pounds. To fund the acquisition of WoodMac, we issued $1.25 billion of bonds and drew $1 billion of borrowings, under our new $1.75 billion revolver. We also issued a 10.6 million shares of stock for $722 million.","Our use of a prudent mix of debt and equity allows us to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings, while taking on an appropriate level of financial leverage. We remain committed to our long-standing approach to capital allocation which is for a mix of acquisitions and share repurchases. With regard to capital allocation for buybacks, we completed the $500 million accelerated share repurchase in June.","While in the course of delevering toward our long-term target of 2.5 times, we expect to reengage our share repurchase program. Our existing authorization at the end of the quarter was about $190 million. We're even more excited about the opportunities, now that the WoodMac team is part of the Verisk family.","Given the depth, expertise and professionalism of the team, I am particularly pleased by the high levels of employee retention and enthusiasm following the close. Year to date, the retention of our subscription-based customers was almost 99% which demonstrates the value of the WoodMac solutions.","Our comprehensive integration efforts are tracking well, including looking for opportunities to cross-sell Heritage solutions into the WoodMac client base. One of our first initiatives was to move Verisk Maplecroft under WoodMac leadership. This effort has clear goals to enhance the existing suite of risk management and supply chain solutions for all clients and to help businesses in the natural resource sector better navigate their above ground risks.","We intend to be the leading provider of risk analytics to the world's largest companies. By combining WoodMac and Verisk Maplecroft, we offer clients a formidable scope of resources which now cover the entire range of above and below ground risks.","As we think about the medium-term revenue growth opportunity, you will see us investing now. While WoodMac's private equity owners invested in the business, allowing WoodMac to grow revenue, we have made a very conscious decision to accelerate some incremental investments, to allow WoodMac to go even faster, with a view towards driving medium-term growth.","In addition, we're taking advantage of the end market downturn, to hire exceptional talent from the industry. We feel very good about the outlook for WoodMac and its ability to be a meaningful contributor to Verisk's financial profile, for many years to come. We have spent time over the past few months visiting offices around the world and meeting with some of the WoodMac customers and are very encouraged by our now global organization.","We're optimistic about the expansion opportunities for our other businesses. For example, we launched Touchstone 3.0 recently which is part of our already global Catastrophe Modeling business. We continue to see good adoption for the platform which is meeting our customers directly where their needs are. We had record attendance at our London risk symposium in June, as we continue to look to add value for our insurance customers outside the United States.","We continue to feel confident in our long-term opportunities to grow shareholder value through a combination of innovation-driven organic growth and prudent deployment of capital, including our strategy driven M&A.","So with that, let me turn it over to Mark, to cover some of the financial results in more detail.","Mark Anquillare","Thank you, Scott. In the second quarter, we again delivered both revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, while also investing for the future. Revenue grew 17.5%. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and Verisk Health pass-throughs, revenue growth was 9.4%.","The strong organic growth reflects the continuing demand for the high-value solutions we offer to our customers. We will be discussing adjusted EBITDA with you today which excludes an $85 million hedge gain and $27 million in nonrecurring transaction costs related to the WoodMac transaction. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 24.6% and 11.6% on an organic basis, excluding acquisitions and the Verisk Health pass-through revenue in the second quarter.","We saw organic growth across all four categories, led by Financial Services and Healthcare. Decision Analytics insurance grew 8.1% in the quarter. The increase was driven by strong growth in Underwriting Solutions, loss quantification, claims, Catastrophe Modeling solutions, all contributed to the growth. We again saw good growth from Touchstone, Xactimate and 360Value.","Financial Services revenue increased 20.8%, driven by continued strong demand for our solutions and services. We're continuing to make progress in the advertising effectiveness space, as well as expanding internationally. Consistent with the plan we put in place at the start of the year, we expect Argus to grow in the high teens for the full year 2015. We called out high project revenue the last quarter. And, we also [indiscernible] to add to our full-year expectations.","The underlying growth rate of the core business continues to track in the high teens. And for the next couple years, there may be some variability from quarter to quarter, as large pilot projects start up and wind down in the advertising affective space. While it's still early, we do have a line of sight into our incremental projects in the ad affective space, that we hope become recurring, as we move into 2016. Also, we continue to be pleased by the global advancements for the business.","Healthcare revenue grew 19.6%, excluding about $2.1 million of pass-through revenue, in the second quarter of 2015. We saw growth across all solution groups, led by revenue and Quality Solutions. The results in the quarter were, again, ahead of our expectations, as the transactional nature of much of the business continues to provide lesser visibility than our other businesses.","With the Medicare Advantage season underway, our execution remains solid. And, we see EBITDA growing faster than revenue for the year, as expected. The Medicare Advantage space remains dynamic, as customers manage their strategies in real time, with respect to the populations they analyze.","We remain a leader in the space and we'll have a much clearer sense of what the 2015\/2016 Medicare Advantage season will look like, when we speak with you following the third quarter. As we look out a bit further, we're excited about the opportunities we see to grow in the commercial risk adjustment space, including with exchanges which will provide some seasonal balance to our Medicare risk adjustment business.","Energy and specialized revenue increased 6% on an organic basis. Including the recently acquired WoodMac and Maplecroft businesses, growth was almost 200%. WoodMac's revenue contribution beginning May 19 was about $40 million, reflecting a reduction due to purchase accounting rules for deferred revenue. Because there's no change in expenses, this will impact reported adjusted EBITDA equally. We reflected this in the accretion range we provided previously.","WoodMac has continued to perform well, even in a challenging energy market. And on a comparable basis to the second quarter 2015, WoodMac grew 10% in pounds. We continue to expect full-year growth in pounds, excluding deferred revenue impact, to be in the high-single digits. Based on the current exchange rates, we expect WoodMac's reported revenue, under our ownership for 2015, to be at least $225 million.","As a result of the purchase accounting related to reduction to revenue, margins will appear artificially low this year, at around 40%. When these transitional effects have worked their way through our P&L, we expect EBITDA margins, on a normalized basis, to be at least 45%. Maplecroft's $2.1 million of revenue in the quarter was in line with our expectations. We continue to see good growth in the quarter in environmental health and safety solutions and are seeing good traction from our commercial weather and climate analytics.","Risk assessment revenue grew 6%, indicating the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Industry standard insurance programs grew 6.2%, reflecting our 2015 invoices which were effective January 1. And, continued contributions from newer solutions, such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 5.7% in the quarter. This increase was driven by new subscriptions.","Adjusted EBITDA which excludes nonrecurring gains and expenses from WoodMac transaction, increased 22.3% to about $238 million. Total adjusted EBITDA margin was 47.7%. The 32.1% increase in Decision Analytics adjusted EBITDA, to $136 million, was a result of growth in the business and improved operations, including in Verisk Health. In addition, we saw the benefit from lower pass-through expenses which will continue through the year.","Risk assessment adjusted EBITDA increased 11.3%, to about $102 million, as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, including lower people-related costs following the fourth quarter talent realignment.","We continue to expect to hire additional people, as part of the realignment initiative. Reported interest expense was $37.7 million in the quarter. Excluding the nonrecurring WoodMac transaction related costs, interest expense was $24.3 million. Total debt, both short term and long term, was about $3.3 billion at June 30, 2015. Our leverage at the end of the second quarter was about 3.3 times. We're committed to bringing leverage down to about 2.5 times, by the end of 2016.","Our reported effective tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter. Excluding the nonrecurring WoodMac related costs, the effective tax rate was about 31.1%. This rate reflects the benefits of our tax planning efforts and lower foreign tax rates. Adjusted net income, excluding the nonrecurring WoodMac related costs, increased 32.8% to $129 million in the quarter. The nonrecurring items in the quarter which were excluded from adjusted net income, totaled $55.9 million.","The December 2014 accelerated share repurchase was completed in June 2015. As a result, an additional 800,000 shares were delivered to the company. The $500 million ASR resulted in the repurchase of 7.2 million shares, at an average price of $69.62, during the period. The average diluted share count was 167.6 million shares in the quarter. On June 30, 2015 our diluted share count was 171.4 million shares.","Adjusted EPS, excluding the nonrecurring WoodMac related costs, on a fully diluted basis, was $0.77 for the quarter, an increase of 35.1%. Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, increased 40% to $295 million, for the six months period ended June 30, 2015, including the contribution from WoodMac. This represented 65.1% of EBITDA.","Capital expenditures decreased 20.7%, to $60.1 million for the six months period ended June 30, 2015. And, we're at 6.3% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx of about $170 million, including WoodMac. As of June 30, our cash and cash equivalents were $145 million. As you think about your models for the full year, including WoodMac purchase accounting from the time we closed, but excluding the second quarter of nonrecurring items, we anticipate amortization of intangibles of about $145 million. And, we'll provide an update when the purchase accounting is finalized.","Fixed asset depreciation amortization, about $125 million. Diluted weighted average share count of $169 million. Based upon the current debt balances, the full year interest expense will be about $110 million. This amount excludes the second quarter bridge fees and the May coal fees we paid, to eliminate the private bonds. For the intangible amortization add back in the adjusted net income calculation, we're using a 26% tax rate, to reflect the U.S.\/foreign mix of intangible amortization, post WoodMac acquisition.","Finally, for the second half of 2015, we currently expect the tax rate to be around 36%. Overall, we're pleased to report that our business is performing well. We're seeing growth from multiple verticals and we're executing on our operational plans. And, our integration of WoodMac is progressing well. With that, I'll turn the call back to Eva for comments before Q&A.","Eva Huston","Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, including two who have just initiated in the quarter, we ask that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up. This will give more people an opportunity to ask their questions. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Could you give us some perspective on the positive operating leverage we saw in the quarter? It looked like tremendous operating expense control. Is this something that represents an inflection point for Verisk? If we put WoodMac aside, Verisk ex-WoodMac, do you think that your past the big investment cycle that you've been in, in the last two to three years?","Scott Stephenson","We have talked about the margins being strong and we would expect that to continue. So, now let me add maybe a little bit of color. And, maybe more directly respond to some of your questions. First of all, as you think about why those margins are higher, a couple things.","One, the business has natural operating leverage we've highlighted in the past. I think you're seeing that. Our level of investment continues. I don't think it's accelerating, inside the business. But, we continue to have a lot of opportunities to invest, but the leverage is outpacing. Verisk Health passthroughs, that is just a mathematical thing. But, clearly, that helps the overall margin picture.","And, if you look back on 2014, we did incur some FTC related costs in 2014, that aren't there in 2015. Only thing I'll caveat, as you look forward, we did have the talent and realignment in the fourth quarter of 2014, related to the risk assessment group. We do intend to hire back a lot of those people. So, you'll start to see that in the second half and into 2016.","David Togut","Just a quick follow-up question on the healthcare business which was up nicely, 20% in the quarter. You called out RQI, but any specific call outs on payment accuracy or enterprise analytics in the quarter?","Scott Stephenson","Well, we're very pleased with broad-based growth across all four pillars, inside of our business. So, we're not really distinguishing among them. But, we definitely look to all of them for growth and they're all growing.","Operator","And your next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair & company.","Tim McHugh","Just on healthcare, I think last quarter you had had a comment, that you expected growth to slow in the second half of the year. I didn't notice that comment this quarter. Is that still the case or has your view changed?","Scott Stephenson","No. Same view as last quarter, no change.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And I guess, can you talk a little bit at a high level, to the extent what your view at this point is, on M&A activity amongst your client base? Both in the reinsurance market and the health plan market. How do you think about that impacting you? And, how do you think about the opportunities and challenges that that will bring about?","Scott Stephenson","When we go through our planning cycle each year and I'll start with insurance for example, we actually build into our assumptions a degree of industry consolidation. We just expect it, actually. And, it's just a very routine part of our planning. And, we're not trying to specify any two organizations will come together. But more, just anticipating that there will be a degree of it.","So, what's happening in the insurance space is, moment in time, nothing other than what we would have expected. And at the moment, whatever small effects are being felt, are being felt, probably differentially, on the reinsurance side actually. But moment in time, the next time that, unfortunately, the world experiences a major natural catastrophe, that will all turnaround very, very quickly.","And, new capital will come into the market. And so, it moves a little bit. But, nothing out of the ordinary, nothing unanticipated. On the healthcare side, we'll see what the effect is, of some of these organizations coming together. Their own operating plans, I don't think, are clear at this time. Maybe starting to take shape, but it will be a little while before they work through, et cetera.","But, the two things that give us confidence; number one is where Verisk Health sits in this universe, as a very, very important partner to the leaders in the space. And the other comment I would make is, as we just look at the demography of the emerging world, some of our most important customers and closest relationships seem to be the ones that are doing well, as the industry structure changes. So, that's an encouraging point for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeff Meuler","You gave a metric ton WoodMac client retention. I just wasn't quite sure exactly what it was. I think you said 99%, but was that at a customer count level? And, was that during Q2 or since you've owned that? What exactly metric did you disclose?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. So Jeff, it was 99%. It was year-to-date. It was on subscription-based revenue. So what we're doing is, we're looking at customers that have had subscription contracts and asking the question, as we've moved forward in time, how many of those did we retain? And, that was the 99%. We also gave you the 10% organic growth number, also. And I think everybody knows, that this is a business which is substantially subscription revenue. So you can derive from that, that the revenues associated with subscriptions have also done very well in that time period.","Jeff Meuler","And then, given that WoodMac offers a range of subscription products, can you help sign up for us how big that cross-sell opportunity is? In the past, you've given some metrics around Decision Analytics insurance. If you got full penetration of existing products, could you give us something similar for WoodMac?","Scott Stephenson","I don't think we put that number out, Jeff. But I'll put -- let me give you a different way of holding that. Which is, if you look at WoodMac's historic performance with respect to organic growth which we think is the normalized expectation for this business over long periods of time. There has been a very healthy mix of signing up new customers, cross-selling existing solutions into the existing customer base and introducing new solutions. It's been a very healthy mix of those three.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","My first question's also on WoodMac, just to confirm. Mark, did you say that the full-year revenue contribution from WoodMac was going to be 225 million pounds and that the WoodMac --","Mark Anquillare","That's dollars. $225 million, for the period that we would own it, through the end of the year.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And then for the - Got it. And, you said the margin's at 40%, that was WoodMac specific, right?","Mark Anquillare","That is correct. And by the way, as we did the math there that you just described, it's at the current exchange rates. The other thing we highlighted, just processed with purchase accounting, there was some revenue that won't be recognized, deferred revenue won't be recognized. So, that artificially lowered the margins to 40%, for this period in 2015.","Manav Patnaik","And, will that lapse first quarter next year or is this just this year?","Mark Anquillare","It mostly lapses. The biggest reductions occur at the beginning of the period. So, it gets generally better over time and I think it does end sometime in the middle of next year, But, the dollars are much less significant then.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. Last thing, on Argus. You guys said high teens. Given the first half performance, that does imply a material slowdown in the second half. Is that something -- is that just conservatism? Is there something to it?","Scott Stephenson","Well, I want to go back to the nature of Argus. So, it also is substantially a subscription-oriented business. There are really three revenue streams associated with Argus. The subscription based, the services that we provide to individual customers and now we have this third dimension which is related to ad effectiveness.","And, I think what Mark was referencing in his comments earlier is that, that third piece is so exciting, precisely because some of the customers that are coming newly to this capability, are very large entities. And so, as they get interested in the capability, even on a trial basis, the amount of work that they look to do with us and the amount of analytic they look to consume, is very, very large.","And so, as this method becomes established, what we're going to see is, at moments in time, large entities diving in. And, in a very deep way. That's what happened with the project-based revenue that we reported and that I think you're referencing here, Manav, in the first quarter of 2015.","And by the way, some of that same project revenue was actually there at the end of 2014, as well. So, it wasn't literally just only the first quarter of 2015. We also had it in 2014. But, you get these little novas and then it becomes more standard operating procedure. You're going to see that from us for the next couple of years.","So, the expectation that you should have is that the underlying business, the subscription oriented business, is going to be a very strongly organically performing kind of a business. And that we will have at moments in time, almost on a quarter by quarter basis, you're going to see some of this project revenue, that's the effect that you're seeing in 2015. But, the basic business is not only as healthy, it's actually healthier than it's ever been.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line James Friedman with Susquehanna.","James Friedman","I'll ask my two up front. Mark, also on WoodMac. Mark, you had mentioned in your commentary that some of the deferred revenue gets written down. Maybe that's the wrong language, but if you could dimensionalize how much is that? And then Scott, with regard to health exchanges, I think you had mentioned in your prepared remarks or maybe Mark said this. That you had an opportunity in commercial, on the health side and potentially with exchanges. If you could elaborate with that as well? Thank you.","Scott Stephenson","I'll take the second one, first. Because, I think there's actually more depth in Mark's response. So yes, the exchanges are, I would call it an emerging part of the healthcare landscape. To us, it's another channel. It's another customer segment, basically. And, the same kind of risk-adjusting analytics are needed there, as are needed everywhere else.","We're excited about it. It's going to grow. It's not nearly as big as, say, Medicare risk adjusting today. But, we're providing leadership there, as we're in these other segments. And the other thing I'll just underline here which I believe was a part of what Mark said, was that the timing with which commercial risk adjusting revenues will show up on our P&L, will actually be a little asynchronous with the Medicare risk adjusting. Which, all else equal, is actually kind of good. And it helps us to manage our operations a little bit more smoothly. So, we're excited about that part of the business. So then, Mark. Back over to you for the WoodMac revenue.","Mark Anquillare","Sure. We had some deferred revenue on the books. So, as a result, you can't recognize 100% of that. In the quarter, that was a couple million dollars. And basically the way that works is, you'll have a normalized or full quarter, for third and fourth. But it will, then, start to move down and get lower, through probably about the third quarter of next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the investments that you're making in WoodMac and what the magnitude is, like going from a 47% margin to a 40%? How much of that is the investments, versus how much is the deferred accounting piece? And also, just confirm that the investments that you're making is part of the 40%?","Scott Stephenson","So, let me let Mark begin by picking apart the revenue effect. And then, I'll come back and talk categorically about some of the investing that we're doing.","Mark Anquillare","I just provided you with the top line effects of things, so think of it this way. You don't recognize as much revenue, the same expenses exist, so as a result, it has a little bit of erosion to the margin itself. What we said is 40% for the year and we would get back to normalized 45% in the future. In addition, I think there's some investment which we're very excited about making, that maybe Scott, do you want to give some color on?","Scott Stephenson","Just a couple places. In a business like hours, it's always actually people. And so, some of the topics that we're on with WoodMac would include -- It's actually a very nice opportunity in the oil and gas space, to try to help players in that space observe, what we call, supply chain effects.","And that is something which is, I'd say relatively nascent. And so, we're actually building the team, the resources that are able to go after that. We're continuing to try to enhance the platform by which the content is put out there. There is so much content that is available, from WoodMac, that crosses the desk of a user's work, on a daily basis.","o, finding ways to make it granular and accessible is an important thing. That will also actually expand the available market. And the third is, we actually think that WoodMac solutions are undersold. And so, the go-to-market capability is being expanded.","Toni Kaplan","Okay. Great. My follow-up question. The $225 million for WoodMac, for this year, in your results, in terms of revenue. Does that include any of the cross-selling that you're expecting? And also, when would you expect to start to see some, either cross-selling or synergies? And, would you expect it to be either more gradual or a step up? Thanks.","Mark Anquillare","So the answer to your question is, the $225 million is the, I'll call it the WoodMac set of solutions. It does not include any of the cross-sell of other solutions, that we think will be attractive to that market.","Scott Stephenson","The latter part, we'll talk about it as it emerges. We're putting great emphasis on it. We've actually taken two relatively Senior Executives and put them in charge of, essentially, achieving this cross-sell that we're talking about. We're taking it very seriously.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","Bill Warmington","First is, I just have to mention that on the Nielsen call yesterday, they specifically pointed to marketing effectiveness being up about 22%. So, kudos to Argus there. But, that doesn't count as a question. So, hold on here. On the purchase accounting, my first question, looks like, if you ballpark it with the pro forma, looks like that was up about, adjusting for currency, about maybe 6% or 7%.","And then, if you throw in the other couple million dollars for the deferred revenue adjustment, maybe that's another 400, 500 basis points. So, WoodMac was growing at maybe 10% to 11% in the quarter? And, I wanted to first ask if that math was right. And if so, it looks like an acceleration from last year. And, maybe talk a little bit about what's driving that acceleration versus last year?","Scott Stephenson","Your math is correct. WoodMac content is must-have for their customers. It's absolutely indispensable. And, when the end market gets perturbed the way that it has, there are puts and takes. And everybody likes to talk about the takes, I suppose which is CapEx temporarily moving down.","But, the put is that people need to understand this dynamic marketplace even more than before. And as a result, there have been some of the customer segments, some geographies in the world which have actually grown quite strongly. But overall, it's more of the same story. Which is, basically, when you have must-have information, it's going to find it's market. And, that's what WoodMac is doing right now.","Bill Warmington","And for my follow-up question, to ask if you could update us on the pipeline for aerial imagery, new products and enhancements. I know there has been talk about Xactware's aerial sketch coming out. And, I wanted to see how that was going.","Scott Stephenson","So we really, genuinely, believe that we have the industry standard method for the interpretation of aerial imagery. Think of it as the algorithms, think of it as the method. And in fact, we're talking about it with our customers quite a bit. And there's a lot of excitement. So, the only thing that we haven't commented on yet and we're not going to comment on today. But we will comment on, in the relatively near future, is our strategy for sourcing imagery. And, I'll just remind everybody that it does include aerial imagery which makes use of the visible spectrum.","But that's not all. Our imagery strategy also embraces satellite-based, drone-based. Basically, anywhere that you can develop data about some condition, on the surface of the planet. So, you'll be hearing a lot more about that from us. But, we continue to lean into that heavily. We continue to talk to our customers about it a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","I wanted to revisit these long-term margin framework of 45% to 47%. And, given the year-to-date results being above the high end, should we consider the high end 47% to be a cap for this year? Or, is 45% to 47% not meant to be a cap, in a specific year?","Scott Stephenson","Andrew, I think what we've tried to outline is a profile of our company over the longer-term. Yes, we've talked about that 45% to 47%. I think we're feeling good about where the margins are today. We feel that the leverage will continue, so I do not see it as a cap. I see it as a long-term direction. Obviously we're trending towards very upper end of that.","And, we consider investment for the future, whether it's around aerial imagery or around acquisitions that just don't have the same margins profile that we have. So, I would not think of it as a cap. It's kind of a longer-term type of set of numbers.","Andrew Steinerman","Is there anything in the second half of the year, of stepped up investments, that might keep us within that 47%? Or, does the second half investment plans look similar to the first half for this year?","Scott Stephenson","I think the only thing that we tried to highlight is that, risk assessment has done a talent realignment. We're probably a little light on resources there and we're staffing up. That will affect us a bit in 2015, the second half. And, probably more into 2016, but that's the one noteworthy item.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","I wonder if you could dig in just a little bit more on the WoodMac investments in new products? Scott, could you talk a little bit specifically, from a functional perspective, as to where you see the most opportunities for growth? My sense is that WoodMac is maybe a little more capital markets intensive than its largest competitor?","And I wonder if broadening out the offering is part of the initiative? And it seems like, despite that spend, it's not going to have an adverse effect on consolidated profitability. So, I wonder if you could frame up those two.","Scott Stephenson","You're on the right trail, there. So, first of all, one of the strengths of WoodMac is that the customer base is very broad and very diversified. And, it includes integrated global oil companies, national oil companies, the Financial Services sector as you point out, pure play E&P companies, just anybody who's basically interested in the hydrocarbon. And, that's a real strength. That is a genuine strength of the company.","So, part of the opportunity here is to find ways to take this extremely rich content and make it just as consumable as possible, for each different use case. And in fact, I would describe the company as being fairly early in its journey, in that respect. So, that's one dimension.","Another dimension is, remember how this business got started. It was some very talented Scotsman observing on North Sea oil, as a part of helping investors to get a perspective on all of that. And I mentioned that simply to say that, that point of initiation relates to what you could consider to be WoodMac's very greatest strength at this time which is upstream. And I would say, particularly, rest of world.","So, some of what we can do to try to create additional growth opportunities, is to make sure that the depth of the content is equally differentiated, everywhere around the globe. And another thing is that, we have opportunities to complement the upstream focus with some other data analytics that the industry needs.","Some of them relate to the supply chain, so you're moving from upstream to downstream, as I mentioned before. Some of them relate to issues, maybe, more of operational excellence, than they do to issues of asset valuation and asset disposal. And, some of them would relate to more directly technical dimensions of what's going on in the oil and gas industry.","So, a whole variety of ways that the business can grow. It's exactly the same play-book, in terms of what the nature of the business is and how it operates. But, yes. A broad customer base with an expanding set of functional solutions for them.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. And shifting gears to insurance, to make sure that business doesn't get short shrift. There's been some discussion around, I think in the investment community, the risk of a softer underwriting premium market.","I know we've been, Verisk has been through a cycle like that before, as a public company. Could you refresh us as to the risk of a softer market? How you address a softer market? How, maybe, your approach to your customers might change, et cetera?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. Our approach to our customers will change not one iota, as we move through the cycle. We're so deeply engaged with our customers that, even before cycles get observed externally, we're very aware of what's going on in their businesses.","But what goes on in their business, first of all, is that the strong signal inside of the insurance industry is that, everybody knows that there needs to be an intense intensified use of data analytics to drive decisioning. And in parallel with that, a drive towards more automation. So, it's actually precise analytics in a speedy way. And, that's exactly what we're working on with our customers.","As the industry cycles around, actually, when there's softness on the underwriting side, the pressure on our customers to have good underwriting performance, only increases. And so, making use of our solutions, arguably, is even a better idea when the cycle is turning down.","So, our approach remains absolutely invariant. And in fact, if anybody has the impression that our pricing, for example, is tied to industry premium volumes, that's just a misunderstanding. We're in control of our pricing. And we price to value. And our customers understand that.","Operator","Your next question is from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery.","Joseph Foresi","This year, we saw healthcare get off to a really good start. And, obviously, it's still performing pretty well. I was wondering, I've typically thought of that business as being backend loaded. Because, it went into Medicare. Evaluations took place. The Medicare Advantage evaluations took place. Has the seasonality in that business changed at all? And, how do we think about that seasonality going forward?","Scott Stephenson","No. The seasonality has not changed. Medicare Advantage is still, substantially, a third and fourth quarter event. But, what Mark referenced and I'll just highlight it again is, as we begin to complement what we're doing on that side, with more commercial risk adjusting, the seasonality of commercial risk adjusting is asynchronous with what goes on in Medicare risk adjusting.","So, the pattern may modify a little bit as the exchanges grow and as commercial risk adjusting increases. But no, that's an accurate perspective on our business, as it is today. More back half than front half.","Joseph Foresi","And on WoodMac, obviously, the oil prices have rebounded. But, it seems like the business may be insulated from any changes in oil prices. Can you talk about why you think that there's a moat between the end market and what the revenue growth was this quarter and going forward? Maybe you could spell that out for us, that would be great.","Scott Stephenson","If you're interested in the hydrocarbon ecosystem and you are considering the possibility of investment. Either as the principal who's investing, the principal who's dis-investing or the agent who is advising on the investment or the dis-investment. You have simply got to have Wood Mackenzie content in order to make your decision.","Because, this being a global commodity, you have to understand with high precision, what the global supply curve looks like, at any given moment in time. And that supply curve is very dynamic. Very dynamic. An existing asset will lose more than 5% of its productivity in a 12 month period, if it's not reinvested in order to maintain it. And so, staying on top of that, there's always new exploration.","And then, there is the need to understand existing projects. How productive are they? And, how productive are they becoming? And so, you will feel uncomfortable knowing what to do from an asset investment or disposal point of view, if you don't have Wood Mackenzie content. It's that simple.","Operator","Your next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","Mark, I'm apologizing in advance for this. But, I just wanted to circle back to your comments about the 45% margins with Wood Mackenzie. Is that after you've made these investments that you've spoken about? And, how long do you think it will take you to get there?","Mark Anquillare","Sure. So, I did say at least 45%, just to make sure I readdress that. I think we feel like these are the types of investments we can monetize relatively quickly. The way some of these businesses work, I'll use supply chain as an example. You have to do some services before you can actually productize. So with that model, you're hopefully bringing in some profitable business, some profitable growth off of those services. And then what happens is, we can productize the observations and start to build margin and leverage into it.","Similarly, if you think about the platform, some of that is just customer satisfaction data visualization. But at the same time, a part of that strategy is to try to take and bundle a solutions in a way that we can attract, I'll call it a tail, to the customer set. Scott addressed it with some salespeople. But at the same time, we feel that there's 900 customers that are currently a part of what I'll refer to as WoodMac customers.","But, there could be 5000, 6000 people who are interested in the material. And, we need to get to them. So, that's another way to monetize it. So our hope is, we talk about it medium term, but we're making thoughtful investment decisions that I think will pay off in 2016. And, you'll hopefully start to see some of that.","Jeff Silber","On the risk assessment side, you had mentioned some of the hiring that may be going on there, back half of this year and into next year. So, is it safe to assume that we would see some EBITDA margin compression, from the 59% level or so, that you've been reporting the past couple quarters?","Mark Anquillare","Yes, you should. That's just a reversion back to, not where we were, but we would still have leverage. I just want to highlight again, we have found ways to continue to do things more effectively and more efficiently.","And what we're starting to see, on inside risk assessment, is opportunities to re-imagine our markets a bit. And, we're going to places that we think there's opportunities. So, we're going to put some talented resources in place, to try to grow the business in a couple other spaces. And, we're excited by the opportunity there. So, you should look to that. And, I think we would continue to see some of the growth in risk assessment continue, that is above historical norms.","Operator","Your next question is from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins","Going back on WoodMac. So, I'm understanding that you've got a significant moat. When you talk about high-single digit growth for the rest of the year, it would suggest a bit of a slowdown from what you've seen most recently. And so, I'm wondering if you are seeing any short-term slowdown with clients? Or, if there's any variation within the client base around their behavior or perspective client behavior?","Scott Stephenson","No. It's really, very steady as she goes. WoodMac have really adopted a very customer-centric approach. Well, they've always been that way. But, in this current environment, I think they've shown special care and attention for the condition of individual customers. Have customized their go-to-market down to the individual account.","Under the leadership of a very, very good go-to-market team. And, the engagement with the customers. I would say the only thing that's actually changing is the term of the agreements is actually stretching out. In other words, the duration of the agreements is actually lengthening in the current environment which is a positive.","Sara Gubins","Switching gears over to insurance in Decision Analytics. Catastrophe bonds were down pretty significantly in the second quarter. The comp was really difficult and it looks like June trends have already improved year over year. Could you talk about whether or not that had any impact in the insurance segment? Obviously, the growth there was very strong on a tough comp.","Scott Stephenson","Yes, it was there. The absolute amount of work we do around cap bonds, the absolute amount of revenue we drive there, is not particularly large as a percentage of the mix of what we do. But, yes, the effect was there. Happily, where all of us as citizens of the world is concerned, hurricane and earthquake activity has actually been relatively low over the last couple of years. That's good. Long-term, one can't really count on that. But, with an effect like that, the whole market orients to that at a moment in time.","And, the next time we have a major event, you will see hardening, you will see capital come into the market. You will see investors trying to find lots of ways to respond to catastrophe risks. And by the way, I'll also say that, we remain extremely pleased with the share that we enjoy, inside of the analysis of cap bonds. We're the clear leader in that category, have been for a long time and still are.","Operator","Your next question is from Arash Soleimani with KBW.","Arash Soleimani","Just a couple questions here. First, I think you mentioned in the second half of the year you're expecting a 36% tax rate. So is that 36%, is it fair to think of that as the new normal, going forward more permanently?","Mark Anquillare","The simple answer is yes. We would say that's probably the new norm, as it relates to going forward. We could have a little bit more opportunity as we get into 2016, but we'll keep you advised. That's where we think will play out, around 36%.","Arash Soleimani","And the other question I had, I know you talked a bit before about the International opportunity you could have in insurance, because of the more global platform that WoodMac has, from a business development standpoint. How significant is that opportunity, on the insurance side, now that you do have that platform? And, what's a general time frame? Is that something within the next 24 months or more of a five-year strategy?","Scott Stephenson","This is a longer-term initiative on our part. At the end of the day, it will be very powerful. At the end of the day, something that will be very material inside of our insurance business, is the globalization of it. But, it will take time. Because, the way that you become global when you are a business like us and especially in our insurance vertical, is that you're actually multi-domestic.","So, you have to be very chinese in China. And, you have to be very french in France. And, the platform will definitely help us. And at the same time, as you know, our business model is it's absolute peak best when we have proprietary data derived from our customers. And that just takes time. So, the theory of the case absolutely holds. And, this will be a powerful effect inside of our business, but over intermediate to longer periods of time.","Operator","Your next question is Anj Singh with Credit Suisse.","Anj Singh","I was wondering if you can talk more about advertising effectiveness? It seems you're quite optimistic that the currently transactional activity could turn in to more subscription oriented, as well as more one-time projects. And, I appreciate the earlier color. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about what's driving the confidence. Are you starting to see engagement from a larger number of clients? Is it the same customer at Q1 that's indicating more interest? Just trying to understand the dynamics there better. Thanks.","Scott Stephenson","The interest in this new category is fairly broad-based. I would say, probably the primary source of my own confidence is actually looking at the size and sophistication of companies that have awakened to this opportunity and are expressing deep and, I would say, enduring interests in these kinds of categories.","And no it's not hardly, simply, the major project customer committing over the longer period of time. It's a very rich set of opportunities. And again, as much as anything for me, it's the scale and the sophistication of the companies that are interested in what it is that we can provide here.","Anj Singh","Okay. Got it. And a little bit of a departure from the earlier questions, but could you update us on some of your innovation initiatives? Particularly around telematics? You had mentioned this at your Analyst Day last year. We saw the press release on your recent alliance with IMS. Wondering if you could share some of the progress you've made there. And, give us a sense of the client activity as it stands today?","Mark Anquillare","Let me take that. This is Mark. I think we feel very optimistic about telematics. And clearly, the U.S. market's a little bit behind Europe. But, we're making progress in three areas. One, we have a couple of analytic models that seem to be truly predictive. So, one's focused on the geography and where you drive. And then, the other is on the behavior of the driver, both highly predictive.","Two, we have been working with, obviously, our insurer customers, in a way to try to figure out a way to work with them as this third party data provider. Along with, providing those analytics. And there's certainly an openness to that, especially with and around, the PII or personally identifiable information, that's out there. There seems to be an interest in having someone else handle and provide that data stewardship.","And thirdly, I think we have interest in working with OEMs that are a part of, inside of the car and automobile manufacturing world, that are harvesting some of that data. So, we hope to provide some better color and some better information about our direction there, in the very near term. But, I will highlight again, a very insightful question in a topic that we're focused on and optimistic about.","Operator","And next question comes from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Adrienne Colby","It's Adrienne Colby for Paul Ginocchio. I wanted to go back to the subject of M&A. I was wondering how the consolidation in managed care has had an effect on Verisk Health. And, if you could comment specifically on your revenue exposure to potential inquirers, versus those being acquired?","Scott Stephenson","I think we actually touched on this before. So, just to recap. First of all, there have been announcements. These large transactions have not been completed yet. I'll also just point out that, when you look at our performance over the last several years which has been very strong and the industry it's been consolidating for some time now.","So, it's not as if this is any brand new phenomenon. I did comment earlier, also, that one of the encouraging things for us is that, as we look at the demography of the emerging world, we look at who it is that seems to be, in essence, coming out on top in all of this. We're encouraged to see that some of our deeper relationships, those are the companies that seem to be doing pretty well.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin","Just one quick question. Was there any update as to how the efforts to increase the excitement about the ISO ClaimSearch DNA product you called out last quarter is trending? And, whether or not you expect that to be a more material contributor to growth in the near to intermediate term?","Mark Anquillare","Let me give you a little bit of color. We have and we're in the process of really redesigning and relaunching our ClaimSearch solution. Just to remind everybody, that is the industry standard around fighting fraud and abuse inside the P&C industry, with over a billion claims. So, that relaunch is being rolled out in a sequential way, with some of our largest customers. What we've seen is both the data visualization has been very well-received.","The tool which, maybe in the past, was a little bit more of a reporting of instances, has a lot more predictive capabilities. Which, I think, are leading to, I'll call it this way, more use of and more value from the solution. Now, how do we monetize that? Remember, this is a well penetrated solution.","What we have is a set of other analytics and information that is around that ClaimSearch product. And, we hope that continued and expanded use will lead to cross sell and upsell, into those other products. So, a little bit of a fortification. And hopefully, it will provide us for an opportunity for further growth, as we look into 2016, when we're fully launched.","Scott Stephenson","I just want to give a shout out to our colleagues who been working on that. They have really done great work.","Andre Benjamin","A little bit of a housekeeping question. As your partner on the ad effectiveness product talks a little bit more explicitly about the growth rates there, is there anything about the nature of the arrangement with them, that would mean that you're growth from that product is any different from what they're talking about?","Scott Stephenson","I would make a different point, Andre. Which is that, we do work in the space with our partner, but also on our own. And so, you can't just directly link the two in that way.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue at this time. And, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Stephenson for any closing remarks.","Scott Stephenson","Thank you, everybody, for your interest and for joining us today. And, we look forward to speaking with you, certainly, no later than when we report out Q3. So, thank you very much for your time today.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call and you may now disconnect."],"21578":["Verisk Analytics, Inc.

This call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.","At this time for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.","Stacey Brodbar","Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide a brief overview of our business. Eric Schneider, our Chief Technology Officer, will then provide an update on our technology strategy, including our cloud migration. Lastly, Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer, will highlight some key points about our financial performance. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer, will join the team for Q&A.","The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Stephenson","Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share that 2019 was another strong year for Verisk marked by solid financial results, while we continue to invest for future growth. Normalizing for the revenue impact of the injunction related to our roof measurement solutions, we delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 6.9%, and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.7%, demonstrating organic margin improvement in 2019. Moreover, our growth was driven by broad-based strength across our Insurance vertical and marked improvement in energy and specialized markets.","The consistency of our growth comes from four sources: First, intimacy with our customers; second, ever deeper levels of integration between our solutions and their environments; third, a steady stream of innovative new solutions; and fourth, the cross-sell of existing solutions to existing customers. Within Insurance, we continue to enjoy strong market uptake of our platformed analytic environments, including LightSpeed for automated underwriting and Touchstone for catastrophe modeling. These solutions are being well received by both the traditional P&C insurers as well as the InsurTech start-ups, who need data analytics to effectively price and sell in a competitive market. We've experienced great success with the InsurTech segment with more than 100 new sales wins in 2019 alone.","Our Energy and Specialized Markets segment delivered improved growth in 2019, driven by particularly strong results in our market and cost intelligence solutions, as well as improvements within our core research at Wood Mackenzie. In addition, we delivered strong top line growth and improving profitability from our breakout areas, including the Lens platform and our chemicals and energy transition solutions. As always, we are in close conversation with our customers as they navigate the near-term macro environment.","In financial services, 2019 was a year of transition as we evolved from a top-down orientation to a bottoms-up approach with an emphasis on steady growth. Along that journey, we took a very deep look at all our solutions in Verisk Financial Solutions and concluded that our data hosting business what we call Argus Data Warehouse, no longer aligned with our core business model. As such, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to transition the Argus Data Warehouse by transferring approximately 50 people and licensing our intellectual property to a partner, so that we can focus on data analytics. We believe this transaction will position the Financial Services segment for stronger growth and higher levels of profitability going forward.","Continuing on the strategic front, on February 1st, Verisk closed on the previously announced sale of our aerial imagery sourcing group to Vexcel group. This transforms Geomni into an asset light operation with a focus on advanced data analytics. Moreover, it meaningfully reduces the cost structure of our Geomni business, while giving us access to the leading US image library along with favorable economics. Regarding our roof measurement solutions, we have applied for a patent on our new technology for roof measurement, while continuing with our plan to appeal the recent court decision.","On February 14, we closed on the sale of our compliance background screening business. This business was in the claims sub-segment of our Insurance business. This transaction will allow us to continue to have access to this important dataset, but in a more capitally efficient manner. Together, these three portfolio changes are examples of how we are actively managing our mix of businesses to capitalize on our competitive advantages and say close to our proven business model of offering platformed analytic solutions and unique analytic objects. These moves position Verisk for continued long-term sustainable growth and improving returns on capital.","On the strategic acquisition front, in December, we acquired FAST, a leading SaaS company for the life Insurance and annuity industry. FAST offers a modular flexible policy administration system that allows Life Insurance companies to modernize legacy systems and stages and without a large upfront capital commitment. It also provides a channel for Verisk to deliver our new analytic objects to the Life Insurance industry. Adding FAST to the Verisk portfolio is a strong step forward as we make advances into the Life Insurance market. The software intensity of our overall business has increased over the years and we are excited about the opportunity for FAST software to deliver our analytics and embed more deeply into Life Insurance customers workflows. I'm pleased with the early steps towards integration with FAST.","Another key strategic initiative for Verisk is our journey to migrate to the cloud. What we refer to internally as cloud first. We have made significant progress on this campaign and are poised to keep the momentum going. When we first started this journey in earnest two years ago, we saw customer feedback and listen carefully to their concerns. Today, in all of my discussions with CEOs of our customers across all of our verticals, there is full support of our migration to the cloud as our customers realize the benefits of Verisks faster pace of innovation and our ability to enter new geographies more quickly. Erik Schneider, our Chief Technology Officer, will discuss with you in more detail, our cloud migration and broader technology strategy.","2019 was also a milestone year for our ESG objectives. We became a participant in the UN Global Compact, the world's largest sustainability initiative, which encourages companies to align their operations and strategies around universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environments and anti-corruption. We view participation as an extension of the vision and principles represented by our Verisk way and an appropriate calling card as our business grows and embraces all geographies, cultures and people.","Several Verisk businesses work with UN sponsored initiatives addressing human rights and climate weather issues by contributing data analytics professional insight and scientific expertise. Additionally, the Global Compact distinguishes Verisk with customers and prospects and sets an example for our suppliers and business partners. On the environmental front, we again reported for the carbon disclosure project, or CDP. And for the second consecutive year, we balanced 100% of our reported scope 1, and scope 2 emissions and scope 3 business air travel with the purchase of energy attribute certificates and carbon offsets. We're committed to reducing our emissions and have continued to do so through office consolidations, building improvements and greater data processing efficiency.","In the fourth quarter, we named Pat McLaughlin, as our Chief Sustainability Officer, our first for Verisk, reporting directly to me. Pat and I have worked together for nearly 20 years, and in that time, Pat, led a major business unit for us. His depth with the company gives him intimate knowledge of who we are, and what we value? And so in 2014, I asked, Pat, to work with leadership and employees across Verisk to build a framework for understanding and addressing our impact on society, including the environment. He is championing sustainability efforts across our operations and advancing initiatives for measuring and reporting Verisk in the context of sustainability.","I would also like to publicly welcome Laura Ipsen to our Board of Directors. Laura, joined us at the end of 2019, and brings with her more than 25 years of experience working as a technology executive at Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle, yielding a deep knowledge of the cloud, artificial intelligence and SaaS business models. Laura becomes the fourth woman serving on Verisks Board of Directors and also our fourth new Director in the past five years.","Finally, I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved an 8% increase in our cash dividend to $0.27 per share this quarter and has also increased our share repurchase authorization by $500 million. These actions underscore confidence in the stability of our business, its profitability and its cash flows. Our core position within our three verticals is sound. And we are confident in our ability to deliver on our strategies to drive long-term shareholder value as we focus on serving our customers while also investing in market-leading innovation and our people.","So with that, let me turn it over to Eric to provide some insight into our technology strategy.","Eric Schneider","Thank you, Scott. Technology is mission-critical to our business. And as such, we are continually working to optimize our technology environment and are always striving to be best-in-class. Working in partnership with our business units, we have identified four strategic areas of equal importance dedicating much of our focus energy to them as we believe these are the areas most impactful for driving growth and efficiency in our business. The four areas are: First, Data Stewardship; second, Analytics; third, our Cloud First strategy that Scott referenced; and fourth, our people. I'd like to take a few minutes to describe each of these and what we are doing.","Let me start with data stewardship. One of our key distinctives is our unique data assets as data is the core of everything we do. Within this area of strategic focus, we are advancing how we protect data, how we acquire new data assets, and how we process data more efficiently. Our relentless focus on data stewardship continuously increases the usefulness of our data and analytics for our customers. To reach the next level, we recently added the role of Chief Data Officer in each of our industry verticals. This role is responsible for driving our data agenda together our three Chief Data officers are sharing best practices across verticals to amplify the value of our data.","More specifically, the Chief Data Officers are identifying new and valuable data assets, making our assets more usable, improving and unifying data stewardship, modernizing our data processing pipelines, and standardizing data governance across the enterprise. For example, they champion the standardization and adoption of data protection methods like tokenization for sensitive information across our broad portfolio of products. For new data sets, our Chief Data Officers discover and align both internal and partner data for valuable business applications. They are leading with cloud-based architectures to speed up data processing times for faster consumption by our customers. And finally, they continuously add higher quality data assets with more coverage, actively improve data quality and use cutting edge techniques like artificial intelligence and machine learning to link our data assets. Improved data assets, with strong governance form the basis of our Analytics portfolio, which I would like to speak about next.","On the Analytics front, we are pushing the envelope by bringing advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to solve the business challenges facing our customers. We successfully partnered with regulators to enable the uses of machine learning techniques to improve analytical outcomes. We are developing novel methods to leverage unstructured data sets such as images and audio in conjunction with our already differentiated structured data assets to further improve their value. Our AI and machine learning center of excellence, together with our business units, leverage our University partnerships to bring research and advanced techniques quickly and efficiently into our solutions for our customers. Our team is focused on accelerating our innovation process and leverage our Analytics platform to explore scores of ideas through quick proof-of-concepts such that we are focusing our energies on ideas that quickly gain market traction.","Now let's turn to our cloud first strategy. We are well underway on our journey to the cloud. We are multi-cloud enabled and have workloads running in all leading cloud providers. Approximately one-third of our computing environment is currently running in the cloud. Our multi-cloud strategy aligns our migration approach with our customer requirements when and where necessary and the pace of our migration continues to meet our customers' expectations. We are leading the migration via our centralized cloud center of excellence, which is offering advanced capabilities to our businesses in the areas of cloud architecture, financial management, security, operations and training. Each of our businesses in all three verticals actively engage and work closely with our Center of Excellence to ensure a secure, timely and cost effective migration takes place.","A significant benefit of our move to the cloud is our ability to reduce and forecast our compute costs. In the cloud, our unit costs are reduced and are linear, in lockstep with our utilization of cloud services. We are taking advantage of near infinite compute capacity by flexing and contracting in direct response to demand by both scaling horizontally for peak periods and contracting turning environments off when not needed. Let me share an example of an environment, we have moved from on-premise data centers to the cloud and the benefits we are realizing. Our Telematics platform, which houses over 100 billion miles of driving data has been completely re-architected to enhance the quality and timeliness of the analytic provided to our customers. By moving to the cloud, we have reduced processing cycle time, while at the same time reducing cost. Offering an overall improved experience for our customers or our telematic solutions. As we move forward, we will incur transitional costs associated with re-architecting and optimizing our solutions to best benefit from cloud platforms.","Fourth and perhaps most importantly is our people. Our talent access is superior globally and we continue to build and attract world-class talent in both our data science and cloud disciplines. Data scientists and cloud architects want to work with us, because we have some of the most interesting business problems to solve and we are doing so in the cloud. Our data science excellence program is an immersive four-plus year rotational training program that brings the brightest talent from top schools to Verisk and exposes them to our customers' business challenges as meaningful contributors to our Analytic teams. And from a cloud perspective, we are advancing the cloud skills of our people. Our teams have obtained hundreds of cloud certifications and we plan to double that number in 2020. In addition, we have augmented our internal teams by attracting experienced cloud professionals in the areas of cloud architecture, security and development operations. We continue to invest and optimize in all four of these strategic initiatives and are confident in the value they are bringing to our people to our customers and to Verisk overall.","Now, let me turn the call over to Lee, who will provide an update on our financials.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Eric. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 10.2% to $677 million. Net income decreased 9.6% to $132 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share decreased 8% to $0.80 for the fourth quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decrease in GAAP net income and EPS is primarily the result of acquisition-related earn-out expenses of $28 million, as many of our acquisitions are on target to achieve payments for strong performance. In addition, a higher effective tax rate due primarily to higher option exercises in the prior year period related to expiring options associated with our IPO 10 years ago reduced net income and EPS in the quarter.","Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we believe that our operating performance remains solid. On an organic constant currency basis and including the impact of the injunction, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 5.4% for the fourth quarter of 2019. Growth was led by the Energy and Specialized Markets segment, which was our fastest growing segment for the second consecutive quarter. Insurance also delivered solid growth, while Financial Services results were stable. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 9%, reflecting leverage from organic growth across all three segments.","Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 47.1% flat with the prior year period, including substantial investment. This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenues and adjusted EBITDA. Normalizing for the revenue impact of the injunction, organic constant currency revenue grew 6.3%; organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA, increased 11%; and total adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 47.5%. Moreover on an organic basis, and particularly on the pre-investment organic basis that we've discussed before, we saw margin expansion in all three of our segments demonstrating the exceptional operating leverage at the core of our businesses.","On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 5.2% revenue growth, while adjusted EBITDA increased 6.6% for the quarter. Normalizing for the impact of the injunction, Insurance would have achieved 6.5% organic constant currency revenue growth, and 9.1% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, demonstrating margin expansion, while also investing for future growth. Within our underwriting and rating business, organic constant currency revenue growth accelerated to 8.2%, and was very broad-based across our solution sets in personal lines and commercial lines. We saw healthy growth in our industry-standard Insurance programs, LightSpeed suite of products, property-specific underwriting and catastrophe modeling solutions revenue. We also had positive contributions from our international business.","Within claims, organic constant currency revenues declined 1%, primarily driven by the injunction. Normalizing for the impact from the injunction, claims delivered 2.9% organic constant currency revenue growth held back by fewer severe weather events this year as compared to last year, reducing transactional revenue growth. However, our claim subscription revenues continue to see solid growth and were primarily driven by claims analytics and repair cost estimating solutions. Insurance adjusted EBITDA margin was 53% for the quarter, flat with the prior year period. Normalizing for the impact from the injunction, the Insurance segment adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 53.5%, reflecting leverage from the organic growth offset in part by continued investment.","Energy and Specialized Markets delivered revenue growth of 7.1% for the quarter, driven by particularly strong sales of our market and cost intelligence solutions and core research revenues, as well as contributions from our chemicals, solutions and the energy transition practice. We also had positive contributions from environmental health and safety and weather and climate analytics revenues. Energy and Specialized Markets adjusted EBITDA increased 23.8% reflecting leverage on strong sales balanced with ongoing investments in breakout opportunities, including our Lens platform, chemicals and the energy transition practice. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 32% from 30.8%.","Financial Services revenue grew 2.1% in the quarter led by growth in fraud and credit risk management solutions as well as portfolio management solutions. This was offset in part by declines in enterprise data management revenues. As Scott discussed, we have decided to transition our data hosting operations to a partner, which will better position this segment for more predictable, sustainable growth. As evidence, the Financial Services segment would have delivered revenue growth of 7% in the quarter without the impact of the Argus Data Warehousing business. Financial Services segment adjusted EBITDA increased 6.2% and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 40.3% from 37.9% reflecting strong cost discipline.","Our reported effective tax rate was 23.2% for the quarter compared to 18.6% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of a higher level of option exercise in the prior year period. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 20.9%, which was in line with our targeted range. For 2020, we expect our tax rate to be between 19% and 21%. So there will be likely some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises, which depends in part on the Verisk stock price and employee personal decisions.","Adjusted net income was $188 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.13 for the fourth quarter of 2019, up 8.7% from the prior year. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and lower average share count. These increases were offset in part by higher depreciation and amortization, increased interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. Net cash provided by operating activities was $176 million for the quarter, up 1.7% from the prior-year period, reflecting primarily a higher effective tax rate due to the option exercises in 2018 mentioned earlier.","Capital expenditures were $64 million for the quarter, down 16.3% from the prior-year period, primarily the result of reduced capital expenditure at Geomni. CapEx represented 9.5% of total revenue in the quarter. As we look to 2020, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million. Included in this number are one-time expenditures of approximately $35 million related to the consolidation of office space that we have planned in two key cities London and Boston. We are excited about the long-term benefits of having our business units and people together under one roof.","Relating this to CapEx, we expect fixed asset, depreciation and amortization to be within a range of $170 million to $180 million in comparison to the $186 million for 2019. Depreciation and amortization should be lower year-over-year helped by the sale of our imagery sourcing group, including the planes and sensors to Vexcel. We expect intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2020 in comparison to $138 million in 2019. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and completion of projects and future M&A activity. Free cash flow was $112 million for the quarter, an increase of 16% from the prior-year period primarily due to lower capital expenditures.","During the fourth quarter, we returned $141 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 700,000 shares at a weighted average price of $145.07, for a total cost of $100 million. At December 31st 2019, we had $128 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We remain committed to ongoing capital return to shareholders, and as Scott mentioned we are pleased that Verisk's Board of Directors approved an additional authorization of $500 million for share repurchases as well as an 8% increase in our cash dividend to $0.27 per share this quarter. As Scott mentioned, we have recently engaged in a series of transactions that focus our portfolio of businesses to fully capitalize on our key distinctives and our core competitive advantages. Each of these transactions is unique in its structure, but share the motivation of active capital discipline and achieving more predictable long-term growth at Verisk.","Before I conclude and looking ahead to the first quarter, I want to inform you of a timing shift in expenses between the first and second quarters that will impact our reported financial results. The company recently changed the timing of the grant of long-term incentive compensation into the first quarter from the second quarter previously. This timing change aligns Verisk with a greater market and more closely times employee compensation with calendar year results. The resulting impact will be increased expense of $10 million in the first quarter related to long-term incentive compensation, but that will reverse to a benefit in the second quarter.","We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and remain focused on long-term profitable growth and solid returns on capital. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long-term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts that we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.","And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. You may ask your question.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning. My question is around the cloud first strategy. So just kind of a two-parter. So one, Scott, when you referenced you were talking to your customers and they are supportive of your move. Other customers also sort of in this cloud move and are ready to adopt it, or will there be a transition period of duplicate cost in order to serve the customer better. And then Lee. I was just hoping you could put some financial parameters around it, like how much of spend, savings, et cetera, we might start thinking about?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. So I'll start with that, Manav, good morning. Our customers are in various stages of considering how they're going to manage their own technical infrastructure. I would say in general, that our company has moved faster, probably considerably faster in modifying our compute environment relative to our customers. But it doesn't really create an added burden for our customers or put more cost into the system as we work with them. In fact, if anything, the interface between us and the customer becomes a little bit easier to manage. So there is no systemic increase in cost. We -- obviously, as we've talked many times, we are adding the cloud dimension to our business even as we are working to retire the premise dimension of our business. The premise dimension comes off sort of in shelves, the cloud, it sort of grows in a linear fashion as Eric said before. But we've absorbed all that into our P&L and are just -- we continue to head in the same direction at the same pace. And so it all feels very organic. With customers; it's really nothing, but good for customers. And it doesn't add an additional burden for them.","And Lee, I don't know, if you want to just talk a little bit more about the specifics.","Lee Shavel","Sure. And Manav, thanks for the question. I appreciate that. Very simply, we aren't providing an estimate of the cost savings for a couple reasons; one is that this is a multi-year project as we are rolling out these transitions across many data sets, many individual businesses. And while we're tracking it on each of those bases, and we look at each of those situations as test cases, where we can see the savings, we can see the return on capital for the investments that we're making because of the rolling impact of us achieving some savings, investing in the transition over time. We don't want to create a fixed benchmark. I think from our perspective, our view is that, this activity will generate both operational improvements, in terms of lower OpEx relative to this function.","And so there will be a margin benefit that supports our overall margin improvement objectives as well as EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth as well as capital efficiencies that will boost our return over time. But given that it is deeply embedded within our businesses and something that we're managing as part of their full technology spend, it's not something that at an aggregate level we are going to provide that full estimates for that reason. But we absolutely have seen those benefits in the projects that we have executed within specific data sets in the businesses and we will expect that to kind of roll forward as we prosecute this initiative overtime.","Stacey Brodbar","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. You may ask your question.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, Lee, it's a margin question. So the fourth quarter 2019 reported EBITDA margins were flat year-over-year, that's reported, that's including past acquisitions, as well as the drag from the roof report injunction. You were good to say how much that drag from the roof report injunction is? And also we're seeing the operating leverage coming from the breakout initiatives at the core. So as such, is Verisk positioned to see 2020 reported EBITDA margins to be flattish to perhaps leaning forward?","Lee Shavel","Yes. So, thank you, Andrew. I appreciate the question and the consistent focus on margin. We bring the same discipline in looking at our overall business. So I appreciate the fact that what you've recognized is at the core, we are generating very strong and consistent operating leverage in the businesses on a pre-investment basis. So in the fourth quarter, we did see that margin expansion for all of our core businesses before the impact of our breakouts, which include Geomni as well as the impact from our acquisitions. And so we -- it certainly shouldn't come as a surprise that Geomni was a significant impact in terms of investment in the fourth quarter of 2019, as it was in for the year as a whole. And so that element will certainly benefit from the transaction with Vexcel. So at least that component in 2020 should have a substantially reduced impact overall on margins, but that's balanced then again, of course, the ongoing investment in our businesses that we make on a return basis as well as the impact from acquisitions. Our long-term objective continues to be to generate EBITDA growth in excess of revenue growth on an organic basis and to improve that margin over time. And I think going into 2020, we feel as confident as ever in our ability to achieve that.","Andrew Steinerman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. Scott, just thinking about your strategy of getting out of the data collection in aerial imagery and also the data hosting business in Argus, it doesn't sound like your view on the value of data has changed. But maybe just some tangential ways of how you get the data? And what you do with it is slightly changing? And so I just wanted to understand like does the new partnership around that Argus Data Warehouse change anything with regard to the ownership of the data? And just how you're thinking of that? And then, Lee, if you could give some additional color on the financial impacts like the net cost savings from the Vexcel transaction? And how much revenue in total will be reduced by other portfolio actions? Thank you.","Scott Stephenson","Yes. Thanks, Toni. So, first of all, our view of the value unique data assets is completely unchanged. And actually if anything, I think going forward unique data assets actually will be even probably more rare, not that we feel that there is any, there will be -- we will take any step back, in terms of the volume, or the value of the data that we've got. So our view of that as a part of our business is completely unchanged. Data remains the oxygen in our bloodstream and it always will. So the two changes that we made; first of all, what I would really like to emphasize around the Vexcel transaction is, that we actually put ourselves in position to have an even better dataset. Vexcel was -- as we've already described, already engaged in data capture. There are also one of the globe's leading providers of sensor technology. And so putting together our image capture process with their methods and some of the commitments they already had to creating this image library. We actually have access. We will have access and we have access to a better set of images than we had before and that substantially improved economics. So it's merely about how do we get to the data, not, are we interested in the data.","And with the move with the Argus Data Warehouse, that's a little bit different, because the Argus Data Warehouse was not about our gathering of data from customers. It was really customers who would observed our facility with dealing with their data and they said, can you essentially white label your way of managing data to me. And we said, yes, as another benefit for our customers. And what happened over time is, this whole space of hosting data warehouses in particularly cloud-enabled has just sort of exploded over the last several years. And it was never founded -- the ADW [ph] work was never founded upon, providing us a data source which we then translate through our analytics. It was really more of an accommodation for our customers in their own workflows. So there's really no change in terms -- well, there is zero change, in terms of our access to data in the Financial segment. So, we view data as we always have. We have as much or better access to data than we used to and our economics have improved as a result of these changes that we made.","Lee, anything you could add to that?","Lee Shavel","Yes. Toni, to give you some sense that from a financial impact standpoint, I understand, you want to get a sense from a revenue perspective, that we would kind of roughly estimate approximately on -- in the fourth quarter there were approximately $8 million of revenues associated with the image capture business that will be moving to Vexcel. So that gives you kind of some sense of the scale. From an EBITDA standpoint there is not a material impact from the impact of those revenues. So kind of roughly equivalent level of EBITDA expense associated with that. But on a year-over-year basis, we are expecting the benefit of eliminating the costs associated with the individuals and the flight operations associated with that image capture business that we will no longer continue to bear, even though we will continue to have access to all of that data on very preferential terms looking ahead. So, it will clearly be a benefit to us from an EBITDA perspective.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of Bank of America. You may ask your question.","Gary Bisbee","Yes, thanks. Good morning guys. I wanted to ask just a bit more about the margins in the quarter. So a quarter ago, you'd talked about in the loss of revenue from the injunction not having enough time to really get at or reduce those costs, and yet the Insurance margin was quite strong. So obviously, you're able to get rid of a bunch of that cost. And on the energy business, we'd also thought there would be -- maybe more of a drag than it appeared there was from the Genscape deal that I think you on for a couple of months in the quarter. So just help us think about as we think moving into Q1 and moving forward, what the dilution from Genscape is, and what -- how we think about the Geomni lost sales and the impact of that all in with Vexcel? Thank you.","Lee Shavel","Yes. Thank you, Gary. So a lot of elements, I'm here, so let me try to give you a couple of components of that. So I think the statement that we made in the third quarter with regard to not being able to make substantial headway on the expense for Geomni in the fourth quarter is accurate kind of specific to the overall entity within our GAAP results. Naturally, the Vexcel transaction will be moving a substantial part of that expense, not all of it, we will have operating expenses associated with our analytics component of that business that will be retained. But in excess of the majority of the expenses will move out of the business. But the margin uplift with Insurance really wasn't driven by cost savings within Geomni. I think it was just the natural operating leverage within the business as a whole.","And specific to the energy and specialized markets discussion there our market and cost intelligence business and the strong growth that we experienced within that business as well as cost discipline at Wood MacKenzie was really the primary contributor to the margin expansion within that business and for the business as a whole. And so there we are benefiting from a very strong growth in that product and relatively low associated expansion within that. So I think that is when we look at that margin strength there were certainly some component of it within Insurance. But a lot of that benefit came from those activities. So as I mentioned with regard to Andrews comments, I think all of those effects we think will put us in a very good position to continue to work towards that margin expansion objective that we have over the long-term in 2020.","Gary Bisbee","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. Thank you. Historically you guys have not talked a whole lot about your commercial sales organization on calls. Maybe just give us an update, is that an opportunity, how do you measure sales force productivity? And any changes to incentives maybe that you've made there, or haven't made as you look forward the growth. It seems like you're doing a lot of acquisitions around software due to sort of penetrate customers, but any thoughts as to adding salespeople and going after more revenue? Thank you.","Scott Stephenson","Yes. So obviously, an important dimension of our business across all the verticals we take a three-tier approach to selling. So we have account representation where -- we have people who are owning our end-to-end relationship with our customer. Then we have product specialists, whether they be data analytic solutions or software solutions. Almost everything that we do is very technical. And so we do need people who are focused on specific parts of our product suite to go in, present credentials, work on issues of integration, et cetera. And then thirdly, we have inside sales to help us cover what -- in some cases is the fairly long tail of smaller customers inside of our market spaces. Generally, we find it a good use of money to expand our go-to-market team and we're always looking to do that. And the only other thing, I would say and this ties a little bit to the point that Lee, was just on, as we make acquisitions, which are inside of verticals that we're already serving one of the things we think hard about is, how are we going to integrate the two. And I will say by the way that, that we had ambitious plans for Genscape integration and the team has met all of their marks. And so it's gone very, very well. But one of the places where we're fairly slow to take any cost out actually is with respect to market representation.","So as we say integrate something that we acquired, we actually want to hold on to the go-to-market resources as much as, as we possibly can. And then we're always asking the question would more be helpful. I mean, in general, I would just say that, I've really been pleased and impressed with what our teams accomplished in 2019, in terms of building our book of business. So, yes, it's always on our mind. We've always had the same structure. We always lean into more investment in that area when it makes sense.","Hamzah Mazari","Thank you.","Stacey Brodbar","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. You may ask your question.","Jeff Meuler","Yes. Thank you. With the preface that I fully recognize the importance of data and analytics as a source of value into solutions. Scott, I would love kind of your perspective on where you draw the lines or what types of software solutions you expect to provide. So just talking about the increased software intensity, the Life Insurance software acquisition and some other software acquisitions you've done. But you also continue to partner with the likes of Guidewire, and I think there was a relatively recent announcement with Duck Creek. So what types of software solutions do you expect to provide? Where do you look to partner? Do you increasingly compete against some of those vertical software providers over time? Thanks.","Scott Stephenson","Yes. No, it's a good question, and it does relate to the fabric of our company. So bottom line for me is, that I would only want to see us in software businesses that have the potential to yield data assets that we can use and reuse for analytic purposes. That's really sort of the bottom line. So there are core transaction processing platforms that tend to exist in all the verticals that we serve. And to the extent that those particular platforms are unlikely to yield any sort of data rights, then it's just less likely to be of interest to us. That's the first dimension of it. And the second, sort of relates to the first. And that is, what we're really interested in is what we call platformed analytic environments. So we want to be the place where somebody who is trying to make a decision goes. They go in the morning and they stay there much if not all of the day. That's our ambition. That's where we want to be. Almost by definition, if that's the nature of the software you're providing, then you are close to the datasets. So, that's really the distinction that I would trace for you here.","Jeff Meuler","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi, good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. When I think about a few call out drivers that you discussed in Insurance, I'm thinking about the opportunities in life and InsurTech, which sounds pretty robust as well as the UK, which I think it was mentioned, Lee, I think you mentioned has been pretty strong. Can you over the next few years, perhaps quantify or dimensionalize how those may bend the growth curve in your Insurance business?","Lee Shavel","Sure. So, I'm going to -- I'll take a first cut at it. And I'm sure Mark can provide some broader perspective on it. So, I think, as it relates to the InsurTech dimension, our view is that it contributes to incremental growth across two dimensions; one is that we have a group of new clients that we are serving in a traditional context with our industry-standard products and other data sets. But the other dimension is that they are bringing innovation, new ways of doing things that is putting more of the focus around our traditional customers to utilize data more intensively than they may have in the past. And that is creating new opportunities for us to develop products to support their needs. And our LightSpeed suite of products is probably a perfect example of that dynamic. And so it is -- I would describe it one level as accelerating the demand and the expansion of analytic objects in demand for platform analytics that has enabled our underwriting and rating business to generate levels of growth as you've seen in this quarter and that probably wouldn't have been expected two years or three years ago. So I think that's one dimension of it. And we've spent a lot of time thinking about the life opportunity, and I'll hand it over to Mark to describe how we see that opportunity influencing and providing incremental growth for us.","Mark Anquillare","So let me basically say it this way, I think, there's two types of InsurTech's. One is, I'm an insurer or probably a managing general agent on underwriting business or at least trying to find business. There what they are looking for is to get into business fast and automate. And that drive towards automation, drive towards technology has been a wonderful opportunity for us. And we have had some great sales there and it is accelerated growth across all of Insurance. There's also InsurTech, but they're trying to do some technology around data and information, and although probably on the outskirts could be competitive over time. So we certainly keep track of them.","I guess the theme that I'll bring out, which kind of may tie together a couple of questions is, our customers are interested in content, that's King. But at the same time, they're pushing towards automation. They want is seamless ecosystem. So they can tap into any data, or any solution, whether it's their own or third-party. And they expect through a series of APIs and micro services to be able to consume that information or consume that application in a very seamless way. And I think that is a large part of why we're thinking that the fast acquisition will help us quite a bit. It is that light touch, quick implementation, low upfront cost, that life insurers are looking for. And we see the same thing, probably P&C is a little bit of ahead from an analytics perspective, but we see the same thing for our P&C customer. So, hopefully that provides a little broader color.","Andrew Jeffrey","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Your pace of M&A activity has picked up in recent quarters, particularly with the acquisition of Genscape. When you had a similar level of M&A activity in 2018, EBITDA margins did contract by about 100 bps. So diving deeper into margins in the year ahead, can you discuss how the margin profile Genscape compares to your earlier acquisitions particularly ones being integrated in 2018. And if you intend to change your pace of investment activity in the breakout opportunities this year ahead versus earlier years? Thank you.","Lee Shavel","Yes. Thanks, George. So whenever we talk about the margin impact, I wanted to kind of start with the fact that the important thing for all of our businesses is that they have fundamental operating leverage that allows us to deliver on EBITDA growth in excess of revenue growth, because we think that's the fundamental value creation driver for that business. And so we look at each of those businesses and every business has a different margin dynamic, but we want to make certain that, that dynamic is present, and we have the ability to improve upon that over time.","So when we are looking at acquisitions, George, we are fundamentally making a capital decision and a growth decision, in terms of, is this going to be a good use of capital. Can we generate a good return on the business? And what we can do to enhance it? And beneath that is their operating leverage that will allow us to continue to generate that EBITDA growth over time. And so when we talk about our organic constant currency revenue growth, yes, we are making that adjustment, so that we see that dynamic across our business as a whole. We tend not to be overly focused on the portfolio impact of the acquisitions because if it is a good return acquisition and it has operating leverage, then it will allow us to generate that EBITDA growth over time.","And I think talking about it in individual acquisition like Genscape, which is going to come in at a lower margin than the rest of the business, that will naturally have a portfolio impact. But what we can -- we hope to generate with that business and its association with Wood McKenzie and generating incremental returns and incremental margins should really drive what we're focused on, which is that EBITDA expansion ahead of revenue growth. So, I know that isn't a complete answer to your question, but philosophically, I think it's important to understand that's the way we think about those acquisitions and their contribution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thanks. Lee, you talked about kind of three different portfolio transactions in the area of Financial Services and Insurance. Can you give us kind of the overall revenue and margin impact from those dispositions?","Lee Shavel","So, I think, I gave the impact from the Vexcel -- from the Vexcel transaction. So I -- and the other, the other ones, I think, we can deal with in a follow-up call, they're not that material overall to the business, I think the $8 million is really the bulk of it. So we can probably find -- we can fine tune that with you offline, separately, but it's the Geomni Vexcel transaction that would have the more significant impact. The rest are less significant.","Kevin McVeigh","Super. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. Just wanted to step back and kind of look at your portfolio of assets. You did some pruning, I think over the past quarter or so. Is there anything else left to divest. And then also did you see synergies between your three major verticals? Obviously, within Insurance, there's a lot, but I'm just wondering across synergies with the other verticals? Thanks.","Scott Stephenson","So we're always looking at the mix of assets we've got. But I would say that, I think we have done a fair amount of -- the kind of work that was expressed in those three moves. We'll always keep our eyes open, but there is nothing major, which is imminent. To your question about synergies across the verticals, we have re-purposed energy data into the Insurance vertical. We're looking at opportunities to tie together observations from retail banking with consumer forms of Insurance. So that work is always going on in the background. But the thing I would really highlight for you is, all of the technical work that Eric described before. This is the kind of work where it would be more burdensome for any one of our verticals or even a business unit inside of a vertical to take it on, on their own, because these are pretty large expenditures. And if you're going to do it right, you have to really commit to these things. Eric, talked about the work you have to do to transition to the cloud, or to create a data fabric inside of the platform data environment that we provide to all parts of Verisk.","And not only does doing this work excellently in the center, provide acceleration to each of the businesses inside of each of the verticals, but it really represents a very cost efficient way of doing it as well. And so that is \u2013 that's actually to me one of the large major points of logic as to why we should be in multiple verticals. And another one is, all of what we do in these verticals, and not every vertical has this quality, but all the verticals that we're in, the opportunity for unique, differentiated data assets exists. And that's not true in a lot of verticals, but it is true in the places where we do business.","Lee Shavel","Okay. I would add as a case in point. We often -- you get questions about the relevance in of the Financial Services business. And as we've talked about the deal with a dataset that is in order of magnitude, if not more larger than many of our other businesses, but the expertise that we have developed in cloud technology and data analytics within that business generates a return on intellectual capital that we have leveraged in our Lens platform within the Insurance business as we're implementing that cloud technology and probably wouldn't be as effective in bringing those efficiencies and advantages, if we hadn't been dealing with that dataset and with that level of expertise. And so I think it's a great kind of case in point how we leverage that.","Mark Anquillare","Yes. I'll just -- I don't want to answer too many times. But case in point is inside the London Insurance market. The expertise and technology associated with the Verisk Financial Services assets were combined with kind of ISO expertise to build a platform there that has been kind of changing some of the London market transaction processing. So it'll be very effective.","Stacey Brodbar","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ashish Sabadra","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So quick question on Claims. Even excluding injunction, it was a bit soft because of the fewer other events. I was just wondering, if you can provide any color on how much of the revenues generated from these other events? And as we think about going forward should we see this business re-accelerate given the stability of the subscription business? Thanks.","Mark Anquillare","So, this is Mark. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, I want to start with the Insurance business as a whole was very strong. We think of it as a portfolio and we're very pleased with the interaction with customers and where we've progressed. Specifically to Claims, I think there's three things that we've seen over the course of a little longer term and clearly short-term. One, I think we've talked about some of the extensions we've had really on the claims fraud or claims fraud detection side of the world related to outside of P&C health companies and like, where we've brought some kind of -- some big customers in and that has kind of rolled off. But more specifically as it relates to the fourth quarter, clearly the injunction affected us. We weren't able to deliver the growth that we've been delivering inside of Geomni, that was a negative.","And the other thing that was clearly changed or different in the fourth quarter of 2019 relative to 2018 was a relatively modest set of storms. There was a very quiet storm season. This isn't about catastrophes. This is just severe weather throughout the nation that had quite a bit of impact on what I'll refer to as the Claims business. So those two things. We're kind of the anomalies in the quarter. I will reinforce the underlying business, the underlying economics remain very strong. Customer engagement very strong. And I think the mission we're on with regard to automation and automating claim adjusting is kind of the theme inside the industry. So we remain optimistic.","Scott Stephenson","And Mark, let's just clarify real quick. When you talk about the effect of the health insurers coming into our ClaimSearch platform and you referred to as rolling off, what you meant was it provided -- it's not that they went away\u2026","Mark Anquillare","They certainly didn't.","Scott Stephenson","They're still in the process as much as they ever worked.","Mark Anquillare","The grow-over\u2026","Scott Stephenson","Right. It represented growth in 2018 and into 2019. But now they're in, and there's all that we have.","Stacey Brodbar","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. You may ask your question.","Greg Peters","Good morning, and thank you for fitting me in. The large Insurance brokers seem to be pushing data analytics as a growth area for their business. Can you tell us, how you're working with them, or should we view their strategies is potentially encroaching on your business. They've also reported good organic revenue growth and it's in part due to the strong pricing environment and commercial lines. Can you talk to us about how your business is affected by pricing trends in commercial lines Insurance? And then finally on LightSpeed, can you give us an idea of the size of that business. I've been struggling to identify actual customers and our channel checks, but that doesn't mean, I'm looking in the right place. So any help there would be appreciated.","Scott Stephenson","Well, you managed to get three questions in there at least.","Mark Anquillare","I don't know. I think counted four.","Scott Stephenson","I'll just take -- Mark, why don't you and I do this together? I'll just take the first part of that, which is the question about the brokers. So the brokers and we really do not have a lot of overlap. The brokers from time-to-time to attempt to put together some forms of data analytics, in order to try to add value inside of their customer relationships. But fundamentally they -- they're much more of a service-oriented kind of a business. We license subscription solutions to our customers. And the brokers touch a good number of situations and they have the data associated with the transactions that they're engaged in. But those datasets are really not overlapping of the datasets that we have got. And so, I mean, it's a practical matter out in the marketplace. We just don't compete with the brokers, and nor do I think, we will compete with the brokers. They're just a fundamentally separate kind of an environment.","And in fact, they operate as customers because particularly our catastrophe modeling solutions are made available to them as well as to others. So, yes, you know, if I was running one of the major brokerages, actually, if I was running almost any business in the world, I would try to make it more data analytic, as a way of trying to achieve advantage. And that's what they're working on. But I don't, their business model and ours is very different basically, and I think will remain. So, Mark, you want to take on those other points?","Mark Anquillare","Yes. And I'll just add to yours. I think from a brokering theme perspective, clearly, they're looking to differentiate themselves that they are providing analytics. I think most of that analytics, at least, the way we've seen it, is sold into and provided to the corporate customer, where we're more on the insurer side of that.","I think your second question was around pricing and pricing impact. So commercial line's hardening market, if you will. I think the short answer is that, if our customers are growing quicker, there is more opportunity to focus on top line, focus on dancing and potentially purchasing new solutions to foster that growth. So, I think it's a friendly environment when everyone is growing and it's probably more opportunities to buy new solutions or extend them. We do have this wonderful solution inside of underwriting and rating our ISO business. When it is a difficult period or it's a soft market, people have to go back to the actuarial fundamentals. They have to go to fundamentals around how I underwrite because they want to be profitable. So clearly that supports our business as well, but I think everyone is in a better shape with a high tide floating all boats.","Last question, I think, it was around LightSpeed. Let me say it this way. The way we've packaged up LightSpeed is, we are trying to take and in the world of Insurance, I'll use personal automobile, you can get online and you can get a quote pretty quickly. But what typically happens is after you get that quote, people then run all the different reports to get information about you, whether you're in an accident, whether you're impacting history, less accidents. And all of that motor vehicle record data, all that costs money. So they then run that information and they more or less changed price in about 35% of the cases. That's a customer-unfriendly way to go. So we are pushing this data forward strategy. We are trying to move to point of sale, so there is no separation between buying a quote that is more attractive for consumer. And we are very uniquely positioned in the commercial lines market because of the data and information we have, more so than even in personal lines. And that strategy, that approach has been gaining quite a bit of receptivity among major customers both large ones and those InsurTechs we're talking about.","So, when we talked about LightSpeed, it's a package of solutions and products and many, many insurers are buying pieces, and a few very large ones have signed up for what I'll call the full package. So that has definitely been contributing to growth inside of our underwriting and rating business.","Scott Stephenson","When customers use it, Mark, I just -- I would think a lot of them actually identify with Verisk rather than saying, \"Oh, that's Touchstone,\" because it's a whole series of services.","Mark Anquillare","Yes. [Indiscernible].","Scott Stephenson","And we tie them together as Touchstone, but I think the customers are relating to the overall brand Verisk.","Greg Peters","Thank you for your answers.","Scott Stephenson","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Bill Warmington","Good morning. And the question I had was to see, if we could get an update on the new product pipeline specifically around loan verifier, also some of the Life Insurance underwriting products? And then maybe also, if you could comment on, how you plan on leveraging some of the unstructured datasets, audio and images that Eric mentioned in his comments?","Scott Stephenson","Why don't you take those on, Mark?","Mark Anquillare","Sure. So let me kind of walk through those. I think you were talking about loan verifier. You were talking about Life Insurance and some unstructured data. So let me start with the final two, because in some ways they're connected. So Life Insurance, we think provides a pretty big opportunity for us. We do have some solutions already available. So think about our catastrophe modeling, what we refer to as extreme event modeling. We do work along longevity models, mortality shock model. Think of pandemic, coronavirus, we do that type of work and that fits into some of the Life Insurance models that are necessary and interested. What we're also doing is, we're doing work around model that it relates to specific underwriting decisions. So that is around partnerships with the medical inspection bureau, which represents a group inside of life around, I'll call it, physicals and health. We've done some work around electronic healthcare records and doing some analytics there. The two analytics that you're most focused on, we have done some work around tobacco. We've done some work around avocation. If you're kind of like the skydiving, that doesn't make you the best risk. And kind of combining some of the technology that Eric and his team were talking about with some of the specialists we have from an Insurance perspective, we have used some voice recognition technology, which allows us to understand things about your voice and whether there is an indication that may lead to tobacco use, as an example. So, hopefully you can kind of understand one small example of how it fits into a) a wonderful technology group helping Insurance business extend into Life Insurance. And FAST provides some of that. Hopefully, that responds.","Scott Stephenson","Maybe talk a little bit also, Mark, about using imagery to interpret damage to vehicles.","Mark Anquillare","Absolutely.","Scott Stephenson","Without having to send a human being.","Mark Anquillare","So, I think one of the things that we would love to do is part of automated adjusting is do a quick look. So this is a what I'll refer to as low severity type of crash, small dollars, but highly frequent. You can do a quick review and make payments. So we have some abilities to take a look at images. Just think about machine learning and understanding a couple of things. One is the image legitimate and accurate based upon time and date and stamp and things like that. Was it manipulated? But we go beyond that to do a few more things. One, we're saying is, it's eligible or not. Should it be complete loss. And then two, if it's eligible, we can do a quick estimate as to what it's going to cost to repair it. And those are the type of things that advanced analytics provide to automate this process. And it's a quick way to do things that have typically taken quite a bit of time and effort to in the past. Great.","Bill, I think you also talked about loan verifier. Loan verifier is another important idea for us. What it does, though, with any of our really differentiated ideas, it does take us time to aggregate data. But what we are working with is, working with insurers to get information access to a lot of that information behind the scenes. So that we can connect those folks who are on the loan side of things, think of the banks, with those insurers who are kind of ensuring that risk and piece those together. Some of that information we have in-house. At the same time, we have a very strong standard stewardship approach to things. And we can only use data for use cases that have been provide to us. So we are working with insurers to validate the use case and I honestly bring on customers. So hopefully, maybe a little long-winded, but a full answer to your questions.","Bill Warmington","Well, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. You may ask your question.","Andrew Nicholas","Hi, good morning. Realizing your acquisitions of Genscape and FAST are still pretty fresh. I was hoping you could provide an update on how those integrations are trending. And then any commentary on the early pipeline builds for those products? Thanks.","Scott Stephenson","Integrations are right on-track with both of them. We actually just reviewed that a week ago. And with respect to everything from cost factors to sales, they are performing almost exactly the way that we expected them to. And in both cases they nest very nicely inside of existing organizations. So these transitions have been very organic. And the pipelines are good. The pipelines are strong.","Lee Shavel","The other thing I would add is, I think that there is a genuine enthusiasm in the case of Genscape among the Wood MacKenzie team, for the ability to utilize that data and integrate it in their analysis and the products that they're serving for their clients. So every time I'm in contact with Wood MacKenzie, I hear their enthusiasm for utilizing that data. FAST is more recent, but I can tell you, I think the -- on the Insurance side, particularly on the life side, our ability to work with them as we described before high level of excitement about what we can potentially accomplish together.","Stacey Brodbar","Final question?","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Joseph Foresi","Yes. So maybe I should ask like an 18-part question. I'm just -- I'll give you a softball to end the day. On the Insurance and energy side, maybe you could talk about the differences in the demand backdrop heading into 2020 versus 2019, either from a pipeline, or necessity on your customer part perspective? Thanks.","Scott Stephenson","Yes. So let me just give you the perspective that really explains Verisk Analytics. We have -- and this has been true for a long period of time. Our company has grown faster than the end markets that we serve. And the reason is that our customers are rotating their own budgets in the direction of what it is that we do. They want to become more automated. And they want to become more deeply analytic in the way that they run their businesses. So you will see a lot of discussion about the level of technology spending on the part of the companies that populate the verticals that we serve. And that in and of itself is a very constructive trend. But you have to actually take that pool of spending and break that down further into sort of data center, keep the lights on, sort of spending versus the platformed analytic environments analytic objects that we provide. And even within the technology category there has been a rotation in the direction of what we do.","So, if you're looking for explanation, in terms of where our business is, and where it's going to go, that is the driving force of what our companies are trying to do. And the fact that because of our vertical approach, we understand their issues. We have deeply intimate relationships because we sell -- in the case of Insurance, we may be selling up to 20 families of solutions to our customers. And from all this depth of relationship and all of the data that they make available to us, it is really the perfect place from which to try to think about the next thing that they need and work collaboratively with them to develop it. And that's why our business grows. The actual macro environments inside of Insurance and energy, I mean, they sort of wax and wane, a little bit. But I don't -- those will not -- in my view have explanatory power in terms of the growth of our business in 2020, 2021 and on.","Joseph Foresi","Thank you.","Scott Stephenson","You're welcome.","Operator","There are no further question at this time. Presenters, you may continue.","Scott Stephenson","Yes, great. Well, thanks everybody for joining us. And as Lee mentioned, we'll have a number of follow-ups with you and look forward to those.

This call is being recorded.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk, Head of Investor Relations, Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.","Stacey Brodbar","Thank you, Grace, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Lee highlighting some key points about our financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.","The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today; Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Stephenson","Thank you, Stacey and good morning everyone. Apologies for my voice today. As we turn the page on 2018, I want to give you my bottom line view of the year just passed. We did well and see opportunity to improve. The single most important reflection of our vitality is our rate of organic revenue growth and normalizing for the effects of exceptional storm-related revenues and a significant contract signing in Financial Services in 2017. Our organic constant currency revenue growth was 7.2%, ahead of our long-term financial target of 7%. Moreover, our growth was broadly based across our Insurance vertical, along with Wood Mackenzie in the Energy space and our core consortium, data analytics in the Financial Services vertical. The heart of our position in the three verticals is sound and forms the basis for cross-selling new solutions in the future.","Looking more deeply into the organic revenue outcomes across the company, I see eight contributing factors. Number one, very high rates of customer retention; two, growth in the number of products consumed by existing customers; three, the introduction and adoption of new innovative solutions; four, positive pricing due to enhanced value in many solutions; five, in those places where we have head-to-head competition, share gains in most categories, including cat modeling, remote imagery, and underwriting decision support; six, affected progress in non-domestic markets, especially the UK; seven, a high rate of capture business with new entrants in the Insurance vertical, including the insure tech companies; and eight, our position as a partner to our customers, who continue to trust Verisk with their data, enabling us to build new solutions in new categories.","For example, in Insurance we are working with our customers to repurpose some contributory policy data already used in our underwriting business to develop innovative claims solutions. One such solution will enable carriers to automate the subrogation process quickly and seamlessly. In Energy and Specialized Markets Wood Mackenzie is leveraging the consortium model developed by our Insurance colleagues and bringing it to the energy sector, where we believe it is in a nascent stage.","We are currently finalizing an agreement to create an energy data consortium, in one of the key US tight oil plays, and in Financial Services, we are working with our card issuer partners in Mexico to launch a fraud consortium to help combat the transaction based fraud plaguing their system.","An important underlying foundation to our growth is the agility of our technical infrastructure, which permits us to bring new solutions to market faster and with greater analytic content. On this front, I was pleased with the following in 2018; our analytics community has grown substantially, through our own program of cultivating data scientists, along with industry hiring, and all of this, supported by the naming of our new Chief Analytics Officer.","We saw a doubling of our consumption of public cloud capacity in 2018. We have made progress in advancing our data methods to support widespread tokenization, which contributes to our internal security and presents opportunities to access new datasets from equally security-minded data sources.","On the innovation front, we introduced a wide variety of unique and customer-driven solutions across our verticals. In Insurance, we launched programs to address new risk exposure, including cyber and flood. We also successfully introduced a variety of disruptive and award winning innovations to the market, which Mark will talk to you about in more detail.","In the Energy and Specialized Market segment, we launched Lens, a cloud-based data and analytics platform, which allows customers to access, analyze, and model data in every major commodity in every market and in our Financial Services sector, we delivered next generation merchant analytics to retailers. As a complement to our innovation agenda, we are very focused on driving operational efficiency. As we shared with you in detail at our Investor Day in December, we worked diligently to advance our operational excellence initiative through Lean Six Sigma. With 3,100 employees trained and 85 active projects underway and more soon to be launched, Verisk is driving a culture of continuous improvement, by measurably improving processes and meeting the critical customer needs of quality and speed.","Another leading indicator for me comes from the many conversations I have with the CEOs of our leading customers. Are they thinking of Verisk as a partner? Or as a vendor? A consistent message across 2018 is that we are engaging our customers around some of their highest priority initiatives for the future and they see Verisk as a distinctive and trusted partner in doing so. The result of many of my CEO visits is a request that their teams to be placed in closer proximity to our innovation pipeline.","A last comment about the year just passed, regards the planning cycle we went through at the end of the year. I have never seen a higher volume of fresh ideas for new solutions and approaches for engaging our customers. We have the wonderful problem of needing to choose among a wide variety of opportunities.","Finally, I'm pleased to announce, as you've seen, that our Board of Directors has approved the initiation of a cash dividend to shareholders. This represents an important milestone in what is the 10th year of our history as a public company, and demonstrates the confidence we have in our ability to drive sustainable profitable growth, generate significant free cash flow, and create long-term shareholder value through careful capital management.","I will now turn the call over to Mark to comment specifically on our Insurance business.","Mark Anquillare","Thank you, Scott. I'm pleased to share with you the 2018 was a strong year in our Insurance businesses. One marked by solid growth across most of our lines of business, fueled by leading innovation and enhanced customer engagement. Excluding the impact of approximately $16 million of storm related revenue in 2017, Insurance revenue, on an organic constant currency basis grew 8.3% in 2018. Our customer retention rates remain very high, and the overall portfolio of new and truly innovative solutions is more robust than ever.","As Scott mentioned earlier, we received numerous innovation of the Year Awards for our creative solutions, including one, LightSpeed Auto, our innovative data forward workflow solution that delivers a faster and more efficient experience for underwriting and buying Insurance. A fully bindable online auto quote is delivered after providing only three pieces of key data. We've extended the LightSpeed technology and platform for the rest of the property and small commercial Insurance segments. Several customers have signed contracts and our pipeline of interest for LightSpeed is growing.","Two, Verisk Data Exchange. Our IoT data consortium that collects connected car data from our GM, Honda and Hyundai partnerships, on more than 4.7 million vehicles, covering more than 80 billion miles. The Insurance applications range from driving behavioral scores for underwriting to instant notice of loss, solutions for claims. And three, EPIX, our Energy and Power Intelligence Exchange, our Insurance platform that helps energy Insurance professionals' research, assess and underwrite complex risks. This solution addresses a critical possible growth need by combining Verisk's risk scoring and benchmarking Insurance expertise, with WoodMac's unique energy data.","A steady stream of first-to-market innovation is one of the four distinctives at Verisk and is also a key driver of our growth. It is also an important force of change within the Insurance industry. On that front, InsurTech is gathering lots of mind share and meaningful capital investment, which we think creates future growth opportunities for Verisk.","In my view, InsurTech is growing in two distinct areas. One, startup insurers and Managing General Agents or MGAs, who are underwriting and distributing Insurance. These types of insured tech startups are likely to need data analytics to effectively price and sell Insurance in a competitive market. We believe these startups have the potential to become Verisk customers, and in fact in 2018, we engaged with 67 of these startups on the 182 opportunities and had 79 product wins.","Second, other InsurTech startups include service providers, who are trying to improve the Insurance process. These startups may be competitors of ours, but many recognize the value of our services and continue to solicit our data analytics, distribution channel or even possible investment. The threat from InsurTech players is igniting investment by more traditional insurers, who are focused on analytics, digital engagement and automation to compete with InsurTech and deliver a better customer experience for their policyholders. This momentum in insure investment have led to increased opportunities for us.","A common description of InsurTech is the use of technology innovations, designed to improve the Insurance process by squeezing out savings and driving efficiency from the current Insurance industry model. With this definition in mind, I view Verisk as the most comprehensive and trusted InsurTech provider.","As we've communicated to you over the years, international expansion is an important part of our long-term growth strategy, and in 2018 it was a solid contributor to growth. The United Kingdom provides a playbook for success in future international expansion. Global Insurance market, especially specialty line has hubs world with London as the key gateway to global markets, and an accelerating step on our journey to extend beyond the United States. This vision is becoming a reality in the UK. Our strategy is to provide a comprehensive suite of solutions across the entire Insurance value chain, driving data and automation from broker to underwriter to reinsurer and from to claim settlement.","During the quarter, we acquired Rulebook, industry leading provider of business intelligence and software solutions for the London Insurance market. Rulebook in combination with Sequel furthers our goal of providing leading solutions to the global Insurance market, including a comprehensive chain of solutions to specialty insurers for mitigating risks and optimizing total cost of operations. Our customers are recognizing the advantages of these integrated solutions, resulting in new contracts and increased sales opportunities.","With a successful 2018 behind us, we are focused on 2019 and are actively meeting with employees and customers. To kick start each year, we held a series of town hall meetings at our major offices to share Verisk's Insurance solutions strategic direction. We also held our Annual Insurance Sales Meeting in Nashville, earlier this month. The first evening of the sales meeting was an award ceremony and a celebration of a strong 2018. The meeting then serves as a form for leadership to communicate our goals for 2019, and for the sales teams to learn about our new innovative solutions. Our 200-person sales team experienced demos from our product experts, and were briefed in our innovation lab, under a cutting edge AI and automation technologies.","Several customers joined us and emphasized the importance of our products and thought leadership to their businesses, as well as suggested enhancements to our solutions. The teams left our town hall and sales meetings with a sense of accomplishment, energy and momentum from 2018 and motivated for 2019.","With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.","Lee Shavel","Thanks Mark. First, I'd like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that's available on our website. The presentation provides background data trends and analysis to support our conversation today.","Moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis revenue grew 7.7% to $614 million, as a result of an income tax benefit of $89 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to tax reform, net income decreased 28.5% to $146 million for the quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.87 for the fourth quarter 2018, a decrease of 28.7% compared with the same period in 2017. Equalizing the fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate to that of the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 5.6% and 6.1% respectively.","Let's focus our quarterly discussion on our normalized organic constant currency results for all year-over-year growth rates and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations, recent acquisitions for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons and non-recurring items, including the impact of the storm related revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. On a normalized organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 6.9% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.3% in the fourth quarter of 2018, reflecting strong organic growth across the Insurance and the Energy and Specialized Market segments, offset by weakness in Financial Services. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 47.8% was up from 47.6% on a normalized basis in the prior year period. Please bear in mind that our reported fourth quarter 2017 margin, not adjusted for the storms, includes the benefit of 100% margin on the $8 million in storm-related revenue.","For the full year of 2018 normalized for both the storm-related and non-recurring implementation revenues, we achieved 7.2% organic constant currency revenue growth and 7.7% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.5% in 2018, up from 48.3% in 2017. We achieved these results, while also maintaining substantial investment in our business, and sustaining ongoing recovery in our Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services sectors.","Let's now turn to our segment results on a normalized organic constant currency basis. As you can see in the press release, Insurance segment revenue grew 8.5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 9.9%, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 53.5%, up from 52.8% in the prior year and inclusive of substantial investments in remote imagery and telematics. Within our underwriting and rating business, we saw solid performance with healthy growth in commercial lines, personal lines and catastrophe modeling services. Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance across most of our claims businesses, partially offset by continued softness in our workers' compensation, claim resolution services.","Energy and Specialized Markets delivered revenue growth of 5.1% for the quarter, as the Energy industry continues to recover. We experienced growth in both our core research and consulting solutions, as well as strong contribution from our breakout areas, including power and renewables, chemicals and subsurface. We also had positive contributions from environmental health and safety and weather and climate analytics revenues.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.6%, adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.3% was slightly down from the prior year period of 31.4%, as we continue to invest in WoodMac 2.0 or Lens, as it is branded in the marketplace, and our chemicals subsurface and power renewables breakouts. These areas represent opportunities to leverage Wood Mackenzie's data and industry expertise more broadly and to deliver and develop products more swiftly and efficiently.","Financial Services revenue declined 2.2% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA decreased by 12.8%. Solid growth in portfolio management solutions and spend-informed analytics were offset by headwinds from tough comparisons with prior year implementation revenues, as well as some timing differences.","As we articulated previously, we continue to make progress on our initiative to reduce the variability of revenues in this segment, particularly around project based items. As we work through this process, we will continue to see quarterly fluctuations on revenue and growth, higher than our other businesses. That said we are encouraged by the long-term growth potential in our Financial Services segment, as we set the business on a stronger foundation for future growth.","Reported interest expense was $33 million in the quarter, up 1.6% from the prior year quarter due to the funding of acquisitions over the last 12 months and our share repurchase program. Total reported debt was $2.7 billion at December 31st, 2018, down from $3 billion at December 31st, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.3 x. We are very pleased to share that on January 30th, Standard & Poor's upgraded Verisk's credit rating to BBB Flat, with a stable outlook from BBB minus with a stable outlook, and assigned a short-term rating of A-2.","Our reported effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, this compares to the negative 14.1% we experienced in the prior year quarter, as we recorded a benefit resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities in connection with tax reform. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 16.8%, which was lower than our targeted range due to significant exercises of soon to expire employee stock options, related to our 2009 IPO that produced a favorable tax impact.","For 2019, we expect our tax rate to be between 19% and 21%. Though there will be likely some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises, which depends in part on the Verisk stock price and employee personnel decisions.","Adjusted net income was $174 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.04 for the fourth quarter, down 21.8% from the prior year. This decrease reflects the impact of a prior year $89 million tax benefit related to the 2017 tax reform. Equalizing the fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate to that of the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 5.6% and 6.1% respectively. Further normalizing for the elevated storm revenue in the quarter, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 10% and 10.6% respectively, consistent with our long-term objective for double-digit EPS growth.","Net cash provided by operating activities was $173 million for the quarter, up 14.5% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $77 million for the quarter, up 9.8% from the prior year period, reflecting continued investments in future growth opportunities, including remote imagery, telematics and Lens, and software development to support and improve new and existing products across the organization. Total capital expenditures for 2018 were $231 million and represented 9.6% of total revenue. As we've said previously, we expect capital expenditures to decline as a percentage of revenues in 2019, and over the long term, and to be within a range of $220 million to $240 million in 2019.","As that translates to depreciation and amortization we expect fixed asset, depreciation and amortization to be within a range of $175 million to $185 million in comparison to the $165 million for 2018, and we expect intangible amortization to be approximately $135 million in 2019 in comparison to $131 million in 2018. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability and future M&A activity. Free cash flow was $97 million for the quarter, an increase of 18.6% from the prior year period.","This quarter, we returned $156 million in capital to shareholders through the repurchase of approximately 1.3 million shares at a weighted average price of $119.55. At December 31st 2018 we had $428 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we initiated a new $75 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the first quarter of 2019.","Of course, the big news on the capital front was the initiation of a cash dividend of $0.25 per share this quarter. We are very pleased to reach this milestone in our 10th year as a public company, and to deliver another source of value to our investors. This dividend underscores the stability of our business, profitability and cash flow, as well as a diversification of our capital return discipline, balancing share repurchases and dividends. We further expect that the dividend will open new groups of potential shareholders to Verisk.","It's important to note that the dividend initiation does not reflect any diminution in our growth prospects or the opportunities to invest our capital. We will continue to have sufficient capital to support our long-term growth objectives, which remain unchanged. We remain excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and remain focused on long-term profitable growth and solid returns on capital. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us. We ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up.","With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Thank you, Mr. Shavel. Our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","Hi, good morning. Scott, you mentioned that you've been meeting with CEOs of your customers, could you just call out what seems maybe on their minds that might be different than last year, or just give us a sense of the most important priorities that they're focused on?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. Thanks Toni. Two things immediately come to mind. One is I would say almost every Insurance company CEO believes and expects that they can find ways to make their company grow faster than their competitors, faster than the industry. And I think that's really significant because it means that what they are leaning into is improved methodologies. They're not just trying to sort of hunker down and play a cost game, they are looking to grow their businesses and they realize that the world around them really has changed and continues to change because of technology.","So I would say that that's really the first and the most important thing that's going on. I would say a second thing that is also pretty obviously true, I would say, especially for the mid and larger companies, is they are really persuaded of the importance of accessing partnerships and supply from outside of their own companies. In other words, they realize that there are ways that their businesses can be benefited by tying in with others, and so I see a lot more partnering, I see a lot more venture investing, as they try to get closer to technology, and I just see a lot more outreach to a company like ourselves that is recognized as being sort of distinctively able to help across multiple fronts. So these are very constructive meetings, they are partnership meetings.","Toni Kaplan","Terrific. And then for my follow-up. I wanted to ask about margins. So in Insurance, I think we've seen investment impacting margins, seen with first quarter in Energy last year, I guess should we view 2019 as maybe a little bit - a continuation of investing maybe a little bit less so than 2018 or how should we directionally sort of think about it and then outside of scale, are there any margin initiatives across the business like efficiencies that you're looking to drive this year? Thanks","Lee Shavel","Thanks Toni. This is Lee. So I think it's - I would start off by saying, certainly all our businesses, we think have superb operational and operating leverage. And so, as you know, across the organization, our expectation is that each of the businesses will demonstrate improvement in margin. I think it's a fair observation that in 2018, there was a high level of investment in a variety of initiatives, Geomni, Lens, IoT and telematics, where we chose to make those investments and that - those obviously had a negative impact on margin.","But notwithstanding that, I want to reiterate as I mentioned in my comments that both - for the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole, when you normalize for the storm activity, we had margin expansion on the year-over-year periods. And so from our perspective, recognizing that storm revenue and the implementation revenue for TSYS was 100% margin, and so that certainly skewed that year-over-year comparison. We believe that we delivered margin expansion, as well as substantial investment in the businesses for that period.","In 2019, we won't have that storm comparison and as Scott indicated, we still see very attractive opportunities to invest. But I think it's fair to say that probably in 2018, from a scale standpoint, particularly around Geomni, it was a higher level, consistent with our CapEx guidance that was acceleration. We expect to see that absolute level of investment decline as a percentage of revenue. So we feel good about the opportunity to strive towards our goal of margin expansion.","Operator","Our second question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. Thank you. Just on the Financial Services segment, maybe you could just touch on how you plan to reduce variability of revenues in that vertical, and maybe just timing of that initiative?","Lee Shavel","Sure. Hamzah, this is Lee. Thanks for that question. So the process is essentially in recognizing in project related revenues. I think the tendency in the past had been to recognize more of that revenue upfront. I think as we have the flexibility in structuring those relationships as new business comes on, we are - and this is not perspective, this is already occurring, we are structuring the relationship, so that revenue is realized over time, so that we don't have these large chunks of revenue that create that variability.","So that is part of the objective. That's a structural initiative as we work with clients. But also I think fundamentally, as we think about developing the growth of the business, our focus is on building the sustainable growth component off of the four constituent businesses that we've described before. So that it is more incremental growth across that base. I think both of those will contribute to more stable, less variable revenue and profitability over time.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. And just for my follow-up question, on the international business, what sort of next milestones should we be looking at in that business? I know you talked about products essentially needing to be more customized locally. So just any color on long-term international Insurance strategy? Thank you.","Mark Anquillare","Yes, thank you. This is Mark. Just to kind of follow up on the question. So I think what we've seen is, it's a bit of a build and buy scenario. So what we are now doing, which is become a very powerful in front of customers is, we've taken many of our solutions and we started to integrate them in a more holistic way. So walking into a customer as opposed to buying all these point solutions, there is an attractiveness of knowing that your data is going to flow from the beginning of a process that starts at maybe a quote or an underwriting decision on through the process, so you can see it from a portfolio perspective in some of our catastrophe modeling solutions, and all of that is information that's embodied in the solution at Sequel.","The concept and the construct here is, I can do it more effectively, I can do it more efficiently and I can do it more accurately. And on top of that backbone, we've added some of, I will refer to it the ISO and some of the other analytics that has been so powerful here in the States.","So that continues to evolve. I think we'll be able to do more and more with customers as we gain access to more data, and maybe just to take your question one step further, to maybe highlight that - I think we see London as being kind of a gateway into the international community, especially with the specialty lines. So as we win these contracts, we're doing work, not just in the UK, but with companies who are located in UK, but are underwriting business throughout the world. So our next step into other geographies is that much easier.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to ask about the Financial Services business, which was really weak for the second year in a row. I'm wondering if this business has the same distinctives that really characterizing both your Insurance and your Energy and Specialized Markets businesses, especially since competition here seems to be increasing with a number of well capitalized competitors like MasterCard offering more and more analytics to a credit card issuer.","So my question really is, does this business really still fit within Verisk, especially given the broader capital allocation framework that you've rolled out today, which seems to focus more on capital return?","Scott Stephenson","David, it's Scott here. Yes, the business does that. I think that many of the folks on the call today are familiar with, what we call our four distinctives, which we talk about a lot, which is just to remind everybody, our unique data assets, deep domain expertise, first mover advantage and deep embedment and customer workflows; and what we do in Financial Services has all four of those qualities. So as Lee previously talked about some of the things that have sort of moved through the business of late, we talked about the sort of the lumpy quality of the way that some of the revenues have been recognized in the past.","What I would go back to is, that the heart of the business is built on consortium data, which is absolutely unique and unlike the data, which is available to anyone else, including the players you just mentioned, on top of which then, we have very deep relationships with our customers and really a large data platform, which is really remarkable for a company of that size.","So all of the conditions are there and then I would also say, again echoing what Lee said, the strength of portfolio analytics, plus the spend analytics that we do, are the leading parts of the business and they're actually healthy. So we expect that as these other effects sort of washed through you'll get sort of a more clear view of those things built upon the distinctives, which really will power the business going forward.","David Togut","Thanks for that, as a quick follow-up. I'd just like to ask about dividend policy. The math shows that the LTM payout ratio is about 28%. How do you think about the payout ratio that you're using to set the dividend and do you expect the dividend to grow in line with earnings or faster than earnings going forward?","Lee Shavel","Thanks David, it's Lee, let me take that. So we - in setting that level, we looked at the payout ratio, really also what proportion of capital are we allocating to the dividend and an eye on kind of yield and where yields are out there. We recognize that investors will expect and reward growth in the dividend over time, and we certainly believe that our ongoing earnings growth will provide a very strong consideration for these decisions by our Board in the future.","We also expect to weigh capital investment and return opportunities in the allocation decisions ahead. So all of those I think factor into it, but there clearly is recognition that there will be an expectation, given our overall growth that there - that the dividend should grow as well. And that's what we will balance looking ahead in advises with the Board on these decisions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning. Scott, I think at the beginning of the call, you talked about the repurposing of 7B Insurance Consortium data, and I was wondering if you can just expand on that, maybe taking a step back and letting us know how much of the data do you have access now to play around and innovate with, and if this is a new or ongoing opportunity?","Scott Stephenson","So let me start and Mark you may want to amplify some of this. But when we think about data and the Insurance vertical, it's really a combination of looking for opportunities to tease additional meaning out of existing data sets and generating new datasets. So upfront, I mentioned for example, subrogation. Subrogation is essentially bound up in the claims resolution process, and as I think most folks know, we have a lot of claims data. So finding a way to point that at the subrogation case and to think about affiliated things like clearing payment between counterparts is just interesting and it's really a process that hasn't really been transformed yet in the Insurance industry.","So that would be an example of repurposing. But then there are other places where we're trying to generate original datasets. And one thing I would just comment on here is that, on the one hand we are very alert to opportunities to position data to where it can be repurposed. On the other hand, we are very diligent about the reasons why our customers made the data available to us in the first place. And so we're going to always be striking a balance between the - what's possible and what our customer contributors would like to see us do. But there's plenty of room in there for innovation. And then there are a variety of new data sets where we're making original calls for data. And you know, actually, even that takes a couple of forms. One is, we have existing platforms like PCS where we started to call data related to cyber incidents, and we didn't used to do that.","So that's original data, but around an existing platform. We are always trying to enrich the data that comes into a platform like claims search, and then we're trying to find yet new forms of claims data that we don't receive today, for example, commercial claims histories are not as developed as personal claims histories. Mark, anything you want to add to all that?","Mark Anquillare","I think that was well said. I think it goes back to the earlier comment I made about partnerships in conversations with CEOs. In the world of data, obviously, our customers and many people feel their data is valuable. So we need to provide them with valuable use cases back to their businesses, in order for them to let us use the data. So having the great partnerships and relationships is very important. We continue to be a trusted intermediary for that data, and we feel that it's a privileged position.","Manav Patnaik","Got it and just for the follow-up. Lee, Just on the Energy and Specialized side I think last year you guys called out, I think it was a bank and then a merger related kind of headwind to the business. Have we lapped those comps and does that mean next year, your number should start looking better?","Lee Shavel","Thank you, Manav. We will lap that in the first quarter of 2019. So we were still experiencing that headwind in the fourth quarter, but that will go away in the first quarter of 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, it's Andrew. I wanted to ask about WoodMac 2.0 Lens. What are some milestone and rollouts that we should be looking for, and will WoodMac 2.0 help margins and revenues or just one of them and particularly make a comment for 2019?","Scott Stephenson","Yes, so let me take it at a general level. Andrew, maybe Lee, if you want to add anything. It's constructive on both the revenue and the margin side, because part of what Lens is getting after, is the very nature of our data aggregation, and it becomes more efficient on this platform that we've built. But equally, there's more functionality there for customers and so we think it will be constructive in both ways.","I don't - I wouldn't point you so much to milestones, or at least not those that will be called out in the overall performance of the business. What I'm trying - and I'm not making a comment about the future profile of the financial performance of the business. I'm simply saying, the revenue streams are all sort of - think of it as a bowl of spaghetti, and Lens works its way through things that we already do, in addition to representing modules, new modules that we can license to customers. But I've called out specifics. Basically it will be - we do business with so many companies already, this will really enhance cross-selling into existing relationships. But in terms of visibility to the outside I'm not - I wouldn't call out any particular milestone, just the general progress of the business certainly. Lee, anything you want to add that?","Lee Shavel","No, I think Scott covered it. I would just make the comment that Lens really represents the platform that enables us to continue the evolution of a very good research and consulting business into increasingly a data analytics business that can serve a broader customer base, can develop and integrate data products more effectively, which is beneficial both from a revenue growth standpoint, as well as from a margin perspective. And I would just finally add that the team there continues to work on operational efficiencies, to improve the margin as well.","Andrew Steinerman","But Lee, might there be a time like maybe this year where you're running two infrastructures for WoodMac and it might be a drag to margins?","Scott Stephenson","Well, I mean, yes, but no. So you observe something, yes. But the implication, I don't think is right. So yes we need to be running things in parallel and we have been investing as Lee has referenced several times, to build the platform. But the actual operation of the platform, I mean one of the things that's so constructive inside of our business, is that we enjoy the gift of Moore's Law every day. And so actually, the cost of compiling data or even processing data inside of the platform that you have built, the incremental cost is not really all that great. I'm not saying that it's zero. So you're correct about what we will do operationally. But I think the implication you are trying to reach in terms of operating expense going forward is not so accurate.","Lee Shavel","Yes, and I would go more broadly. And I think that definitely has some relevance with regard to our transition to cloud, where we are making investments and see opportunities to find greater efficiencies, where we still have legacy costs. I think that is - would be a valid observation, not so much in this context. So thank you for the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company. Your line is now open.","Tim McHugh","Yes, hello. First, I wanted to ask on the Energy side of the business. In the prepared remarks, you talked about being close designing to signing a consortium deal. Can you talk more about that and the nature of the data, I guess and the product, I guess that would flow out of it?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. So those of you, who have followed us, know that the majority, in fact, a large majority of the data that we've had up until today, has been mostly about the commercial dimensions of the oil and gas business. So observations about productivity and the cost factors associated with the assets that produce either the raw materials or the refined materials. So those are the datasets that have typically traditionally been a part of what we do. The datasets we are adding are what we call the sub-surface datasets, and these are the ones that take into account the actual real-time operations, even in the oilfield, in combination with the nature of the rock and the nature of the fluids and the nature of the fields. So that we can complement everything we've already done - always done, with basically much more real-time optimization of the operations of our customers' assets. And this is something that we haven't done as much of, in fact very little of, up till now. So the datasets relate to that; real-time operational optimization.","Tim McHugh","And did you say it was for specifics region or sub-sector of companies you would start with.","Scott Stephenson","Well, yes. So whenever we talk about the consortium dataset, you're always you're always talking about specific customers and generally specific product sets or specific places. So that does apply and, excuse me, in what we're doing in building these new datasets the subsurface data sets, and our focus right now, predominantly is the lower 48 in the United States, where the need the situation in the United States is different than the situation in most other parts of the world.","And because of the United States. What the operators are doing is basically saying that particular rig should I move 2000 feet and I can move it and four days later, have one thousand foot well that's producing, and so that, that's the speed with which strategy quote unquote is being set and operations are being rebalanced in the United States.","Tim McHugh","Hey, great. Thank you. And then on the insurance side the aerial imagery product set. Can you and I think you mentioned is one of the growth drivers, I guess, but can you give us more color on adoption kind of competition for that product at this point. How scaling, maybe relative to what the initial plan was 18 months ago or 12 months ago when you can of made a more aggressive push into this space.","Mark Anquillare","Sure. So this is Mark. I think your question is directed insurance and at the same time, we have been extended beyond that. So first of all, we've been very pleased with the takeaway we've had in the market, our market share is growing. We've won significant customers and many of them that is clearly contributed to some of the organic growth that we've talked about here beyond what is our fair to it as market share. We've also continued to add products.","So remember in the world of I view as a complete automated solution. If I was to take use imagery in combination with some of the scoping and what we reverted image the scope, which is the exact activate tool behind our in front of all this imagery we can really automate and become more accurate and more cost effective for those claims adjusters. Literally, we think we can double the productivity of the claims adjuster field forces that our customer saving them hundreds of millions of dollars, so we're seeing that.","What I also like to highlight though is that growth is extending beyond what is traditional insurance. As you think about world of contractors, if you think about the world of, I would reduce mapping and construction, as well as roofing companies, all of those found use cases in some slowing down or innovative way we view some of the technology. So that is contributing to the growth across the board. Even outside of insurance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone. So you mentioned the UK model and gateway for international expansion. So culturally there are a lot of similarities in the use at US and the UK. I guess Weinstein Churchill will call them two nations divided by a common language. But as you go, as you look to prioritize your other geographies for international expansion, what are the ones where you are going to be focusing first?","Scott Stephenson","So, Bill I am going to assumes that is a continuation of the conversation we had on insurance. So we think there's a lot more to do in the UK. So we'll continue to push there. I think what we've identified is looking at like markets. Looking at places that have a more mature insurance marketplace. And a gross premium and a growing gross premium. We have really identified Europe but more specifically Germany and France is kind of the next couple of places that are of interest. Down the road, I think everyone thinks about kind of emerging markets and emerging insurance markets like China and India.","We aren't turning our back on that. We're keeping an eye on it, but we kind of think to your point, trying to stay close to the markets that are little more mature in Europe is probably the best next step for us.","Bill Warmington","Got it. Then for my follow up, your thoughts on FX impact to revenue in 2019.","Lee Shavel","Yes. So, Bill, I know the reason we try to focus on organic constant currency numbers is that we can't predict what's going to happen from an FX standpoint. So we're focusing on results excluding the FX range. I do think generally given the very strong US orientation of our business. Generally, the fact that that Wood Mack has a mix of US and international revenues, we think overall the exposure is relatively low. So I'd say proportionally we don't think it will have a big impact, but our focus is always to try to eliminate that factor which we can't completely control.","Operator","Thank you. We have our next question from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff Meuler","Yes, thank you. As you productize the subsurface consortium data as you were just kind of explaining, are you inventing new categories of solutions to sell to customers? And I don't mean new relative to various coming new relative to the market or certain another way, do you have to displace solutions from the leading incumbents that have subsurface data already. Are these I guess Greenfield opportunities.","Scott Stephenson","It's a combination of the two. And it really hinges upon how much analytic content we get into what we do. So there are players today that will provide observations about a number of this sort of individual parameters that apply when you're trying to understand the productivity of real-time operations. So from one place you can get data as it relates to, for example, the completion strategies that have been taken for the individual. Well, there are other sources, where you can make sure that you have completely identified the leasing --the lease holding an ownership structure of whatever patch of land, you're talking about and then other places you can go for the heavy size technology work and on and on and on like that.","So part of what we will do is to increasingly make those kinds of those kinds of data available to our customers. But then, over and above that, what doesn't exist so much in the marketplace today is the - is really the AI machine learned expression of all of that data in quantity across heterogeneous situations. So that in an automated fashion, you can really make predictions and drive decisioning, and there we expect, because we're Verisk, we will be distinguished. How much those kinds of solutions generate completely original revenue streams versus how much they displace, for example, some of these bespoke datasets. I would say that remains to be seen. The primary point here is, there is the opportunity for differentiation.","Jeff Meuler","That's helpful. And then on the Insurance business, there's been some underlying acceleration and there is a couple of years where maybe it was growing below trend a few years ago and you called out some various moment in time factors at that point. But I guess Scott, as you list out the eight factors that are driving it, they sound largely sustainable. So just how are you thinking about Insurance growth at this point. Like has bookings growth also accelerated, is bookings growth outpacing revenue growth? Thanks.","Scott Stephenson","Yes, so, you definitely understood what I was saying upfront. All eight of those trends apply broadly across our company, but specifically in the Insurance vertical. I mean if you just step back and you say okay, this environment - this Insurance environment, what characterizes it? The customer set is relatively stable. There are occasionally some large merger transactions and there are some segments like global reinsurance brokers, where there has been some of that seasonally. But by and large, the customer demography is steady. Regulation really doesn't change that much. Energy - excuse me, technology is a constructive factor, as it relates to a company like us, because back to the top, every - virtually every one of our customers believes they can grow faster than their competitors. And so everybody is trying to behave innovatively, and so that's, that's just inherently constructive for folks like us.","And then if you think about all of the - the many references that we've made this morning, they are just new things that we're doing and bringing to the market that don't exist. And so it's a constructive environment. I mean, the United States Property and Casualty Insurance industry, our home market is the granddaddy of large-scale contributory data analytics. I mean it was invented that way practically. And so we really have this wonderful privilege of being who we are inside of that very constructive environment.","Lee Shavel","Thank you, Jeff. I think we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","George Tong","Hi, thanks, good morning. I'd like to drill deeper into the Financial Services business; you touched on plans to reduce the variability of revenues through the restructuring of contracts. Can you elaborate on the initiatives you have to improve the overall growth of the segment? Because in the quarter, even after normalizing for the year-ago implementation revenues associated with TSYS, organic growth would have been pretty muted, any color there would be helpful?","Lee Shavel","Sure. So George, this is Lee, and I'm going to refer back to the kind of description in the organization that Lisa gave at Investor Day. And so, I think it's helpful if you think about it in the four components. The foundation of this business is the benchmarking solutions business. And as we indicated, the growth in that part of the business remains very stable. In addition, the spend-informed analytics component remains solid. The two areas where in the fourth quarter and I think represent our opportunity to make progress is in the enterprise data management component, and that really is an emerging space, it is one where we are finding opportunities to develop new data management solutions for our customers. Given our scale, given our expertise, and that's something that we certainly think, based upon feedback from clients is very positive. But that is something that we will develop over time. We're encouraged by the initial responses.","And the other element is the fraud component, and that's an area, similarly where we - I feel very good about the contributions from our acquisition of LCI and G2, we are in the process of developing some of the infrastructure, some of the product sets around that, and we think that over time, that area will also be a stronger contributor to the growth overall.","So that would be the way I would kind of organize thinking around where we see or where we have an immediate focus on improving the growth rate for that business.","George Tong","Very helpful. As a follow-up. I'd like to switch over to the Energy business, you saw an incremental step down in organic constant currency growth there, can you talk about trends in your non-recurring revenue streams in Energy and how annualized contract value growth is progressing, and in light of some of the declines we've seen in oil prices?","Lee Shavel","Sure. So I think in that - that's principally the consulting - consulting component business that was - it was still growing and growing at a higher rate than our subscription business. But the third quarter was particularly strong, and so I think that contributed at one level to a slight - and I would just view it as kind of a slight slowdown relative to the third quarter level. But overall, I think we see progress in this - continued progress in the subscription component of the business, particularly as it relates to the new breakout initiatives that are generating strong subscription growth within that segment.","Scott Stephenson","I would just add the recent movement in the commodity is within a range that we don't consider it material to the performance of our business.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks for sneaking me in. I'll be quick. Just a quick numbers questions, Lee, what should we be modeling for interest expense this year, and also the tax rate guidance that you gave us for 2019, is that something we should view as longer term? Thanks.","Lee Shavel","Yes, so on tax, I think based upon what we see right now, obviously, any changes in tax legislation. I think that 19% to 21% range is a good basis. On interest expense, it's not something that we give formal guidance, we - obviously that's going to flex based upon what happens within the business and our capital allocation decisions. So I think kind of starting with the point of just stability in overall debt levels and looking at the average rates is probably a middle of the way road to go. But I wouldn't give you any specific guidance beyond that, because that will adjust based upon our capital allocation decisions over time, I would expect that we remain within this - within this leverage range, absent any other material changes.","Scott Stephenson","Okay. Well thank you all very much for your continued interest in Verisk, and we look forward to following up with a number of you, as well as those who are taking a new look at Verisk, based upon our new capital policy, including the dividend. So look forward to our continuing conversations with you. Thanks, thanks for this morning and your attention."],"21510":["Verisk Analytics, Inc.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's SVP and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.","Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Chief Knowledge Officer","Thank you, Dorothy, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2015 and full year 2015 financial results.","With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.","The earnings release referenced on the call, as well as the associated 10-K, can be found in the Investors section of our website at verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, until March 24, 2016, on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.","And now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Eva. And good morning, everyone. We reported another year of industry-leading high-single-digit organic revenue growth with margin expansion and excellent free cash flow generation.","Fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations, with total revenue growth of about 21% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 23%. Full year revenue grew 18% and diluted adjusted EPS increased about 29%. We grew the top line, excluding the healthcare analytics business and recent acquisitions, over 5% in the quarter and 7% for the full year. Profitability was strong as adjusted EBITDA excluding acquisitions grew about 7% in the quarter and 14% for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 47% in the quarter and 48% for the full year.","We continue to work on our comprehensive review of strategic alternatives for the healthcare analytics business. There is a range of alternatives and not solely limited to a sale of the business. As responsible stewards of shareholder capital, we are being methodical and thoughtful in our approach. The volatility of the equity and leverage markets in the last quarter of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 has contributed to the timing of our efforts. We expect to be able to provide you with an update by the time we report first quarter earnings.","We're always looking to innovate to drive growth at Verisk. For example, in our insurance business one of the solutions which has been contributing to growth in Risk Assessment is the ISO electronic rating content suite. We rolled out new features including an automated maintenance feed that allows insurers to import the most recent changes to ISO loss costs and rating algorithms directly into their rating systems. This is innovation which helps our customers to implement rate changes more quickly and more efficiently.","In other recent news, WoodMac announced a commercial alliance with Thomson Reuters. This alliance gives customers of the Eikon platform a direct link to WoodMac's oilfield data and research. The information and analysis we are providing includes crude oil production, oil product balances and stocks, oil product prices, crack spreads and refining margins. This is an important new channel for WoodMac, extending our reach to customers we were largely not already serving.","Looking at capital deployment, we are on track to meet our deleveraging commitment even as we have made a number of tuck-in acquisitions and returned capital to our shareholders through repurchases.","We made a couple of acquisitions in the fourth quarter for about $50 million. We acquired Infield Systems including its proprietary database of offshore asset prices. We also acquired PCI Group, which has proprietary data assets and deep chemical industry domain expertise. These two acquisitions complement and enhance our data and capabilities at WoodMac very nicely.","During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through the repurchase of over $20 million of stock. Our remaining authorization at the end of 2015 was $469 million after a $300 million increase in December, and we remain buyers of our stock at current levels. We are committed to a prudent mix of M&A and share repurchases over time to complement and enhance our core businesses. This combination positions us very well to deliver the kinds of shareholder returns over the next several years that we expect of ourselves and you expect of us.","Our initiatives during the past year position us well to execute on our plans for 2016 and we're constructive on the outlook. We expect our combined insurance businesses will grow at least as fast as they did in 2015. This reflects the quality and value of the solutions we provide and the strength of our relationships. As we discussed at Investor Day in December, we expect WoodMac to grow in constant currency, even when excluding the effect of Infield and PCI.","Given the end market dynamics, we think this is a strong reflection of the quality of our team, the strength of our intellectual property and the depth of our customer relationships. Our health care business grew 6% in 2015 with expanding margins, and we anticipate a higher rate of growth and additional margin expansion in 2016. We also expect Argus to grow double-digits for the full year 2016, even with the one-time project revenue we had in the first quarter of 2015.","Over and above all of this, in 2016 we will strengthen our foundation. Our internal environment for handling large amounts of diverse data types is rapidly and continuously improving. Our data assets, already among the largest private data sets in the world, will expand. And our global footprint, a key to providing organic growth opportunities over the long term, is now in place and growing. Verisk is today one of the world's most valuable, vertically oriented data analytics companies. Our robust plans to the year 2020 will lead to new levels of distinction and performance.","So with that let me turn it over to Mark to cover the financials in more detail.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Scott. For the fourth quarter, we again delivered solid revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing for the future.","Revenue grew 20.6% in the fourth quarter and 18.4% for the full year. Net of healthcare pass-through revenue, and excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, total revenue grew 3.9% in the fourth quarter and 7.4% for the full year.","Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the second quarter hedge gain and WoodMac one-time acquisition costs, grew 22.5% to $263 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA grew 24% to $996 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 47.4%, excluding the $15.6 million third quarter warrant gain. And adjusted EBITDA margins excluding healthcare, acquisitions, and third quarter warrant gains were over 50% for the quarter and year-to-date.","Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 29% in the fourth quarter and 5.3% excluding healthcare and acquisitions. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by insurance. For the full year, Decision Analytics revenue grew 25.9% and 9.3% excluding healthcare and acquisitions.","Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by strong growth in loss quantification solutions with good contributions from insurance, anti-fraud claim solutions, and underwriting solutions. Catastrophe modeling solutions also contributed to the growth. Full year Decision Analytics insurance growth was a solid 8.1%.","Financial Services revenue declined 2.6% in the quarter due to project work in the prior-year period which did not recur this year. For the full year Financial Services revenue grew 20.5% as a result of media effectiveness project revenue and continued demand for analytic solutions and services in the U.S. and notably expanding globally.","The Healthcare business again performed slightly ahead of our internal forecast. Net of pass through revenue, Healthcare declined 2.4% in the quarter but grew 6.2% for the full year. Population solutions led the growth in the quarter while payment solutions led the growth for the full year. All areas contributed to full year growth and full year margins improved versus 2014.","Energy and specialized revenue increased 410% in the fourth quarter and 264% for the full year. Organic growth in the quarter was 4.3% and for the full year 5.1%. Commercial weather and climate analytics and environmental health and safety solutions led the growth.","WoodMac revenue in pounds and on a comparable basis declined 1% in the quarter and increased approximately 5% for the full year. For the period of our ownership, WoodMac contributed $211 million, slightly ahead of what we discussed with you last quarter despite exchange rate headwind.","We're pleased with WoodMac's performance in an extraordinary time for their customers. Annual contract value of signings were up in 2015. Customer retention remained strong and client engagement as measured by portal activity was up 26% versus 2014.","Turning to Risk Assessment. Revenue grew 5.4% in the quarter, indicating the value to our long-standing insurance customers. The overall increase within the segment was due in part to 5.5% revenue growth of industry-standard insurance programs resulting primarily from growth in 2015 invoices effective from January 1. Property-specific rating and underwriting revenue increased 4.9% in the quarter. Growth was a result of new sales with higher committed volumes. For the full year, Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.8% driven by 6% growth in industry standard programs and 5.1% growth in the property-specific rating and underwriting category.","As I mentioned earlier, EBIT (sic) [EBITDA] increased 22.5% in the quarter to $263 million resulting in EBITDA margins of 46.9%. Decision Analytics adjusted EBIT (sic) [EBITDA] increased 30.8% to $161 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions, growth of the business and lower professional services fees. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, second quarter WoodMac onetime items and the third quarter warrant gain. Decision Analytics adjusted EBITDA increased 3.7% in the quarter and 13% for the full year.","EBITDA margins for the Healthcare Analytics business net of pass-through expenses were 24.8% in the quarter and 25% for the full year. Fourth quarter 2015 EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 11.4% to $102 million as a result of good revenue growth, good expense management and the talent realignment costs in the prior period. Excluding the prior-period talent realignment cost, EBIT (sic) [EBITDA] grew 5.8% in the quarter and 8.8% for the full year.","Reported interest expense was $33 million in the quarter. At December 31, 2015 total debt was about $3.2 billion including about $870 million in revolver borrowings. Our leverage, at the end of fourth quarter was about 2.9 times. We'll remain committed to bring the leverage down to about 2.5 times by the end of 2016. Since the end of the fourth quarter we have paid an additional $165 million. Our cash and cash equivalents were about $138 million at the end of 2015.","Our reported effective tax rate was 30.3% in the quarter. For the full year 2015 the effective tax rate was 29.3%. Adjusted net income increased 28% to $138 million in the quarter and 28.1% to $520 million for the full year.","The average diluted share count was 172.6 million shares in the quarter. On December 31, 2015 our diluted share count was 172.2 million shares. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.80 in the quarter, an increase of 23.1%. For the full year adjusted EPS grew 28.8% to $3.09.","For shares purchased in the quarter, the average purchase price was $73.20. At December 31, 2015 the company had about $469 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs well above our cost of capital.","In 2015 free cash flow grew 33.5% compared with the prior-year period of $458 million and representing 46% of adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the 12 months of 2015. Growth in free cash flow is driven by improved profitability in the business and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the WoodMac acquisition.","Capital expenditures were $166 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $19 million over the same period in 2014. Capital expenditures were 8% of revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015. We continue to manage the capital intensity of the business and expect it to continue to move lower as it has over the past several years.","To think about your models for 2016, we expect CapEx of about $175 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $140 million, and amortization of intangibles of about $121 million. Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $130 million. We expect the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33%. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will use 28% to reflect the tax rate applicable to our intangible assets. And finally we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases.","As a reminder, first quarter of 2015 still had healthcare pass-through revenue included in the reported results. You will recall that after adjusting for the pass-through revenue of about $6.7 million, first quarter 2015 would have been $68.4. Also in the first quarter of 2015 we had about $11 million of project revenue at Argus, which had higher than average margins.","Overall we're pleased with the results for 2015 and excited by the plan for 2016 and the opportunities ahead. We expect to see growth from multiple verticals and we're managing the business to generate long-term shareholder returns. With that I'll turn it back to Eva for a comment before Q&A.","Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Chief Knowledge Officer","Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. This will give more people an opportunity to ask their questions. And with that I'll ask the operator to open up the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you. Good morning.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for the commentary about your revenue expectations. Could you talk about what gives you confidence that you'll be able to grow WoodMac in constant currency in 2016, given the 1% decline in the quarter? I know you're not going to give details about subscription versus service, but any color about what you were seeing on the subscription side, particularly around renewals would be very helpful?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So retention of customers remain strong and even in the first month-and-a-half of 2016 we're seeing strong year-over-year growth in terms of numbers of research subscriptions clients. We are seeing a increase in use of the portal, customer engagement is up 6% already in the year. So these are the kinds of things which basically relate to where we stand with our customers and is the source of our expectations for the year.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And so, I guess, is the expectation on the service side that you would continue to see pretty significant declines there, but it's less important as it becomes a smaller piece of the total?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're not really breaking that out, as you know, Sara, but I mean, our plan is for the whole business to perform.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then just separately on margins. Could you give us any color on how you're thinking about margins in 2016? Particularly because there were some hiring plans in Risk Assessment, I'm wondering if those have started to come through or if you would expect to ramp that next year or this year?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Good question. This is Mark, Sara. So first of all, let's start with 2015. We had some one-time items: the hedge gain, WoodMac transactions, the EVT, the warrant gains. So we'll pull that out and we remain positive and constructive with regard to margins in 2016. I do want to highlight two things that we tried to do. One, specifically, the talent realignment you mentioned. We would and we do expect people to be hired back to former levels. That's probably about 50 people, just to kind of give you a flavor of things, like around (18:31). And the other thing we did try to call out is that the project revenue of Argus in first quarter of 2015 was about $11 million. It had very high margins. So you have to just factor those two things in and hopefully that gives you some color on where we stand.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","The first question just around WoodMac again. I was just wondering if you could help characterize your organic growth guidance of WoodMac next year in the context of what you're assuming the energy environment is? And then also maybe in context, like is this, the Thomson Reuters announcement that you did, a sign of more to come and is that maybe a material contributor to showing that growth number for 2016?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We think there are additional channels for getting WoodMac content to market and we actually think that the number of customers that WoodMac will have in the years to come will be substantially greater than it is today and part of that is in fact the new channels. And we're very early in the journey on that particular front but I would definitely expect additional channel partnerships as a way of supplementing growth at WoodMac.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And just on the assumption for the energy environment...?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're never going to be folks to predict the price of oil. The thing that is our real bedrock on this business is the depth of relationship that WoodMac has with its customers. We actually performed in the fourth quarter or we completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 our Net Promoter Score assessment across all of Verisk and WoodMac came in with the second highest Net Promoter Scores across all of Verisk. Their customers love them. I was with the deputy chair of one of the name brand global energy companies a couple of weeks ago and they just \u2013 they love WoodMac and they find the content and the analysis absolutely indispensable and that's really the foundation of the business.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And then just real quickly I know in the comments you mentioned that you expect insurance growth to be at least as good as 2015. I was wondering if there was anything, any puts and takes to call out between the two divisions when we think about our models for the year?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Looking at you, Mark, I mean, it's kind of broad based. It's across almost everything that we do actually. Underwriting was strong in 2015, will be strong in 2016. I wouldn't really differentiate greatly among the different parts of what it is we do.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I agree.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Just on healthcare, I guess, can you elaborate what gives you reason to think that it will grow faster in 2016? And then you also alluded to obviously there's more options than just selling healthcare that you're looking at. Can you, if you're able to talk at all about what other options are front and center on the table right now?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, maybe your second question first. So from the very beginning we had all options on the table taking a very thorough look at the business and how to maximize value for our shareholders and the standing of the business and so nothing changed. There is nothing changed in that regard.","When we look at the growth of the business, part of it is we actually are having success in generating new revenue streams. I think you know that there was a lot of what we did on the revenue side that was related to Medicare Advantage. We started to do more work on the commercial side and that's a nice supplement to what we've traditionally done in the business.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then just on Argus, the marketing effectiveness type of projects, I know there's a tough comp in Q1 but when you gave your outlook in 2016 in terms of double-digit growth, are you counting on any other large lumpy projects at some point during the year when you say that?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think we've been \u2013 I think we've \u2013 for some time now been trying to make it clear that there are large name brand companies that sort of get interested in the methods and when they come in, they come in a fairly big way. There have actually been several of those in the course of 2015 and into 2016 that will be a part of the growth overall. So there will continue to be sort of these breakout kinds of moments. But as we've said, the project then ripens (23:38) into a sustainable subscription and that's fully what we expect.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, thank you. I caught the commentary from Mark in terms of annual contract value growth at WoodMac for the full year but as the year progressed, mainly as we got into the back half and into early 2016, has there been any weakening in bookings trend at WoodMac?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mentioned we've typically talked (sic) [not talked] about bookings. What I can tell you is that from a retention perspective, what we've seen in the end of the year and into even January\/February is we've had retention rates that are consistent with \u2013 consistently high with what we saw for full year 2014 and 2015. So we're comfortable, actually a kind of very good part of the WoodMac business is that retention with the customers. We also mentioned kind of broadly that the bookings have been up so that's the good news. I'm not sure we're not going to give color dating back to prior to ownership. I'm not sure we have that detail with us. Sorry.","Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just thinking about healthcare quarterly modeling, with the shift in mix towards I guess de-emphasizing a little bit Medicare Advantage as a percentage of mix in favor of commercial, how much does the seasonality shift in healthcare relative to prior years?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the short answer is that, I think we've talked about this in quite a bit of detail, but the MRA business, and the medical side of it in CMS, runs the SWEEPS from July to January, February. Typically what happens is the commercial side of this nicely fits in with \u2013 more in the first half of the year. But we're not going to talk as much about the details of Verisk Health given the strategic alternative process we're engaged in.","Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Can you give us a sense of I guess how pricing conversations have been going for WoodMac just as the year has progressed? And whether margins are still sort of \u2013 we should expect that sort of mid-40% number is still the right way to be thinking about it?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I think the reality is the contract renewals, given the nature of the customers and the pain our customers are feeling, is kind of one that is a little bit more challenging. We've tried to bundle solutions. We've tried to do things that kind of provide value to them and also provide us upside to the extent that the CapEx spend and profitability returns to our customers as they use more solutions that will give us some upside.","I think the combination of some of the work that we're doing to make the business; I'll call it a little bit more industrial \u2013 strength around IT and also to invest in the sales pipeline that gives us an extension to more people to sell it to.","But we've been investing from a sales perspective more, and we've also from a technology perspective so we can, for the most part, take some of the solutions and maybe smaller swaps and maybe more confined view, a little bit more downstream in the sense of smaller customers. And that will hopefully help us in the top line. So those investments probably have taken margins down a little bit and we would expect that in 2016 as well.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just, if you could give just a little bit more color on the business model of the Thomson Reuters partnership; is that going to be considered subscription? Or is it more like one \u2013 like data feed? And are you providing sort of data at a lower rate than you would in a direct subscription? And is there a similar margin profile for that? Thanks.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So let me try to take your questions, I'm not sure I'm going to do them in sequence but let me give it my best shot. First of all, the way the relationship with Reuters would be is it would be a kind of a subscription and access to a limited scope amount of information. If you wanted more you can buy different modules and different pieces. We've tried to take the data and cut some very big products into maybe smaller subsets, and provide it in a way that more people would be interested in it. Different groups of people, different customer sets.","So once again, the nature of the information businesses that we have, we would expect one, to be subscription; two, not a lot of incremental cost once you sell that implementation service, not a lot of incremental cost there. So I think we feel pretty good about the margins.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hi. You spoke a little fast I believe in the prepared remarks on WoodMac like-for-like growth in the fourth quarter, and does that include the couple of small WoodMac acquisitions? And if so, what would be the organic fourth quarter number, like-for-like?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So like-for-like is a negative 1%. So we said that it was in the quarter negative 1%, comparable basis and that was in pounds. And we said 5% full year. And that excludes the acquisitions.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","That excludes. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hello, Bill.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So I wanted to ask about the \u2013 if you look at the normalized, organic, constant currency growth rate for 2016, I think it would be helpful if you could frame for us the basis for drag that you're getting from WoodMac? I understand that WoodMac is still growing positively on a constant currency basis for 2016, but I'm trying to get at this normalized, organic, constant currency growth for 2016?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Bill, I think we're not going to give specific guidance. I think we've said it's going to grow next year, I think we feel good about the business. You've heard that. So I'm not sure I can directly answer your question without giving you a specific point target for WoodMac, which I'm not going to give here today.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, the \u2013 okay. Then second question. There's been some speculation in the media that you guys have been looking at Argus. Now I don't think any of us would expect you to comment on that speculation, though my question is what are you considering doubling-down in energy? By that I mean making a sizable acquisition in the energy space?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're always thinking about where do we sit and where do we want to go with respect to our customers. And I will say that having a sense, a good sense of where the price of the commodity is going as a part of a lot of the modeling that is already built into what it is that WoodMac does today.","So at a general level I would say that understanding the entire supply and demand picture is a useful thing to do. Now we already \u2013 I mean, if you subscribe to WoodMac product, you know that there are views of forward prices as well as the supply side volume as well as dollar value. So that will all continue to be a part of what we do and our thought process is entirely around what is it that we can do to bring more value to our customers and when we put A and B together do we unlock even more value for our customers? So we're constantly thinking about everything that we can do to increase value so I'm not going to comment on that specific situation but just generally we're very active in thinking about where we are and where we ought to be.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One of the conversations I've heard you had with investors over the last 12 months to 18 months with regard to healthcare is the sort of value of the data in your healthcare business compared to the data across your other businesses and I assume that the relative value of healthcare data is one of the things that has led to this exploration of alternatives.","We recently saw IBM buy Truven for a pretty big price tag. How does that influence your overall view of the value of the healthcare data in your business? Is it distinct from Truven's data? Just a little compare\/contrast and whether or not sort of directionally that influences the range of outcomes possibly for that business at Verisk?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, so first of all our business, there are I would say small overlaps with Truven. In fact there are bilateral commercial agreements between us and Truven. But in general, their business is by degrees different than our business. So I wouldn't really use it as a particularly meaningful marker and we're very focused on how to \u2013 the business that we've got, what are the future opportunities, how can they be maximized and how do we maximize shareholder value for our shareholders? So yes, of course we've referenced things that are going on like that transaction but in reality I think that our situation is relatively custom.","To the point about data, the basic point I would make to you is that obviously data is very important in the data analytic kind of work that we do and others do and everyone \u2013 all of the third-party vendors do but the distinction that we're trying to draw is when you look at the vast majority of the data that we've got inside of the insurance vertical, the financial services, retail banking vertical, and the oil and gas, metals and mining vertical, a lot of what we've got is very, very unique. The nature of regulation and industry structure in the healthcare world in the United States makes it relatively harder to have distinct data assets. That's the point that we've trying to stress. So it's not that we don't have data. We actually have a lot of data. But we very much want Verisk to be a highly distinctive, very differentiated partner to our customers. And one of the things that provides distinction is unique data assets. And they're just harder to achieve in the healthcare space.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks and good morning. Just a couple questions.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Can you \u2013 on the talent realignment where you said that you'll be doing about 50 new hires, is that pretty steady throughout the year in 2016? And could that have a favorable revenue impact maybe looking forward to 2017?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, let me remind you of the goal of the talent realignment. We did try to take what would be our more traditional ISO solutions business inside of Risk Assessment and focus this on kind of a shared services model, trying to take groups and become more efficient and more effective. And I congratulate the team on the work that was done there. We then took those resources and we said we were going to kind of invest in new products and in new segments. And our hope is that, yeah, that type of investment would lead us towards kind of sustainable growth in the future. And it's probably a little bit of a longer-term march than a short-term march but we're optimistic like we described earlier in those initiatives.","With regard to timing, I think we've seen quite a few people hired in the latter part of 2015 and into the first quarter here of 2016. So although, I think you're right, it will kind of extend throughout the year, I think there's a little bit more of a push or an emphasis here in the first half.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll just add, I am very excited by the quality of the people we're attracting into the business. These are world-class people, global perspective. They are definitely going to help raise our analytic sights and just the quality and depth of what it is we do. It's very, very encouraging to people that we can attract to Verisk.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And lastly on the tax on amortization. I think the guidance there was 26% before and now it's up to 28%. I was just curious what drove the increase?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So what we did was we took a best guess back at the time. And remember, the world of purchase accounting and developing how much amortization runs through your books is something that won't be finalized until mid-2016. We gave you our best guess, we have a more refined estimate as to how much amortization is coming through and the amount as it relates to WoodMac is down a little bit from those original estimates, meaning that the U.K. rate is a little less pronounced or weighted in the calculation.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the answers.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna.","James Friedman - Susquehanna International Group","Scott, I appreciated your dimensions you shared on the growth prospects for 2016. I wanted to ask you about your comment about your insurance assets. Would you anticipate that both RA and insurance in DA will accelerate next year?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","James Friedman - Susquehanna International Group","Okay. And then if you could comment \u2013 I know that pricing is working through the system now on the ISO database and Risk Assessment. So, could you update us as to how much of that is still on the look back of prior period premiums and what some of the inputs are for pricing on RA overall?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So we, I think we have shared with you in the past that sort of the mix of revenue sources in that part of the business has changed, where it used to be that most every customer was being priced according to a two-year look back on premiums. But we're now at a point where more than 50% of what we do in RA is on multi-year agreements, not related at all to what was happening in the premiums two years prior.","And then with respect to the rest of our customer base, where we still do reference premiums from two years before, just want to remind you that there are three terms in the pricing algorithm and premium is only one of the three. And we have complete freedom with respect to the other two, which is mill rate and the flat fees. And so the actual, literal effect of what is going on in the premium environment is actually very muted at this point. And it's really value-based pricing. It's the work that we do every year to try enhance and bring current what it is that we're providing to our customers. Our customers understand the value of that kind of work and it's really on that basis that we set the prices.","James Friedman - Susquehanna International Group","Helpful. Thanks a lot.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you so much. You had mentioned on the adjusted EBITDA margin when we take out the gain on sale of the third-party warrants, I think it was 47.4% for 2015, and then you said you were constructive on margins going forward. Does that mean you expect margins to go up in 2016 from that base?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All right. What I tried to say was that I would caveat that positive just with the two adjustments I described. One, I mentioned the talent realignment. I kind of pointed to about 50 people, which would be some expense in Risk Assessment. We've talked about that over time. And the other thing I was just trying to call out was in first quarter of 2015, Argus had that revenue that was very high margins. It was about $11 million of project work. So I was trying to call out those two items in the context of what is a fundamentally sound and positive margin picture going forward.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just going back to Argus, you mentioned what the project revenue was in 1Q 2015. Can you give us that number 4Q 2014 just so we can see how the quarter you just reported compare?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I'm not sure we've provided that in the past. It's not \u2013 it's notable as first quarter. I don't think we've given that out in the past. I'm sorry.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. No worries. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Thanks for taking the call.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","I had a quick question. Maybe a little more insight on Infield and PCI Group in specialized markets and kind of the impact, how much that could possibly move the needle in 2016?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We haven't really put out the absolute size of those but I would just encourage you to think of both of those as modest tuck-ins.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. All right. And obviously Argus is still doing well. Are you hearing anything else in the financial services vertical on demand in regards to macro? Or does that seem stable?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually, some of the fundamentals in the business are actually quite exciting. And one that I would point is the success that we're having in getting consortia of banks in end markets other than the United States to come into our method, and it's really very exciting because when that happens then we're essentially platformed in the market and now we can do \u2013 now we can bring the whole range of solutions that we've got. So we have several very exciting developments right now along those lines. But with respect to the macro environment, I mean, we've referenced it. I would encourage you to just understand. It's not really material as it relates to the prospects for the business going forward. No, it's kind of steady as she goes.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The macro environment.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Great. Thanks, guys.","Mark V.

This is Zach Bakal on for Anj. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to first ask again about that Argus segment and I think for the full year your commentary has been pretty consistent that you expect a high teens growth and we had a little bit better than that. I'm just wondering if that was a little bit stronger than you expected and that if that's just driven maybe by the consortia of banks or something else?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would tell you that Argus is a wonderful business. I mean I just always like to mention that again. It has an incredible data asset that kind of creates a real barrier there and what the team there has been able to do is two things. One, provide great service and new products to those customers. And then we have the project revenue that is a little bit more related to the marketing and advertising effectiveness. We're trying to transition that to more subscription and I think we're being successful.","So what we try to call out from an outlook perspective is that we continue to see very strong double digit growth and that is a growth even with or even kind of assuming the growth where that's going to happen in first quarter. So I felt we were trying to pretty transparent on that and hopefully that just clarifies the comments we made earlier.","Zachary Bakal - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks. I think we all appreciate that. And then just secondly on the Telematics Data Exchange, you know what we've been reading of that, it's getting prepared for say a June launch. We haven't really heard any additional partnerships aside from the one you already mentioned with OnStar and GM. Have you been able to build any additional partnerships? And will the program require any further partnerships to launch in June?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So in reverse order, we can start serving insurance companies even without additional OEMs in the partnership. One of the things you have to reference by the way is how advanced or not each OEM is with respect to the connected car movement. So some had gotten on with it more. Others less, GM has actually been a leader. That's one of the reasons why we were so excited about striking the partnership with them.","But no, we can and will and are selling the data and the analytics into the insurance vertical beginning with the rollout of the platform. And as we add additional OEMs, the value just simply goes up, but we don't have to wait for that. And as you'd imagine, the team is out and having a lot of conversations with a lot of OEMs domestically and globally to promote the method. So this is a very \u2013 this is something we talk about very frequently inside of the management team, and we have great hopes for this and a lot of focus on this.","Zachary Bakal - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","There's a lot of interest from us as well.

Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I think both of my questions have been answered, but I guess one piece I was hoping to maybe push a little bit more back to the WoodMac color, I know you're not giving any specific guidance, but I think the other businesses you have given at least directional color on how you're thinking about growth in 2016 versus 2015. So versus the 5%, is there any color that you can provide whether up or down from there, knowing that there's a wide range for positive?","Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I'm going to say it again. I said that it's going to grow, and I think we've been trying to be a little bit more transparent with regards to an outlook. I think that's as far as we're going to go at this point, and I hope you can respect that.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Then I think aerial imagery is an area you talk a lot about in the past, and we know you continue to innovate in a lot of parts of your business that don't necessarily get as much air time. I was wondering if there was any update on what you're up to there and the effect we can expect that to have on the insurance growth?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So you may have noticed last year that we actually put out a press release that we were sourcing images again. And that's on our \u2013 based on our own efforts, but we're also working with others to source imagery. What makes it really special is the analysis that converts it into solutions that can be used by insurance companies and players and other industry verticals.

This call is being recoded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Director of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen. Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.","David E. Cohen - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, Scott, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2016 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark, and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.","Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. All discussions of EBITDA reflect adjusted EBITDA, for which you can find a reconciliation in our press release. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I'll remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone.","In the fourth quarter, we again delivered solid revenue growth, leading margins and strong underlying cash generation. The resilience of our financial performance while facing currency and energy and end market headwinds, reflects the distinctiveness of our businesses, the outstanding dedication of our people, and the value we deliver to our customers.","In addition to a successful 2016, our initiatives during the year position us well to execute on our plans for 2017. Revenue from continuing operations grew 6% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the year. Organic constant currency revenue grew about 6% in the quarter and for the full year. With almost 8% growth in the quarter from our combined insurance and financial services businesses, the long-term underlying trends remain encouraging. WoodMac finished the year slightly better than flat, a remarkable achievement, given the end market headwinds. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins in the quarter and for the full year of around 50%.","EBITDA growth was around 7% in the quarter and excluding the prior year warrant sale gain was about 12% for the full year. Diluted adjusted EPS grew about 8% in the quarter and for the year and about 11% excluding the prior year warrant gain. Year-to-date, free cash flow was up 16%, excluding the one-time tax on the gain on the healthcare business sale. We were pleased to continue returning capital to our shareholders through our longstanding share repurchase program. We bought $144 million of stock in the quarter and after an additional $500 million authorization. We had over $600 million available as of December 31, 2016.","With our leverage below our 2.5 times reference level, we have plenty of capacity to make strategically relevant acquisitions, as well as additional repurchases. We made a number of tuck-in acquisitions in 2016 and early this year, which collectively have brought us new data sets, adjacent solutions, distinctive analytics, additional markets to serve, and outstanding data analytics talent. In many cases, the acquisitions also accelerate our strategies, at a lower cost relative to a build approach.","We benefit from our flexibility to decide whether to innovate organically or via acquisitions. We remain active in evaluating possible transactions in pursuit of our international expansion and vertical enhancement efforts. The foundations of our businesses remain the Verisk distinctives of one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first to market innovations; and four, deep integration into our customer workflows.","Our success is due to the outstanding efforts of our people, who enhanced the distinctiveness of our business, as we focus on serving our customers with innovative data analytics solutions. We feel very good about our ability to serve our customers and drive top-line growth for the long-term as a result. We are well-positioned for 2017 with contributions expected from existing and newly acquired businesses. We continue to invest in innovation, and I'm excited about the multi-year opportunities for solutions under development this year.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Mark for some additional comments.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, Scott.","Across our businesses which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we had several key industry themes, including vertical big data, industry automation, and digital engagement. As we serve our customers with these themes in mind, we made a number of tuck-in acquisitions to complement our organic efforts. We made two acquisitions to enhance our strong position in extreme event modeling. Analyze Re extends AIR's capabilities farther downstream by providing real-time solutions for reinsurance treaty pricing, enterprise portfolio roll-up, and portfolio optimization.","Last month, we acquired Arium, which provides modeling solutions and analytics for the casualty market. Our vision is to leverage Arium's capabilities to allow us to do for casualty analytics, what we've done for property analytics. Arium's solutions provide analytics for liability exposures, including visual and quantitative insights into accumulations in areas of risk concentration. These acquisitions got us to market faster and at a lower cost than if we had built the solutions ourselves.","We also acquired MarketStance, a leading provider of data analytics solutions that enable insurers to identify high potential market segments of interest. This gives us a broader set of solutions with which to serve our customers' marketing departments.","Another of our recent acquisitions was The GeoInformation Group, a leader in geographic data solutions based in the UK, where we are expanding. The GeoInformation Group offers large-scale mapping services and geospatial data and analytics solutions to a wide array of companies and public sector organizations. This acquisition complements our risk management and predictive analytic capabilities internationally and expands Verisk's footprint in the UK across multiple verticals including insurance, energy, and real estate.","Finally, just last week, we acquired Healix Risk Rating, a leader in automated risk assessment at the point-of-sale for the travel insurance industry. This acquisition further expands our Risk Assessment offerings for the global insurance industry, providing solutions that are embedded in our customer workflows and can help our insurers underwrite travel insurance with greater speed, accuracy and efficiency. These tuck-in acquisitions are close to our core insurance business and support our deep analytic expertise, unique data and global focus.","With that, let me turn the call over to Eva to cover the financial results.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, Mark.","In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we again grew both revenue and EBITDA, while also investing in solutions with meaningful long-term potential revenue streams. Revenue in the fourth quarter grew 6% and 6.2% organically in constant currency. For the full year, revenue grew 13.3% and 5.8% organically in constant currency. Our combined insurance and financial services businesses grew 7.9% in the quarter and 6.9% for the full year.","As a reminder, organic constant currency growth excludes the contribution from recent acquisitions and reflects current period exchange rates applied to prior period revenue. EBITDA grew 7% to $258 million in the quarter and 11.9% to $1 billion for the full year. The full-year growth excludes the 2015 warrant sale gain. EBITDA margins were 50.9% in the quarter and 50.4% for the full year.","Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 6.5% and 7.3% organically in constant currency. Again, this quarter, financial services was the fastest growing vertical, while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to growth. For the full year, Decision Analytics revenue grew 18.5% and 6.3% organically in constant currency.","Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 7.5% in the fourth quarter. Organic growth was 7.3% in the quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by strong growth in underwriting solutions, with good contributions from claims analytics and repair cost estimating solutions. Catastrophe modeling solutions also contributed to growth.","For the full year, revenue grew 8.1% on a reported and organic basis. The full-year Decision Analytics insurance growth is consistent with what we delivered in 2015. Customer retention remains very high, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth.","Energy and specialized markets category revenue declined 0.3% in the quarter and increased 43.4% for the full year. On a constant currency basis, WoodMac was up slightly for the full year. We were expecting the results to be about flat, and as a result we were pleased with the performance.","Consistent with our longstanding approach, WoodMac became a part of organic revenues starting in the third quarter. Revenue for energy and specialized markets excluding the recent acquisitions declined 5.5% in the quarter and for the full year, primarily as a result of the continuing end market and currency headwinds affecting the energy business.","Financial services category revenue increased 27.3% in the quarter and 10.1% for the full year. Growth was driven by analytical and media effectiveness solutions. Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.1% and 4.4% organically in the quarter, continuing to demonstrate the value to our longstanding insurance customers, contributions of newer solutions, and the inclusion of recent acquisitions.","Risk Assessment growth was 5.2% and 5% organically for the full year. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.9% in the quarter and 5.4% organically, reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions such as Predictive Models and Electronic Rating Content. Growth was 5.6% for the full year and 5.3% organically.","Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 2.6% in the quarter and 1.4% organically. Growth was led by underwriting solutions revenue. For the full year, growth was 4% and 3.7% organically.","EBITDA increased 7% in the quarter to $258 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.9%. For the full year, EBITDA increased 9.9%, resulting in margins of 50.4% and, adjusted for the 2015 warrant gain, grew 11.9%.","Reported interest expense was $28 million in the quarter and $120 million for the full year. At December 31, 2016, total debt was about $2.4 billion, including about $100 million of revolver borrowings. Our pro forma leverage at the end of the fourth quarter was about 2.2 times. Since the end of the fourth quarter, we've repaid an additional $70 million.","Our cash and cash equivalents were about $135 million at the end of 2016. Our reported effective tax rate was 32.9% in the quarter. For the full year 2016, the effective tax rate was 30.9%. Adjusted net income increased 5.5% to $135 million in the quarter and 10.1% to $532 million for the full year.","Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.80 in the quarter, an increase of 8.1%. For the full year, adjusted EPS grew 8.4% to $3.11. Diluted adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the full year increased because of organic growth in the business, acquisitions, and lower interest expense. The increases were partially offset by higher fixed asset depreciation expense, higher taxes, and a higher share count. Excluding the 2015 warrant gain, adjusted EPS grew 10.7% for the full year.","The average diluted share count was 170.2 million shares in the quarter, and on December 31, 2016 our diluted share count was 169.5 million shares. We repurchased 1.8 million shares in the quarter for a total return of capital to shareholders of $144 million. At December 31, 2016, we had $636 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. As Scott mentioned, we added an additional $500 million in December. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital.","Free cash flow increased 20.8% to $498 million for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2016, excluding the $100 million tax on the gain of the sale of the healthcare business and the $19 million ESOP payment. Free cash flow excluding the tax and ESOP payments was 49.5% of EBITDA. These numbers are all for continuing operations. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise, and therefore shareholder value.","Capital expenditures were $146 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $7 million over the same period in 2015. Capital expenditures were 7.3% of revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016.","As you think about your models for 2017, currency will continue to be a headwind, with the strongest effect in the first quarter and continuing through the year, given the current sterling-U.S. dollar rates. On a reported basis, this will affect the normal quarterly progression we typically see. In 2016, the exchange rate averaged $1.44 before the June Brexit vote and $1.36 for the full year. At December 31, 2016, the rate was $1.23. At $1.23, 2016 revenue would have been about $25 million lower than reported, with the greatest impact in first quarter.","In addition to the revenue impact, currency will also have a downward impact on margins. Depending upon your prior FX assumptions, please keep the lower currency in mind as you review your 2017 and forward estimates. In addition, you will recall that in first quarter of 2016, we had several million dollars of one-time true-up revenue in Decision Analytics insurance, which we discussed with you last year.","And finally, please keep in mind that the tuck-in acquisitions are not yet at scale, and therefore are lower margin than the corporate average but proportionate to their size. The acquisitions we are doing are close to the core with well defined path to top line growth and margin expansion. The net of many of these factors is that we expect to see much more of a progression in both revenue and EBITDA, as we move through the year.","In addition, we expect CapEx of about $160 million to $165 million. This reflects the opportunities we have to invest in some newer areas, in many cases related to people which fall both under operating and capital expenditures. Fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $125 million, and amortization of intangibles of about $90 million. Based on our current debt balances and interest rates we expect interest expense to be around $115 million, and we estimate the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33%.","In the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% for the tax effect on intangible amortization. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of 171.2 million shares.","We're pleased with our 2017 plan while being mindful of the currency headwinds. We are excited about the opportunities to invest, looking to drive long-term profitable growth. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long-term.","We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up.","And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. First, just I wanted to ask for a little bit more color on the insurance vertical. I guess, the growth while you had talked last quarter that you didn't expect that part of the business to accelerate this year, I guess, it still seems to have been probably a little slower than you used to see. So can you talk about the puts and takes that you're seeing just, I guess, within that vertical?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Hi, Tim. This is Mark. Just I want to give you the color you're asking for. First of all, I think, we continue to feel very good about the insurance vertical overall, the combination of greater customer engagement in form of better interactions, higher level interactions, big topics being discussed, as well as a lot of new innovations we're excited by. Inside some of the macro, you do have some headwinds with regard to the world of premium growth industry consolidation, but I think those are to a lesser extent kind of more distinct and I think the team performed well, inside of a couple of, what I refer to as some industry slowdown, but we maintain a very positive outlook for the future.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","I guess just a follow-up in the context of that, I guess, tougher industry environment I assume that's going to continue into 2017. Would you expect the growth rate to stay at a little lower level in that environment? And is that the kind of way you're thinking about it now or how are you thinking about it?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So I would say to you that if you are focused on kind of the industry premium growth, a lot of our contracts now have kind of moved beyond and away from that. So there is clearly a focus on procurement and cost containment inside of our customers, so that's a little bit of what I was referring to. But in what I see is a lot of industry automation that's happening, people are relooking at processes, people are relooking at how their systems operate, and that has given us some big opportunities and some nice pipeline.","The other thing I'll highlight as we continue to be talking about here, kind of U.S. premium growth, we continue to have aspirations and some opportunities that extend beyond United States, and the international global expansion remains a key priority for us as we look forward. So, I think we remain positive across the board there. I hope that's responsive.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. And just to continue on that, one follow-up. The cat modeling area seems to have been the slowest growing part this quarter for Decision Analytics, as it was last quarter. I recognize the issues in the reinsurance sector, but are you comfortable that you are still picking up as much market share as you were in the past? You seem to have grown faster relative to your main competitor there even in the past, I guess versus lately.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So I think we are continuing to make a lot of progress there. You've probably hit on couple of the topics, although a smaller piece, the world of insurance-linked transactions is a little lighter so that probably has brought some of that revenue down a little bit. More importantly though, we from the standpoint of working with insurers and reinsurers we have been growing like we have in the past. I don't think there's any slowdown there. When we talk about industry trends though, there is a headwind relative to when \u2013 if there's industry consolidation among insurers. So you see some of that inside the growth as well.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Scott, I guess with reference to your comments early on in terms of being well-positioned for 2017 with new and existing solutions, I was hoping you could maybe touch on some of the new ones you were referring to, and if that changes the \u2013 I guess the trend in the growth rates you are seeing right now, if there's any material pickup that we should expect in 2017.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","The innovations are very broadly based. They cover many, many different aspects of the insurance value chain, and I'll just reference a few, but there are really so many. So we're working on helping our customers that are doing aggregate portfolio analytics with better portfolio tools. This relates in parts to what we added with Analyze Re.","We have platforms which speed up the underwriting process. We have new data sets, which relate to among other things, the underwriting of auto policies, which is related to the Telematics Data Exchange. We're making better use of remote imagery in helping the claims and increasingly the underwriting processes to move ahead.","We're bringing new forms of data management to the insurance vertical. One of the things that \u2013 and Mark was referencing this before, the big data movements. Last year, I spent a good deal of time with the CEOs of our largest customers. They are very interested in the nature of their technical environments. Everything from our potential conversion to more of a cloud basis, in terms of our computing being a primary consideration, but they realized that like a lot of companies in the world today, that we need to grow beyond the first version of the enterprise data warehouse movement, which was actually a late 1990s, early 2000 thing.","So these are very, very significant topics for our customers, and I can keep going on, the overlap between energy and insurance. So it's very broadly based and that's consistent with who we are basically. We're very deeply engaged with our customers and so that's why we're able to move out on such a broad set of fronts.","And Mark referenced before the macro environment, balancing the macro environment in the United States, as he said, is the fact that our ambitions are global and we've really had much less activity in non-domestic markets, but that's a factor which is here and which I believe will be increasingly significant as we go forward, so very pleased with where we sit.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And then in terms of a follow-up, just with respect to CapEx, again I guess if fell in 2016 at least on a dollar basis and it's ticking back up. I mean, are there any unusual items in there or one-time-ish that need to be called out or just looking at it forward, should we think of 7.5% to 8% as the new normal for the CapEx spend?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Hey, Manav, it's Eva. Good morning. Just in terms of CapEx, I think, the numbers when you said it fell and it did not fall in dollars if you're looking on an apples-to-apples basis, remember we have continuing ops and we have the divestiture of Verisk Health. So I think as I said in the script, you actually saw dollar growth in the year. The percentage was about 7.3% in the year, so as we've talked about we've been managing that CapEx. We had some investment over a several year period where it kind of peaked and now we're kind of bringing that back down. What we're doing though really is we're striking the balance between being efficient with the dollars we're spending and ensuring that we're investing in that internally developed software, which is a lot of the platforming that we've been talking about.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it, thank you.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Eva, it's Andrew. Given the healthy margins in the fourth quarter, I wanted to know if the company is positioned to have margin expansion in 2017 including the comments that you made about FX in the small acquisitions.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So thanks for the question, Andrew. I think as we think about EBITDA margins, as you know there are a mix of number of things that go in there. FX is certainly a weight on margins and the acquisitions, as we said, the small tuck-ins, I think their margins are appropriate for the stage of development they're in, but they are a drag on margins. So while we're not giving specific guidance in terms of the margin, I would say that those are probably the balancing factors you should consider when you think about your model.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Could you give us a sense of size of those two factors?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I think that if you were to think about \u2013 we gave you the dollars of revenue on FX. That's about a $25 million drag, just apples-to-apples, if we were to use constant currency here. In terms of the acquisition margins, you can look just in the filings, we'll be happy to walk you through the math after the call, the margins for those, and so I think you'll be able to figure that into your model.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thank you. Just given the insurance industry comments, is the annual invoicing impact this year similar order of magnitude to past years to recent years?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So this is Mark. I just want to make sure I have the question. We have typically and traditionally invoiced around the holidays in anticipation of the future year. So this would be December of 2016.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Correct.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Timing and everything is unchanged. I think the second part of your question, I'm going to read into it is that I think with every passing year we've started to engage with our biggest customers to put in place what are longer-term contracts that are unrelated to premium. So what you'll see is a majority of that revenue that we would typically talk about in industry-standard programs is now unrelated to premium. It's all about a negotiated outcome. If they want to add a new service, obviously, there would be additional fees to be charged. But everything is consistent with the past. It's probably a little less focused on premium going forward.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. And then in terms of the increased cadence of tuck-in M&A, including a lot in the insurance vertical, is this just a moment in time where there's a flurry or is there something that's changed, whether it's culturally making everybody part of the M&A team or something about the end markets, something strategically, just a comment on the increased cadence of tuck-in M&A?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You really answered your own question. We about, I don't know, maybe 18 months ago or so, we basically really began campaigning throughout the entire company for the notion that everybody is on the M&A team. And what we mean by that specifically and relating this to the interest of our shareholders, because we're walking the hallways of our customers' offices on a daily basis, we actually have intelligence that is not available broadly in the world. And in specific, we get a chance to see other companies that are perhaps emerging and at least beginning to make a difference for our mutual customers. And so we've really just hit very hard the idea that that intelligence is an additional source of value for our shareholders. And so we have really engaged at an even deeper level with the folks in our business units, and this is the result basically.","So no, I don't think that this is \u2013 it is a moment in time in the sense that we've put an increased emphasis on this at a point in time about 18 months ago. But I don't think it's a transient phenomenon. I don't know that we'll always be putting points on the board at exactly this rate. We'll see how it goes, nor do we start with the assumption that it's all about size. If they're strategic, we're happy to do midsized deals, large deals, smaller deals. But I would encourage you to think of the smaller deals as reflective of a very active strategy which is about expanding our source as a value for our customers. And as Eva said in her remarks, there's just a balance here between buy and build, and we're very open to what gets us to the valuable place fastest. So no, not a moment in time although something did change in our environment.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I'm wondering just, Mark and Scott, as a follow-up on some of the competitive questions, particularly insurance. Is there anything you're seeing changing on the ground as far as new competition or new technology? And I'm thinking specifically within underwriting and maybe even geospatial and aerial imaging.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I wouldn't really point to new competition. I think that there are classes of folks that have money to invest who have been on the theme of insurance and are in and around it. I think a couple of private equity players and then there are a couple of operating companies that have had the theme for a while. But when you look at the actual operations that are out there assembling information, creating solutions, et cetera, it's really a very slowly \u2013 almost no change actually in terms of the cast of characters. So ownership may shift some, but the actual on-the-ground operation and delivery, I don't really see that changing very much.","What you do have at the margin are some companies that come more from a big data horizontal methods approach and attempt to work their way into the insurance industry, actually not just the insurance industry, but if you think about all of our verticals, that's a theme out there, which is one of the reasons why we really beat the drum for vertically-oriented data analytics, because we really think that's a very strong place to stand and it's in the verticals the proprietary data grow up.","So there are those kinds of players who are out there. And of course there is technical innovation as well. So for example, if you were to pick the category of drones, there is a list of companies who would like to help outfits you with one or two or three or five drones. That list of companies is as long as both of my arms. But the literal difference that they're making in the insurance industry today is low, is very low, very modest. And so no, I don't really \u2013 the bottom line is and this is actually true of everything that we do, competition does not fundamentally determine our opportunity or what it is that we're doing. It is all about our relationship with the customers and our ability to really understand their needs and harness methods and technology and data and get them to where they need to be. That is what makes the difference between \u2013 or spells the outcome in terms of, for example, our growth rate.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And when I look at WoodMac with the churn in oil prices, I'm wondering if 2017 is likely to be a significantly more positive growth year, how are you thinking about your view on WoodMac business this year?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Let me characterize generally and Eva might care to add something. But the point I really want to emphasize here is really the tremendous performance of Wood Mackenzie in the face of kind of historic conditions. And I was impressed last year spending time with the CEOs and senior members of WoodMac's customer set as well as our others, was how much depth of relationship WoodMac enjoys, we enjoy with our customers and the regard that customers have for us. And a very active set of new product initiatives, which I think are aimed at just exactly where the industry is. And so that's the bedrock. Those are the things which are really core.","But definitely the conditions in 2017 are better than they were in 2016 and 2016 was at least the stabilization relative to 2015. So yes, the environment's moving in the right direction. And it's another part of our forward view of being very pleased with where we are with WoodMac. Eva, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes, I was just going to add I think if you wanted to start with customer retention remained very high in 2016 despite what was obviously a challenging environment. And so that's really the basis on which we start to grow going forward, we start with the existing clients. One thing just to keep in mind is, as Scott talked about, we have new products. There's lots of things that we can sell. The fundamental base of WoodMac remains our subscription business. And so that will \u2013 as it creates stability in a downturn, it also takes a little while for that to kind of pick back up. So I think we're very positive on WoodMac, just remember that subscriptions don't turn on a dime, but I think we're optimistic about 2017.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari, your line is open.","Kayvon Rahbar - Macquarie Group","Yes, hi. This is Kayvon. I'm filling in for Hamzah. I have a question for you guys about the Decision Analytics business. How much of that is subscription and how much room do you guys think you have for converting it \u2013 for conversion, how has that been going over time?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I think what you'll see is, I mean, you will less subscription in Decision Analytics and Risk Assessments, but still a very, very high level, and overall we're at about 80%, 85% in the whole company. It's interesting, because I think what you tend to see is as we're converting certain parts of that business too from transactional to subscription, we're bringing in actually new solutions which tend to start transactional. So I don't expect that over time you're going to see a grand shift in that as long as we're doing what we want to do which is create those new solutions.","Kayvon Rahbar - Macquarie Group","All right, thank you.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. This is Patrick in for Toni. So the first question is I'm wondering if you guys are expecting financial services to achieve another year of double-digit growth in 2017.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So as we think about our company, I think the way we've really framed it for the market is the total growth of the company and aiming for the organic growth that we've talked about historically rather than parsing it into individual segments. Certainly financial services has been a strong pro forma for us, and we think there are a lot of things going on within that area that are pretty exciting. But I wouldn't put a specific growth rate on it at the moment for you.","Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. And then it looks like normalized free cash flow conversion ticked up a few points year-over-year but remained below the 60% of EBITDA target you've talked about in the past. Is 60% still your target? And if so can you talk about some of the leverage you have to reach that goal?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I'm not quite sure where the 60% target is coming from. I don't know that that's something that we've stated. I think that we were very pleased with the conversion of the free cash flow. Clearly, there are just a couple of things that come out after you have EBITDA, I mean, you've got to pay taxes, so certainly we do that as we should. I would say that the working capital remains a positive contributor there. CapEx would be the other offset. So I think, fundamentally, we feel good about where we are in terms of free cash flow generation.","Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks, Eva.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW. Your line is open.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Just a couple quick questions. On Risk Assessment, specifically property-specific underwriting, the organic there seem to have ticked down a bit sequentially. I was just wondering if that was due to anything specific.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So first of all, it's business as usual in property-specific. If you actually kind of look through 2016, you'll see the revenue there per quarter is anywhere from $42.4 million each quarter inching up about to about $42.7 million. We did sign a couple nice contracts in fourth quarter of 2015, so that helped us in 2015, probably creates a bit of a grow over in the fourth quarter of 2016, but I think it's a wonderfully consistent business that's had some stable growth.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And just a last question still on Risk Assessment. Is the hiring there basically complete now or is that still ongoing?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","It's a good question. I think we are getting through it, signing the right people. We're very selective, and we had some new initiatives in Risk Assessment that we're excited by and we're going to probably bring in some talent to lead those efforts. So not completely done. I think that will continue to have or add some expense inside of Risk Assessment as we progress through 2017.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you very much for the answers.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I wanted to ask the growth rate question for the individual businesses a little bit differently. Is there anything we should be aware of from a business perspective that would impact the present growth rate that we exited 2016, heading into 2017, obviously excluding the FX in those individual business lines?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. I mean we're back to the same point we were on before, which is we've noted what's in the macro environment. And Eva talked about currency, Mark talked about the in the moment condition of the insurance industry. I would just add the financial services companies are wondering where they're at right now. U.S. financial services companies maybe on the one hand, there will be some deregulation, and on the other hand they've been dealing with mounting compliance requirements and have felt some squeeze on the bottom line, and we've talked about the environment in at WoodMac.","But the counterpoint to all of that is our program of investments, and creating new solutions and our ever deepening relationships with our customers. Those two things are the wellspring of our future performance.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. Okay.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","And we feel very good about those things.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And how should we think about the breakdown or the focus of investments in 2017? Anything you'd like to call out as areas that you're keenly focused on outside of the international growth? Thanks.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. I mean I would say that we're investing across all the different verticals that we're in and pretty excited. I think international growth is certainly a highlight as well. So I think it's pretty broad-based.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","We have noted for you all in the past that there is an increasing software intensity to our business which is essentially another way of saying that we're a solutions-oriented company. And I think that that's a true statement. But we've moved into that position over the last couple of years. I think I don't know that the relative software intensity is going up from where we are, but that's a drumbeat inside the business.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks so much. And just looking at the cost of revenue in the quarter that you booked, it was fairly high compared to last year. Were there any one-time items going on either this year or last year, and is this the kind of rate we should look for going forward in 2017?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I think the best way to think about it is in aggregate. And as we think about the business and the cost of revenue versus SG&A, sometimes there are things that, that balance between those depending upon where we are in development versus implementation of those solutions. So I don't think that there's any conclusion to draw from that as you look forward to 2017.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So let me ask the question another way. If I take the combination of cost of revenue and SG&A again, the run rate that we saw in the fourth quarter would be something we'd use for 2017?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I think that's certainly a starting point. Again, I think there are a number of things that go on within those numbers, but that would be the baseline (43:40).","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right, and one more quick numbers question. What should we be looking forward for stock based compensation this year?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I don't think that you'll see any grand shifts in that.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, good morning. I know you had a couple points about your international expansion goals being part of the M&A strategy, and I know you now have a hub in the UK on the back of the WoodMac acquisition. I was just wondering how we should think about your focus on UK businesses as opposed to other parts of the EU, given each country there operates very locally.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah, so let me start there and then maybe Mark will fill in with a little bit of detail around the insurance vertical specifically. But at the general level, first of all, we have beefed up our corporate development capability in Europe and we're in the process of beefing it up in Asia as well, so it's really an around-the-globe view of our opportunities. And that expresses itself both as acquisition. You've seen some of that in the more recent acquisitions, also partnerships, and we really like both flavors and we'll be spending time on both of those flavors.","But I really compliment the question, Andre, because it really is the case that if you are a data analytic company and you take the data dimension of the data analytic agenda seriously, then you have to find this third way to operate basically if you want to be global, because there's the one form which is you make it wherever, Copenhagen, Detroit, whatever, and you export it around the world. That tends to relate more to physical goods. And then there's the second form, which is just you become utterly local, completely local in what it is you do, and the whole really doesn't become greater than the sum of the parts.","If you're a high intellectual property company with the databases, you actually have to find a third way, which is you can manufacture your methods centrally. But I think in line with what you're trying to get at, you actually have to occupy each marketplace because there is in the world today and will be in the world increasingly in the future what I call data nationalism. Most countries work very hard to make sure that their data physically resides in their country. And in fact, the follow-on to the Safe Harbor in the EU was just a particular example of the general case, where there's just concern about where do our data physically reside. And so you do actually have to become local in order to have access to the data.","So you have to be the third way or we have to be the third way anyway. And so we're working very hard on that, and that is everything from where we place our people to how we deploy our people. And so here's where I now want to turn it to Mark because he led us through a very significant reorganization towards the end of last year with respect to our go-to-market folks in overseas markets. So, Mark, maybe you want to talk about that, including how broadly based this particular program is.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. So I think what we've tried to do is identify markets that are, A), mature and like the U.S. markets. That's where our solutions act and feel the best. Obviously, we have the focus on some of the emerging markets too, but where we're currently putting most of our resources is also where we have customers, so that we have the ability to follow a customer to different geographies.","So that focus has led us to really take a lot of people who have been typically in different business units and put them into what we refer to as our global business development teams. And those teams are working across all of our insurance operations to really focus in on different markets and opportunities across all the solutions we offer. So that reorg provides us with a focus on customer, better relationship with customer, and talking about Verisk, not individual point solutions, and that's starting to make a difference.","The other thing I'll just contribute, and by the way, those business development teams are across the world. You had brought up UK as an example. Clearly the UK market feels the most like the U.S. market. There's a lot of movement between risks between London and the U.S. And as a result, we're most dedicated and most focused right now on the UK. And you can see that not just from an organic perspective, but some of the acquisitions we've done, whether it's with GeoInformation, Healix, even Arium is from the UK. So we think we're starting to make a difference and we are very much focused on bringing that opportunity, I call that third dimension to the cube here into a positive and profitable light here over the course of the next couple of years.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Maybe that's more than you expected, Andre, but we really care about this trend actually. You bumped into something that we do a lot of work on.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","We're glad to spend the time. Thank you for the question.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Chu with Bank of America. Your line is open.","David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, thank you. So last quarter, you highlighted that there were some delays in implementation of contracts that have already been signed. Can you just provide an update on this?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. I think that we're progressing as expected. That's really a comment as its related to the revenue that would be received in 2016.","David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, got it. And then in regards to WoodMac, you didn't lose too many clients despite lower oil prices in 2016. So does this suggest that we shouldn't expect a meaningful lift to client count this year, despite higher oil prices?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I'm sorry, you cut out just for a second we shouldn't expect, could you repeat that part?","David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Like a significant lift to client count this year, despite higher oil prices.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Well, I actually think that we've expanded, and I know that Steve Halliday spoke about this on Investor Day. We've actually expanded our customer base, fairly significantly through some of the new solutions and companies that we've brought into the WoodMac mix.","So actually what we're looking to do is, we're looking to grow those customers into broader solution purchases throughout WoodMac. So I think you have to think about the customer base a little more broadly than just the core you might have thought about when WoodMac first came into the family.","David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning. If I could just go back to the international insurance strategy and opportunity over time, it seems to me, the key to the U.S. business or one of the keys is certainly the consortia data model that you've built. And unless I'm misunderstanding this, you really haven't had success creating organically the same level of consortia dataset to be the core in any other market, and I know you've talked about doing that successfully with the Argus business in other geographies. So why have you not been able to do that? What's the gating factor? And maybe more forward-looking optimistically what's the outlook for doing that to deliver the kind of business that you have here in the U.S. over time? Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Let me just put your question in a slightly different context, which is we continue to feel that proprietary data is an advantage and one that we always pursue. We recite it as one of the four distinctives, so it's always there in our minds. There are two ways that you can build a proprietary dataset. One is you can have an a priori discussion with the market you're trying to serve and essentially get agreement that let's all join hands and take the plunge together and start putting our data into one place where we haven't previously put it. That's the history of our early roots in the insurance industry. Argus has proven to be very effective at doing that.","Wood Mackenzie is always about proprietary data, and it ends up being a consortium, but I want to relate it now to the second way that you can build a dataset, which is you can also go customer-by-customer. And you provide them solutions and as a part of having earned their trust, you ask for the opportunity to use and repurpose the data, which is flowing through your application.","We do it both ways. We've always done it both ways. And in some markets that maybe that we can leap straight to the consortia, Argus has had particular success at that. And in other markets, whether they're defined by vertical or geography, we may have to do more of the second method which is on a customer-by-customer basis. So I just want you to have that perspective because we don't \u2013 we never lose sight of the goal to create proprietary data assets. It's more a question of how you go about it.","Specific to the insurance industry, what goes on particularly, as you look at, I'd say especially Europe, is you've got differences in terms of both regulation and market structure. And of course those two things go together, regulation has an effect on market structure. And essentially Europe, European primary P&C markets generally tend to be more concentrated. And so the larger share player is naturally going to say, let me think about it a little bit more before I make my data available. And so that's really just a condition that we deal with, but we're not deterred in the least in terms of trying to move towards proprietary data assets. It's just the pathway maybe a little bit different.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And so what are the long term implications about the potential profitability of an insurance business overseas, given that concentration? Should we read into that, that it's unlikely even at scale to achieve the margins you've done here in the U.S.?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","No, I would not draw that conclusion. If you look at the most profitable parts of what we do whether it's in insurance or other places, there is a very nice mix of businesses which are built on our priority consortia data, and businesses which are not built on our priority consortia data. So you can get there both ways.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, everybody, for your time and your interest today. I know that we're going to be \u2013 we'll be following up with several of you even later today. We're going to have events in the course of the coming months.

Ms. Brodbar, you may begin your conference.","Stacey Brodbar","Thank you, Charelle, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2019 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide a brief overview of our business. Lisa Hannan, President of Verisk Financial Services, will then provide an update on our Financial Services segment. Lastly, Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer, will highlight some key points about our financial performance. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer, will join the team for Q&A.","The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has been attached to an 8-K that has been furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Stephenson","Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Verisk delivered another strong quarter marked by solid 7.2% organic constant currency revenue growth, which remains the most important measure of the health of our organization. Moreover, our growth was driven by continued broad-based strength in our Insurance segment as well as marked improvement in our Financial Services segment. ","At Verisk, it is our people that drive innovation, provide a great customer experience and are critical to delivering our consistent and solid financial results. As such, we are keenly focused on maintaining an environment that attracts and retains the best talent through strong recruitment, leading talent development programs and management training efforts, which ultimately results in highly engaged employees. I'm pleased to share that employee engagement at Verisk is on an upward trend, improving 2 percentage points from 2018. At the same time, we have maintained retention of our top performers at over 92% in each of the last three years in what is a very competitive labor market for our kind of talent. From a recruiting perspective, this summer, we are hosting our largest class of interns ever with 119 interns across all our business units who can serve as a pipeline for permanent hires. ","On a training and development front, we are investing in our future by hiring talent earlier in the talent pipeline and training them ourselves instead of competing for experienced talent. As such, we have expanded our global data science excellence program, which is an internal four plus year rotational training program for data scientists with a Masters in Data Science or Data Analytics. We have also extended training programs for talent in key areas, including cloud architecture and artificial intelligence. We have enhanced our management training programs to include offerings for first-line managers as well as experienced leaders and have expanded our online education offerings in data science and analytics in connection with leading universities such as Johns Hopkins and University of Michigan. ","Lastly, as part of our global talent optimization strategy, during the second quarter, we opened a new office in Krak\u00f3w, Poland. This office focuses on data science and analytics talents, and we are seeing early success building out this team and have a strong pipeline of talent interested in joining Verisk. On the client engagement front, in June, we hosted Verisk Vision in London, our client conference tailored to the London and European markets. We hosted approximately 300 attendees for a daylong event that focused on the ongoing transformation in the insurance landscape and covered areas, including risk, claims and InsurTech such as cyber risk, artificial intelligence, antifraud analytics and digital transformation. The event also featured the Verisk innovation lab, which showcased product demos featuring new technologies and industry applications, which incorporate cutting-edge deals such as social media, image forensics, security and surveillance, aerial imagery and entity resolution. The event not only solidifies our position as an InsurTech thought leader, but it also strengthens our position as a key technology and data partner to the London and European insurance companies. ","On the innovation front, we're seeing great success in gaining market share in personal lines due to strong sales of our LightSpeed suite of products. LightSpeed helps our insurance customers compete in the digital age as it utilizes innovative data-forward advanced analytics that enable insurers to provide a fully bindable quote on just three simple pieces of information. This addresses our customers' dual needs to both increase the velocity and efficiency of their operations by increasing the precision of their underwriting analytic. The result is more profitable conversion rates for our customers. Personal auto automation has led the way in this growth, quickly followed by personal property and small commercial. ","At Wood Mackenzie, we continue to be encouraged by the early results of our data analytic platform called Lens. We have a strong pipeline of interest and continue to sign up new subscriptions with major oil companies, independents and global investment banks. Additionally, we are seeing solid double-digit growth in both visits and unique users to the platform. We continue to work in partnership with our customers to deliver an offering that is unique in the marketplace, one that is scalable, dynamic and integrated into their workflows. We plan to have the next module, global upstream valuations, for the Lens platform by year-end 2019, which we think will be very well received by the market. And in Financial Services, we're seeing great success with our merchant analytics platform, which Lisa will talk to you about in more detail. ","Finally, we continue to be engaged on the strategic acquisition front with a focus on finding high return on invested capital transactions that leverage our scale, existing resource and deep domain expertise. We recently announced the acquisition of Keystone Aerial Surveys. Keystone is a leading aerial survey company with operations that cover the entire United States. Keystone will become part of Geomni, and it demonstrates our commitment to becoming a leader in aerial imagery, property analytics and geospatial data solutions. The addition of Keystone will accelerate our nationwide inventory coverage network and improve our refresh rate as we strive to bring our customers the most innovative and technologically superior geospatial solutions. ","And now I'll turn the call over to Lisa to provide some insights on our Financial Services segment.","Lisa Hannan","Thank you, Scott. I'm excited to have the opportunity to provide you with an update on Verisk Financial Services, our business unit built through the combination of the legacy Argus platform with acquisitions that added capabilities and expanded our solution sets. Now that I've been in the role of President, Verisk Financial, for just over a year, it's a great time to discuss the progress we've made over the past 12 months, provide an update on our key strategic initiatives and share our vision for the future. ","To start, I think it's important to take a step back to better understand where Verisk Financial Services is in our evolution and where we're headed. At the start of 2017, the Financial Services segment of Verisk consisted of the Argus business, which is a data contributory consortia business working with the leading banks and payment companies around the globe, including the top 30 credit card issuers in North America, the U.K. and Australia. Argus offers our customers unique solutions such as tracking and measurement of over $2 trillion worth of consumer spending annually as well as industry benchmarking and portfolio profitability analytics. ","Throughout 2017, we made several business acquisitions that aligned from a strategic and financial perspective and added capabilities to our existing services. In early 2018, we dedicated significant attention to integrating the acquired companies from an operating perspective, and we began creating a unified go-to-market presence under the Verisk Financial brand. In May of 2018, the management team went through a comprehensive strategic analysis of each of our solutions within Verisk Financial. We examined critically and dispassionately what Verisk financial was doing very well and where we could improve. Based on this analysis, we developed an integrated strategic plan for the business. The first change, which many of you may recall from our December Investor Day, was to align our go-to-market strategy around four solution sets. ","The first of these is portfolio management solutions, our legacy consortia-based products, which provide industry benchmarking and portfolio profitability analysis for credit cards, payments and retail banking customers around the globe. Second is credit risk and fraud management solutions, our portfolio of bankruptcy and merchant acquirer risk solutions and our new suite of fraud solutions for our banking clients. The third is spend analytics and marketing solutions, which encompasses our cards' marketing models, consumer and merchants' insights and media measurement solutions. And finally, enterprise data management solutions, comprised of our global regulatory reporting platform and client-specific data management, MIS, and data advisory solutions. ","I'm happy to report that one year in, we're seeing the benefits of this solution-based orientation beginning to pay off. There is momentum in each of our solution sets with particularly strong performance from our media measurement, merchant analytics and portfolio management solutions during the first half of the year. And while enterprise data management is a newer and developing business for Verisk, which tends to have more quarter-to-quarter variability, we are experiencing sequentially improving trends with the introduction of some of our key strategic initiatives in that area. ","And in addition to reorienting our business, we've also implemented a number of operational improvements, including strengthening and reorganizing our sales team around the four solution sets for more comprehensive and holistic go-to-market sales strategy and implementing Lean Six Sigma and process automation. These changes have already created significant benefits to our business. For example, our process improvements for portfolio benchmark reporting have led to a 35% reduction in processing time each month. And the automation of report summarization module alone for benchmarking led to a laborsaving of 200 hours from us, allowing us to free up resources for new product development efforts. We believe that the investment in time to improve our operations ultimately creates a better environment for our innovation and growth. ","As we brought several smaller businesses together with our Argus platform, we've also made some key strategic decisions. We have rationalized head count and updated our client pricing structure for our enterprise data management offerings based in India. We have reduced our reliance on business opportunities that led to onetime, short-term revenues in favor of longer-term subscription-based growth. And most recently, we sold our Verisk retail loss prevention business as it was no longer fit within our new Verisk financial strategic road map. Collectively, these decisions have led to a stronger, more aligned Verisk Financial Services unit that is better positioned for future growth. ","As we look forward, we're ready to embark on the next phase of our business transformation. In addition to our relentless commitment to continuously improving our customer experience and our existing solutions, we are focused on long-term strategic growth, which is underpinned by the key strategic initiatives that we share during our Investor Day. These include introducing our next-generation benchmarking platform, expanding our spend analytics solutions globally, building our fraud solutions beginning with the fraud consortia in Mexico, advancing our cloud migration and developing a global regulatory analytic platform as part of our enterprise data management solutions. All of these initiatives are underway, meeting key milestones and beginning to deliver. ","Of particular note, we are getting extremely strong market interest in the Mexico cards fraud consortia, which will deliver our first new consortia data set since 2016 when we launched the Australian card study, and the global regulatory platform as regulators around the globe embrace a data-driven approach to oversight. Our experience working with the OCC, the Fed and the CFPB in the U.S. as well as our work through the Lloyd's syndicates in the U.K. uniquely position us to meet the needs of both regulators and their regulated entities. ","In addition to these Verisk financial strategic initiatives, we are also accelerating a cross-Verisk collaboration, working with our colleagues in the Insurance segment. We are currently working with our partners in underwriting and rating on enhancing lead generation and market prospecting as well as working with our colleagues in claims to elaborate on enhanced fraud solution. ","In summary, I'm proud of our team and the progress we've made over the past year as we have synthesized a series of acquisitions to create Verisk Financial Services, a single cohesive operating unit. We have made tangible progress choosing long-term vision with near-term operating execution. Our bias is to action with the understanding that a world-class business isn't created overnight, but is instead the sum total of numerous incremental changes and consistent execution over time. We are confident in our long-term growth potential and look forward to sharing additional progress with -- updates with you in the future. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Lisa. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Presentation provides background, data trends and analysis to support our conversation today. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and a GAAP basis, revenue grew 8.5% to $653 million. Net income decreased 2% to $150 million while diluted GAAP EPS declined 1.1% to $0.90 per share for the second quarter 2019. As we previewed on last quarter's earnings call, both GAAP net income and diluted GAAP EPS were negatively impacted by the acceleration of $6 million in stock-based compensation in the quarter. ","Let's now focus our quarterly discussion on our organic constant currency results for all year-over-year growth rates and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations, recent acquisitions for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons, nonoperating acquisition-related costs, including earnouts, dispositions and nonrecurring items. We believe these are the best measures to evaluate the health of our overall business and are the metrics we use in our own compensation plans. ","On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 7.2% in the second quarter of 2019, reflecting organic growth across all three segments and delivering on our long-term target of 7% growth. Growth was led by our Insurance segment, and we also delivered improving trends in Financial Services. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.2% and was 7.3% after normalizing for the accelerated expensing of stock-based compensation. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 46.6%, down from the 47.9% in the prior year primarily the result of the acceleration of stock-based compensation which decreased margins by approximately 1%. This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenue and EBITDA. Acquisitions decreased total adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately 20 basis points in the period. The headwind from the acceleration of stock-based compensation is also reflected in the individual segment results as these costs have been allocated based on revenue contribution to Verisk. ","On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 7.8% revenue growth while adjusted EBITDA increased 5.1%. Within our underwriting and rating business, growth was balanced across personal lines and commercial lines. We saw healthy growth in our industry-standard insurance programs, property-specific underwriting and catastrophe modeling solutions revenue. We're seeing strong uptake of our new innovative solutions, including LightSpeed auto, as our new data-forward products are designed to meet the needs of our Insurance customers for quicker, more efficient and easier to use solutions. Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance in claims analytics, repair cost estimating and remote imagery solutions. This was offset in part by modest weakness in workers' compensation claim resolution services. ","Total adjusted EBITDA margin declined 140 basis points to 53% from 54.4% in the prior year period. Energy and Specialized Markets delivered revenue growth of 5.5% for the quarter. Strong sales of market and cost intelligence solutions drove the growth. We also had positive contributions from core research and our environmental health and safety business. This was offset in part by softness in our consulting services related to strong performance from last year. ","Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.7%, reflecting, ongoing investments in breakout opportunities like Lens and our chemicals, subsurface and power and renewables breakouts. Total adjusted EBITDA margin declined to 29.9% from 31.8%. The largest factor in that margin decline was a nonoperational foreign currency translation loss. Excluding this item, margin in the segment would have been flat. Financial Services revenue increased 6.1% in the quarter led by solid growth in portfolio management and spend-informed marketing solutions revenues. As Lisa mentioned earlier, these improving results reflect the impact of the strategy that we implemented in 2018 to transition Verisk Financial Services from a top-down orientation to a bottoms-up approach with an emphasis on steady growth. We expect that investors will continue to see more clearly the long-term growth potential of this segment over time as we continue to make progress with the transition. ","Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.9%, and total adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 31.9% from 30.3%. Strong focus on expense management as well as leverage from the revenue growth drove the margin expansion. Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter, down 4.7% from the prior year quarter due to the net repayments of our revolving credit facility. Total reported debt was $2.5 billion at June 30, 2019, down from $2.7 billion at year-end 2018. And our leverage at the end of the second quarter was 2.1x. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $153 million at June 30, 2019. Our reported effective tax rate was 19.7% for the quarter compared to 17% in the prior year quarter primarily due to a lower level of option exercises. We maintain our estimate of our effective tax rate in the full year 2019 to be between 19% and 21%. ","Adjusted net income was $184 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.10 for the second quarter, up 4.1% and 4.8%, respectively. After normalizing for the impact of the incremental stock-based compensation, diluted adjusted EPS would have grown 8.6%. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a decrease in interest expense and lower share count. The benefits were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a higher effective tax rate. Net cash provided by operating activities was $200 million for the quarter, down 3.4% from the prior year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $566 million year-to-date, up 6% from the prior year. ","Capital expenditures were $47 million for the quarter, down 16.4% from the prior year. CapEx represented 7.2% of total revenue, reflecting the expected decline in capital intensity as the result of reduced capital spending on the Geomni initiative following its initial ramp-up. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $220 million to $240 million for 2019. The free cash flow was $153 million for the quarter, an increase of 1.5% from the prior year. Free cash flow was $474 million year-to-date, an increase of 9.1% from the prior year. ","During the second quarter, we returned $91 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 361,000 shares at a weighted average price of $138.32 for a total cost of $50 million. At June 30, 2019, we had $303 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we initiated a new $75 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the third quarter. On June 28, 2019, we paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per common share. And on July 24, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on September 30, 2019, for shareholders of record on September 13, 2019. We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and continue to manage capital prudently through internal investment, strategic acquisitions and the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. ","[Operator Instructions]. I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Stacey Brodbar","Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And you do have a question from Toni Kaplan.","Toni Kaplan","Just taking a step back, you've had margin contraction in Insurance for the past 10 quarters, and you've been investing and experiencing an impact from dilutive acquisitions. But at some point, perhaps we could see that reverse. And so just given operating leverage of the business overall, I guess at what point do you think that we could start to see some margin leverage in Insurance specifically?","Lee Shavel","So Toni, thanks for the question. I think we've been focused on those -- on the year-over-year results. And when we look at this quarter's year-over-year performance from a margin standpoint, I think it's important to understand that if you take the timing -- compensation timing impact of about 1%, the margin in the second quarter of 53% would have been 54% versus 54.4% in the prior year period. And so that certainly is I would -- we would describe as flattish. And at the same time, recognizing that we have been making some significant investments in Geomni and telematics that have been accelerated as we've ramped up in particular, Geomni. And so we are making those investments with the expectation that those will be contributing to our margin improvement over time as we reach scale in those businesses. So I think it's the financial dimension, and I'll turn it over to Mark to provide some additional color here.","Mark Anquillare","Sure. I'll echo the investment we're making. I think the thing that I always like to emphasize is that inside the investment, what we have seen is our top line organically growing quicker, which means our bottom line EBITDA cash flow is growing quicker. So I think that's been successful. We have been disciplined in the way we spend and invest. And I think there is scale clearly in the business as we take on pretty big investment in something like aerial imagery and IoT. So I just want to provide a little bit of color that I think we've had quite a bit of success in the growth side of things.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik.","Manav Patnaik","I guess since you have Lisa on the call, maybe I can just ask on the Argus comments. I think there was a comment about updating the pricing structure to more subscription-based revenue, and that might have been specific to the EDM business based in India. So I was wondering if you can just elaborate on that with some context on how much of Argus today is subscription. And are there any other areas there that you could see similar pricing structure updates?","Lisa Hannan","Sure. There were two things. The first is that as we've begun integrating the companies that we acquired, the business that we acquired in India, we did go through a rigorous review of all of their solutions and the pricing for those solutions relative to our investment in those solutions. Based on that, we have updated our pricing structure for solutions-based set of India. Those are primarily subscription-based solutions. In addition, across all of the Argus business, we have also been changing and shifting our mix towards more subscription-based and product-driven solutions as opposed to onetime implementations or initial development revenue up-front and more heavily weighted in the current year. As we implement some of our data analytic solutions, the enterprise data management solutions, we're now orienting those to more of a longer-term subscription base as well. So in all the things that we're doing, we're looking for longer-term subscription-based revenue. Today, the percentage of revenue that's subscription-based is over 65%, close to 70%. We continue to move that up.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim McHugh.","Timothy McHugh","Just wondered on LightSpeed, you highlighted that this quarter. So can you talk about how customers are adopting that? Is that displacing prior methods of kind of underwriting and acquiring customers? Or is it used -- being used as an incremental? And then I think recently, you talked about taking Sequel to the U.S., which I believe is a new initiative. So I guess talk about the plans and how aggressively you're pursuing that.","Mark Anquillare","Great. Thanks, and this is Mark. So let me first talk a little bit about LightSpeed. Inside of the insurance process, there has typically been a two-step process. First, you provide a quote, and then people run what is typically all the reports and gather the information. There's a cost there before they bind the policy. So what we have attempted to do inside of our kind of ecosystem is create a very automated approach so they can flow this business, that's a term of ours, they can be completely automated, more accurate, more efficient. And we're bringing all the data needs up-front. We call it our data-forward strategy. So that represents kind of a different way of going to -- go to market. You can actually provide a quote, bind it all in one. Just an example, you talked about digital engagement. On the personal auto front, on a car insurance, about 33% of all quotes you get online change after people do that work. So very poor experience. And what we've done is we've taken things like motor vehicle reports, loss histories, prior losses, prior coverage, all the things about the driver and brought that up-front. And that has been adopted, well accepted, and we have a nice success on the insurance front. That kind of moves across auto, the homeowners and even into small commercial. That is our theme, and that's where we're headed. ","I'm going to now flip over to the question on Sequel. Just to remind everybody, Sequel solution set which is, for the most part, all of the software to a service policy, starting from the up-front, within underwriting on to claims, all of that very much a industry standard inside the London insurance market, primarily around things that what I'll refer to as ISO. And most of Verisk hasn't been as focused on the non-admitted market, meaning the specialty lines, the really complex risks. What we have attempted to do is use some of that technology in some of our products here. But more importantly, what you saw in the press release is for specialty or complex insurance risk, we are going to bring Sequel to the United States. We seem to have quite a bit of interest. We are leveraging the teams in place, both on the claims side and on the ISO side of the underwriting side. And I think we're very optimistic that inside that niche specialty market, we have a solution that can win today. And we're optimistic.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman.","Andrew Steinerman","It's Andrew. Could you give us a sense how your Energy clients are doing as they're increasing spend with Wood Mac, which areas of interest is increasing with those Energy clients? And also, you mentioned cost intelligence with energy. I assume that's around PowerAdvocate. And could you give us a sense of how PowerAdvocate is do -- again evolving within Verisk?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. So Scott here. And in reverse order, the PowerAdvocate suite is doing well. The traditional customer set for PowerAdvocate has been utilities. A lot of the motion in the business has been taking the same kind of solution into the oil and gas space, which is one of those places where PowerAdvocate is advantaged by being tied to the business with very substantial footprint we've already got in the oil and gas space. And then over on the traditional Wood Mac side in the oil and gas space, basically, there is a lot of interest in what the Lens platform provides, which is essentially more real time and more integrated into the customer workflows. And so it's essentially doing what we thought it would do, which is positioning our content even more deeply in the customer workflows. And that's the direction of travel. Basically, as the United States has sort of been differentially adding to the global supply curve, the U.S. environment is one where you're making operating decisions all the time as opposed to the traditional offshore decadal kind of investment cycle. ","And so the need for real time, the need for more benchmark kinds of data just goes up, and that's exactly what we've been positioning for. So it's -- one of the leading metrics there is the rate of adoption of Lens among the oil and gas companies, both the integrated globals as well as the more pure-play E&P companies. And we're very happy with what's happening there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee.","Gary Bisbee","Thanks for the detailed rundown on Financial Services business. It sounds like you're making a lot of progress there. I guess the key question is, how do those changes impact how we should think about the medium- or longer-term growth potential of the business and maybe also profitability? Historically, before the recent couple years of challenges, I think there was clear discussion of this being the fastest growth or growing above the corporate average. Is that a reasonable and sustainable target at some point in the future based on the progress you're doing?","Lee Shavel","Gary, this is Lee. So for all three of our segments, our expectation that all of them have the ability to meet or exceed our long-term targeted 7% organic constant currency growth rate as well as to realize the operating leverage and achieve EBITDA faster than that. And so I think one of the challenges for investors, which we certainly empathize with, is that given some of the large contracts in contract transitions in the business made it difficult to see the underlying growth within the business. And so we wanted to focus on really developing the bottoms up approach to the business that Lisa described in each of the four solutions areas. And I think in those more traditional -- in the kind of the foundational benchmarking areas, those are probably mid-single digits growth elements. And the fraud, bankruptcy, enterprise data management, marketing spend analytics are newer, higher-growth businesses that we think contribute to achieving that 7% growth. ","So no change in terms of our expectations of what the Financial Services business can achieve and can contribute to our overall growth rate, but there has been a shift in making sure that we're delivering that on a more sustainable and granular basis and that investors have greater clarity on that growth, which certainly I think within this quarter is a clear step in that direction.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi.","Joseph Foresi","I was wondering if you could talk about Geomni and some of the potential contribution to revenues and the CapEx that you've put in there and what stage that's in.","Mark Anquillare","This is Mark. Let me try to address that. So the opportunity with Geomni is very much focused on, first, ensuring that we have coverage, frequent refresh of those images. And with that, that library of information, our first step was really to address the claims-focused solutions in the insurance space. So literally, by using those advanced pictures and some advanced analytics, we can get measurements and do repair cost estimates for the claims departments from the sky. They then use maybe some desktop adjusting but, for the most part, a majority of that is done in a very automated fashion, saving a very significant cost to the insurers as well it's safer and more accurate. We have opportunities to bring that into underwriting as well as to the world of cat modeling. ","But I want to highlight though that as much as our first use case was insurance, there's probably and there is bigger opportunities outside of the insurance space. So we have partnered up with some folks that are doing construction. We're doing work in the solar space. We're doing work across various verticals where that imagery and those exact measurements are very helpful. And Geomni is contributing nicely to that claims category inside of our growth rates for insurance. ","So it continues to be investment-oriented. Keystone accelerates that investment for us because it replaces what we have to buy in the form of sensors, meaning big cameras as well as the planes. Keystone has it. They have operations. They have pilots. So this will accelerate our path to strength there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey.","Andrew Jeffrey","Yes. I wonder and I'm thinking about LightSpeed. But broadly across your business, can you talk about the extent to which InsurTech maybe is driving some of your growth and how structural that is? And whether as you look out to the market today, that's a potential growth acceleration driver over the next year or two?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. Scott here. It has two effects on our business. So one is, if you think of InsurTech as a category of digitally enabled innovations, this is one of the things that actually our customers and all of our segments are looking for. They themselves are trying to transform their businesses making use of digital methods. And so here we are with our particular solution sets. They are rotating their budgets in the direction of making use of modern methods. So that's just a fundamentally constructive factor across everything we do basically. But in addition to that, when people refer to InsurTech, partly what they're talking about are new companies that are basically using digital methods fundamentally to change the distribution of insurance, the sourcing of insurance, customers presenting the insurance product to the end user. ","And so these are some of the companies that get celebrated as startups that are -- sort of kind of present a new face to the insurance-consuming world. We've done very well with those companies as customers. So here they are. They're inventing a new insurance company. And we find that they just -- that they have voted with their feet and basically want to use our industry-standard solutions so that they have the benefit of efficiency, fighting fraud in effective way. One of the big issues you have when you emerge as an insurance company is you don't have a lot of experience. And so how are you going to anticipate where your losses are going to be and at what level? That's one of the things that our solutions just give you right out of the box. So it's really gratifying to see how many of them come our way when they form and then all of a sudden -- and I've had a chance to visit with the CEO -- even recently with the CEOs of some of these highly celebrated, emergent insurance companies. And they just -- they really, really like being a partner with Verisk.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeff Meuler.","Jeffrey Meuler","Scott, I was just hoping you could extend your earlier comments around kind of human capital and the opening of the Krak\u00f3w office. You relatively, I guess, acquired Wood Mac. And one of the points from the acquisition was expanding your global office footprint, but I know data nationalism always top of mind. So just roughly, what percentage of your data and analytics and tech head count or innovation head count is in the United States or more expensive labor markets today? Like how big is this long-term opportunity as a margin enhancement for you?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. So the first thing that motivates us on this is access to talent. That's the thing that this is really about. So the reason we like Krak\u00f3w so much is, as we expand our business in Europe, especially Continental Europe, having high-quality, technically deep people who also will get steeped in the verticals that we serve, having them right there to interact more easily with our customers is a really, really nice feature here. And then I'm glad you picked up on the point I was making about talent because that really is the wellspring for our company. And there's no question that everybody -- we have about 9,000 associates at Verisk now. Everybody really counts. There are some of the technical disciplines that are the ones that are particularly in demand. I ticked off a few of those, so being able to make cloud architectures that are secure and really work, sort of data science as in the transformation of the data. ","There's also a big data engineering dimension always to what it is we do. And so there's no question that over the last couple of years as we have built those communities of people around Verisk differentially, the additions have been overseas between what we do on -- in Continental Europe, both in Spain and in -- now in Poland, we have added quite a few people in India. And so as a percentage of the additions to the team that we've made, they're coming more not in the United States than in the United States of late. Of course, we're building both sides but relatively, it's even more overseas. And I don't see that changing. But it's -- and it is constructive from a cost point of view as well. But to me, that's just a marker actually of supply and demand. And we're just trying to make sure that we are in as many places as a, we intend to serve; and b, can provide great talent. ","And the last thing I'll just emphasize again is the develop ourselves mentality that we have here. We feel very rewarded for having gone in a direction that I think by degree is at least is a little bit different than what some other companies do. Because several years ago, we recognized if we're just going to count on our ability to go into the market and hire already experienced people, we're essentially saying, \"We're going to let somebody else solve our challenge, the talent challenge.\" And we said, \"Well, no. We can do better than that.\" And so we've just gone very early into the talent pipeline. And we have felt very rewarded doing that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the Bill Warmington.","William Warmington","So the acquisition of Keystone last week brought to the front the question of how much coverage of the U.S. do you have now? And is that enough? Because you've been -- I know you've been talking about going into Japan and Asia. So in that context, I want to see how much is left to go in the U.S. And then as you look out internationally, is this going to be the beginning of a new investment cycle in geospatial for Asia? And how much you think it'll be? And how long do you think it'll take?","Scott Stephenson","So Mark, you may want to add to this, but I'll just kick off. So in the United States, we are approaching what we would consider full coverage now. You have to understand coverage as both the square miles that you are imaging, but also the frequency with which you are imaging them. And so with respect to will we be able to reach all the important corners of the United States, we're very, very close to being there. With respect to the frequency of the refresh, that may always be something of a moving target. These data sets are not commodities. And one of the ways that you make them to have the quality of not being a commodity is the freshness of the data. So we will always be taking account of customer needs and competition in order to determine how frequently are we refreshing the images. So when you think about coverage, you have to think about both of those. ","With respect to overseas markets, we actually already do, do some of this work in other places. And basically, the methods that we develop, the ability of the team to automatically interpret the image sets, that works everywhere. So as we build out our franchise generally -- and insurance is one of the killer apps for the -- for remote imagery. As we build out the Insurance franchise globally, I think it's very clear we will want to come in behind with these methods. But it'll -- it's -- we still got plenty of room to run in the United States, and then we will sort of build it I think organically and consistently with the rate that our Insurance franchise grows outside of the United States.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Tong.","George Tong","Historically, enterprise data management and fraud solutions were the two underperforming areas within Financial Services. This quarter, all solution sets within Financial Services saw sequential improvement. Can you elaborate on the relative performance here and specific initiatives you'd call out that should drive continued acceleration in revenue growth in this segment?","Lisa Hannan","So it's true. All the segments saw sequential improvement. The enterprise data management sector is the sector that will continue to be lumpy and have variability on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Those contracts are very long-term contract often delivered through RFPs. And so the sales cycle is very long, and they also -- some of them end. Some of the work that we've done on more of a client-by-client bespoke enterprise data management solutions basis end. So it's really about building a book of business there and getting to a level of sustainability that allows us to meet that level of consistent performance as we see contracts end and new contracts begin within a quarter and quarter-to-quarter. ","Continued improvement in that sector, that is a sector that we're looking to grow over the long term. And we'll continue to see lumpiness on a quarterly basis over the short term, but we do hear and continue to feel that the market is receptive to the solutions we're offering. Most particularly, we are hearing good reception to the global regulatory reporting platform. Regulators around the globe are changing the way they do their oversight. They are creating. They are leveraging deep and rich granular data to do that work, and we believe we're uniquely positioned to serve in the financial sector there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ashish Sabadra.","Ashish Sabadra","Just a quick two-part question on the Energy side. Any color on the softness in the consulting services? Is that mostly difficult comps? And then just where are we in terms of investments for the breakout opportunity within Energy? And when can we start to see margin expansion in the segment?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. So go ahead, Lee.","Lee Shavel","Again, Ashish, I may just want to get clarity around the second part of the question. I had a little difficult time hearing you. So on the -- in the first element in terms of the consulting revenue, some of it was a function of a very strong second quarter in 2018. We also saw among some of the large national oil companies some political transitions that delayed some of the revenue that we had anticipated in the quarter. We do not think that, that was a revenue at risk but simply a delay of some of that revenue. ","And then with regard to margin, if that was the question and the impact of the breakouts on the margin for Energy and Specialized Markets, Ashish, was that the thrust of your question?","Ashish Sabadra","Yes. Yes. Yes. That's it.","Lee Shavel","Yes. So thanks for raising that. Within Energy and Specialized Markets, I think it's important to note that in this second quarter that a large part of the decline in the revenue, in fact, the largest single element was an FX gain adjustment, which reduced margin by approximately 2%. That's a function of the dollar-pound exchange rate and valuation of our net current assets that influenced that. And so that would -- absent that impact, which fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, we would have had a higher margin. In addition, that margin also bears approximately the 1% impact of the timing from a compensation standpoint. So absent those two nonoperational elements, it reflects the operating leverage and the margin expansion that we are experiencing in the core business while at the same time investing in new initiatives like Lens and the breakout areas like subsurface, power and renewables and those elements. And so I think we feel very good. This -- the quarter, the numbers are distorted by that compensation timing issue in the FX. But overall, from a pure operating standpoint, we actually saw margin expansion. ","And if I may, I want to emphasize this dynamic to go back to Toni's question around the Insurance side. In each of our businesses, putting aside the FX impact as well as the timing issue, all of our Insurance businesses saw an expansion in their operating margin. And so that's the underlying operating leverage that drives our margin up. And then we are deliberately making decisions from an investment standpoint with the breakouts in terms of how much of that do we want to spend down with an overall objective of increasing that margin over time. And that's -- we think that's a very healthy dynamic. It's important for continuing investment. But it's also important to understand that absent that investment, we are seeing net operating leverage and that margin expansion improve as we grow. It's just that when you look at the net number, there are various nonoperational impacts and investment impacts that are affecting that. Does that -- hopefully, that addresses your question.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Scott Stephenson","Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us. We've scheduled a number of follow-ups with you. We look forward to that. Thanks for your interest and talk to you soon. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you all.

Ms. Huston, please go ahead.","Eva Huston","Thank you, Amber, and good morning to everyone.  We apologize for the slight technical delay we had at the starting here.  We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our second quarter 2012 financial results.","With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer.  Following some comments by Frank, Scott, and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we\u2019ll open the call up for your question.","The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investor section of our website verisk.com.  The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC.  A replay of this call will be posted on our website and available by dial-in for 30 days until September 1, 2012.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today.  And information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Frank Coyne.","Frank Coyne","Thank you, Eva, and good morning.  In second quarter 2012, we delivered good performance of 14% total revenue growth and almost 15% diluted adjusted EPS growth.  We continued strong performance from our Healthcare business and good performance from our insurance businesses and our emerging businesses in specialized markets.","In the second quarter our risk adjustment revenue grew 4.9% after adjusting for the impact of a transfer of some revenue to Decision Analytics beginning in 2012.  This growth is a continuation of what you saw in the first quarter and evidence of our sticky customer relationship based on the recognizable value we bring.","In Decision Analytics, we grew revenue almost 23% and our insurance solutions in Decision Analytics grew about 9%, a very solid rate given the lower storm activity versus last year.","Our Healthcare solutions continued on the organic growth we have seen in the past few quarters growing revenue nearing 37% organically in the quarter.  Our total Healthcare revenue growth was over 160% bolstered by the contributions MediConnect has made to our second quarter performance.","In Mortgage, we continue to see challenges in the market and our revenue declined due to the declining items of forensic review, but I would note that we continue to grow our underwriting solutions at a faster pace than the 2Q estimates for the origination market.","Overall, our consolidated organic revenue growth was 6.4% as we saw both a lighter quarter per storm activity and mortgage continue to weigh on growth.  Excluding all historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth was 8.4%.  Profitability remained strong with an EBITDA margin of 43.9% in the quarter.","We remain disciplined of our use of capital and are focused on delivering shareholder returns.  We brought $68 million of shares in the quarter as we mange our buyback as part of our broader capital allocation plan.  We continue to be active in looking at M&A but also continue to maintain our discipline, focusing on assets with a true strategic fit, strong financial model and appropriate value in relation to future growth.","The first half of 2012 has been solid and met expectations overall.  I remain confident that behind the numbers we are doing the right things to position our business for future growth driven by delivering quality solutions to our customers.","Now, I'll turn it over to Scott to give you details about our progress in healthcare and other parts of the business.","Scott Stephenson","Thank you, Frank.  I'm going to briefly update you on development in several of our business with an emphasis on innovations aimed at our customers' emerging needs and ways in which we are becoming more integral to their operation.","First, in the Healthcare vertical three items, the unified platform initiatives is proceeding in the first phase of integrating our payment integrity businesses has been largely completed.  We are one month into hosting of large customer on the platform and then our teams are pleased with the results to-date.  The efficacy of our real-time edits are increasing materially inside the new platform.  In the next phase, we will leave our enterprise analytic solution into the platform as we also transition more customers to the platform.  We are pleased to be meeting important milestones on time as we steam towards 2013 completion of the project.","Next, we are finding great synergy between our revenue integrity business and MediConnect Business.  We have been pitching business jointly and have been energized by the level of wins coming from the combined skill set.","And third, we are finding great synergy between our healthcare analytics and the P&C world.  Working with the group of PNC carriers, we have now processed $15 billion of work comp claims in order to suppress fraudulent and wasteful ones.  We are only getting started and the early result hold great promise.","In connection with all the positive momentum we are excited to have recently name Joel Portice as the new President of Verisk Health.  Joel had been running our payment accuracy division, which is one of our most highly performing, and where his leadership had led us to considerably higher growth in margin as well as the integration of the unified platform I mentioned earlier.  We extend the best wishes as Michael Coyne, our prior president moves on to an emergent health and traumatic company.","In a different vertical, I want to highlight some work we have been dealing with our weather and analytics tool as they related to insurers.  In late 2011, we announced a solution called AER Respond, which picks our weather data and overlays it on an insurance policy portfolio when a large weather event occurs in order to give them a better estimate, of both how to deploy their resources as well as what type and volume of claims to expect.","We have recently been successful in selling this solution to several top tier insurers and have begun to integrate this tool into our Xactimate claims estimating tool and we are excited about this and the general future of repurposing our weather analytics in the commercial uses for insurers as well as into other domains such as the supply chain.","The general themes of innovation and repurposing of our intellectual property are very alive across all parts of Verisk and they will continue to be a major part of our growth story going forward.","And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results.","Mark Anquillare","Thank Scott.  You have put some of the exciting things that are going on in our business and I will share some of the numbers that was a result of those efforts.","In the second quarter, we delivered 14% total revenue growth and 6.4% organic revenue growth.  Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic growth in the quarter was 8.4%.  For the second quarter, our Decision Analytics segment revenue continued to lead with 22.6% revenue growth of which 7.6% was organic excluding the 2011 acquisitions for Bloodhound and HRP, which is Health Risk Partners and the 2012 acquisition of MediConnect, as well as the transferred revenue for the mortgage appraisal tool.","As a reminder in 2012, we have transferred revenue related to the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment's property specific revenue category into Decision Analytics' mortgage and financial services revenue category to reflect a management reporting change.","We will continue to provide you with visibility into the apples versus apples comparisons throughout 2012.","Within the Decision Analytics our insurance category grew 8.8% in the second quarter for organic.  We continued on double digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions as we continued to gain customers and also performed well on the catastrophe related products focused on the capital markets.  We have been the model of record for all catastrophe bonds issued in 2012.","We also experienced strong subscription revenue from our loss quantification solutions, but more moderate growth due to decreased transactional revenue resulting from decreased storm activity in the second quarter of 2012 versus the same period in 2011.","Claim solutions delivered respectable growth.  I'll note that our acquisition of Aspect Loss Prevention in July of 2012 is under the leadership of our pro-claims and crime analytics group, and we reported in the insurance revenue category within Decision Analytics.  The revenue in mortgage and financial services declined 1% as reported in the second quarter and declined 9.9% after adjusting for the transfer of new mortgage appraisal tools from risk assessment into this revenue category.","Underwriting tools grew nicely in the quarter and continued to outpace growth in origination markets.  Corporate revenue from forensic solutions declined in the quarter as expected offsetting that growth.  Our outlook for 2012 for mortgage remains negative as the mortgage markets continues to make it difficult to predict near-term trend for the majority of our solutions, but we remain confident in the long-term value and our relationships with the financial institutions that buy our tools.","Healthcare continued strong growth, 160.7% for the second quarter and 36.7% organically, and healthcare organic growth year-to-date has been 34.8%.  Our total growth continues to benefit from the addition of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners, as well as the addition of MediConnect in the second quarter.","Just as a reminder for those of you who are looking at sequential revenue dollars, Q1 and Q2 are seasonally lower revenue and margin quarters for our revenue integrity business.  And MediConnect follows a similar seasonal pattern.  Additionally, starting in third quarter 2012, both the acquisitions of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners will become a part of our calculation of organic growth.","Our specialized markets grew 8.7% in the second quarter, with growth from both our supply chain solutions as well as in weather analytics.  Both of these areas are delivering solid growth today, and we are optimistic about the opportunities to broaden their reach.","Scott gave you an example of traction we're getting with insurance on our weather analytics and we're actively taking our 3D assets, in addition to our stream event modeling asset, in developing broader strategies around that to serve supply chain.","In Risk Assessment, we reported revenue growth of 2.6% in the quarter, and 4.9% after adjusting for the impact of the transfer we discussed earlier.  Our industry standard program 6.1% in the quarter reflecting our 2012 invoices and strong growth in our premium leakage solution.  If you're looking at sequential revenue growth please note remember 2000, $1 million of license revenue was called out in first quarter that was non-recurring.","Our property specific revenue growth, which reported declines of 7.3%, but excluding the transfer grew 1.8%, as new sales and higher volumes from certain customers offset decline from others and the appraisable solutions grew further growth also.","EBITDA for the second quarter was $163.8 million as outlined in table 3 of our press release.  EBIDTA increased 14% for the quarter and our EBIDTA margin was 43.9% remaining consistent with our margins in the second quarter of 2011.  Although actually up if you take into account the $3.0 million benefit of the earn-out liability reduction in 2011, and the greater impact on margin of a full quarter of acquisition they are seasonally lower in the second quarter of 2012.  Ex-acquisitions the second quarter of 2012 margins would have been 44.9%.","As reported we're down slightly from the 45.9% in the first quarter 2012 due primarily to our annual salary increases from April 1st, and the incremental cost related to April 2012 equity work, and associated accelerated vesting on the payment of eligible retirement age by some employees.","In the quarter our risk assessment margins were 52.8% versus 48.6% in second quarter of 2011.  We benefited by about 2% on the margin due to lower pension costs related to freeze of plan in February.  Also in April, we funded $72 million into the pension bringing it closer to fully funded.","Our business continues to show scaled up profitability, but we also to continue to invest in developing new solutions.","The margin in Decision Analytics was 38.3% in second quarter 2012 versus 40.4% in second quarter of 2011, and 39.3% in first quarter 2012.  In second quarter 2011, we had the benefit to the margin from the reduction in earn out liability of $3.4 million.  Excluding the benefit of that reduction, the margin in that period was 38.6%.  In second quarter 2012, ex-acquisitions EBITDA margin will exceed 39%.","Our interest expense was up $2.5 million versus second quarter 2011 based on higher debt balance related to our acquisitions.  We ended the second quarter with total debt of $1.3 billion including the $150 million drawn under our $725 million revolver.  Our pro forma debt to EBIDTA ratio as of June 30th was 1.9 times.","Our reported effective tax rate was 39.5% for the quarter, which we expect to continue for the rest of 2012.","Coming down to the net income line, we focused on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we define in the current period as net income plus acquisition related amortization expense, less the income tax effects on that amortization.","Our adjusted net income increased 13.7% to $80.6 million for the quarter and adjusted EPS on its fully diluted basis was $0.47, an increase of 14.6%.  The average diluted share count was 171.9 million shares in the quarter and on March 31, 2012, our diluted share count was 171.3 million shares.","In the quarter, we purchased approximately 1.4 million shares for about $68 million.  At quarter end we had about $200 million left under our authorization.  Our approach to share repurchases remained focused on limiting dilution and only going beyond that when we believe the share repurchase will deliver appropriate internal rates of return and not crowd out acquisitions.  Our share repurchase program has been successful to date generalized annualized IRRs over 25%.","Turning to the balance sheet.  As of June 30, our cash and cash equivalents were about $97 million.  Total debt both short-term and long-term totaled $1.3 billion at June 30 reflecting debt borrowed that fund the MediConnect acquisition which closed on March 30, and after our pension funding of $72 million April.","Post MediConnect and pension funding, our debt capacity is about $650 million and will continue to grow with our EBIDTA and free cash flow.  As we have stated before, we are willing to temporarily go beyond our long-term target of 2 times debt to EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities, particularly on the acquisition side.  With that debt capacity available, we continue to look for the right opportunities.","Free cash from the first half of 2012, which we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was a $149.4 million, a decrease of about $3.3 million or 2.2% versus the first half of 2011.  This decline was principally due to the funding of our pension which we have mentioned earlier.  Excluding the impact of our pension funding net of tax benefit and timing (inaudible) and other items or free cash was about 18% to the positive.","Our capital expenditures were 5.3% of revenue for six months ended June 30, 2012.  Free cash flow represented 46.2% of EBITDA in the first six months of 2012 reflecting a reduced conversionary due to the $72 million pension funding partially offset by the tax benefit associated with that.","Overall, our business is performing well, and we have a nice mix of growth from multiple vertical and we continue to invest for the future. ","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Kelly Flynn with Credit Suisse.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse","Great.  Thanks for taking my question first.  So my question relates to MediConnect and also Bloodhound and HRP.  Can you give us more specific sense of what revenue MediConnect contributed to the business in the second quarter?  And then also it would be helpful if you could tell us what the year-over-year growth rates were for both MediConnect as well as the Bloodhound and HRP businesses in the second quarter so we can try to figure out hopefully what impact the HRP and Bloodhound might have when they roll into organic?  Thanks.","Mark Anquillare","Well, I think what we have seen is nice and solid growth in the standpoint of all of our healthcare acquisitions.  We grew in double digits across the board in the first half of 2012 and MediConnect showed strength.  As we described at the time of the call on MediConnect, there is a second half seasonal aspect to MediConnect similar to our Health Risk Partners business in that anywhere from 50% for HRP and maybe as much as 70% from MediConnect is more weighted towards the second half.  So (inaudible) that gives you a little bit more visibility into where we are.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse","Well, I guess the thing is that I mean the health care business is growing over 30% organically.  So, I mean when you say double digit that could be anywhere from you know 10 to 30 for these acquisitions.  So, I mean could you give any more help on that?  are we talking -- do you think basically when HRP and Bloodhound roll into the organic base, is it likely to have a significant positive impact on the organic growth or should we think about their growth rate is being closer to the corporate organic rate at this point?","Mark Anquillare","Sure, let me try to give up a little bit more on that.  I think there is two things that you consider and just remember that I was to look back from the standpoint of healthcare, third quarter we did about $30 million last year and then we had a big step into fourth quarter we did about $38 million.  So there is a tougher comp but we feel very good about the continuation of strong organic growth and I think it come into the corporate growth rate there growing faster than the corporate organic growth rate, and that should provide the lift.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse - Analyst","Okay.  Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rayna Kumar with Evercore Partners.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners","Good morning, I am calling in fro David Togut.  Can you please talk about the specific factor that throughout the deterioration of mortgage results in the second quarter and do you expect these factors to persist during the next 18 months?","Scott Stephenson","Yeah, this is Scott, I will take that.  I mean, as Mark said before, when you think about the different parts of our business, the tools that we sell for purposes of supporting originations were up strongly.  And so, the difference in result is a function of the forensic and analysis we do of the loans that are gone bad.  And what we are seeing is a variety of movements inside the customer base where there are some customers that have ramped up their volumes but there had been others that have actually ramped down their volume substantially, just particularly in the mortgage insurance world, and that's just a function of market condition in that world.  So, that's a trend that we think we'll continue to work its way out in 2012.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners","Okay.  And just a follow-up to the previous question, do you think high 30% organic revenue growth in the healthcare vertical is sustainable, and if so why?","Mark Anquillare","I think I tried to answer that before, I mean, I think we feel very good about healthcare.  The comps become more challenging as we get towards the end of year.  So we still feel very good about the strong double-digit growth.  And to extent that we get a little bit more refined there, I think we've been winning customers, but I don't know if we have a very specific view lines dollar and percent growth.","Operator","Your next question is from Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.","Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo","How much of an impact this, the lower storm activity have on the insurance growth rate within Decision Analytics on the quarter?","Scott Stephenson","It's a little bit difficult to parse because what happens inside of our contracts is this.  If we have a customer who has exceeded their minimums and then we start to just basically charge on a transactional basis.  In very large parts, it will come to us and we'll renegotiate a higher minimum.  So, it's tough to do a direct comparison.  But let me just at least give you this.  It was definitely a drag in the tune of about 20 bps in the second quarter on overall growth.  I think that's the one way we kind of think about it.","So, I hope that gives you some clarity.  And what we're seeing which is obviously, may be fleeting but we've seen storm activity in July start to return to normal, which I think bodes well, I mean, like any insurance cycle and insurance trends I mean, things are up and down.  And I think we saw a very high activity in 2011.  We've seen unusually low activity in the first half of '12 and you would think things would start to return to normal.","Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo","So, how should we think about then that insurance piece of the Decision Analytics business going forward?  Is that really like a high single-digit revenue grower with upside to that due to whatever has happened with this storm activity?","Scott Stephenson","I just need to clarify, are you talking about insurance as a whole or you're talking about the insurance aspects of Decisions Analytics please?","Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo","Within Decision Analytics?","Scott Stephenson","I think we continue to feel very strong growth there is possible.  I mean, I -- we tell you that from the standpoint of insurance inside of DA, we do look at and I will just quickly digress.","When, we think about insurance I mean we're servicing a broad set of customers that is a combination of those customers from a risk assessment perspective and we try to cross-sell into Decision Analytics.  So, across the board, I think we do feel that that combined is a kind of high single-digit growth.  But we do have a view that Decision Analytics where most of that growth is going to be.  And we continue to feel strong about the opportunities there both in the second half of the year, as well as into the future.","Operator","","Your next question is from Bill Warmington with Raymond James.","Bill Warmington - Raymond James","I want to ask on the mortgage business.  When you saw the cross over point was going to come, when the originations business begins to outgrow the forensic piece and also, if you could remind us again what the mix is between the two businesses?","Mark Anquillare","Well, we remained cautions about mortgage to the full year.  I think we have said that if we exclude that revenue trends, so we talked about we are down about 7%.  I think we mentioned early on the year that that had been and continues to be our forecast of full year.","There is a customer that we described for most part that starts to normalize in fourth quarter.  But just given the uncertainty inside that market and also the movement in originations which have been strong in the second quarter and subsequently in the future the risk become a little bit cautious about giving too much optimism inside of mortgage for the remainder of the year.","Bill Warmington - Raymond James","","Okay.  How about the mix, if you can recall it was like two thirds forensic and third origination but that maybe dated now?","Mark Anquillare","Its now about 55% on the backend, it is a little bit greater than that 50% on the year-to-date perspective and that is obviously down from what it was because the forensic has been dropping and the front end has been increasing.","Bill Warmington - Raymond James","Okay.  And then, I wanted to ask also, if you could give some additional color on how you are integrating MediConnect into revenue integrity and also for the HEDIS with enterprise analytics?","Frank Coyne","Yeah, good.  So, the HEDIS part of our business actually formally reports into the MediConnect structure.  So, and we actually did that almost contemporaneous with the acquisition because the overlaps are just so obvious and so great and that is really -- that is working very well.","Bill Warmington - Raymond James","Good. ","Frank Coyne","And then, the connection of that set of capability, so starts retrieval and abstraction plus HEDIS, there is a very tight working relationship really at the level of the account, because when we are selling into the individual account you actually need to present the chart retrieval and abstraction solution at the same time as you present the HDC analytics and the five star analytics and that is what, all of that is part of the bundle that many customers are buying and so, we actually need to line all that up on a customer-by-customer basis when we're actually going to market.  And so we're well along on that also.","And really conceptually all of that, everything you just asked about, Bill, it is in our minds, one integrated business and we just continue more and more to move in the direction of operating it exactly in that way.","Bill Warmington - Raymond James","Okay.  And the last question I just wanted to ask about how exactly are you doing on a standalone basis with the XactContents module, and any thoughts on the European expansion?","Frank Coyne","XactContents continues to grow well and its growth rate is outpacing the growth rate of the market.  It's one of the more highly growing parts of the Xactware portfolio.  We feel the market is coming in the direction of our solutions.  There is -- just for little color, there is a lot of working on content, which is very labor intense, and that's not our method.  It's we're doing it the Verisk way build it once and sell it many, many times.  And the market seems to be coming to that.","And in Europe we continue to make very steady progress.  We've actually with one customer leaped across the English Channel into Mainland Europe, and we're very happy about that and we just continue to expect more and more growth throughout Europe.  And we're actually looking at other geographies as well.  It's a tool, which is extensible, and what paces that primarily actually is the availability of enough local data in order to have relatively good cost factors inside the mall.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","I want to ask about the P&C insurance industry.  Obviously premiums were rising in 2011 to help your 2013 risk assessment growth.  I wanted to go further to say when the P&C insurance industry is doing better should it just lift your Decision Analytics insurance piece through request are in other products and if so, what would be the timing of any DA lift that you get from the insurance industry?","Frank Coyne","I mean, yes, you're generally on the right path.  But I guess what I want to just emphasize is the degree of one-to-one coupling of those two factors.  There is a lot that goes on inside of our customers' consideration of our solutions.  And the primary point is that every one of our DA solutions is going to get highly, highly scrutinized before it's purchased.  I mean, our customers are very sober minded, risk bearing entities, and they usually we go through a proof of concept.  And so, at the end of the day, their decision to buy a Decision Analytics solution is really based upon the value of that -- of that solution.","It is true that if their results overall are stronger at the margin, I would say, their willingness to think about purchasing our new solutions that probably goes up somewhat but I really want to caution against you thinking that it\u2019s a one for one correspondence because it just doesn\u2019t work that way.  The sales cycles are long and the considerations are very technical when they look at minor products.  But yes, on balance, it is actually helpful.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","I was asking about given the sales cycle that you just talked which are probably shorter when the P&C is doing better, when and how long do you think it will take to see benefit in your DA insurance segment for just the factor that the P&C insurance industry has been doing better for over a year now?","Frank Coyne","Well, again, I don\u2019t actually think the decision -- your premise is the one that we actually don\u2019t share.  So, I don\u2019t think that the coupling is as tight as maybe you're suggesting it in your question, but I would say that there are long smooth cycles inside of the insurance industry and I think the industry itself sort of observes changing behavior relatively slowly.  So, you should think in terms of sort of cycle thing out, it\u2019s over a couple of years basically.  And I again, the Decision Analytics decision making cycle is not really going to be respond all that strongly or all that quickly to what's going on inside of the industry overall.  (inaudible).  We're very optimistic about getting our solutions sold.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","How long is a typical sales cycle to cross over new DA solution to insurance company?","Frank Coyne","18 months would probably be a good midpoint.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Suzanne Stein with Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley","Have you disclosed the cost of the new healthcare platform, and can you just talk about how significant this could be from the cost side?  And this in terms of future margin?","Frank Coyne","Sure.  Suzy, I think we've described that we were talking about -- we call that two major initiatives that were taking place specifically around 2012 and it was the combination of the unified platform which is the healthcare platform in combination with our next generation platform which is the catastrophe modeling platform.  Now, what we said was the two combined for '12, we're targeting towards about $10 million.","Now, I think your question as I heard it was really more focused the impact of margin.  So, when we talk about the $10 million a majority of that is programming cost.  So, as a result that is capitalized, it becomes a part of the CapEx.","As a part of the overall initiative, clearly there is a lot of cost associated with modelers and scientists to help with the catastrophe modeling science, but a good chunk of our investment in \u201812 is going to be CapEx and I would tell you that as we think about 2013 it may become a little bit more period cost but not that dramatic.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to affect margins in too negative or material way.","Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley","Okay, I guess that was very helpful the question is also should that drive margin improvement in longer term?  I mean is that for cost efficiency over the long run?","Scott Stephenson","","I'm going to go back and forth, this is Scott.  the answer is I think the opportunity there is to create a more robust platform and on the healthcare side it could become more efficient but the reality is we are doing this to drive top line growth.  I mean it is the ability to bring solutions together to make it easier for customers to buy and make user experience more pleasing and that has been kind of a lot of the focus of these two initiatives.","Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great then just a quick one on share buybacks.  You've done a great job of returning capital to shareholders.  Do you think this will continue at a similar pace going forward?","Frank Coyne","Well as I think we have always said I mean we have a view that we are really trying to create shareholder return our first and primary focus is to invest in the business.  So the extent that we have opportunities around the acquisition front that would be our primary first use of capital and then we will continue to do buybacks to eliminate dilution.  ","Extending beyond dilution and returning additional capital beyond that it\u2019s really a balancing act.  We try to take a look at little bit about the pipeline we want to make sure we have enough capacity to continue to execute on that growth strategy.  So, I think what you have seen over the last couple of quarters is a little bit of a dialing back because of the actual acquisition activity that we have had.","Operator","Your next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Just a quick question on the international aspect.  Could you tell us what the mix now is for international and, I think Scott mentioned, you are seeing some pretty growth there, I understand is coming off a smaller base, but are we talking about high double digit?  So what sort of growth are we seeing there?","Frank Coyne","You got to bear in mind the base is very small, I mean, we really got only two businesses at the moment that have material international footprints.  And so, inside of our revenue overall non-domestic might be about 5% or something like that.  So the rates of growth are good but you are coming off from a very small base.  This is a long March for Verisk.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Yeah, correct, okay, fair enough.  And then just from a strategic standpoint I guess in the mortgage division is the, obviously you have strong set of underwriting tools and you have, like you said, customer issue on the forensic side, but is this strategy that sort of just stick with the tools and ride out the storm per se or is that thought or opportunity around acquiring volume and market share and maybe bulking up that unit a bit?","Frank Coyne","That is not where our thinking goes at this time, so the acquiring and bulking up.  We do remain very interested in other forms of solution inside of the commercial banking industry, I mean, that is definitely in mind.  But when you look at the mortgage vertical itself we have a very complete set of solutions.  And we are continuing to try to make them better and we do believe that in normalized market conditions we would have a very nice business.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","So I guess to follow on that could you give us some idea of I guess, the other solution as you just referred to in the commercial banking industry and would that be sort of innovation coming from internally or would you need to acquire something?","Frank Coyne","Well, we are not really talking about our plans specifically in that area and as always we remain open to developing things internally and building our platform through acquisition.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","And last question just for Mark.  In terms of the Aspect Loss that acquisition. I mean. I know this is really small, should we see or should we be modeling any sort of contribution benefit from that deal?","Mark Anquillare","I just want to describe to you that it is really very much a tuck-in acquisition to a business that is it is small but growing inside of Verisk as a whole.  It is just not going to hit the (inaudible) or make any dramatic impact on revenue that you can consider.","Operator","Your next question is from James Friedman with SIG.","James Friedman - SIG","Hi, thanks for taking my question.  I wasn\u2019t sure if it was Mark or Scott who was speaking, but with regard to the healthcare client that you mentioned that's coming on board in the second half how does the revenue recognition work on that?","Scott Stephenson","Hi.  Do you want to take it, Mark?","Mark Anquillare","Yeah, just you'd appreciate what we are talking about was we are moving one large customer who is a pretty broad based customer, we are moving from our existing solution to our new unified platform.  That is kind of a test customer.","So, from a revenue recognition perspective we are providing the same set of solutions, same set of services, we are continuing to roll out maybe some additional analytics because of the new platform, but the reality is the revenue reckoned does not change it is the same customer providing and we are providing a maybe more complete set but same set of our solutions.","James Friedman - SIG","I was just trying to figure out had there been any expenses that weren't offset by revenue at this stage in the customer's adoption?","Mark Anquillare","I think there has been cost to the overall unified platform but as most of that has been capitalized, so I don\u2019t think you can see a blip in any margin calculation that I think I tried to highlight that to Suzy so.","James Friedman - SIG","And then in addition, Mark, you had mentioned there was 20 bps, which is really helpful of impact in the insurance decision.  I just want to make sure I got the denominator right.  Was that 20 bps on the insurance Decision Analytics or was that on the Decision Analytics or was that on the company overall?","Mark Anquillare","Sure.  So, it is on the company overall and it is about 20 to 30 bps, yes.","James Friedman - SIG","Got you.  Yeah, that's a helpful number.  And then, lastly, it seem like the repurchase though substantial was slightly less than the east, let me get my language right, the KSOP, so you actually had a slight increase in the share account.  Is there anything to read into that or is that just a function f when the shares come on?","Mark Anquillare","Let me just remind everybody about the KSOP.  The KSOP in a majority of the expense was accelerated at the time of the IPO.  So we probably went it at and too much down for some investors, but that\u2019s in large part behind it, I will come back in a minute.  But all you see right now is a reserve as it relates to the KSOP is the 401K match component.  So really the only thing you should be seeing is maybe MediConnect coming in there, because this is a 401K match of those employees, but the reality is it should be pretty consistent and it's consistent with kind of how we match our employees contribution to that program.","The other thing that I will just highlight is the way these SOPK is handled is that we need to take all those shares and pass them along to participants by the end of 2013, so it is depended up on what the value of the shares are and how many shares are left.  There could be, as we always talked about, some 2013 events that would be a non-cash one time type of item to end the ESOP plan.","If you are looking broadly at our share count, and I am just trying to interpret some of your question, there were and continue to be option exercises associated with our long term incentive plans and maybe the option exercised and then number of shares coming out exceeded the buybacks we did in the quarter.  So, there was may be some dilution.  We try to handle that over the long term, not quarter by quarter.","Operator","Your next question from Jennifer Huang with UBS.","Jennifer Huang - UBS","Hi, thanks for taking the question.  Did you guys talk about the sales implementation cycle being I guess the 18 months for the -- on the insurance side.  Can you talk about that on the health care side?  And in terms of the revenue growth as we have seen in health care with inside on those revenues open products that were sold, so part of the solutions that were several quarters ago, so can you just talk about the pipeline in terms of sales and implementation currently and how that compares to may be a year ago?","Frank Coyne","Yeah, well, the pipeline is stronger than it was a year ago if for no other reason that we have more solutions.  And so, when -- we actually grid it out where we look at each customer and we look at which parts of our suite they buy and don\u2019t buy.  And relative to last year there is actually more white space on that grid because the solution sets are expanded even though there are -- we have filled in some of the customers on that same grid.  So that definitely the sense of opportunity in the market is greater.","The sale cycles vary in healthcare depending up on which part of the solution mix that we are talking about.  So, when we talk about revenue integrity, those solutions actually tend to be on somewhat faster sale cycles.  There are also I would say among the things that we do they have some of the most easily quantified value propositions.  There is just a great urgency about getting the revenue integrity calculations right because reimbursement from Medicare, for example, literally hinges upon it, and it all occurs within the calendar year.","So there is actually a genuine push on the part of the customers to get into those solutions, and I would embrace the MediConnect solutions inside of that.  At the other end of the spectrum would probably be the medical intelligence analytics that we sell which are very useful for getting things like actuarial calculations correct and reserving right, etc, but those tend to sort of slightly less urgently felt sorts of the needs.  And then -- so, I would say the sales cycles are longest there and probably in the 18 month plus range.  And then somewhere in the middle would be our payment accuracy solution where the value for opposition is strong and quantifiable, but the amount of integration that\u2019s required is a little bit greater and so it just tends to pace things a little bit more.","Jennifer Huang - UBS","Okay.  And that's very helpful.  And then I know there is still uncertainties out there around the healthcare reform --","Frank Coyne","Yeah.","Jennifer Huang - UBS","But as it stands today, I guess how do you think that -- how that impacts the healthcare business?","Frank Coyne","It really doesn\u2019t have a lot of impact.  I mean, you have to go back to the basic fast that most of our businesses with payors and the net effect of the healthcare reform would due to have more people on private or formal insurance system which on balance would just expand the size of that and so was sort of a moderate part -- a benign moderately positive basically.","I would also say I think that the that there is also inside of the overall reform the government is putting a little bit more emphasis on using data analytics and emphasizing things like matching cost and quality outcomes.  And those are all good for us because anybody who just get more thoughtful about how to run healthcare is going to naturally be more interested in the kind of things that we do.","Operator","Your next question is from Bill Cork with KBW.","Bill Cork - KBW","Good morning, just wanted to go back to the expense side.  Sequentially, I think you had the impact of the equity awards this quarter.  Year-over-year you still have the comp increases and I think also this quarter you had some impact from the pension freeze.  Just trying to get a sense of where Q2 is from a run rate perspective and where we could expect the second half of the year to kind of shake out?","Mark Anquillare","So I mean let me just kind of reiterate I think what you said.  So, if I was to look at the second quarter and look at it solely you know, the salary increases that were in will remain for remainder of the year.  So, I don\u2019t think you would adjust for anything there. ","The items that I will call out is inside of the margins we have a long term incentive with the equity compensation because of the way claim participants who are aged 62 vest we do have an acceleration in the second quarter.  That\u2019s about $4 to $4.5 million that affected the quarter and that will kind of normalize out for the remainder of the year.  So, that\u2019s something you should probably think about.","Pension, I think you would probably expect that to just continue with what you saw first half.  And we did also mention that the acquisitions are a little bit seasonal.  So, the margins in the first half of the year are little bit lighter than what we will see in the second half.  So that\u2019s a bit of a positive in the second half as you think about margins overall.","Operator","And we have a follow up question from Kelly Flynn with Credit Suisse.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse","Thanks just a couple of quick follow ups.  First on the mortgage business, I know you said you expected to be weak for rest of the year but I was hoping you can help us work through how we should think about the tougher comp that the business had in this quarter and kind of should that lead to an improvement in the growth rate all else equal in the third and fourth quarter?  So why was the comp down if you could remind us and what impact did that have in the back half growth rate?","Mark Anquillare","I think we have always we said right from the beginning of the year is that we are targeting sometimes somewhere around 7% decline for the full year.  And I think what we view right now is we don\u2019t think we have enough information to change that view.  ","From a comp perspective, we talked about a customer that has been kind of moving back to a more normalized level of forensic review that I think we saw more or less normalizing in the fourth quarter of this year.","And the other thing that I highlighted was that what helped us in the first half was a kind of a pretty rich mortgage origination environment which was rather positive and I am not sure if the NBA and others expect that to continue for the second half and that works against us.","So those are the things that like factoring just some of our thinking.  Obviously, I talked about the macro factors.  At the same time, I mean, I think we have a view that we are still winning customers and we are making progress both on the front end and call out on the back end.  So, all of that is, bodes well for the future but I want to be cautious about where we are today.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse","Okay, but it grew, I think it grew a percent in the second quarter of 2011 and I understand you had a customer kind of rolling off but that was a much better growth rate than any other quarter in the year.  Was there anything else going on there that made for that especially strong growth rate in the second quarter of \u201911?","Mark Anquillare","Well, I do know that the second quarter of \u201911 we were talking about that one customer, they did a lot of volume with us in that quarter.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse","Okay, so was that one customer okay, got it.  And then just another question on the insurance part of Decision Analytics.  I think clearly you guys have called out Xactware and some of the weather comps there, but could you give us a little more detail on the other businesses and I would ask it this way.  Which businesses are seeing accelerating growth in line item, and which ones are decelerating aside from Xactware?","Mark Anquillare","Want to talk a little bit about cash remodeling and kind of I think that will probably our strongest --","Frank Coyne","Yeah.  So I think, we have -- well, first of all, don\u2019t overlook the fact that inside of Xactware there is actually a variety of things that get done.  And some of them are related to claims and some of them are related to underwriting some of them are domestic and some of them are overseas.  And so you don\u2019t have to pick Xactware part.  And the growth rate associated with that bundle of thing would have been materially different if storm activity had been equivalent in 2012 to what it was in 2011.  So just that background.","Other things that are going on inside of the insurance DA mix, two things I would particularly highlight.  One would be catastrophe modeling Mark talked about us literally sweeping the board in terms of all the capons issued in 2012 which we actually think of as the purest test of the quality of the science inside of the model.  And so, we find that a really encouraging result.","Basically, there are still a lot of parallel country combinations to be modeled.  And we find that the market is very open to our solutions.  And all of that just compounds inside of the work we are doing, that create a new platform for serving up the models to get them even more inline with the customers workflows.  That will be one thing that I would point out.","Another thing I would point out is underwriting.  As you know, we created an underwriting unit at the beginning of this year and its growth rate is very strong, it is greater than the growth rate of Decision Analytics overall.  And as we access where we sit in the P&C world, strengthening our underwriting solutions and our position is on of our biggest opportunity.  It is actually, that we are so strong in claims, we are so strong in catastrophe modeling, we are so strong in rating but underwriting is something where underwriting not rating is a place where we can still definitely gain altitude.  And so far in 2012 as well, the results have been good.","Operator","","And your next question comes from Tim Mchugh with William Blair.","Tim Mchugh - William Blair","Just following up for the previous question.  I want to ask a similar question about healthcare.  If you can just talk about the different service lines or product lines, there they all seem to be doing well, but is there any one of them that is doing particularly better or worse relative to the others?","Frank Coyne","I mean basically, so just to kind of clarify what we do.  First of all, you can really put it -- we put it in the four buckets.  So, there is what we call enterprise analytics, which is the variety of medical intelligence products which are aimed at things like risk adjusting and risks scoring individual members of a population.  We have also got our enterprise intelligence, which is basically the OLAP platform through which a plan can consume the analytics and apply them to their decisioning.","Then, we have got payment accuracy, which is coming through claims flows in order to basically clean those claims flows, find the one the claims that are suspicious and then take them through some clinical review in order to present a very clean view of the claim.","And we supplemented that with what we did what we are now doing with our colleagues at Bloodhound, where in addition to that sort of retrospective -- I shouldn\u2019t say retrospective, later in the process analysis as we can also deal with the claims even before they are adjudicated inside of the claim system.  That is the second thing.","Third thing is what we call revenue integrity, which is essentially helping our customers with their own reimbursement.  So, I mentioned before, HCC analytics for Medicare Advantage reimbursement.  And more generally, five star kinds of analytics that also relate to Medicare reimbursement.  So that is revenue integrity.","And then, the fourth thing we do is, it is under the banner of MediConnect and its chart retrieval and abstraction.  So, it's getting the clinical data so that you can analyze it.  The first order use of that data actually is inside the things like HEDIS calculations, as well as the revenue integrity work that I just described.","So, those are the four big buckets.  And they are all doing well actually and I think that is really the message here.  But I would say that probably, at the moment at least, we are getting a little bit more gross from chart retrieval abstraction and the revenue integrity set of things but that is detail underneath the general and\/or of that we're well-positioned, its kind of everywhere really.","Tim Mchugh - William Blair","Okay.  And the workers comp opportunity that you are seeing in terms of the synergy between the P&C and MediConnect.","Frank Coyne","Right.","Tim Mchugh - William Blair","Where, is that in the healthcare business or you are coming at that from the insurance platform?","Frank Coyne","That the revenue gets recognized in the payment accuracy part of the healthcare business.  With a bigger assist from our P&C colleagues.  We are working on claims on the P&C side.","","Operator","Thank you.  I would now turn the call back over Frank Coyne for any closing remark.","Frank Coyne","Yes.  Well, thank you very much for joining us on second quarter results and I would like to thank you for your interest and your questions.  And we look forward to well speaking with you again next quarter.  Have a good day.","Operator","","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's SVP and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.","Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer","Thank you, Shannon, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2014 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.","All numbers we discussed today, unless otherwise stated, will reflect continuing operations and exclude the results from Interthinx. Interthinx is shown in discontinued operations reflecting the sale of the business in March 2014. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K, which we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, until March 26, 2015, on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Eva, and good morning, everyone.","We're very pleased with the results we reported last night with outstanding revenue growth and strong operating discipline. In the fourth quarter, we delivered excellent results with total revenue growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 18%. Full year revenue and diluted adjusted EPS both grew about 9%.","Excluding the costs associated with the FTC review of the EVT acquisition and the fourth quarter risk assessment reorganization costs that Mark will discuss in more detail, our diluted adjusted EPS growth in the quarter was 22%. Our consolidated organic revenue growth for the full year was 9.4%, Profitability was strong with an EBITDA margin of 46.2% in the quarter and 46% for the full year.","Adjusting for FTC-related costs and Decision Analytics and the reorganization and risk assessment, full year EBITDA margins were 46.6%. This is consistent with our expectations and previous comments that we would maintain margins at about the same level as 2013, while also investing in our business. As you know, in December, we concluded our efforts to acquire EVT following the vote by the FTC to challenge the transaction. We worked hard to come to a mutually agreeable solution with the FTC, but no agreement could be reached that was in the best interest of our shareholders.","While we were disappointed in the FTC's decision, we are committed to remote sensing and imagery analytics and intend to be the leader in these areas. For competitive reasons, we'll be measured today in our comments regarding our go-forward strategy. The solutions we have and will create over time will be based on a multi-tier, multi-spectral set of images. We are doing this today with satellites in our Verisk Climate division and with non-satellite images at Xactware. In fact, Xactware recently announced that Property InSight is now available for all residential, commercial and agricultural structures in the United States.","The Property InSight data bundle includes 3D property models, roof exterior and property measurements and property risk factors, among other critical data points, for professionals who work with properties. We also announced the launch of the Xactware Remote Sensing Lab, a collaborative industry group dedicated to developing remote sensing technologies specific to the property industry.","The Lab is a natural extension of Verisk's long history of partnering with customers on new technology and applications. Participants in the Lab include experts in remote-sensing, computer vision, geospatial intelligence and analysis, computer science, engineering and geology.","We expect to pursue our strategy through balanced investments, synchronized with revenue growth, and will remain within our typical margin expectations. As we had accumulated cash in anticipation of EVT transaction, we determined that a return of capital to our shareholders in the form of a $500 million accelerated share repurchase was appropriate.","This was in addition to the $90 million in the fourth quarter and $275 million for the full year we spent repurchasing shares in the open market. Our remaining authorization at the end of the quarter was $190 million. We continue to feel confident in our long-term opportunities to grow shareholder value, and the accelerated share repurchase is evidence of that confidence.","In addition to returning capital to our shareholders, we remain active in looking at M&A opportunities. We continue to focus on assets with a strong strategic fit, and as we've been discussing with you, we are interested in using acquisitions to support our international expansion efforts. We remain interested in both our existing verticals as well as potentially other global verticals that can leverage our existing intellectual property.","In the fourth quarter, we made two small acquisitions, both of which expanded our global footprint. One, DART, is in financial services and is now part of Argus. The other, Maplecroft, is in the area of country and political risk and an important complement to our existing supply chain initiatives.","DART is a leading provider of benchmarking and advisory solutions to financial services institutions in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia-Pacific markets. Argus and DART will serve financial institutions in lending and payment product optimization.","Maplecroft, which is based in the U.K., uses a proprietary data aggregation and analytical approach enabling its customers to assess, monitor and forecast a growing range of worldwide risks, including geopolitical and societal risks, many down to the local site level. Maplecroft's unique solutions are used by multinational companies, financial institutions, governments and NGOs. Maplecroft's research data and platforms complement our world-class capability in natural catastrophe and extreme weather impact assessment in order to form a comprehensive set of analytic solutions. The combination will enable organizations to make informed risk-adjusted decisions for their assets, operations and supply chains.","With the addition of Maplecroft, we are establishing ourselves as a leading provider of value chain optimization tools, providing comprehensive quantitative risk analytics and platforms by which our customers can visualize, quantify, mitigate and manage their risks. We have rebranded the company Verisk Maplecroft to reflect our growing international strategy. You'll have a chance to see Maplecroft's solutions at our Investor Day next week on March 5 in New York City.","As we look back over the past two years, we've been able to deliver very good results in the context of a temporary step-up in our investments and a sizable expansion of our healthcare business. Both our organic revenue growth and our operating profitability continue to be sector leading, and we remain committed to a prudent mix of M&A and share repurchases over time to complement and enhance our core businesses. This combination positions us very well to deliver the kinds of shareholder returns over the next several years that we expect of ourselves and that you expect of us.","So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover the financials in more detail.","Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Scott.","For the fourth quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing in the future. Revenue grew 11.6% for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 and 9.5% for the fiscal year 2014. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, revenue grew 11.4% for the fourth quarter and 9.4% for the fiscal year 2014. The strong organic growth reflects the health of our business and the value we deliver to our customers.","Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 15.2% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 15% on an organic basis. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in financial services, healthcare and insurance. For the full year, Decision Analytics revenue grew 12.1% as reported and organically. Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category grew 12.3% for the fourth quarter of 2014. Underwriting solutions led the growth, followed by catastrophe modeling and loss quantification solutions. Insurance fraud claims solutions also contributed to the growth. Overall, growth was driven by the increased adoption of existing and new solutions and annual increases in invoices.","Touchstone, our next-generation catastrophe modeling platform, continued to drive growth, as did our GIS risk platform and property replacement cost underwriting solutions.","In the Financial Services category, revenue grew 25.2% in the fourth quarter 2014. The revenue increase was driven by demand of our analytic solutions and services. As you know, we sometimes see project revenue in the fourth quarter from our clients as they look to fully utilize their budgets, and again saw that in 2014. For the full year, Financial Services revenue grew 19.3%.","In the healthcare vertical, revenue in the fourth quarter grew 21.8%, all organic, with growth across all divisions led by Payment Accuracy Solutions. For the fiscal year 2014, revenue from healthcare grew 16.2% at the higher end of the direction we gave you for mid-teens growth. This is a strong outcome in the area of our business that is more transactional than the rest of Verisk.","As we look ahead to 2015, we want you to understand a change in one part of the revenue in the Medicare Advantage area of our RQI business at Verisk Health. We recently adjusted some of our contract language at Verisk Health to accommodate health plans that want to include prospective health assessment costs in their medical loss ratios.","We prefer changing the contract language instead of becoming a licensed medical provider. There is no impact to our bottom line as we've always netted out these revenues and expenses. The only result is a change in less pass-through revenue in 2015 than in prior years.","Overall, we expect to see good growth for the full year versus comparable 2014 revenue number of $279.5 million. Similar to 2014, revenue growth will be somewhat weighted to the latter part of the year, and while we don't breakout profitability of Verisk Health, we expect EBIT to grow faster than revenue in 2015 as we continue with our program of operational improvements.","In specialized markets category, revenue declined 0.5% in the fourth quarter 2014 and 0.8% for the full year. Good growth in Weather and Climate Analytics and Environmental Health and Safety Solution was more than offset by lower activity related to government customers. Verisk Climate continues to provide important analytic content for our insurance customers and our supply chain related initiatives. The specialized category will return to growth in 2015 both as reported and organically.","Turning to Risk Assessment, for the fourth quarter, we reported revenue growth of 5.5% indicating the value to our long-standing insurance customers. The overall increase within the segment was due, in part, to 5.1% revenue growth of our industry-standard insurance programs resulting primarily from growth in 2014 invoices effective January 1.","Property-specific rating and underwriting revenue increased 6.8% in the fourth quarter. Growth was a result of new sales with higher committed volumes. For the full year, Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.2% driven by 5.1% of growth in industry-standard programs and 5.7% of specific rating underwriting category.","For the fourth quarter 2014, EBITDA grew 13.4% to $214.6 million with an EBITDA margin of 46.2%. For the fiscal year 2014, EBITDA grew 7.8% to $803 million with an EBITDA margin of 46%. Excluding professional fees related to the FTC of $6.9 million for the full year 2014, including $1.7 million in the fourth quarter as well as risk assessment reorganization costs of $4.8 million in the fourth quarter 2014, EBITDA margin was 46.6% for the fiscal year 2014.","The fourth quarter 2014 EBITDA margin for Decision Analytics increased 41.1% from 38.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The fiscal year 2014 EBITDA margin in Decision Analytics was 39.6% versus 40.7% in the fiscal year 2013. Excluding the FTC-related costs, full year Decision Analytics EBITDA margin was 40.2%.","Over the past year, we've been working to position our core insurance business for sustained growth and innovation into the future. In the fourth quarter, we offered voluntary resignation packages to a group of our long-tenured employees to honor their solid contributions to the business. The risk assessment reorganization was a talent realignment rather than simply a cost reduction exercise. We intend to reinvest the savings from those taking these packages back into our core business in the areas like product strategy, advanced analytics, technology platform and customer engagements, which are crucial for sustained innovation.","The fourth quarter 2014 EBITDA margin Risk Assessment decreased 55.4% from 57% in fourth quarter of 2013. Reported fiscal year 2014 EBITDA margin for Risk Assessment was 56.7% versus 56.1% in the fiscal year 2013. Excluding the reorganization costs, EBITDA margin Risk Assessment was 58.3% and 57.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and fiscal year of 2014 respectively, an increase versus the comparable periods in 2013.","Our interest expense was down nominally in the first quarter versus the respective period in 2013. This decrease was due to repayment of private placement debt of $180 million during 2013. Our reported effective tax rate was $37.8 million for the fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, the effective tax rate was 37.2%.","Net income increased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2014 driven by growth in the business, and net income grew 8.3% for the fiscal year of 2014. Adjusted net income increased 13.5% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 6.4% for the fiscal year 2014. Diluted adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.65 and $2.40 for the full year reflecting growth of 18.2% and 8.6% respectively. The average diluted share count was 167.1 million shares in the quarter. On December 31, 2014, we had 161.1 million diluted shares outstanding reflecting the execution of the accelerated share repurchase.","In the fourth quarter of 2014, the company executed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase. Under the ASR program, we received an aggregate initial delivery of approximately 6.4 million shares, which represented an estimated 80% of the ASR at the then current prices. The total number of shares repurchased under the ASR were based on a discount from the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock over the course of the program, which will be run up to six months or conclude earlier at the broker's option. At final settlement, we expect to receive additional shares of our stock.","In the fourth quarter, we also repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares for $90.5 million prior to the announcement of the ASR. For those shares purchased in the quarter, the average price we paid was $62.54. At December 31, 2014, the company had about $190 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs of about 20%.","Turning to the balance sheet, as of December 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents were $39.4 million. Total debt, both short-term and long-term, totaled $1.4 billion including about $160 million of revolver borrowings. Today, our incremental debt capacity is about $1 billion and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Our total debt to EBITDA at December 31 was 1.8 times, below our steady state target.","In 2014, free cash flow defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, adjusted for the sale of our Mortgage Services business grew 3.4% compared with the prior period to $329.5 million and represented 41% of EBITDA conversion in 12 months of 2014. Growth in free cash flows was driven by improved profitability of the business and stable CapEx partially offset by shifts in the timing of tax benefits in 2013, previously discussed, as well as other timing items.","Capital expenditures were $146.8 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $0.8 million over the same period in 2013. Capital expenditures were 8.4% of revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014.","As you think about your models for the full year 2015, let me give you what our quarterly Verisk Health revenues for 2014 would have been if reported on the basis of the new contract language. First quarter, $58.4 million. Second quarter, $56 million. Third quarter, $81.1 million. Fourth quarter, $84 million. That's $279.5 million for the full year.","Turning to our full company P&L, we anticipate the amortization of intangibles of about $53 million, fixed assets depreciation and amortization of about $100 million, and the tax rate around 38%. Because of the ASR, our share count will be down year-over-year in 2015. But we will continue to evaluate additional repurchases in the context of our broader capital allocation program and market conditions.","Based on the current debt balances and maturities, full year interest expense will be about $66 million with the first quarter interest expense around $18 million declining through the year. We expect CapEx of about $115 million up modestly from 2014.","Overall, we are pleased to report that our business is performing very well. We are seeing growth from multiple verticals and we are executing on our operational plans.","With that, let me turn it back over to you for comment before Q&A.","Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer","Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. This will give more people an opportunity to ask their questions.","And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair and Company. Your line is now open.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. I guess the first question just on the margins, and I guess as we think towards next year, if I adjust for the new revenue presentation for healthcare I guess, my quick math, which could be wrong, tells me that's about a 90 basis point boost to the margin just because that's pass-through revenue. And then there's another 60 basis points from stripping out the professional fees in restructuring. So between those two that puts you above the 45% to 47% range, I guess. You've talked about being within. Is that still the range, then, that we should we think about next year, or are there factors offsetting it that the underlying margins would be coming down?","Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Tim, thanks for the question. I think your math is good. To the extent you think about the FTC costs, which we do agree are onetime, and the nature of the change in accounting, the 90 bps is about right in both cases.","I'll continue to just to highlight that we have a high degree of good feelings about the business into 2015, especially around margin performance. We think that we have scale in all of those businesses. What we continue to, obviously, balance is the investment in the business to make sure that we grow into the future. So our view is, we're feeling very positive about where margins should be anticipated in 2015, moderated by what I would say is some overlap in investment.","The other thing I'll highlight to the team, I think we tried to bring it out inside of the conversation, the script is that the iPass reorganization, albeit a $4.8 million number, is probably something that will come back into the P&L in 2015. We are looking to redeploy those resources.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And the healthcare comment was \u2013 I guess, I wasn't clear what you, from a revenue growth perspective on, I guess, the new revenue presentation. Are you still looking for double-digit growth or mid-teens growth like you were talking about last year in that business or, I guess, on an underlying basis, how are you thinking about the outlook there?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We feel good about the business. The growth in 2014 was broadly based across many different solution sets. We expect the growth in 2015 to be broadly based across several solution sets.","One of the metrics that, among several, but one that some folks follow is the rate of growth in the Medicare Advantage population. It's been the case, and we expect it will continue to be the case, that in that segment of what we do, we would grow faster than the underlying market, which is actually true of a lot of what Verisk does across our many solution sets. So we feel very good about our growth into 2015.","Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And we would take that growth and grow it off of the $279.5 million that we were describing throughout the day.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, guys. So just to follow up on the healthcare, like thinking longer term, one of your competitors obviously just went public and they've thrown out long-term targets of 20%-plus with some mid-30%s margins and so forth. I was just curious if you guys could provide us any color. I know anecdotally you guys are very positive on the space, but just trying to get a sense of how we should think about this over the next, call it, five years.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, our mix is by degrees different from theirs. And so we're certainly interested in an (24:14) company with whom we compete in some categories. But our reference point is really us and the solutions that we've got and the customers that we're serving.","And this is one of the places inside of Verisk where, as we've said in the past, we've actually got secular tailwinds in the form of just kind of the underlying demand in the market, and it causes us to feel good about where we sit. We have strengthened the business operationally and expect to continue to do that. So it's a positive outlook for us inside of the healthcare space.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then just on your M&A pipeline, so for a couple of years, I guess, we've heard you talk about a very active M&A pipeline and maybe the last year, the pending EVT deals that have held you guys back. But what's the roadblock or what's the delay in terms of executing some of these deals that you have in your pipeline?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, maybe other than sort of the obvious one about the FTC process last year. I wouldn't call it a road block, but I would describe us as a very thoughtful acquirer. There are any number of transactions that we could have closed over the course of the last 12 months to 18 months, some of which you actually would have heard about if you observed the space around us where, just based upon our sense of valuation versus the sellers' ambitions, we were definitely positioned to buy businesses, but for valuation considerations chose not to. So we don't actually feel constrained and are leaning very heavily into the M&A agenda.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Congrats on the quarter.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi. I was wondering, could we dig a little deeper as to why the change in the accounting methodology and what opportunities it either opens or changes from a demand perspective in the healthcare business?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So just to go back to fundamentally why we're making this change, our customers in the context of the Accountable (sic) [Affordable] Care Act, are being measured and managed on their medical loss ratios. And they need to make sure that they don't fall below levels that the government has identified as the benchmark.","So what they're interested to do is to have as many costs reflected in the expense line, which is the numerator of the calculation. One of those expenses that our customers would like to have in that numerator is the cost of prospective health assessments, and that's the product line that Mark was describing.","In order for us to provide the service and book the gross revenue, we would have to have \u2013 we would have to be treated as if we were a provider. We would have to have a provider ID. We're not interested in being that. We're not interested in having the liability associated with being a provider.","So all we've done is we've said that the pass-through revenue associated with that service, we're just not going to book as revenue anymore. Otherwise, we're still providing the service just as much as we did before. We're simply changing the way that we account for it, and that is the only change. And it really has zero interaction with our business going forward.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Got it. That's very helpful. And then on the insurance business, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing from an underlining demand trends. I know that there's been no correlation between premium movements. But how do you feel about that, and how long does it take, you think, to create that imagery business as opposed to the acquisition? Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Okay. So let me \u2013 two very different questions, both good questions. So the insurance market has its ebbs and its flows. We're in a place right now where it certainly is not growing at high rates. It cycles around a little bit, but as we've often described, our opportunity is really based on the amount of value that we can create for our customers, the amount of innovation we can put into existing and new solutions.","And so our situation is very similar to what it has always been, which is we love the insurance market and our customers. It's a steady market, which is of course what we all look to insurance for, and our performance is going to be a function of the innovation and value that we can bring.","On the Aerial Imagery front, I just really want to emphasize two things that I hope are clear, but just to make sure. The first one is we've got fully dimensioned analytics already; the analytics are already built. And the second is that we have a set of images that cover the entire country. So we're all dressed up and ready to go.","The ongoing issue with respect to imagery is that we would like to see the quality of the images improved and, in fact, that was part of the thought process around EVT was that we would start with their library but improve it. We're now discussing multiple additional ways that we could go about doing that, and we will inform you when we have chosen which of those paths we're going to go down. But we feel very good about where we sit, and we feel very bullish about the business going forward.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line in now open.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So in healthcare, just conceptually, how should we think about the trajectory of healthcare growth rates in 2015 given seasonality but also given the fact that the comps are easier in the first half of the year?","Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Toni, so I just want to try to catch the question. Very similar to what we've talked in the past, from a seasonal perspective, the suites (30:32) regarding Medicare Advantage and the work that we do with RQI is second-half weighted. So we have talked about 60% at the end of the second half, 40% in the first. And I think you'll see that same type of ramp as we progress through the year.","If your question is a little broader kind of to the one we had earlier, I think I'll kind of reinforce Scott's position. I think we're feeling good about the business as a whole. I think we're feeling good about healthcare. And one of the things I think you probably noted in the way we described the growth, RQI, which is more transactional, has been strong but so is the payment accuracy side of the business which is a fundamental fraud fighting kind of expertise that we have and we felt good about that.","Final element or final component from the healthcare perspective, population management is the rage right now. Everyone's trying to find ways to better consume healthcare and probably get better outcomes for less cost. And that trend, that interest, I think will continue to spur our Enterprise Analytics business. So across the board, I think we look forward to 2015.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Maybe just to amplify a little bit on that point. There are a couple of sort of emerging customer sets in the healthcare world. One would be the accountable care organizations and integrated delivery networks and their ilk and the other would be the exchanges both public and private. And we feel very good about the territory we've been able to claim in both of those categories, which is a source of encouragement for us on where we're headed.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, terrific. And then I've been reading a lot about the increasing popularity of cat bond lite transactions. Can you just talk about how you expect that that trend may impact your business if at all? Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I appreciate the qualifier on your question because it's just important to bear in mind that cat bonds are one of many ways that catastrophe risk gets managed and transferred. And in fact, it's one of the lesser ways, so it's identifiable because there are discreet transactions and we do very well on the category. In 2014, we had about 80% of all those transactions, but I just encourage you to keep it in context.","Overall, it is a small part, a very small part, of the revenue associated with what we do in catastrophe modeling. So that said, cat bonds lite, you're still going to need a calculation agent that's going to stand as a third party to render a dispassionate and technically deep view of what's going on. And so if that was to expand that market overall a little bit, that would be great. We expect to still be highly competitive with respect to what's going on there.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Terrific. Great quarter. Thanks.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I want to talk a little bit about the Risk Assessment business, which accelerated in the fourth quarter. I remember third quarter commentary about some shift in annualizing or annualize contracts with reinsurance customers. It seems like somehow we've overcome that. So could you talk about how we accelerated in the fourth quarter, and given that 2015 invoices are out now, will the fourth quarter trajectory foray continue into 2015?","Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Andrew. Let me take that. This is Mark. First of all, I think we had a strong year from Risk Assessment. I think we have fundamentals in the businesses are as strong as ever and the position we have is strong as ever. A couple things to highlight if I think about the fourth quarter. First of all, some of our content is actually licensed through vendors, and that revenue is strong. It's been a component of a license and there's some royalties. So we saw some pickup there, so that's good news and hopefully that will continue into 2015.","And I think I've highlighted some other elements of Risk Assessment. We've talked about Risk Analyzer, which is our predicted modeling. We've moved from very much focused on personal auto but into homeowners as well as into the commercial line space and that has been up \u2013 the uptake there has been very strong and very good. We've had some good news around what is our electronic rating content. That's the way we take our loss cost and our rules and embed it deeply into our customers' workflows. And finally even Workers' Comp, which we haven't talked a lot about, had some good legs in the quarter and we think will continue. So those are the features of the fourth quarter, which I think will bode well into 2015.","And I think to answer the second part of your question, at this point you referenced about invoices; you're right there out. And I think we've done what we've consistently tried to do. We've tried to deliver value to our customers, reflect that in the invoices. At this point in time, though, you have to remember that more than 50% of the way we're contracted with customers, it really is about longer-term contracts now that they're committed to, they're multiple year. So it's not as much annual recalculations. And I think we're going to see a consistent growth reflecting the value we provide.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll just add those multi-year contracts Mark was referencing, they always increase year \u2013 they always carry year-over-year price escalators.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore. Your line is open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. You saw a very nice acceleration in organic revenue growth in the quarter to 11% from what had really been trend line organic growth in the high single digits over the last couple years or so. So my question really is, are the drivers of the higher growth rate more specific to the fourth quarter, or are you generally seeing an improving demand trend that might support more of a low double-digit-type organic growth rate going forward?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, of course, what we do is extremely broadly based; we're in multiple verticals, et cetera. So I don't think there's one answer really to your question. I would say that the demand factors across the vertical markets that we serve are, at least, as strong as they have been. So if you think of that as foundational, I would say at least as strong as they have been in the recent and intermediate past.","And as is always the case with our company, in 2014, including in the fourth quarter, we found ways based upon value to grow our business at a rate which was greater than that of our customers and the underlying markets and we believe that that dynamic will continue to apply in 2015. And we have definitely been doing a lot of investing into the business to try to create new solutions, to try to re-platform existing solutions. All of these things are pro-growth, and we are definitely focused on the organic growth of our business.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)","I appreciate that. Just as a quick follow-up, you saw a nice acceleration in growth in financial services in the quarter; I think Mark called out some project-specific work behind that. But are there other factors that might support a more sustained higher growth like what we saw in the fourth quarter?","Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So thanks for the question. I think what we've seen inside of the financial services category is really the fundamentals of the business where we've been able to actually take that product and extend it internationally has helped. And that's progress, and I think that's something that we'll continue to see in 2015.","The other thing that is a little bit more project work, I don't want to suggest that's a big, big number, but that is a typical kind of bit of a surge at year end where people and customers have some dollars to spend and they try to get their money's worth at year end. So I wouldn't necessarily annualize that base. But the underlying fundamentals internationally is very good. And the other thing that I will highlight is the world of marketing and advertising effectiveness, which is a way to go about helping advertisers understand how good and how effective their advertising is based upon the consumer and the spend is a very big category for us, and that continues to grow nicely and will have legs into 2015.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)","Understood. Thanks so much.","Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So earlier in the call, you had referenced growth in Medicare Advantage. I'm just trying to balance that with some forecasts that we've seen indicate that growth may inflect negative in the coming years. Just wondering how you think about the impact from that. Is there any risk to the healthcare category's growth, or is it safe to say that demand for the analytics within that space should easily offset that?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We don't see kind of what you're hypothesizing there. We don't actually see that. The long-term factor inside of Medicare Advantage is an aging population and a preference for the Medicare Advantage product. So I'm not quite sure whose projection you're referencing. First, the most recent look at growth in the enroll populations was actually very strong, high single-digits. So between that and our own work, to make what we do valuable for our customers, we feel good about the environment.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Yeah, it's the CMS Office of the Actuary that I believe has those forecasts a little bit further out showing that the growth there dips. But I guess moving onto my next question. I'm wondering if you can discuss the head count reductions in Decision Analytics during the fourth quarter. Can you tell us which category this was attributable to? Is there more room for efficiency there and, perhaps, how you think about your SG&A going forward in light of it being remarkably flat the past few years.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So first of all, just to make sure you're clear, the head count reduction was in Risk Assessment, not Decision Analytics. And basically it was, we took the opportunity on a, really, on a one-time basis to reset the talent inside of that business. As Mark said, we're trying to make the unit more analytic and more capable of the kind of high-value growth that we're looking for.","So it really was a moment in time readjustment, and this is inside of what is really the oldest part of Verisk ISO. And so we just made our assessment. Clearly, what we did has made us stronger and will continue to make us stronger into the future. So we feel very, very good about it. The transition was quite smooth and in line with what we expected. So, Mark, do you want to talk about SG&A at all?","Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, and I believe your question there was on a broader context, the SG&A category throughout the corporation. I think we have a constant goal to try to be continuously improving those operations, and inside the SG&A category, I think we've been pretty successful there.","Couple things that I'll highlight. We've done some data center consolidation. We continue to see benefits from that. I'm not sure that those benefits will increase as much into 2015. The other thing that helped us in 2014 was pension, and the pension assets performed extremely well. So there was good news in a reduction to the pension cost in 2014. As we roll into 2015, the mortality tables have changed, offsetting what was good news inside of the pension asset returns. So the pension will actually cost us more into 2015. I think those couple things are more or less offsetting. I would just see some gradual increase in SG&A maybe up a little from what you've seen in 2014.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman from SIG. Your line is open.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great way to end the year, guys. I had a couple of questions, so I guess I'll ask them upfront. So, Mark, you had mentioned project-related work in financial service. I think we've become more accustomed to seeing that in insurance DA. Anything to call out there? And then the other one is, Scott, relative to DART and Maplecroft, as we're trying to figure out the contribution for 2015, I realize you gave an organic for the fourth quarter. Did those deals close early or late in the quarter so we can try and annualize those? Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Why don't you take the first question, Mark, and I'll take the second.","Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So from a project-related work, the things that typically come to mind both in our cat modeling category and what we refer to as the loss quantification, which is Xactware, sometimes there's work that's done on behalf of a customer to more deeply integrate the models into their environments. Obviously, cat bonds is the other element. Although these are big, sometimes they do flux into fourth quarter. I don't think there was anything to call out in the fourth quarter inside the insurance category. It was probably a little bit more than other quarters, but nothing unusual.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And to your question, DART closed in November and Maplecroft closed in December.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning. Two questions, one on energy, one on healthcare. First on energy, I know you said you're going to be measured in your comments, but I know at that time you bought EagleView, you were pretty clear you thought they were a very strong competitor. Now they're going to remain a competitor. So I was just wondering how we should think about how you're thinking about competing, how aggressively you're willing to spend to become a leader, and whether we should characterize imagery as remaining at the top of your priority list that you're going to pursue aggressively or if that's kind of overstating its importance relative to the whole business?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Imagery is a high priority for us, and we believe that imagery will play a number of roles inside of Verisk. So the first order role is the existing product set, which is using images in the process of responding to property claims. The next most important use will be as it relates to a higher degree of automation in the underwriting process, where imagery will play a role in that.","And beyond that, we think that the interpretation of images, whether they're taken from 50 miles above the Earth or a couple thousand feet above the Earth or a couple hundred feet above the Earth from a drone, all of those need to be brought together into a kind of one unified way of dealing with imagery so that you get to the best solution at the lowest cost. EagleView plays at one of those levels today, primarily. We intend to play at all of those levels. That is part of what we think is important here. And the other part is that just like with most of what we do, there's also a very important requirement to distinguish based on analytics and the workflow by which the analyzed output gets into the customers' own process.","We intend to be doing all of those things in order to make it happen for our customers. And so we believe the category is important. We believe that we will bring a lot of strength to this, and as I said, the only part of it that might register as a question is where will the images come from? Again, just want to underline, we already have the images for the entire country and the objective for us is to get, yet, more precise images. And we feel very confident that we are able to do that and we are really sorting among the options for doing that right now.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And the second question was on RQI. I was just wondering if you could talk about your level of penetration of the client base and the updated thoughts on the size of the market. I know you've got an Analyst Day coming up, so you may be looking to save it for then. And specifically, I was interested in how many of the country's biggest clients that have the large data and analytics firms are currently clients?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we feel very good about the customer list. We have many of the name brand commercial carriers among customers for what it is that we do. Our sense is that we are a share leader in the business. It's also clear to us, however, that we don't work with everyone and we don't have all of the available business from those with whom we do work.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Bill.","William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So I've got a question for you about what impact, if any, you think the severe weather in the Northeast potentially has on some different parts of your business, it seems like, near term, potentially you have some benefit from Xactware and XactContents from a transaction piece there. But could it also be impacting cat modeling demand and possibly even premium growth for the coming years?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I think you answered your own question. I mean...","William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Does that make sense though?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, definitely. Those are the places where our business actually responds to events. Now that said, in the course of the year, there are lots of natural events, natural \u2013 and I'm trying not to say catastrophe. There's a lot of claims that are not related to catastrophes, and so the overall claims volume is going to be a function of not just one event, but a whole lot of events, some larger, some smaller, some that relate more to flooding, some that relate more to atmospherically driven events.","So I would encourage you not to get overly focused and think that there's some enormous surge based on any one event. But it is the case that when there are more property claims, there's more call upon the Xactware platform. We have, by the way, in that business, we've worked to have a balance between committed subscriptions and transaction-based revenues. And, in fact, the mix has shifted more towards the committed volume side so that dampens the effect somewhat.","Definitely it's the case that everybody gets more sensitized to the need for good modeling when there are large-scale events that go on and, yeah, rates generally tend to harden when there's more claims. So I think you did identify the cause-and-effect levers that are in there. Again, I would just say any one event or any one moment in the course of the year, don't overweigh it too much because there are a lot of different ways that there is damage to property and claims are being filed.","William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Excellent.

Your line is now open.","Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","I know you mentioned in the past that you continue to balance returns of capital versus M&A. Just wondering, can we expect returns of capital of a similar magnitude to the $500 million ASR in the future, or should this be viewed as a one-time in nature just given the EagleView?","Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's one-time. I mean, we had earmarked capital for a $650 million acquisition, which we were in pursuit of for about a year. And we felt that when it was clear that for the reasons I stated earlier, we weren't going to do the transaction, that the responsible thing to do where our shareholder were concerned was to return the capital to them. It doesn't infringe our opportunity to do M&A in the future. But at the same time, we felt that it was a responsible move at a particular moment in time but definitely in response to the one-time event of the EVT transaction.","Mark V.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's EVP of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen.","Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.","David E. Cohen - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, Ivy, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for discussion of our third quarter 2017 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.","Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC.","The earnings release contains reconciliations of several non-GAAP measures, which we will reference on today's call. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, David. Good morning, all. Reported revenue grew 10% for the quarter, organic constant currency growth was 7%. We're pleased to have delivered faster organic growth in the third quarter than we saw in the first half of the year as expected. We remain on track for an acceleration in the second half versus the first half. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins of almost 50%.","We're excited about the addressable markets we serve, our initiatives to create new solutions, and the opportunities to help our customers with decision-making. Combined insurance organic growth was 9% and excluding the demand due to extreme weather was about 7%. The team continues to do an outstanding job serving our customers and driving growth. Mark will talk about some of the extraordinary effort by our teams to support our customers in responding to the recent hurricanes.","At WoodMac, revenue growth continues to improve as the end market has stabilized. The team there is also doing an excellent job, evidenced in part by the 5% plus growth in subscription ACV year-to-date. WoodMac is expanding their addressable markets and we will demo some of their newer products at our upcoming Investor Day.","We're very pleased to report a new Argus partnership with TSYS as announced by their CEO on their recent investor call. This partnership will allow us to bring a new range of data management and analytical solutions to new banks and markets that are incremental to our core base. This initiative, as well as other positive developments at Argus, position it to return to solid organic growth in Q4 as expected and continue to contribute good and accelerating organic growth in 2018.","On the capital allocation front, we have been active in M&A throughout 2017 and especially in the third quarter. Many of the acquisitions are companies we have been tracking for years, and the timing is mostly a function of the availability of the targets. While the timing has been brisk, the integrations have been smooth and quick, given the nature of our purchases.","Our acquisitions in 2017 fall into three groups. The first group consists of small product sets with promising characteristics that fall into our existing verticals. The names here are Arium, ENI, Healix, Fintellix and MAKE. Collectively we paid $94 million for these product sets with run rate revenue at the time of the acquisitions of around $23 million.","Arium provides liability loss modeling that runs parallel to AIR's property loss modeling. ENI helps insurers determine damage amounts to automobiles for quick claim settlements and Helix is the leading provider of travel insurance analytics in Europe. Fintellix is a global leader in compliance solutions for banks and seamlessly relates to our transaction-level data integration at Argus, while bringing new functionality to our client banks and MAKE is the global leader in wind generation analytics, integrating seamlessly with our solar generation analytics.","In all cases, we have quickly brought these products into our existing channels of distribution with the expectation that all of these product sets will grow at double-digits for an extended time and with ramping margins. When we add such products to our platform they immediately gain profile and credibility in the market.","The second group was our acquisition of seven regional remote imaging companies in the United States. We paid $31 million for these companies whose 2016 revenues were $15 million as we noted last quarter. Integration of these companies has been smooth and straightforward, led by our Geomni team which includes experts who have operated image capture operations for decades. Their expertise brought real value to customers in the latest storm season.","Lastly, we bought three larger companies in the third quarter, all leaders in their categories. We purchased Sequel, which provides solutions related to complex commercial insurance with a particular focus on the Lloyd's London market as well as LCI and G2 Web Services, both of which provide distinct solutions for the retail banking world and both of which leverage Argus' distribution as well as enhancing products through overlapping capabilities. Collectively we paid $583 million for these businesses, whose run rate revenue at the time of the acquisitions was about $78 million.","Mark will say more about them in a moment but in all three cases we expect them to bring strong double-digit growth with ramping margins. We will provide further detail on these businesses including their solutions, markets, and economics at our upcoming Investor Day in December.","While M&A remains our priority for use of free cash, we also repurchased our shares in the quarter through our longstanding program. Year-to-date through September 30, we have repurchased $270 million worth of stock including $10 million in the third quarter.","At September 30, 2017, we had $366 million remaining under our share purchase reauthorization (sic) [share repurchase authorization] (06:49). Our strong cash generating capability will bring down our leverage even assuming further capital deployment.","We remain confident in the strategy built on the Verisk distinctives of one, unique data assets, two, deep domain expertise, three, first to market innovations and four, deep integration into our customer workflows. As you know, with the distinctives come network effects, scale economies and a large percentage of subscription revenue. From this foundation we are focused on executing on our plans which include ongoing innovation and serving our customers. As we look ahead we have a constructive view for all of our businesses.","And with that I'll turn it over to Mark for some additional comments.","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, Scott. Following up on Scott's comments regarding the three August acquisitions, Sequel is a leading insurance and reinsurance software specialist serving the London market. The acquisition further expands our comprehensive insurance offerings to the global complex commercial and specialty insurance industry with worldwide premiums larger than the U.S. regulated market we primarily serve today. Sequel is a pioneer in complex commercial and specialty insurance software innovation with a diverse customer base that includes some of the world's largest specialty insurance players.","LCI is an industry-leading provider of risk insight, prediction and bankruptcy management solutions for banks and creditors. We're also confident that the LCI solutions are applicable beyond the banks to other companies that need to monitor consumer bankruptcy processes. The combination of Argus and LCI will allow us to introduce new and exciting range of insights, proprietary decisioning algorithms, and state-of-the-art risk management work flow solution aimed at addressing a growing need among our banking clients.","G2 is an industry-leading provider of merchant risk intelligence solutions for acquirers, commercial banks and other payment system providers. G2 extends Argus' capabilities to mapping bad-actor networks, predicting payment risks and providing clients with the best opportunity to reduce losses and fines due to merchant and business fraud and compliance violations. Fighting fraud is an important theme for Verisk as you know, and G2 complements our existing capabilities nicely.","Growth in insurance continued to improve, primarily on the strength of our solutions in customer relationships with some help from the weather. Engagement with our customers is a strong and ongoing focus across our insurance-facing businesses. Last month, for example, we had our now annual U.S. Risk and Analytics Summit. We saw record attendance in terms of companies represented and number of attendees. We also had demonstrations of some of our newer and cutting edge solutions. Feedback was very encouraging with attendees citing engaging and well-informed speakers, the examples of benefits from forward-looking companies and thought provoking panels.","As you know, after an unusually long period of relative calm we have seen a surge in catastrophes over the past few months. Our property claims services or PCS business is the industry standard for catastrophe event designation and insured loss estimation in the U.S., Canada and Turkey. In one of the most active periods on record, PCS has designated 50 events so far across three risk areas with insured loss estimates still developing but likely to exceed $70 billion.","In addition to the major hurricanes in the United States, PCS provided insured loss estimates on two cyber risk loss events following the launch of PCS Global Cyber in September. Cyber is the latest addition to the growing PCS Global specialty lines loss reporting platform following the PCS Global Marine and Energy launch earlier this year.","Our catastrophe modeling business which serves insurers, reinsurers and insurance brokers has proactively provided more than 30 loss estimates since September 1 and real-time alerts for customers on 13 catastrophes happening around the world. With particular note to the hurricanes, AIR clients use the information we provided to assess the potential losses as the events were unfolding and in some cases to proactively deploy claims adjusters or to notify policy holders.","As a reminder, since the customers subscribe to AIR solutions there isn't a real-time revenue benefit. Client feedback has been positive as our teams have worked in some cases around the clock to give these reports to the market on a timely basis. We continue to speak with clients on their actual loss experience and plan to continue these dialogues over the coming months as the claims unfold.","In our repair cost estimating imagery business, volumes increased meaningfully as a result of catastrophes. At Xactware, volumes were nearly double for the quarter versus the prior-year period. As a reminder, many of our contracts are based on minimum volumes, so this volume increase isn't a direct proxy for revenue growth, it does highlight deep more full (11:50) integration and the value we provide to our customers.","One of our newer solutions, Claim Experience, proved to be a very helpful tool for our customers as they served their insurance. Claim Experience allows our customers' customers to capture images and information from which we are able to generate repair cost estimates. As the industry focus on customer service and response times, this new solution is generating a lot of incremental interest.","Geomni, our remote imagery business, which we took to a new level of capability in the second quarter, was able to assist our customers with our cutting edge technology. We were flying and capturing images 48 hours after Harvey in Texas and as soon as the FAA lifted flight restrictions in Florida. These images, in combination with our computer vision algorithms, automate the repair cost estimate processing, allowing, for example, one of the largest insurers in the United States to start paying out claims before their customers could even get back into their homes. We are proud of having been able to help our customers deliver such outstanding service and speed of response at such a critical time for homeowners.","With that, let me turn it over to Eva, to cover our financial results in more detail.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, Mark. In the third quarter we again grew revenue and EBITDA while also investing in solutions with meaningful long-term potential revenue streams. Growth improved again, consistent with our comments on the last two earnings calls.","Revenue in the quarter grew 10.2%; organic constant currency revenue grew 7%. The press release again has a table to help you see the acquisition and currency effect for each of our revenue lines.","As a reminder, organic constant currency growth excludes the contribution from recent acquisitions and reflects current period exchange rates applied to prior period revenue. Currency helped revenue results in the quarter by about $2 million. And total acquired revenue in the quarter from all deals that haven't moved into organic was $19 million, including partial period contributions from G2, Sequel and LCI. Revenue from the three August acquisitions contributed $7.6 million in the quarter.","Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue increased 12.2%. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 8.2%. Decision Analytics insurance revenue increased 16.9% in the third quarter and organic constant currency revenue growth was 13.7%. Growth was led by very strong performance in loss quantification and remote imagery with good growth in underwriting, catastrophe modeling solutions and claims analytics. The hurricane- related repair cost estimating and imagery-based solution contributed about $8 million in the quarter for Decision Analytics insurance.","Energy and specialized markets revenue increased 2.1%. Organic constant currency revenue increased 2.2%. On an organic constant currency basis, Wood Mackenzie revenue grew about 3.3%. We are pleased to see the trends in our subscription business continuing to be positive, complemented by good consulting revenue. The customer environment remains stable and while we continue to finalize certain renewals in 2017 and early 2018, we see an encouraging business trajectory.","Financial Services revenue increased 20.2%. Organic constant currency revenue declined 2% in the quarter. As we've discussed on prior calls, we had several contracts conclude last year which contributed about $11 million in 2016. We continue to expect to see organic revenue growth in fourth quarter.","Risk Assessment revenue grew 6.9% including contributions from our recent acquisitions which are expanding the baseline for future growth. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 4.9%, reflecting our 2017 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions.","Total EBITDA increased 7.5% to $272 million. The combined cost of revenue and SG&A increased 4.9% for the quarter and 3.5% year-to-date on an organic basis as we continue to focus on efficiency in our existing businesses and re-purposing that spend to fund innovation. Acquisitions added to the expenses in the quarter and for the year.","EBITDA margins as reported were 49.6%. Margins were reduced by about 230 basis points due to acquisitions and the related fees, an effect that we expect to continue through the year. The acquisitions we are making are close to the core with well-defined paths to top line growth and margin expansion.","Reported interest expense was $30 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.9 billion at September 30, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the third quarter was about 2.9 times. Our strong capital structure is an asset as we continue to explore opportunities to drive growth.","Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.2%. Our tax provision in the quarter of $60 million represented an increase of 34% over 3Q 2016 where the tax rate included some one-time benefits. This was a meaningful reason for the adjusted net income growth to be down 2.3% to $141 million and adjusted EPS to be unchanged from the prior period at $0.84. Normalizing for the $2.4 million of tax, based on applying the third quarter 2017 tax rate to 2016, adjusted EPS growth would have been about 9%.","Average diluted share count was 168 million in the quarter. We bought about 100,000 shares at an average price of $81.85. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. On September 30, 2017, our diluted share count was 167.8 million shares.","Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $592 million for the nine months ended September 30, an increase of 22.2% versus 2016. Capital expenditures were $114 million for the nine-month period ended September 30 and CapEx was 7.2% of revenue year-to-date including investments supporting our remote imagery business. Free cash flow increased 27.5% to $478 million for the nine month period ended September. Free cash flow was 61.9% of EBITDA year-to-date.","Across the three August acquisitions, in U.S. dollars and reflecting purchase accounting revenue haircut at Sequel, revenue in the fourth quarter should be around $17 million and EBITDA should be about $5 million. As you think about your models for 2017, we expect CapEx of about $185 million. CapEx will normalize to about 6% of revenue by 2021 after the initial remote imagery investments in 2017 and 2018, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of $135 million and amortization of intangibles of about $105 million.","Based on our current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to be around $119 million for the year. This includes non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. We expect the full-year tax rate to be around 33% or possibly a little bit higher. You will note that this implies a higher tax rate in the fourth quarter as we assume a retroactive UK tax law change will take effect.","In the adjusted net income calculation we will continue to use 26% for the tax effect on intangible amortization. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 168 million to 169 million shares.","We're pleased with the continuing overall improvement in revenue growth we have discussed all year. We think the opportunities for revenue growth, free cash flow generation, and prudent capital deployment remain as strong as ever. We have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long-term.","We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. First, just wanted to ask on the insurance vertical, excluding the hurricanes, the 7% growth. Is that \u2013 can you talk about what I guess, drove the acceleration in that underlying growth versus kind of 5%, 6% we had been seeing? And is that sustainable? I know you also mentioned some cyber events, I don't know if that drove kind of short-term revenue, but just talk a little bit about the sustainability of that pace of growth in insurance.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes, so in reverse order, Tim, cyber didn't really contribute a lot. Think of it as a new extension of a product set that we've always had. Cyber insurance is a real thing. On the other hand, it's a fairly small line relative to the others. And most of what we do, pricing \u2013 or our revenue is going to relate to the premiums, and the premium in cyber insurance remains fairly small.","I think the way to interpret the third quarter relative to, say, the earlier part of the year is the anomaly was more the early part of the year, where you'll remember we described some one-time effects with respect to nonrecurring revenue in 2016 that didn't recur in 2017, for example.","So I think what you're seeing now is more kind of our normal expectation for the insurance vertical. And other than the effects of the catastrophes, there's really not anything to point at that would sort of stand out as a unique factor in the quarter that was contributing to the revenue, so we kind of feel like what we're seeing here is over time the kind of insurance-facing business that we've got.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And on the catastrophes, does any of that carry over into the fourth quarter in terms of impact on claims and kind of a short-term boost?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah, not a lot. Basically, as you would imagine, our customers are very motivated to deal with catastrophe-oriented claims very quickly and so they do actually tend to get dealt with within days of when the events actually occur, so no, not very much of that.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. On Argus, can you just help us understand, obviously there's a big improvement in the trend there in the second half. As these new customers come online or the new partnerships come online, is there a meaningful one-time revenue contribution to the second half or is this more an increase in the subscription base?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","It's both. So I think we've described for you before, that there's an interesting quality to the nature of the business related to taking all of the spend analytics we've got and pointing them towards new use cases, for example, looking at media effectiveness. And that is that there is a one-time bit of work that needs to be done to essentially integrate our platform with our customer or partner's platform and there is revenue associated with that integration. We get paid for that, but then what happens thereafter is a sustaining set of subscription revenues. So it's really at both ends.","So yes, there will be moment in time effects associated with bringing on a substantial new customer and many of the customers we bring on are substantial, but at the same time, there is an enduring and meaningful tail of subscription revenue.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","But I guess the question I'm trying to get at is, is the on boarding revenue going to create grow-over effects for 2018 that result in Argus growing below trend or is \u2013 I mean, you're not quantifying it or calling it out on the call. Is it there but not material enough to have a big impact?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","It's not \u2013 I mean, it is there and it's a dynamic business where we are adding customers, so there will be an effect in there, but relative to the overall performance of the business I would say not particularly material. And definitely, we need the business to continue to grow but there will be something in there but not...","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then if I could just sneak one more in. On the M&A program, obviously you continue to lean into it and see it as a source of potential value add for your shareholders. I think there's some more skepticism from some of your shareholders on the M&A program. Can you just maybe talk about how the board assesses capital allocation in terms of their review of management and your compensation programs? Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. I think you actually asked two questions in there, so we bring the program of acquisitions to the board. We go in depth through every opportunity. The effect of the board discussions is not always to affirm what it is that management has been working on, so the board is exercising discretion. With respect to, I think you were then trying to relate that to how the board interacts with us, maybe particularly me, and compensation, and the board pays me according to their view of our performance and their primary view of our performance is how do we do for our shareholders?","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify, Scott, to the first question I think that it was the $8 million hurricane impact that you were referring to that does not repeat beyond the quarter and I was hoping of that $8 million, I guess how much would you attribute to the remote imagery aspect of it and just curious why that wasn't an inorganic number just because I understand that it was all the assets that you acquired that allowed you to go do that post hurricane activity?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. So, first of all, yes. You heard me correctly. The $8 million is not particularly bleeding into the fourth quarter, so period, end of sentence. Most of that $8 million is related to solution sets that we've had for some time and not the remote imagery activity, and it's very straightforward on the classification of the revenues. The businesses that we acquired did not do anything in the insurance vertical. We acquired infrastructure. But in terms of actually causing business in the insurance vertical, that was entirely Verisk and existing Verisk.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And then just on WoodMac, I mean, it sounded like there was some positive developments, new products you're going to show at the Investor Day and so forth, I guess, my question is more tied to two-and-a-half years in, I was hoping you'd give us some commentary on how the sort of revenue synergies between WoodMac and insurance and so forth might be tracking?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. One of the things that you'll see at Investor Day is a synthesis of our energy data analytics and our insurance data analytics, a very exciting new product. It's really kind of in the early stages, so it's not material, where the revenue is concerned right now, but we are really, really excited about it. It's called EPICS (28:46), and you'll get a chance to see that.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just on pricing. Could you give us a sense or just an update on whether there's an opportunity to price your book of business? I know you were owned by the insurance companies and it seems like pricing is still pretty low relative to your market share and maybe just give us some color how you think about that.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. Well, the pricing for us is really a proxy for the distinctiveness of our solutions and the amount of value that we're bringing to our customers. Across everything that we do, there would be a pricing effect which relates to the strength of what it is that we do. There are some parts of our business where the pricing effect is a little bit stronger; for example, our very long-standing industry standard insurance programs. And then, other parts where it would probably be a little bit less strong, because we're more on a transaction basis in our pricing.","But there is a price effect everywhere, and that's really no different than it's ever been. I would only \u2013 with respect to price, I would just add that we're in it for the long haul. We are making grounded decisions about how to price our solutions, because we really care about our relationships with our customers and we want them to endure and a lot of our growth opportunity is to bring new solutions, new value to our existing customers. So we feel a great burden to be responsible with how we price our products.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And just a follow-up question. Outside of the P&C insurance universe, maybe just give us a flavor of what your exposure is to auto and personal insurance and whether you see any headwinds in that business, either from autonomous homes or vehicles. Just any sense of how you think about the world outside of P&C and whether that's a growth avenue for you or not really. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Well, as I think most folks know, we principally serve three vertical markets, which would be P&C insurance, retail banking and its extensions, including into retail and media effectiveness analytics, and then the whole energy complex and natural resources. And the other two parts of the business, meaning the non-P&C parts, we're very excited about them going forward. We believe both of them have sustained very strong revenue growth opportunities.","I think you were trying to ask also about the effect of kind of like personal lines and the way that automobiles are changing and with autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles, et cetera. We actually see that as an opportunity. We actually, we believe, are the leaders in the United States in harvesting data off of connected cars. We've announced partnerships and we'll have more to announce in the future. And so it's new data basically that we can pull into our analytic methods, so we view it as an opportunity.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani from KBW. Your line is open.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to know if you could provide some more detail on the aerial imagery opportunities outside of insurance. I know you mentioned insurance was a $200 million addressable market and perhaps how large the addressable market is outside the insurance sector?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes, the TAM for all of the applications outside of the insurance vertical are about an order of magnitude bigger than the insurance vertical. So we talk about the insurance vertical as something, (32:58) that's sort of our home base, that's where we started from but actually, extensions into other vertical markets are going to be important to us (33:11). There is a lot of background noise. Maybe somebody's phone is unmuted (33:15).","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","The second question (33:20) I had was, could you just provide a bit more detail about what Sequel does and does that get rolled up into Decision Analytics?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes, hi. This is Mark. Let me just provide you a little bit of insight. One, the suite of solutions that Sequel provides is really behind the scenes of all of the major carriers in London, so a little bit of a nuanced market in London and they have a captured march (33:47) there to do everything from what would be the analytics upfront from an underwriting perspective, to policy admin (33:54), to claims, even inside the reinsurance world and they have a wonderful tool that provides visual representation and a good VI to versus (34:07). So there's an analytic aspect as well (34:08). What we are going to do is we're going to invest in the VA (34:11) insurance side of things, and we think there's great opportunities to use some of those solutions to bring to maybe some of our U.S. customers on the analytic back end, which would be that visual geographic approach to things as well as the front end which is the underwriting. We also hope we can kind of supercharge some of their analytics insights inside the (34:36) solution set. So we're very excited by it. Customers are very pleased and we've gotten some very good feedback from the market in general. So we're optimistic about what we can do with Sequel.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Yes. Your next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Could you comment a bit on Argus' new contract with TSYS? This looks very intriguing and in particular, I'm wondering if there's any exclusivity here that might preclude you from working with other large card issuer processors like a First Data, a Fiserv, an FIS?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","No exclusivity, and in fact one of the reasons why folks like TSYS like to partner with us is because of the richness and depth of our ecosystem which creates a data asset that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world and actually, as the next partner comes in, the ecosystem gets better, so the network effect is there and the last one to come in knows that and the next one to come in knows that. So no, there's no exclusivity and it basically is a way of extending \u2013 first of all as I say, it improves the data asset but in addition to that, it actually creates yet more reach into specific banks that would be a part of TSYS's ecosystem. We're very pleased by the partnership, very excited about it.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","And just as a quick follow-up, is there any way to dimension the size of this contract with TSYS and potentially the size of this new market opportunity for Argus?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Well, we don't really put out the numbers around individual customer relationships. If you wanted to sort of do some work on that, you could sort of figure out what is TSYS's share of the processing world and try to relate that to the size of the business we are already.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Thanks. Just wanted to add another question on the Sequel purchase. My sense of your foray into the UK is that you bought a bunch of interesting but yet somewhat disparate assets in the past and haven't really completely integrated it all. I wonder, given the relationships there, is this an opportunity to go to market with a more consolidated or integrated approach and solution?","And then as part of that, what's the opportunity to take analytics and things you offer here, layer that in, and drive a more meaningful revenue base from the existing customers that that business has? Or is that not really an opportunity for some reason? Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Well, let me start with your last question, then Mark, maybe you'd like to talk a little bit more about Sequel. I just want to interact with the premise of your question, which is the smaller acquisitions earlier in 2017 not being integrated, that's just not accurate. So just to set the record straight on that.","But yeah, with respect to how we see the business growing globally, you can create your data analytics method pretty much anywhere. What you need to do is to make it relevant for the local market, first, by having local data sets, and second, doing whatever customization you have to do to speak into that market in exactly the way that it wants to be spoken to. So that is our view of how to grow our business, and yes, there are things that we do at Verisk today that will complement Sequel nicely.","I'll mention, for example, our Touchstone platform on the catastrophe modeling side, and then you've got these accumulation tools on the Sequel side, and they really play together very nicely. So that work is already underway. But, Mark, do you want to kind of pick it up from there?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah, I think the other thing I'd like to highlight is there are some acquisitions, but I think this program of looking to go global is a combination of build and buy. We've been spending a lot of time and energy putting a management team in place, putting business development\/sales resources that cover the world, and specifically in kind of the UK, we've done quite a bit of work with Lloyd's, we've done a lot of work with a lot of syndicates. We are building up some actual expertise.","So we are trying to take a lot of the things we do here in the United States maybe around property, around actuarial (39:25) work, bring it to the UK. And maybe an example of this is one of the earlier acquisitions was in Ireland. It provided some underwriting information. Today, we have significantly grown and brought that to market a fuller-blown, I'll call it ISO-type of loss costs beyond just traditional rating variables.","So we've kind of put the Verisk way into Ireland. We're trying to move that type of thinking, that type of approach, augmenting acquisitions along the way to build a platform that's substantial in the UK and beyond into Europe. So that's clearly our strategy, and I think you'll see more of that as we progress in the coming years.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then the follow-up, there were a series of articles after the hurricanes about insurers using their own drones to go take pictures and assess damage and reduce the dependence on people in the adjuster role. I guess is that just a good story that was easy to tell coming out of that, or is there some potential risk to, whether it's your aerial imagery or some of the other solutions from insurers beginning to do some of this stuff a bit more on their own? Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah, so the way that the imagery ecosystem works is first of all, you need to avail yourself as an insurer or an independent adjuster or an insured, of the ability to understand the asset and how it's changed. So one of the things that matters is your understanding of the asset before the event, before the damage, and so one of the things that is necessary is sort of a view of truth, which is what is there before the damage occurs? And that has to be developed both precisely in terms of the quality of the images, but also efficiently for cost reasons.","You cannot do that with a drone. And actually, you can't do that with a satellite either. What you need is aerial imagery. That is the way to create the single view of truth in terms of what is on the ground. And that we do not see changing. So that is fundamental and foundational.","What you do hear from some of the carriers is that in the wake of an event, if an adjuster can get to the building, because remember, the radius in which you can fly a drone is very limited, then one of the ways that you can assess the property in addition to visually inspecting it as a human being, is to operate a drone. And some of the companies have begun to do that. So they literally would have some of their adjusters driving around with a small drone in their trunk.","It's really kind of a technical augmentation of what an adjuster has always done, which is to try to get close to the property and understand what happened to it. It really does not represent very much change. The adjusters may find that using the drone, they can do their work a little bit faster, they can maybe be a little bit more precise, they can drive better images and we're all for it actually. We are able to provide a turnkey drone solution to our customers as well and actually, one where the homeowner is actually sort of operating \u2013 if they have access to a drone, they can actually direct and capture the images and get those back to us. So that development is a good one. It's not an overwhelming one. It hasn't really changed the nature of the claims process, maybe into the future it will have somewhat more effect, but the fundamental point is if you're going to do these analytics at scale, you're not going to do them with drones.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. That's helpful.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Morning, Bill.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Morning.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So a question for you on the EBITDA margins. The guidance had been that the second half margins were going to be flat with Q2 and Q3 had come in 100 basis points ahead of that. I understand we've had the extreme weather benefit. I just wanted to ask how we should think about margins heading into Q4 and into 2018.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Bill. Well, I think you hit the nail on the head when you talked about the margin in the quarter and certainly one of the benefits of our business model is we have nice incremental margins and certainly, we saw some of that in terms of the storm benefit.","We also had the impact on our margins that we've discussed which is around the acquisitions. So those will be a little bit of a pulldown on the margins as we think about sort of the fourth quarter. We have brought in the new acquisitions. We gave you some very specific numbers around how much those will contribute in the fourth quarter, that's sort of call it roughly a 30% margin based on what we've said. Those margins will scale over time, but I think as you kind of put that all together, I would say that we did have an outperformance versus expectation in margins in the third quarter because of some of the storm benefit. So I would \u2013 as you think about your model for the fourth quarter, I would put those other factors back in and certainly we look to drive margins, but there will be probably more of a pulldown, than a pullup in fourth quarter.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And a quick follow up if I may. A housekeeping question on the revenue impact from the extreme weather. You mentioned the $8 million and having it giving a couple point benefit to the insurance piece. I just want to make sure my math is right. If the constant currency organic for the third quarter was 7.0%, it looked like 160 basis points coming from that, the extreme weather benefit, so that would mean about 5.4% versus the 4.1% in Q2. Is that about right?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You are spot on, Bill.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. And then the context there is should we think that \u2013 should we expect Q4 to be \u2013 the organic growth to be higher versus that 5.4% normalized level?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. So as you know, Bill, we don't get into specific quarterly guidance throughout the year, we do express (46:16) in terms of our growth rates and I think you've seen that so far.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Well excellent. Thank you very much.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you, Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I wanted to jump back into aerial imaging revenues in the organic for DA insurance. If it wasn't for the hurricane effect, would aerial imaging be moving the revenue needle in the third quarter and then because I thought it's still kind of nascent business? And then the second part of my question is you indicated aerial imaging acquisitions added $15 million of revenues. Could you give us a sense of how big your Geomni revenues in total are right now including your prior internally-built base?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I think both those questions are aimed at the same point, Andrew, and I'll just say that the Geomni business in the insurance vertical is growing and would have grown even absent the effect of the extreme weather, and growing very, very nicely. So there was a boost in the quarter as I said before of that $8 million, most of it was not attributable to Geomni, but pre-existing Verisk solutions. So Geomni is growing nicely. It's sort of getting to a scale where we can almost begin to not call it nascent anymore, even though we're still early in the journey. But it is growing, and would have grown, and would have grown nicely in the third quarter even absent the extreme weather effect.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You're welcome.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe this actually relates to the prior question, and I've asked this before, but when I look at your Q and the disclosures there about subscription and non-subscription, in Decision Analytics it continues to stand out that the non-subscription line is growing really rapidly. I think it was like 38% year over year if I back into that right or $27 million. So I guess the question is one, what is driving that non-subscription growth? Is it all aerial imagery for example? And then secondly, can you give an organic subscription number for the quarter in Decision Analytics? Because that continues to look a little bit anemic.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. So the reason that the growth shows that we're \u2013 or let me make a more general point as we sort of get into this topic, which is that customers often have a preference for how they buy solutions, particularly new solutions, which is that they prefer to get into it in a transaction mode rather than in a subscription mode, because they don't exactly know how much of it they're going to need. And we're happy to do business that way as we're moving into a category which is either new for them or it's at least new for us with respect to serving them. So we don't consider transaction-based revenues to be low quality revenues, because they very frequently mature, they ripen into subscription agreements. So for example, in the Geomni world \u2013 and I'm just taking that as an example, today we're transaction-priced.","One of the plans that we have worked on at length has been as our offerings begin to mature, one of the ways that we can offer them to customers would be in more of a subscription mode, where you would essentially sort of be kind of buying the aerial imagery platform I guess is the way I would say it, without respect to any individual property that you want to look at. So that would be an example of there would be a progressive movement of what today is booked as transaction revenue into what tomorrow or down the road would be booked as subscription revenue. And that's kind of a normal effect inside of a data analytics business. It's very common for the customers to want to start out in a transaction mode.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah, and, Alex, I was just going to add to that. I think, when you look at the growth rates, certainly the transactional growth rates were higher than the subscription growth rates in the third quarter and actually, in the second quarter as well. But if you actually look at the progression in that growth, you would see the subscription \u2013 the relativity subscription growth has accelerated quite a bit as well as has transactional.","And remember, because we are 80% subscription, the dollars associated with that acceleration of subscription growth are really what's meaningfully driving the growth. I don't have the organic numbers in front of me, but I would say that generally some of the businesses that we're bringing in are a lot more transactional in terms of that. So I think if you were to parse that out of your transactional growth rate but down to organic, I think you would see a bit more balance. Although nonetheless, we have storm activity and so transactions, as Scott said, is good revenue. So we'll take that.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","That's very helpful color. Thank you very much. Just secondly real quick, you mentioned the hurricane or weather impact will bleed into the fourth quarter, which is good, but how should I be thinking about this more longer term? Because this was, I think, a more extreme event than we've seen in years. Like where could there be incremental demand longer term? For example, maybe you will see some premium acceleration in some parts of the business, should that drive more, or better end market? Will you see more subscription on aerial? Or maybe some models that change and people have to purchase. What's the longer-term discussions with customers potentially coming out of this, kind of like very extreme time?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","There are three things to keep in your mind. I'll touch on the first two and Mark will pick up on the third. First of all, we said that the third quarter extreme events don't bleed into the fourth quarter with respect to revenue, so just hopefully everybody heard that and heard that clearly. The second thing to just sort of know about our business and obviously, we're talking here about insurance. We are very excited about where we're going in financial services and in the energy complex and I just want to continue to put that out there.","But in the insurance space, the anomaly has been the amount of time that has passed since the last major event, so you can basically go back and say you have Sandy in 2011 and then you had Katrina and the unusual thing is sort of the spacing in there, actually. So when you think about Verisk, one of the things that you should think about is that part of what we do for our customers is provide a whole suite of solutions which help them to be hardened against major events.","Major events happen. They happen not every year. We've actually been in an extended period where they didn't really happen with any frequency but that's the anomaly and so it is a part of our business. It won't show up every year. We'll see what the pattern is \u2013 and by the way, extreme event does not necessarily mean a hurricane, so there's also a sensitivity to for example, things like major flooding events in the United States, but they may not be atmospherically driven in the same way that a hurricane is, so you've got all that. But now having said those two things, I think what we also want you to just understand is sort of the very balanced way in which our insurance-facing business is growing. It's related to a lot of things, claims and new software platforms and so Mark if you want to just talk about that a little bit?","Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Just, I think to your question a couple things that typically help us a little bit in the future (54:36) is an event like these our insurer and reinsurer customers take some additional thoughts around how and what they're going to do with regard to cat modeling, so there could be opportunities for AIR down the road, to the extent that someone (54:50) wants a second model and maybe a more comprehensive suite of solutions whether it's across different perils, or different geographies, that's an opportunity.","What we've also talked about sometimes with catastrophes is that it does help pricing in the industry. From a primary perspective I don't think we're going to see a big upsurge in pricing. From a rate perspective reinsurance, it should bolster maybe reinsurance a little bit. That helps our customers' customers who are growing have more of an appetite to buy things. So that's maybe just another tertiary benefit to us, but just wanted to share those other observations. I think that's what maybe you were searching for as well.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Thanks for taking our questions. We just thought with some of the production capacity going offline for a little bit from the storms, could you see that having any impact to energy CapEx spending at all in 2018 and if that would have any effect on the business?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","No. No, the nature of the business in the south central United States is a very engineering-intense way of extracting hydrocarbons from the ground and basically in the unconventional space for example, you can get your well established within three to five days, so it's a blip.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Got it. And with all the acquisitions, the leverage ratio going up a little bit. Do you have a ceiling with how high you would go with the leverage ratio to complete the more necessary acquisitions?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So yes, so we have stated curbs and Eva maybe you just want to describe those?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes, I mean we've talked about our reference point being 2.5 times debt to EBITDA but we'll go above that for the opportunities. We've done that in the past. The way we really think about it is we don't really \u2013 we have covenants, those aren't really a constraint for us. So for us, the measure is really how long does it take us to de-lever and I think if you look at our business, especially in Q1, we generate a lot of free cash flow. So I would expect that that ratio would come down relatively quickly absent spending that cash on any other opportunities. So we feel very comfortable we've got a lot of flexibility.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","All right. Thanks, guys.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is open.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning. It's Henry Chien on for Jeff. I just had a follow-up on the aerial imagery product, or products, I should say. In terms of the time line of the rollout to customers, I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of that, and when we can see at least a meaningful impact on growth in the insurance segment or business line.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","It's in the market now and impacting our growth rate now.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And in terms of the acquisition multiples, could you give us a sense on what those levels are for the aerial imagery acquisitions?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I don't think we really \u2013 the aerial imagery acquisitions? I mean, I think, Eva, remind me, but I think we actually talked about 2-ish million dollars of acquired EBITDA at the time that we bought the seven smallish regional imaging companies.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And in terms of the multiples? How have they trended so far?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","So we paid $30 million...","Eva F.

Hey, just post the Equifax breach, are you seeing any step-up in demand around kind of authorization and kind of pre-approval as it relates to Argus?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Authorization and pre-approval of Argus. I'm not quite sure what you're asking.","Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Scott, in terms of trying to manage fraud, fraud detection early, kind of in a pre-approval process or at the point of authorization, are you seeing any potential step-up in demand from clients?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Well, the demand factors for Argus are very good, but that's not \u2013 if I'm understanding your question, that's not really what Argus does.","Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right, but is \u2013 I guess, so let me ask, is that a potential area that you could potentially get into?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","You mean to help companies \u2013 help banks, for example, with their cybersecurity?","Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","That is potentially something that we could do at Verisk. That is not something that we do today. We do work on cyber insurance, so we help insurers think about how to manage their insurance products, but actually hardening companies, including banks, against cyber-attack is not something that we do today, though potentially something that we could consider doing in the future.","Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in, and appreciate all the color on the natural disasters and other events and so forth. My question is a little more granular on the acquisition strategy, particularly when I look at G2 and Lundquist (01:00:42). I think a little bit about what the bureaus are doing for banks and perhaps TransUnion in particular, and I just wonder if you can comment on whether or not you think your business is sort of moving into adjacencies to what has been a traditional bureau offering, or how you think about differentiating your financial services offerings generally.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes, I think that \u2013 let me take it in reverse order. So Argus is a beautiful business that is founded on a data set that is utterly unique. And the data set is unique because of the granularity of the data that is being contributed by a wide \u2013 a large, wide and growing number of companies that participate in this consortium where they're contributing data. We do our analysis and decision support and provide it back to them.","And so that whole ecosystem is growing and strengthening, and that is the fundamental foundation of the growth of Argus. And we are finding our ways into new use cases related to that content. So for example, when you think about G2, a lot of what G2 does is to diligence merchants. To date, most of the application of the data set has been more about diligencing consumers, the borrower and then to \u2013 and observe what they're doing in terms of their spending, using their credit card product for example, or their debit products. But one of the things that you can do when your data set is as comprehensive as ours is, is you can also then sort of pivot and start to try to observe the activities of the merchants where these payment products are being used. That's kind of new business for us relatively, and G2 is already there and so that's where the synergy occurs on that side.","Then with respect to looking more at sort of LCI, another thing that you can do when you have comprehensive transaction data, is you can try to understand patterns of fraud, which is a really great theme for us, one that's very important for us in the insurance world for example. That's something that we have already done inside of Argus. It's a small part of what we do at Argus today but it's available and LCI helps supercharge that.","When you move more towards the sort of the merchant analytics, there can be a degree of overlap with players out there including the bureaus and when you move towards trying to root out fraud, there's kind of a different set of solution providers out there that you might end up overlapping a little bit but we believe that, back to the most important point, we believe we come very equipped for these new categories because of the depth of what we've already got. And so we feel advantaged in trying to bring new value to the market with respect to categories like merchants and fraud.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. And then Eva, I just missed it, a housekeeping standpoint. What was the intangible amortization comment for this year?","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","The intangible amortization for this year is $105 million.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Eva F.

Your line is open.","Nicholas Verhein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. This is Nick Verhein on for Anj. Thanks for taking my question. Could you maybe just give us a sense of what the WoodMac contribution was to your energy and specialized markets revenue growth in the quarter?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","I think we put that out there. It was 3.3%.","Nicholas Verhein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Oh, okay, I must have just missed that. Can you just maybe then provide an update on maybe some of the customer conversations or maybe some sentiment, what it's sort of trending like and any updated thoughts on what sort of growth the business can aspire to in the sort of stable to low oil price environment?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. Well, first of all, just to observe on the environment, I think maybe you noticed that Brent closed at $61-something yesterday, so there's been actually fair progression in terms of the price of the commodity. We said for some time we just need the environment to be stable for our customers to feel good and to lean into growing their businesses and doing so by doing business with us and we feel like we're now in that environment, so we're actually very pleased about that.","Customer conversations are very good. I mean, it's a large global dynamic space and probably every customer of ours in that space has their own story in terms of where they are on their journey towards growth and profitability and part of the reason why we're both a meaningful partner for them, and also we feel like we have really terrific opportunities, is that we have these intimate relationships with essentially all of them and so we're able to turn corners with them specifically. Where are they trying to get to?","And just like everything else we do, our business there also has a motive quality because we have data assets that are absolutely unique, so we feel very strongly about this business and are very excited about where it's going. I said at the time we bought it, and I still say, that over intermediate and long periods of time I'm looking for Wood Mackenzie to grow faster than the average of Verisk and we believe that's very possible, probable.","Nicholas Verhein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America. Your line is open.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you for the ACV commentary on WoodMac. Did want to ask about how renewal rates have trended? And then also, did you offer any price concessions to clients during the downturn? As you are doing your planning around next year, are you planning for price increases on those products?","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yes. We've actually talked about this effect before, so just to sort of reprise what we said before, WoodMac does a \u2013 at WoodMac we do a mix of one, two and three-year subscriptions. So part of what gets reported right at this moment is actually what was set in motion a couple years ago. And there were contracts that were being written and renewed kind of in the depth of sort of the pressure on the category. So when we report the 5-plus percent ACV progression year-to-date, it actually takes a little while for that to work its way into the reported results. And so as you're watching Wood Mackenzie step up, and we've talked about this for several quarters now, it's because these good things that are happening, they just take a while to get expressed into the overall result. So you're seeing WoodMac elevate. I think, 2018 looks very interesting for WoodMac.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then on acquisitions, I understand they are a 230 basis points drag to your EBITDA margins in the quarter. In terms of thinking about a time line to narrow that gap, is a two-year period too aggressive? Could you do it faster or slower? What's a rule of thumb to use? Thank you.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Well, if you were to look at for example, the three acquisitions we did in Q3, which are 75% of the spend that we've done in 2017, I think that you would definitely expect them within 12 to 18 months to essentially be sort of looking like they will look like at their run rates. And in all cases, I think you're then talking about a difference to the corporate margin level, which is much, much lower than that 230 basis point effect that we were \u2013 that we've talked. The 230 basis points, Eva was trying to help you understand Q4 of 2017 but these are highly profitable businesses.","Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Yeah, I would also add, there are some one-time effects when we acquire businesses. There's some fees associated with that. There's some accounting associated with certain revenue. So that's going to be more of a near-term weight on those businesses as well. So I think as Scott said, we're positive in terms of those ramping up.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","All three of those businesses have the same quality as the rest of Verisk, which is to say, a high degree of fixed costs and so incremental margins in all of those businesses are really good.","Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Okay. Seeing no other questioners on the screen there, I'll just say thank you very much for your time and your interest today. We look forward to seeing you. Hope you can all join us at our Investor Day in December. And as I mentioned right up front, we'll spend even more time on some of these newer parts of the company so that you have a very, very deep understanding of what they are, and how they behave in the market and how they behave economically. So hope you can join us then. Thanks for your time today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"21516":["Verisk Analytics, Inc.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's EVP of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen. Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.","David Cohen","Thank you, Patrick, and good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for discussion of our second quarter 2017 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations.","The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. The earnings release contains reconciliations of several non-GAAP measures which we will reference on today's call. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.","Finally, as set forth in more detail, in yesterday's earnings release, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.","Scott Stephenson","Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. Reported revenue grew 5% for the quarter. Organic constant currency growth was 4.1%. As expected we are seeing the performance progression we discussed on our first quarter earnings call. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins of around 49% and diluted adjusted EPS increased about 12%. When I look at the organic initiatives and recent acquisitions, I'm very encouraged by our people, our assets and the outlook. Our teams are working hard on all the new solutions in which we are investing. The long-term opportunities remain robust and we are seeing real progress in terms of market demand in our customer interactions.","While M&A remains our priority for use of free cash, we were pleased to continue repurchasing our shares in the quarter through our longstanding program. We bought two million shares for a total return of capital to shareholders of $156 million in the quarter. At June 30, 2017 we have $376 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We have capacity to make strategically relevant acquisitions as well as additional repurchases.","During the quarter we spent $48 million on acquisitions including MAKE which is the leading expert in wind energy data analytics. MAKE is an important complement to Greentech, the solar data analytics business we acquired last year as we round out our capabilities in the renewable energy space. Additionally, as you've seen in the press release yesterday afternoon during the quarter we acquired seven leading aerial imagery companies for a total consideration of around $31 million to support our remote imagery solutions which are provided as part of our Geomni business.","The acquisitions position us as a leader in remote sensing and enhance our analytics solutions for the property casualty insurance industry. The acquisitions bring us a talented group of professionals as well as aircraft and sensors, we have put together a great team and a great network of geographic coverage which is critically important to serving our customers. Our geospatial imagery database serves as the foundation for analytics solutions addressing the needs of property casualty insurers as well as photogrammetry, surveying and mapping companies known as PSM, and other end markets. Additional applications will serve energy, banking, architecture, engineering, emergency response and urban planning.","The new companies combined with our expertise in computer vision based imagery processing and large-scale data management accelerate our efforts to meet the needs of our property casualty insurance customers with the required frequency resolution and U.S. coverage. You may recall that we explored a higher cost option in 2014 which would have accelerated us into the space. We have come up with an even better solution which provides us with greater intellectual property at a significantly lower investment. By building the capability ourselves with control over the aircraft sensor technology in flight plans we are able to create what we need at a much lower total spend.","Including the $31 million purchase price of the acquisitions we will be investing up to $100 million in a remote sensing platform initiative across 2017 and 2018. These investments will enable Geomni to address an annual opportunity of over $200 million in the insurance space at an aggregate level of investment lower than previously possible. Additionally, with this valuable imagery dataset we expect to be able to access other addressable markets with multi-billion dollars of current spend. Even in the context of the near-term increase in capital expenditures to support this initiative we expect CapEx to normalize to about 6% of revenue by the year 2021. This moderation in CapEx reflects the maturation of the re-platforming and investment opportunities we've been discussing with you.","Finally, last week we announced the signing of an acquisition agreement for G2 Web Services. We expect to close the transaction this quarter and are excited about the opportunity to integrate its fraud fighting solutions into our unique Argus platform. We remain confident in the strategy built on the various distinctives of one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first to market innovations; and four, deep integration into our customer workflows. As you know, with the distinctive come network effects, scaled economies and a large percentage of subscription revenue. From this foundation we are focused on executing on our plans which include ongoing innovation and serving our customers.","As we look at the rest of 2017 we continue to have a constructive view for the insurance business with the second half performance better than the first half and we expect Wood Mac [ph] to make progress inside of a stabilized end market.","I'd like to put our expectations for financial services for this year in a broader context. Argus became a part of Verisk five years ago; over that time period it has averaged 17% organic growth. That growth has come from new logos, new solutions, new international markets and modest pricing effects. We've seen a 67% increase in U.S. clients and an 80% increase in international clients over that time period. 2017 is clearly an outlier since the acquisition in 2012. Since we came together, Argus's addressable market has expanded materially. In 2012 much of our TAM related to credit card issuance, now we serve banks with respect to fraud fighting, compliance and data management, as well as serving a growing list of leading non-bank entities.","With these has come a changed profile of revenue acquisition. While our bank consortia products provide recurrence just the same as other parts of Verisk; the newer products bring with them large upfront engagements followed by recurrent streams at somewhat lower levels. So we create grow over facts as the business grows but overall, our growth over the past five years was against a smaller TAM and we are optimistic about the future.","At the moment as you know, we have several non-core contracts which ended in 2016 whose $11 million represented about 9% of revenue, these are one-time events that will not recur. Our current assessment is that several important new contracts will come online in 2017 but later in the year than anticipated. The core business remains in excellent shape and underlying growth remained solid with very good growth in the spending and media analytics part of the business. More important, our data sets are continuing to grow and remain unique allowing us to create solutions for our customers that no one else can offer. At Argus we have four strategic growth pillars including; one, core banking solutions; two, data management solutions; three, decisioning algorithms; and four, spend in media analytics.","The core banking solutions are the Argus Foundation. We continue to lead with our core banking solutions and are expanding these to new international markets. Data management solutions follow from our leading capabilities around aggregating, standardizing and structuring data for analysis often more efficiently than our customers could do themselves. We have expanded our capabilities in the space with the acquisition of Fintellix and particular related to global regulatory compliance. The decisioning algorithms include established solutions like Wallet Share models and new ones such as fighting first-party fraud including through the pending acquisition of G2. Primary to this pillar are the sophisticated data science skills and methods we apply to our proprietary datasets.","The fourth area of spend in media analytics reflects the opportunities we have been speaking with you about in recent years where we are working with consortium partners including companies with insights into traditional and new media presentation and measurement. All of this adds up to addressable end markets of over $2 billion. As we pursue market leading growth rates overtime we do expect new solutions initially to show more variability relative to our heritage solutions. This is especially evident in financial services and while revenue declined in the quarter, when we review the quality of our data assets and capabilities, the levels of customer engagement, the run rate business contracts and the future opportunity; we are very confident that our solutions are positioned to win in the long-term.","So with that let me turn it over to Mark for some additional comments.","Mark Anquillare","Thank you, Scott. First, as you saw in the release growth in insurance picked back up as we expected. As we expand our business which serves the property and casualty insurance industry we have several key themes including vertical Big Data, industry automation and digital engagement. The good example of industry automation introduced recently is underwriters advantage, a single source solution providing detailed underwriting data and accurate rebuild cost estimates for U.K. residential and commercial underwriters and brokers. We've taken our well established U.S. expertise and broadened it to the U.K. through the recently acquired geo-information group acquisition. We're actively working to pursue other international markets as well.","More broadly, the solution highlights the process we're making in the U.K. in area which we are excited to continue invest. Progress in the U.K. is also underscored by the success of our annual risk symposium which had record attendance in June. Cyber is another important growth area within the insurance space which we are addressing at the IR and at ISL. As you may recall, we've launched ARC or Analytics of Risk from Cyber which allows insurers to evaluate any commercial policy, measure and monitor aggregations of cyber risk within a portfolio and estimate potential insured cyber losses for portfolios. More recently, ISO launched a cyber-insurance program with enhanced rating variables and coverage options designed to help insurer respond to the rapidly changing world of cyber risk. Building on the work we have done ISO recently launched a process to aggregate cyber data from the industry, a classic application of the vertical Big Data concept.","AIIR had a good quarter including nice wins in the cat-modeling space as Touchstone continues its success in the marketplace. In addition, we are seeing growing interest in the solutions we have introduced from analyzere [ph] in the area of acquisitions. While small, we see a long runway for portfolio optimization in casualty event risk management.","Finally, AIIR continues to be the leader in the cat bond market which was particularly strong in this quarter providing models for much of the new issuance this year-to-date. Finally, another example of automation is the ongoing rollout of ISO claim search integrations which allows our customers to receive instant access to Central Plains Analytics and insights directly in their claims management systems. This is part of a larger opportunity driven by the availability of the next generation of claim search which provides a platform for an ongoing in steady stream of new analytics enhancements, existing users with the investigation and adjustment of claims but providing real-time alerts and actionable intelligence using state-of-the-art data visualization techniques, response from customers has been very positive. With that let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results in more detail.","Eva Huston ","Thank you, Mark. In the second quarter we grew revenue and EBITDA while also investing in solutions with meaningful long-term potential revenue streams. Our growth in the quarter picked up consistent with our comments on the last earnings call. As we move through the year, we remained confident that revenue growth will continue to improve.","Revenue in the quarter grew 5% and organic constant currency revenue grew 4.1%. The press release again has a table to help him in FX or fax acquisition. As a reminder constant currency growth rate excludes the contribution from recent acquisition and reflects current period exchange rate to prior period revenue. Currency hurt revenue results in the quarter by about $7.2 million. And total acquired revenue in the quarter was $12 million including the contributions from our aerial imagery acquisitions and MAKE in the renewable space.","Within the decision analytics segment revenue increased 4.2%, organic constant currency revenue growth was 4%. This quarter insurance was the fastest growing vertical and also the largest contributor of dollars to growth. Decision analytics insurance revenue increased 8.8% in the second quarter and organic constant currency revenue growth was 8.4%. Growth was led by strong performance in underwriting and cash remodelling solutions claims analytics growth was good and last on occasion solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter.","Energy and specialized markets category revenue declined 0.7% in the quarter a quarter and on an organic constant currency basis of revenue increases point six percent and on an organic constant currency basis revenue increased 0.6%. On an organic constant currency basis with MAC grew in the quarter while the British pound impacted revenue in the quarter we're pleased to see continued improvement in customer demand inside a stabilized energy market. As expected as you know the benefit will be over time given the multi-year subscription nature of the majority of that business. The category revenue growth was affected by decline and environmental health and safety solutions due to lower demand following the late 2015. now in the late two thousand and fifteen completion of V.H.S. standards related implementation.","Financial services revenue decline 4.3% in the quarter, organic constant currency revenue declined 9.3% in the quarter. As Scott said, strong growth in media effectiveness and good growth in core banking solutions were more than offset by the contracts which concluded last year. We noted last quarter that those contracts contributed about $11 million in 2016. We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the business and building on what is a great dataset and analytic capability. The impact of the non-core contrasts are roughly even across the full year.","Underlying growth excluding the 2016 non-core non-renewals is good, media effectiveness growth remains strong. We were anticipating additional revenue from non-bank companies in the payment space in 2017. The dynamics of the sales cycle with those companies varies from those with the banks but the long-term value proposition for this customer segment is compelling. As we bring in new data assets and capabilities to our financial services solutions such as Fintellix and G2, we reinforce the path to long-term sustainable growth as we move into 2018.","Risk assessment revenue grew 6.4% in the quarter including contributions from our recent acquisitions which are expanding the baseline for future growth. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 4.4% reflecting our 2017 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions. While still early, we are encouraged by the strong efforts to drive new product development in this part of the business. The organic investments and acquisitions reflect our ambition, particularly in international markets to build on our strong foundation. Total EBITDA increased 3.7% in the quarter to $254 million. We continue to invest with a focus on revenue we see in the pipelines and opportunities for this year and into the future.","The combined constant revenue and SG&A increased 7.3% or $19 million in the quarter. However, the increase was just 2.4% on an organic basis as we continue to focus on efficiency in our existing businesses and repurposing that spend to farm innovation. EBITDA margins as reported were 48.6%. Margins were reduced by about 120 basis points due to acquisitions and the fact that we expect to continue through the year. Total acquired EBITDA on the quarter was about $1 million excluding acquisition associated expenses. The acquisitions we were doing are close to the core with well-defined path to topline growth and margin expansion.","We expect the temporary pressure on margins from acquisitions as well as investment opportunities to continue through 2017. While full year margins are likely to be consistent with the second quarter we are constructive over the long-term. As we've said previously, we review our leading margin level as a gauge of the strength of our solutions. Reported interest expense was $29 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.4 billion at June 30, 2017 and our leverage at the end of the second quarter was about 2.5 times our strong capital structures and asset as we continue to explore opportunities to drive growth.","Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 28.8%. The tax rate benefited primarily from the ASU 2016 09 [ph]. Adjusted net income in 2Q increased 11.5% to $139 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.82 in the quarter, an increase of 12.3%. Diluted adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased because of organic growth in the business and lower interest expense, provisions for income taxes and share account. The increase in the adjusted EPS was partially offset by higher fixed asset depreciation. The average diluted share count was $168.3 million in the quarter and we bought about two million shares in the quarter at an average price of $79.73. Our repurchase program has been successful today generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. On June 30, 2017 our diluted share account was 167.9 million shares.","Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $430 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of 11.6% versus 2016. Capital expenditures were $73 million for the six months period ended June 30 and CapEx was 7.1% of revenue year-to-date. Free cash flow increased 14.5% to $357 million for the six month period ended June 30, and free cash flow was 71.5% of EBITDA. Growth in free cash flow is driven by positive operating results and this is an important metric for the measurement of driving enterprise and therefore shareholder value.","In the second quarter as Scott noted, the new additions to our aerial imagery capabilities contributed to our revenue of about $700,000. In 2016 these companies generated about $15 million in revenue and about $2 million in EBITDA. They will be included in the decision analytics insurance line for reporting purposes and will be treated as acquired until the third quarter of 2018. As Scott mentioned, including the purchase prices of about $31 million we expect to invest upto $100 million across 2017 and 2018. The additional investments will largely be in the form of CapEx to further expand data gathering capabilities through planes and remote imagery sensors.","The five-year plan when looking at the investments and operating costs relative to our revenue forecast and the resulting free cash flow we expect to generate is compelling. As you've seen in yesterday's press release, insurance related market opportunity is over $200 million annually, and we also see opportunities in broader bottom markets.","As you think about your models for 2017, currency will continue to be a headwind moderating a bit as we move into the second half. To help you look at the FX impact, the following 2016 total revenues are restated as of June 30, 2017 rates. If rates were unchanged from June 30 these would be the base for organic constant currency revenue growth. Most of the impact falls within the energy and specialized market segment and decision analytics.","For 3Q 2016 it would be $496 million versus the reported $498 million, and for the fourth quarter 2016 it would be $508 million versus the reported $506 million. In addition, we expect CapEx of about $185 million, an increase versus the prior amount to reflect the remote imagery investments. As Scott noted we expect CapEx to normalize to about 6% by 2021. Fixed asset depreciation and amortization will be almost $140 million for the year, and the amortization of intangibles about $95 million. Based on our current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to be around $115 million for the year; this includes non-cash amortization of debt issuance cost.","We still estimate the full year tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33% and the adjusted net income calculation we continue to use 26% for the tax effective on intangible amortization. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of 169 million to 170 million shares.","We look forward to continue the overall improvement as we move through 2017 and beyond. We are excited about the opportunities to invest as we work to drive long-term free cash flow. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long-term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us we ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tim McHugh, William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh","Thanks. I guess to start off with maybe a two part question on just insurance; how meaningful is the strengthening capacity bonds to the growth that you saw in decision analytics insurance? And secondly, I guess elaborate just why now are you ready to pull the trigger on going more aggressively after aerial imagery?","Mark Anquillare","This is Mark, let me start out Tim. Obviously, the cap on market was robust in the quarter, we continue to be the model choice and as a result that did help us a little bit. But I just want to make sure I don't -- we don't overemphasize how much revenue we get from the cap on market, it's certainly an indicator of kind of the strength of our AIR brand but at the same time we're talking a couple of million dollars over something overly dramatic.","Eva Huston","Yes. And Tim, I would just add that if we have not seen any growth in the cap online there, we still would have seen acceleration in the DA insurance growth.","Scott Stephenson","And to your question Tim about aerial imagery, we've really been on this topic for some time now and much of what we've given attention to over the last couple of years have been our analytic methods. And so our machine learned methods for interpreting image sets I think are the best in the world and we've been working on those for a few years. What we concluded was that in order to assume the position that we want to, where this market is concerned we had to complement that excellence with equal distinctiveness with respect to the image sets that are available to us. To-date we've been working with third-parties and so this we see as really the final step in order to be fully prepared to serve this marketplace. And so it's not that we haven't been here, it's that this was sort of the final piece.","Timothy McHugh","Okay, thanks. And then just one quick follow-up. I guess Eva, I think you said insurance you expect faster growth in the second half, is that relative to 2Q and -- or is that first half? Just kind of I guess clarifying what you were saying?","Eva Huston","We're just only looking at first half versus second half, Tim.","Timothy McHugh","Okay.","Eva Huston","And you know, we prefer to talk about it from an annual basis but that's the way we think about it.","Timothy McHugh","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeff Meuler","Thanks. On the aerial imagery, the investment that you're talking about is that all incremental on top of the level that you've already been investing in aerial imagery including the amount that you've been spending to source the images from third-parties?","Scott Stephenson","No. So our own efforts at image capture will substitute for, what we have had to spend with third-parties in order to capture images to-date. Now there is a bit of an overlap period here where -- even today we're still being supplied by the third-parties that we put together but in a short period of time basically it will all be our own image capture and therefore these costs associated with the third-parties will go away.","Jeff Meuler","Can you give us any rough order of size in terms of how much is incremental?","Eva Huston","Well, I think the way to think about Jeff is, when we're talking about the $100 million investment, that's the -- the M&A of about $31 million plus CapEx, and I think as we're talking about third-parties, that's more on the OpEx side; so I think it's a little bit of apples and oranges. But I think fundamentally as Scott was saying, I mean this is a better way to do it, overall, it's going to be less expensive and we're going to have more control and better imagery.","Jeff Meuler","Okay. And then just going back to the Argus performance and the outlook commentary; I think there were the comments somewhere in Scott's prepared remarks about run rate business contracts, so is this more contracts that are signed and the question is when they go live and you start to recognize revenue or is this pipeline that has not yet contracted in terms of what seems to be more delayed than your previous expectations?","Scott Stephenson","It's a combination of both Jeff. So we can see the cumulative effect of what has already been put in place and also anticipating new contracts, particularly in these new segments that I was talking about before; so it's both.","Jeff Meuler","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning, thank you. Just a clarification around CapEx; is it fair to say that Verisk is in a multi-year elevated CapEx cycle? You guys pointed to $100 million spread over two years but then you threw out the 2021 figure of 6% of CapEx. So just maybe a little more color after 2018, is it still elevated that CapEx spend and it just goes down in 2021 or any color would be great there.","Eva Huston","Well, so there are a couple of layers in there. Thank you for the question. I think maybe I'll start by saying sort of prior to the discussion of the $100 million investment in aerial imagery of which remember 30% of that is M&A, $31 million and the remainder is CapEx, so we're talking about that across 2017 and 2018, that's -- before that what you know is we've been re-platforming our business and we were already starting to work our CapEx percentages letting it down. This is something that will sort of elevated for '17 and '18 but our expectation is that we will continue on that downward trajectory, this is just a layer on top of the path that we already discussed.","Hamzah Mazari","Great, that's very helpful. And then just a longer term question, maybe if you could frame for us what catalysts investors should look for the company to have greater penetration internationally outside of energy? Is it simply that data analytics markets need to develop more overseas or is there anything else that you are hearing from your customer base that could be relevant? Thank you.","Scott Stephenson","No, I mean it's -- there is no single effect but the rest of the world is the same as the United States in the sense that data analytics is what companies are doing, you know, companies inside of our vertical markets are working on today; so it's really just a matter of us being present and presenting credentials and we're very encouraged by the engagements that we've been able to generate in 2017 with names that didn't used to be on our customer list. And it's just that it's steady march that will get us there but there is nothing fundamentally different about the rest of the world; I mean there may be some differences in terms of regulatory structure and that can have some effect on market structure but overall, it's really -- it's the same thing. No, it's not a matter of catalysts, it's a matter of us being present, bringing our great intellectual property into these markets and finding our place.","Hamzah Mazari","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you, good morning. First question just to clarify a couple of things on the aerial imagery investment; so in terms of the revenue opportunity -- you've been working on this since 2014, you talked about $200 million TAM on the insurance side I guess. I was wondering if you could just have us frame what that revenue penetration looks like for you guys today? And just to clarify, the $70 million is '17 and '18 but after that what should the run rate look like in terms of spend there?","Scott Stephenson","Yes, so we've accessed less than 5% of that TAM today. So we're -- this is the opening minutes of the first quarter. We've been working on our methods for a long time as I responded to Tim's question but we feel like we've put the final piece in place here. But we've accessed 5% or less actually of that TAM, so very, very early days. With respect to the CapEx profile, there will be a sustained tail of CapEx because essentially the infrastructure necessary to generate these image sets always has to be refreshed but as Eva was mentioning before with respect to CapEx, '17 and '18 are kind of this bubble and then we come down to substantially lower sustained levels to essentially keep this network in the United States operating in perpetuity.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And maybe just one question to Eva, last quarter you guys talked about 7% to 8% as your target for financial plus insurance, clearly it sounds like that's not going to be meet because of financial; would you be willing to give us what that range would look like now?","Eva Huston","Yes, you're right. Because of the discussion we've had around financial which -- we're still very encouraged by the business overall but I think in 2017 it's not going to show the type of growth that we would need to get to that target that we had talked about earlier. So I think as we've talked about insurance we expect that to continue to accelerate in the second half, we feel very good about it. So that's kind of where we set.","Scott Stephenson","7% to 8% is still the reference benchmark for us, nothing has changed, we're simply talking about quarters here.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeff Silber, BMO.","Henry Sou Chien","Thanks, good morning, it's Henry Chien. I just had a question, it's a follow-up question on the aerial imagery space; is this -- in terms of how you're building up your aerial imagery business, is the focus still on the insurance end market where you also position being the data and the services to other end markets and just any thoughts on how you plan to position this future aerial business?","Scott Stephenson","Yes, so I think couple of questions in there. This capability will serve more than the insurance market but the insurance market is a primary consideration for us simply because of the nature of the business that we do but in fact there are marketplaces today consuming the analyzed output of aerial imagery which are larger than the insurance used cases and we intend to tap those markets as well; so it's really -- it's genuinely at both end and the way we think that we're going to win, the way that we are making progress today is basically a combination of great data which is what this announcement about the aerial imagery capture program is about combined with leading analytic methods, and you also have to build great workflows so that the customers can easily ingest the data in the analysis, we've got all that and we are actively presenting credentials in the market today and very encouraged by what we're saying.","Henry Sou Chien","Okay, that's great. And just a follow-up question; on the gross margins, it looks like it's been trending downwards, is there anything that's been driving that?","Eva Huston","I mean I think you're probably seeing some impact of some of the acquisitions in that.","Henry Sou Chien","Okay, alright. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, it's Oscar [ph] for Andrew. So I was just wondering can you provide any color on the competitive environment in Argus, has anything changed there?","Scott Stephenson","No, nothing has changed there. No, we still have a very unique position inside of the banking ecosystem with respect to the data asset that we have, nothing has changed.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow up, we've seen an uptick in the pace of M&A recently though it has been somewhat smaller deals; how should we think about your M&A strategy going forward in terms of size, vertical and geography?","Scott Stephenson","So we -- our history at Verisk has been, we have created a lot of value for our shareholders through the program of M&A and the reason that it has created values is that it is tightly linked to our strategy; so we start from within the customer markets that we serve with a deep understanding of what they need and what their emerging needs look like, and from that we derive our strategy and from that we ask questions about should we build it or should we buy it, that's the way we've always done and that's the way we will continue to do it. We're not doctrinaire [ph] about the amount that we spend on M&A, we're not doctrinaire about the size of the deals, what we're looking for are things which fit our strategy. The strategy is tightly yoked to two things; one is the vertical markets we're serving, and the other is the four distinctive that we always talk about, and those are really the criteria that we use at those and financial metrics to look at potential acquisitions.","So we're on the same course that we were always on, and so with respect to expectations going forward we will continue to lean into the M&A agenda, we will continue to lean into the share repurchase program; and the amount of transactions at any given moment will be a function of mostly kind of availability and we do a lot of cultivation and things take time but I think you can look to us for a very steady stream of acquisitions into the future.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that's helpful, thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William Warmington","Good morning everyone. So first question for you on Wood Mac, you had pointed out that the growth -- on an organic basis constant currency up about 0.6% but it's actually little better than that because EHS was negative against it. So I wanted to ask whether you were seeing -- what you were seeing on the renewables, whether you're seeing on the dollar value, were you seeing price improvements, expansion; what's driving the growth there?","Scott Stephenson","Yes, it's -- we're very encouraged by what's happening with the subscription revenues, that's real-time business and that is as with the way that we face-off with our customers and all vertical markets, when we come to a renewal moment it isn't just a sort of a raw question of price increase on what they were using previously; first of all, our products are always sort of dynamically changing but in addition to that we sort of bring bundles. So when we look at -- what we're paying attention to Bill is the subscription amounts associated with existing customers and obviously with new customers as well. And there has been very nice progression in terms of those subscription revenues. As Eva pointed out because we signed multi-year agreements it will take a little while for the full effect of what's happening right now to show up on the revenue line but it's progressing nicely.","And as I said, just to be clear about this; you know, inside of the resource and energy world we don't need the commodity to be -- for example, if we're talking about the oil commodity we don't need it to be at the record highs, it was at a few years ago, we just need our customers to be stable and looking to the future which is actually kind of where we are now. There has been a tremendous reduction in breakeven inside the industry and so it's -- we just need stability and essentially there is stability at this point; so we're enjoying what's happening in that business.","William Warmington","Okay. And then a clarification on the 7% to 8% constant currency organic target for the total insurance including and plus financial services. When we talked about this in early May, at that point it looked like about two-thirds of that target was under contract and about one-third was coming from new sales; and I just wanted to check whether we were still on-track for that for the year and I wanted to also -- I mean, back at the envelope it looked like that combined organic constant currency was somewhere in the 4% to 5% range for the second quarter, that's my math and I know your math is better than mine; so I just wanted to check that.","Eva Huston","All right, there were like seven questions in that.","William Warmington","Sorry about that.","Eva Huston","So I'll start with the last one first, organic constant currency and buying insurance and financial in the quarter was 5.1% and that compared to 4.9% last quarter so there was a progression there. Going back maybe to the top, a clarifying point was the one-third, two-thirds comment you made, that was the comment we made specifically around insurance last quarter and maybe after I get two more of your questions I'll have Mark make a comment on how we're progressing on that. With regards to the combined targets for financial and insurance, you know, going back to the comments that Scott and I made, financial in 2017 because of some of the dynamics we talked about [indiscernible] level we had expected for -- so I would say that when we look at that combined target that we talked about that is not something that we're looking at because of the financial performance that we're now expecting in 2017. So let me comment on how we're progressing on the insurance side.","Mark Anquillare","As we demonstrated in the second quarter, we feel like there is a ramp inside of insurance and we were just kind of reinforce second half versus the first half. One of the metrics I think we tried to provide during the first quarter call was the element of how much of the contracts or how many additional growth was relative to committed contracts and things that will be happening because of a commitment and signed contract versus go get your pipeline; and I think you feel good about the progress we've made over the course of quarter and that number is even more positive today. So I'm comfortable with at least the progress we're making.","William Warmington","Got it. So I understand we were saying now on the 7% to 8% target; did you want to give us a revised target for that combined segment for 2017?","Eva Huston","I think Scott's described well the dynamic and financial and for insurance that we've talked about acceleration into the second half.","Scott Stephenson","Yes, and we expect progress as the year goes on and the target remains the target and it's just a question of timing.","William Warmington","Got it. All right, well thank you very much and I appreciate your patience through all the questions.","Scott Stephenson","Thank you, Bill.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Good morning. Eva, EBITDA margins were down year-over-year in the first half for the year in 2017; might we see EBITDA margins down in the same or more in the second half of the year, year-over-year and when should we get back to margin expansion?","Eva Huston","Andrew, thanks for the question. If you were to look at what we -- what I found on the call with regard to margins, I think if you look at second quarter and think about the year I mean that's kind of where we are, we've got a couple of things going on there. Obviously, we've talked about the beginning of the year some of the investments that we're making in the business, we continue to make those; we're excited about those. We now have brought in some acquisitions, you know, I did mention for you some of the revenue in EBITDA and those acquisitions, those are smaller margins of our existing business and so that was over the call for this year. But as -- you know, I've said before, we continue to be constructive on margins over the long-term.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay.","Operator","And our next question is from Arash Soleimani with KBW.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks, good morning. So one question you mentioned in your prepared remarks a bit about cyber; I was just wondering, obviously cyber is still a relatively young insurance market are you seeing pretty large appetite from your insurance carrier clients to grow that line?","Mark Anquillare","This is Mark. I think one of the things that every insurer is looking to do is grow and cyber offers that opportunity in a world where premiums and rates have been relatively soft, cyber offers that opportunity. The challenge is it's tough to quantify that risk, actually understand what you're underwriting and how big it could be especially with all the cyber-attacks and the exposure that's out there. So there is -- you know, I call an under -- uninsured opportunity here and everyone's looking to try to seize on that. We have done several things that I think are responding to that need. We have typically focused on insurance and are sure of customers or reinsurers and you kind of heard some of the things from CAT [ph] models to actually programs and coverage forms that -- were aggregating data to better improve the last cost, we're going to try to put out what we refer to as like -- we typically have these building underwriting [indiscernible] kind of have a similar type of report or businesses.","The theory is that both from a risk by risk and a portfolio perspective we can provide a lot of solutions to our customers that need support in writing this risk. Last comment, this is the type of risk if we do it right has the ability to kind of lag outside of insurance and into the corporate market. So it provides even a bigger TAM and bigger opportunity if we do it right; so we are excited about the opportunities here and we're working hard to be the first or at least first to market.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks, that's helpful. And the other question is, was there anything unusual in the tax rate this quarter; it seemed a bit lower than usual?","Eva Huston","As I mentioned, remember we have this new approach from an accounting perspective to how we have to write for the benefit for stock option. So you're going to see a bit more variability across the quarter and that's what you saw in this quarter for the tax rate that we still think for the year we're going to be looking at 32% to 33%.","Arash Soleimani","All right, great, thanks for the answers.","Eva Huston","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tony Kathleen [ph] with Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. You've talked a lot about financials so far but I'm not sure I have a great idea of the growth expectation in the second half for this segment, you're facing sort of mid 20's comps organically but you do have the large contracts in the pipeline that you're expecting to come on later in the year. So basically I'm just trying to understand how much of these large contracts contribute to growth and just facing the tough comps, I'm just trying to get a sensed directionally of how we should be thinking about financial?","Scott Stephenson","Yes, so we expect it to grow in the fourth quarter, more in Q4 than Q3.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And basically should Q3 be -- should we be thinking positive organically or how should we be thinking about that?","Scott Stephenson","I mean that's kind of where I'm going to leave it with you Tony [ph], it's just -- it's progressing from where it was in the second quarter and the second half will net out to growth and it will be more Q4 than Q3.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then Mark I think talks about the changed profile of revenue in Argus; I'm just trying to understand are there different types of products that customers are demanding or have you just changed the structure of the contracts for the existing products. Just any examples of maybe changes in purchasing behavior if there are or just what's going on? Thanks.","Scott Stephenson","Yes, so there were a couple of -- this is Scott, there were a couple of comments that we made on that. So as we've expanded the products that we've also moved to a new set of customers, so actually you have both effects going on at the same time and the new solutions take on somewhat -- some of the new solutions taking on somewhat different shape and profile than say the consortium based products which were the ones that really -- you first got to look at, that was most of what you were seeing when you were looking at Argus 2012-2013, they have the same kind of recurrent quality as many, many of the things we do around Verisk but as we moved into new solution sets, for example, media effectiveness; the nature of the engagement with the customer which is a different customer takes on a different profile where there is sort of an intense engagement as you get started because we have to integrate datasets with datasets in order to be able to create the analysis that we're looking to do which then you come off that high somewhat as you move into then a recurrent relationship. And so that shape is different than the shape of what the Argus business began with inside of the consortium model.","So as we move to new solutions we also move to new customers and those new solutions that's for those new customers do have a somewhat different profile but extremely good business; the difference that we can make, the value that can be added is substantial.","Unidentified Analyst","Perfect, thanks Scott.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Mike Creed [ph] on for Joe, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go quick back to what the long-term margin opportunity was and would that come from less acquisitions and lowered investments or are there other leverage there?","Eva Huston","I think as you think about our business model it all comes from the top line growth and as we're investing, we're working to enhance that top line growth and I think you'll see that scalability. I think similarly with our acquisition and you've seen the acquisitions we're bringing in, they are not all at our margins today but they also are growth opportunities, and so as we start to scale that I think you'll just see that naturally fall to the bottom line as you have historically.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then -- you think there would be any seasonality margin-wise between Q3 and Q4, probably not much?","Eva Huston","I don't think that's a typical period in which we see seasonality. I mean there is always variability but I don't think there is anything specific I'd call out.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks.","Eva Huston","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Alex Care [ph] with UBS.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. I hope this question is not too detail but I wanted to just ask about subscription growth in the quarter. Now when I look at your subscription disclosures in the 10-Q and I backed into the implied growth, the 2Q had less than 1% subscription revenue growth in decision analytics and I think all the growth came basically for non-subscription growth; I think it's about 16% by my calculation and I think subscription was as flat in the first quarter too. So I know there is a lot of moving pieces, effects, acquisitions, the different business but I guess if I just step back and look at this more holistically, it looks a little bit more like the business is becoming much more dependent on one one-time sales and maybe the subscription would have stalled. So again, a lot of moving pieces but maybe you can elaborate how you would look at that?","Eva Huston","Yes, I mean -- I think if you -- you kind of have to unbundle it and I think there is a reasonable impact from the comments we've made around Argus. Those long-term contracts that did not renew at the end of last year as expected, those were subscription on long-term contracts; so I think part of the impact we're seeing relates to that. I can circle back with a little more detail later on but I would consider that in your analysis.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So still very comfortable, obviously, that the subscription core is positioned for steady growth.","Eva Huston","Absolutely.","Scott Stephenson","That is -- those are own beat inside of our company.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, good. And then but secondly, and maybe related to the same data. I think Eva, you kind of rushed a little bit for the cap-ons [ph] answer there when somebody asked early and you said, a couple of million, again, by just backing into the non-subscription goals, I think I get to $11 million, I guess it is adjusted as well but where is that $11 million coming from if it's not the cap-ons [ph] strength, what other kind of like non-subscription items contribute at this quarter that you may want to cause?","Eva Huston","Sorry, I'm not sure I know your $11 million reference but let me go back to what Marc said about cap-on from what I said, I think Mark said he didn't want to overstate the size of the business, it's millions of dollars, not tens of millions of dollars. And the comment that I made I think in response to Tim's question was that even if we were to assume that, so cap-ons obviously grew nicely in the quarter but even if we were to assume that we've got no dollar growth in cap-ons this quarter, you still would have seen an acceleration in decision analytics insurance growth. So the comment I was making was really just trying to -- I mean we're excited about it, we love to get cap-on revenue, it's great but I just wanted to make the point that the strength of the business was not solely related to the cap-on market. Hopefully that helps.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, there is always a first time. Thank you.","Eva Huston","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Anjaneya Singh with Credit Suisse.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, this is Nick Ryan [ph] on for Anjaneya, thanks for taking my questions. Now that you've kind of made the last step if you will, on aerial imagery, can you maybe just update us on what the competitive landscape looks like for you guys, now that's a sort of bigger focus and maybe any sort of estimates on the margins today and\/or where they could go overtime?","Scott Stephenson","Yes. This is Scott. There is -- in the insurance marketplace there is one primary competitor and outside of the insurance marketplace it's actually a fairly unconcentrated sort of long list of companies that provide that are small-ish that provide a fraction of the services that we're interested in. So that's really sort of the nature of where it says and one of the things about being in the insurance vertical is that the analyzed output from remote imagery needs to get put into platforms where the customers then make decisions based upon the remote imagery derived analysis and a lot of other inputs as well. We are the provider of most -- we are the leading provider of many, if not most of those platforms and so it's one of the reasons why we feel that we have a winning proposition that is going to take its place.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great, thank you. And maybe just any commentary around where you estimate the margins are today and maybe where they are expecting to go?","Scott Stephenson","Well, this is like most of the things that we do. We'll show a lot of scale as it grows, you have the semi-fixed cost of creating your datasets and you have the semi-fixed cost of the tech stack that you build to do the analysis. And so as this business grows we expect the margin characteristics to materially improve.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Gary [ph] with RBC.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, good morning. First question, just on the margins; Eva, did I hear you right that the margin for the full year approximates the second quarter? And if so, it -- given the margins were stronger second half versus first half a year ago, it seems to imply quite a bit larger contraction in the next few quarters, is that just the impact of the recent M&A or is there some other stepped up investment elsewhere you're expecting?","Eva Huston","Yes, we haven't shifted our investment plan for the year so I would say that a lot of that impact you're seeing really relates to M&A. And maybe just kind of moving back to the question before; on the inorganic side on aerial imagery, I gave you the data points in a script that the companies that we acquired in 2016 had about $15 million, about $2 million of EBITDA, so I'm kind of doing the math on that, even that will have some impact in the short-term.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then the follow-up; just on the longer term 7% to 8% organic revenue framework that you've discussed, how are you thinking today about the energy business long-term potential; at the time of the deal it was definitely above that. I think you've indicated tempering that and I guess relevant to what's going on now, how do you think about financial services against that that long-term framework? Thank you.","Scott Stephenson","So first of all, we haven't tempered that view with respect to the resources and energy business. So we remain in the same place, we actually have a wonderful franchise and many different ways that we can grow it; so we actually haven't tempered that franchise. And you asked about financial services, you know, our believe is that it has the potential to exceed the corporate average as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh, Deutsche Bank.","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thanks. I wonder if you could train or just the longer term frame, what the potential opportunity could be around fraud as you make those investments within [indiscernible], you know, what type of growth driver that could be for the business?","Scott Stephenson","Yes, so fraud is one of those persistent issues that never goes away, it's actually a topic that we like and it's one that I think you all know we give a great deal of attention to in the insurance vertical. And so what you're basically counting are many basis points against very, very large transaction volumes. And then what modifies that view of TAM a little bit is the degree to which our customers consider fraud a cost of doing business versus an opportunity to get after. In the insurance vertical, it's pretty well established that fraud is a category to go after. And our view is that in the financial services vertical it is increasingly viewed the same way and what's really needed are precise tools that create great confidence that you're actually getting after something and that the gains that you get will persist. And so we believe it's a very large marketplace and it's a very small part of what it is that we do in financial services today; so it's a very good theme for us.","Kevin McVeigh","Is that tied in Scott with kind of the cyber or those kind of -- do you do them jointly or are those independent?","Scott Stephenson","So Mark, if you want to talk about cyber again -- although Mark's comments about cyber; first pass relate to the insurance vertical but there is -- if you want to call it kind of a cyber-dimension, so for example, G2 web services, if you take the opportunity to look into that a little bit more, this is basically about diligencing online merchants and I won't sort of go into the specifics today but it is about trying to find sort of bad actors and maybe you wouldn't call it fraud exactly but it is about trying to find bad actors. And then Mark, do you want to add anything with respect to cyber?","Mark Anquillare","Well, I mean -- let me hit the cyber as well as the other things we do; I think there is a general theme that we've always found there is high correlation to the extent that you have bad guys that operate across a lot of spaces, we have the opportunity to find more fraud to the extent that we have a broader set of databases; so the extent that you think about all the insurance claims that are inside of our database we've brought in healthcare which is kind of improved through the accuracy and the ability to fight fraud. Cyber is another dimension and to the extent that we can gather some information with all the proper approvals around some of the credit card fraud that happens, I think we would be more effective at finding fraud across these different communities of interest; so that's a general thing we have and I think it's a positive one.","Scott Stephenson","No, that's a good point. Thanks.","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thank you.","Operator","And management, I'd now like to turn it back over to you for closing remarks.","Scott Stephenson","Okay, well thanks everybody for your time today and for your interest and I know we'll be talking to many of you in the days and weeks following this; and we look forward to bringing you our third quarter in a few months. And -- so again, thanks for your time today.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
