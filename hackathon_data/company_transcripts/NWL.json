[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellrubbermaid.com on the Investor Relations homepage under Events and Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download.","I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell","Thanks, Brent, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. On the call with me today are Mike Polk, Newell Rubbermaid's President and CEO; and Doug Martin, CFO.","Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. We caution you to consider the important risk factors described in our press release and in our various SEC filings. Please also note that any non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to core sales, normalized operating margin and normalized EPS, are provided because management believes that they provide insights which enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings release and as part of the slide deck that's available on our website.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Polk.","Michael B. Polk","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We have 3 objectives today. First, I'll review our first quarter results. Second, I'll update you on the progress we're making driving the Growth Game Plan into action, including our decision to sell our Hardware and Teach Platform businesses. And third, I'll provide you my perspective on the balance of 2013.","There are a couple of moving parts in Q1 2013, and we'll bring as much clarity as possible to the numbers so you can get a clean read on the underlying performance of the company. All the numbers we will share today relate to our business on a continuing basis, so excluding the Hardware and Teach Platform businesses.","We'll also talk to 2013 adjusted for the impact of the 2012 European SAP implementation. So let's get going.","Our Q1 performance represents our seventh consecutive quarter of consistent delivery. The results are in line with our expectations and set the stage for a solid 2013. Our Q1 2013 core sales grew 2.5%, adjusted for the 2012 European SAP-related timing shift from Q2 2012 to Q1 2012.","Q1 2013 gross margin improved sequentially to 38.2%, up 110 basis points versus Q4 2012, but down 80 basis points versus prior year due in large part to the unusually high gross margins in Q1 2012 related to the European SAP pull forward and higher 2013 customer programming investment in a select number of businesses in Q1.","As a result of a very full Project Renewal change agenda, we saw meaningful benefits in both structural and strategic SG&A in Q1.","During the quarter, we restructured the marketing and R&D and design organizations, implemented the next phase of best cost finance and restructured the 2 Tools global business units into 1 Tools segment, combining the functional leadership teams.","During the transition period in marketing, we also chose to tightly manage marketing investment as we made substantial leadership changes in the key roles that typically manage the spend.","The renewal changes, coupled with tight management of Q1 spending, resulted in a 40-basis point increase in normalized operating income margin versus prior year adjusted for SAP timing.","We delivered normalized EPS of $0.35, 9.4% ahead of prior year and $0.03 ahead of consensus.","Remember, Q1 2012 normalized EPS was favorably impacted by about $0.03 of earnings related to the European SAP pull forward. So the Q1 2013 normalized EPS of $0.35 increased about $0.06 versus prior year adjusted for SAP.","Importantly, our Q1 2013 result was bolstered by about $0.03 of net favorable discrete tax benefit that we will now use to help offset earnings dilution associated with the planned sale of our Hardware and Teach Platform businesses.","I think these are good results up against tough comparisons, and I'm once again proud of the organization for driving delivery while simultaneously driving change.","In Q1, we drove a jam-packed change agenda. We rolled out the new operating model, reorganizing the company around the first 2 pillars of the Growth Game Plan: development, where we make our brands really matter; and delivery, where we're building an execution powerhouse that delivers best-in-class results.","We restructured our Tools segment functional leadership team, merging talent from the industrial products and services with construction tools and accessories.","We announced the next round of change in finance as part of our best cost finance initiative. We created a comprehensive plan to simplify and transform the profitability of our European operations, resourcing the businesses aligned to its growth potential. Subject to the necessary consultation processes in Europe, many of these changes will take effect in late 2013.","We restructured procurement, simplifying the organization, and recruited a new leader of direct procurement from General Electric. We initiated work to find buyers for our Hardware and Teach Platform businesses. And with the movement of these businesses to discontinued operations, we have reduced the number of operating segments from 6 to 5: Commercial, Tools, Writing, Home Solutions and Baby & Parenting.","As I said, we've restructured marketing and R&D and design, reducing our people cost by almost 30%, while at the same time, recruiting new talent to blend consistency at Newell with new leadership and international perspectives.","In Q1, new marketing and design leaders have joined from Christian Dior, Electrolux and Whirlpool.","We launched Hilmor, our newest tools brand that will compete in the growing U.S. HVAC and refrigeration market. We also prepared for the launch of Sharpie Neon in the U.S., our second new line of premium-priced Sharpies, following the launch of Sharpie Metallics last fall.","We expanded further into the hand tools market in Latin America with the launch of an innovative new product, Irwin Dupla, a new double-sided hacksaw that's off to a very fast start across the region.","We created a larger independent consumer marketing insights function that will establish the insight foundations for accelerated growth, adding 50% more headcount and almost doubling our strategic research budget.","In our commitment to transform Newell into a design-driven company, we announced the creation of a new design center that will open in 2014 and house almost all of our industrial and graphic designers in a new creative work environment.","So we're driving the Growth Game Plan into action and, at the same time, have delivered a solid set of results.","Let me pass the baton to Doug now to unpack our Q1 performance further.","Douglas L. Martin","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone.","Before I dive into the results, I'll remind you as Mike did, that effective in Q1, we reclassified the company's Hardware and Teach Platform businesses into discontinued operations. These include Bulldog, SHUR-LINE, Ashland, Amerock, the drapery hardware business within the Home Solutions segment and Mimio. The results of operations of these are reported as discontinued operations in the company's financial statements.","In addition to a small profit in the quarter on these businesses, we recorded a $10 million impairment on the Teach business. The remaining businesses in the specialty segment, namely Dymo Office and Endicia, have become part of the Writing segment, and the results our consolidated within. The former specialty segment has been eliminated.","These stated quarterly results for 2012 and 2011 have been posted on the company's website in the Quarterly Earnings section of the Investor Relations site.","Now turning more specifically to the numbers.","Newell reported net sales for the quarter of $1.24 billion, an 80 basis point decline versus prior year.","Core sales, which exclude the impact of unfavorable foreign currency, increased 20 basis points.","Recall also that last year's first quarter included approximately $28 million of sales related to our EMEA SAP go-live that were pulled forward from the second quarter.","First quarter sales grew 2.5% if we adjust last year for the impact of that pull forward.","Our company-wide gross margin was 38.2% in Q1, an 80 basis point year-over-year decline. Incremental investments in customer programming and the favorable impact of last year's SAP pull forward drove the decline. Input cost inflation was offset by productivity.","For the full year, we continue to expect year-over-year expansion in gross margin.","Normalized SG&A expense decreased $8 million to last year, declining 40 basis points to 27% of sales. Renewal savings enabled us to focus strategic investment behind marketing news in Tools, Commercial Products and Baby.","We expect to continue to accelerate strategic spending behind our brands sequentially as we progress through 2013.","Reported first quarter operating margin was 7.9% compared with 9.9% in the prior year. On a normalized basis, Q1 operating margin was 11.2%, a 40 basis point decrease from the prior year, reflecting the absence of approximately $13 million in SAP timing-related benefits, partially offset by cost savings from Project Renewal.","Interest expense was $14.6 million, a 28% reduction from 2012 due to the work that we did last year to strengthen our balance sheet.","Our normalized tax rate was 16.5%, attributable to onetime favorable discrete period net benefits of approximately $8 million to record net international deferred tax assets.","Other expense in the quarter reflects the devaluation of the bolivar in Venezuela. Now because Venezuela is a hyperinflationary country for accounting purposes renewal, the initial devaluation impact of approximately $11 million is recorded below operating income and other expense rather than in the equity section.","First quarter reported earnings per share were $0.19 compared with $0.27 in the prior period. Normalized earnings per share, which exclude restructuring and restructuring-related costs and discontinued operations were $0.35, a 9.4% increase from a year ago.","This improvement was largely attributable to the more favorable tax rate. Last year's normalized earnings per share also included approximately $0.03 of SAP-related benefit. So the underlying normalized earnings per share growth rate excluding both the 2013 tax benefit and the 2012 SAP benefit is about $0.03 or around 10%.","In the first quarter, we've used operating cash of $123.1 million, and this compares with the use of $47.4 million in the prior year. The change was driven primarily by a voluntary pension plan contribution we made this year in the amount of $100 million. In last year's first quarter, the pension contribution was $25 million. We also returned $78.3 million to shareholders in the quarter in the form of $44.5 million in dividends and $33.8 million for the repurchase of 1.4 million shares. Program to date, the company has repurchased 9.7 million shares at an average price of $17.65 for a total of $171.4 million.","Turning now to a little more detail on the segments. Reported net sales in our Commercial Products segment grew 4.4%. Core sales rose 4.9%, and core sales excluding last year's SAP benefit grew 6.1%. Commercial Products sales were strong in North America, driven by healthy order rates across most products and customers.","In the U.S., our health care platform continued its double-digit core growth, driven by new innovation like our new CareLink mobile nurse station. Latin America also grew double digits as sales force and local manufacturing investments continue to drive growth.","Recall that sales force capability investments were part of where we decided to make some renewal investments last year, and those investments are yielding growth dividends. Operating margin for this segment was 11.8%, up 120 basis points due to structural cost reductions, partially offset by increased investment in emerging markets.","The Tools segment delivered a reported sales decline of 1%. Core sales grew 70 basis points, and core sales excluding SAP were 5.1%. This strong underlying performance was driven by double-digit growth in Latin America where we have invested heavily in selling systems and new products like the recent launch of Irwin Dupla, our new double-sided hacksaw. Normalized operating margin in Tools declined 520 basis points to 9.9% as a result of heavy investment behind the launch of Irwin Dupla in Latin America and Hilmor in North America, increased selling investment in Latin America and input cost inflation that was not fully covered by productivity and pricing in the quarter.","In our Writing segment, first quarter reported sales fell 9.3%. Core sales decreased 8.5%, and core sales excluding the SAP benefit declined 4.5%. We faced a tough comp as we lapped the launch of both Parker Ingenuity in Asia and Paper Mate InkJoy in the prior year period. Fine Writing sales were also negatively impacted by continued macro challenges in Europe and a slowdown in Asia as we transition our distribution model in China to better align inventory levels with consumer POS. Our weaker performance was accomplished by sluggish markets -- was compounded rather by sluggish markets in the U.S. office superstore channel.","We have a very strong set of Writing marketing plans for the balance of 2013, with year 2 innovation and launch support on Paper Mate InkJoy. Solid programming behind Parker's 125th anniversary, year 2 support on Sharpie Metallics, strengthened back-to-school merchandising plans and the 2013 back-to-school launch of Sharpie Neon. And as the category leader in the U.S., we plan to spend on writing brand at historically high levels in the back-to-school time frame, despite the uncertain channel dynamics, in order to strengthen our leadership share positions and jump-start market growth in the category. First quarter normalized operating margin in the Writing segment was 18.6%, up 90 basis points due to improved gross margins driven by productivity and planned SG&A reductions as compared with last year's InkJoy launch.","Our Baby segment also delivered strong results, despite having to lap double-digit growth in the prior period. Reported sales growth was 4.1%. Core sales growth was 6.4%, and excluding SAP, core sales growth was 7.9%. Again, the formula for success has been winning innovation and strengthened customer partnerships. In the first quarter of 2013, we significantly increased distribution behind Graco new items in the U.S. and Europe, and our Baby team was recognized by our largest Baby customer as the 2012 global vendor of the year and by our second-largest Baby customer as category captain. In Japan, Aprica also grew nicely, driven by increased promotional activity and new products at retail. Baby's Q1 normalized operating margin was 12.6%, up 30 basis points to last year.","The Home Solutions segment, which was a drag on the growth rate in 2012, turned positive in Q1 behind very good execution in the U.S. of the first of 5 merchandising scale events on Rubbermaid and steady progress on our D\u00e9cor blinds business. The Home Solutions' reported sales growth was 3.7%, and core sales growth was 3.9%. The D\u00e9cor business, which was down low single digits last year, is starting to stabilize but still has a ways to go to become a growth contributor. Home Solutions' first quarter normalized operating margin was 10.1%, a 60 basis point improvement versus the prior year, reflecting higher sales volume and the benefit of Project Renewal savings.","Looking at Q1 sales by geography, North American core sales grew 2.5% by strong performances in Commercial Products, Baby & Parenting and Home Solutions. In EMEA, core sales fell 17.2% versus last year's results, which included the SAP pull forward. Excluding that $28 million benefit in 2012, core sales declined 3.5%, which reflects ongoing macro challenges in Western Europe and is consistent with our expectations and what we experienced last year.","In Latin America, core sales grew a very strong 28.6%, with strong growth across all of our businesses.","In Asia Pacific, core sales fell by 5.3%, due largely to the previously discussed step back in Fine Writing in China, partially offset by continued growth in Aprica and Fine Writing in Japan.","The emerging markets' growth rate was slightly below last year's low double-digit rate as the acceleration in Latin America was partially offset by declines in China as a result of our decision to reset our route-to-market model in China on Fine Writing.","Our developed world core sales growth adjusted for SAP was nearly 2%, driven by good growth in the United States of nearly 3%. We've also made very good progress on the first phase of Project Renewal. Through the end of Q1, we've realized $80 million of savings and are on track to capture $90 million to $100 million in cumulative savings by our target date of Q2 2013. The second phase of Project Renewal is expected to generate an incremental annualized cost savings of $180 million to $225 million by the middle of 2015.","We expect the benefits of Phase 2 to start flowing through in a meaningful way by the second and third quarters of this year. And we intend for the majority of these savings to be invested back into strategic SG&A, such as sales force, advertising and promotion, product development, consumer research and capability building to drive acceleration of core sales growth in our priority segments and markets.","In summary, we are pleased with our Q1 results and our continued progress in driving the Growth Game Plan into action. Mike?","Michael B. Polk","Thanks, Doug. Now just a few words in the businesses we plan to sell. Our Hardware and Teach Platform businesses are good businesses run by talented people with a lot of potential to benefit from the inevitable economic recovery, especially in housing. They have a lot of heritage with our company, and the people, the brands and their history with Newell will be missed. But the businesses are not core to our strategy and, as a consequence, have not gotten the strategic focus they deserve. In my experience, noncore assets almost always perform better in the hands of focused owners. Focused owners invest more in these businesses to build them because they are, in fact, strategic to them. We believe the current market conditions are right, so we've decided to exit now.","Over the last 3 years, our continuing business grew core sales about 60 basis points faster than Newell did with the planned divestitures included. We had nearly a 40-basis-point higher normalized operating income margin, and we grew normalized operating income about 110 basis points faster. So with a more focused portfolio, Newell Rubbermaid becomes a faster growing, higher-margin business.","Restated 2012 results for the movement of our Hardware and Teach Platform businesses to discontinued operations are as follows: Newell Rubbermaid's 2012 net sales were $5.58 billion, normalized operating income margin was 13%, normalized earnings per share was $1.67.","In 2013, we intend to fully cover the lost impact of the disc ops businesses.","The normalized EPS over delivery of $0.03 in Q1 2013 will help us cover the nearly $0.04 of lost earnings associated with the Hardware and Teach Platform businesses.","We have a line of sight to accelerated Project Renewal savings that will enable us to fully cover the lost earnings flow and strip out any retained costs so that we stay on our EPS glide path in 2013 and 2014. We're confident we can do this without compromising our Growth Game Plan drive to increase brand support for accelerated growth on our priority businesses and in our priority markets.","So let's now turn to our 2013 outlook. As a result of these changes, we're reaffirming our 2013 full year guidance against the restated 2012 base as follows: core sales growth of 2% to 4%, this is unchanged versus prior guidance; normalized operating income margin expansion up to 20 basis points, this is unchanged versus prior guidance; normalized EPS of $1.78 to $1.84, this is unchanged versus prior guidance but now represents normalized EPS growth of 7% to 10% above our restated 2012 normalized EPS of $1.67; operating cash flow of $575 million to $625 million, this is unchanged versus prior guidance.","There are 2 key factors that could influence our delivery on full year guidance in 2013. First, our delivery of the Project Renewal savings. Second, the performance of our Writing segment. On savings, we're making progress, but still have a lot to do. Our focus is on the 5 work streams associated with Phase 2 of Project Renewal announced in Q4 2012. We have projects initiated in all 5 work streams, and as Doug said, we will deliver the 2013 savings on time and in full. We also have a good pipeline of savings we can accelerate that will help cover the lost earnings cash flow associated with our planned divestitures.","The savings associated with Phase 2 of Project Renewal are backloaded in 2013 and, as such, the benefits to the P&L will accelerate from mid-Q2 forward. We will also have choices to make about how much of the savings flow to brand support and how much falls to normalized EPS. Our dominant logic is that the brands need more support than they have today. Our ability to accelerate growth is contingent on increasing brand support, and we have not made enough progress here yet. The good news is we have clear line of sight to the savings, and I'm confident we have the risks of delivery reasonably well balanced.","The second key factor that could influence where we land in our guidance range is the performance of our Writing business. As expected, Writing had a weaker start to the year as we lap the Paper Mate InkJoy and Parker Ingenuity launches, and we took the choice to reset our route-to-market approach on Fine Writing in China.","As Doug mentioned, our Writing plans in the balance of the year are strong. We have terrific momentum in Latin America with strong double-digit growth in Q1, which we expect to continue through the year. In the U.S., we're staged for more back-to-school display in merchandising this year than last.","We have heavy marketing support planned in Q3 behind a good flow of innovation with year 2 of InkJoy, Sharpie Metallics and the launch of Sharpie Neon. And we plan to extend the shoulders of the season into October and November with new consumer-facing programs. So we feel good about our brands and the ideas we're bringing to market despite this sluggish start and the tough market conditions.","Within Writing, there are 3 factors that could influence the flow of overall Newell results in 2013. First, the timing of our Fine Writing recovery in China. Second, the timing of U.S. back-to-school shipments. Third, the timing of the consolidation of the U.S. office superstore channel and the resulting retailer inventory liquidation.","On Fine Writing in China, we expect to get back to growth in the second half of 2013. We have more work to do in Q2, but we intend to play for the long term, accept the negative growth in Q2 and see the Fine Writing reset all the way through.","Predicting back-to-school selling timing is more art than science, as you know. We do know that many U.S. retailers have said they will not take inventory into their systems until the fourth -- July 4 merchandising has largely moved through their stores. This year, July 4 falls on a Thursday, so more shipments may slip from the last week of June into the first week of July.","Finally, the consolidation of the U.S. office superstore channel is likely to be an overhang on the U.S. Writing business for some time to come. We expect a pretty significant liquidation of retailer inventory to occur shortly after the Office Depot and OfficeMax deal closes. We intend to proactively manage down inventories after the back-to-school merchandising window so that we're not long with them prior to their deal closing.","This planning approach will help us avoid tough conversations and expensive discounting as they consolidate distribution networks.","This certainly means a less significant back-to-school replenishment season for us in September than last year but likely a better consumption-driven selling flow in early Q4.","Our total company outlook assumes a no to slow growth year in 2013 on the Writing segment and then a return to greater growth in 2014.","While we have all of this factored into our full year guidance and our internal quarterly forecast, based on looking at the quarterly consensus, I'm pretty sure that some of you don't have these shifts properly factored in. There are few things to keep in mind as you revisit your models. Our normalized EPS will experience $0.01 of dilution per quarter in the remaining quarters given the movement of the Hardware and Teach Platform businesses to discontinued operations. Versus last year, a higher proportion of U.S. back-to-school sell-in will occur in Q3 rather than Q2. However, the September replenishment activity in Q3 will be weaker than a year ago, washing out some of the revenue upside in Q3.","Additionally, we will spend significantly more in marketing in Q3 on Writing than we did a year ago, so revenue may not flow to earnings in the way it typically does on Writing in Q3.","Finally, our renewal savings accelerate through the year, with the largest year-over-year impact in Q4. That should influence your thinking on earnings flow perhaps a little more than it does to date.","While we don't provide quarterly guidance, my view in all of this is that the normalized EPS will be much more evenly distributed across the remaining 3 quarters of the year than it has been in past years.","We continue to believe the middle of our full year guidance range is the best estimate for our 2013 delivery, with the first steps slower than the second in momentum building through the year. And this is consistent with what we said in January. The line of sight we have to savings through Project Renewal makes the high side of our normalized EPS range certainly possible, but the probability is moderated by the choices we're making on the Writing business and our drive to increase brand investment for accelerated performance.","So let me close by saying we're pleased with the start of the year. There's no doubt this is a time of great change at Newell, and it will take change of this nature to recast the future of our company.","My new leadership team is on board and set to make the new operating model work. We're driving a more consistent cadence of delivery while simultaneously driving change, and we recognize that neither the delivery nor the change has come easily, particularly in this economy. I have no delusions about where we stand today and how much more work is left to be done. Our confidence is strengthened by the fact that we are asking a lot of our employees and they're rising to this challenge. They're embracing the changes we're making far better than I had hoped and that, along with good performance, gives us permission to change further and faster.","I hope you see through our track record that we're committed to building a stronger company while also creating value for all of our constituents. You saw it last year with good results and strong returns, and you'll continue to see it in what we achieve in 2013. We're all committed to making our Newell Rubbermaid a larger, fast-growing, more global, more profitable company.","With that, let me open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Maybe just to go back to the divestitures, and since this is kind of disparate businesses between Teach and Hardware, is this kind of a clean sweep throughout the business of a once-and-done, or will you continue to look at other aspect and potentially sell things here and there?","Michael B. Polk","Yes, let me make sure we're clear. We've got 2 separate processes working on the Teach Platform and the Hardware Platform, because obviously, those businesses don't work together. Obviously, Hardware has the opportunity to participate in what will eventually be a resurgent economy, and Teach also benefits from that as school budgets and municipality budgets improve. But they are separate processes. I've said all along, if you recall back, all the way back to the Back-to-School Conference in 2011, I said there were about $300 million worth of business that didn't fit within our portfolio and wasn't really connected to our core strategies. And what you see today is the outcome of that observation. We're going to work hard to strengthen our portfolio over time. Obviously, our energy is focused on our organic performance. So I think this is, for now, the right set of steps to take to strengthen the portfolio. It makes the company faster-growing and higher-margin and more focused. And while I wouldn't rule out in the future us either feeding the portfolio and doing some more weeding, I think that, that's not on the agenda in the very near term. So our focus is on strengthening the agenda, driving the Growth Game Plan, strengthening our organic performance, driving the Growth Game Plan into action and building the capabilities that we've talked about building over the last number of months.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And to just follow up on the Writing instruments, historically, you haven't had that much of a correlation with what's going on in the office market, can you maybe give us some more color of are you expecting half of the store base between OfficeMax and Office Depot to close or are you just seeing worrisome trends or what are you seeing where that's correlating a little bit more?","Michael B. Polk","Well, we don't see anything at this point because their deal is not done. And I think they're going to be drawn out into the second half of the year, as best I can tell. You've seen their reported results and you've seen some of our competitors who reported last week in Writing talk to the channel dynamics. I mean, I think their general assessment of the channel dynamics are accurate. We have the benefit of stronger brands and good marketing and innovation plans in place but certainly feel the effects of that in our numbers. I think as back-to-school -- the back-to-school window kicks in, we'll see some of that strengthen. As our spending increases on the brands, as the category leader in the U.S., we have a responsibility to drive category growth. And you'll see us do that, as Doug and I mentioned, in Q3. But I think it's going to be a tough year for the U.S. super store channel. Now with respect to what happens post the closure of the deal, we can only speculate, obviously. The thing that we want to make sure we do from a planning perspective is not put our head in the sand with respect to what I would do if I were in their shoes. And you bring 2 companies together, you likely would go after the distribution network efficiencies. And with respect to store locations close to each other, you're not going to have redundancies there. So there is going to be, as I said in CAGNY and on the prior call, there's going to be probably a 90- to 120-day period where they're going to go through the rationalization that you need to go through to deliver your synergies. And that will affect all of us in the market. And all I'm saying to you today is that we're going to plan for that, we're not going to have that happen to us. Because you can get into all kinds of inefficient discussions if you don't go proactive. And so the reason there's a governor on our growth on the full year in Writing is in part related to that and in part related to the fact that we're not going to replicate the pipeline fill associated with the launch of InkJoy and Ingenuity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see what you thought the impact of weather was in the quarter. You did adjust for the pull forward last year, but I know last year, obviously, you did benefit a little bit as well from the early onset of spring. So I'm curious if you guys have quantified what the impact might have been year-over-year.","Michael B. Polk","Joe, I didn't ask the team to sort of figure that out. I asked the team to spend their time focusing on how to deal with it in this year's performance. Clearly, last year in the U.S., you all recall that the right half of the country benefited from the warm spring and everybody benefited from that, all the home centers and we did. You can't do anything about the weather. I used to run an ice cream business and a ready-to-drink tea business, and you really could get screwed up with weather challenges. But you can't do anything about it, so you have to overcome it. What I'm really pleased about in the first quarter is that our Commercial business delivered 6.1% growth adjusted for SAP and the Tools business delivered 5.1% growth adjusted for SAP, and that's well ahead of sort of my midpoint plan for the quarter. Writing, a little bit worse on the office channel challenges. And based on what I've seen our peer companies report, it's generally better than what others have reported. So it just speaks to the underlying momentum and the good leadership that my Tools and Commercial team delivered.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. Just moving to the tax benefit, $0.03 in the quarter. Did you guys know about that early on in the quarter and adjust your spending to that, or was that a late quarter surprise?","Michael B. Polk","I'll let Doug handle.","Douglas L. Martin","Yes, I wouldn't say it was a surprise, Joe. It's something that we -- it's one of the period type tax adjustments that are required to be made by companies like ours. We did have some visibility to it as we got to the middle part of the quarter, and as Mike said, we'll use that to help above-the-line activities through the rest of the year.","Michael B. Polk","Yes, let me build on that. We definitely did not use it to fund incremental investment like we did in Q4. If you'll recall, we had some below-the-line benefits in Q4 that helped us deal with gross margin challenges in that window and still keep spending up. We went through a fundamental change in our marketing and R&D and design organization in the first quarter. I mentioned the fact that 30% of our people costs are going to come out of that area. And in the context of that, with new leadership, a new org design and people moving roles, there was no way I was going to spend a lot of money in the first quarter, in part because a number of jobs changed for the key people that control that spend. And so we pulled way back in the first quarter. So I'm actually quite pleased with the core sales results in that context. We're going to spend it back, obviously, I mentioned, in Q3 on the Writing business so that we really play for a good pull through consumption period. But no, you wouldn't see big spending in Q1 this year. And against last year, that was up against the InkJoy launch in North America. So the year-over-year comparisons are quite meaningful, which is how in the context of an 80-basis-point gross margin decline, you get 40 basis points of normalized operating income margin benefit adjusted for SAP. So the answer -- the short answer to your question is no, we didn't take the tax and spend it. We're holding the tax as a benefit against the dilution effect associated with Hardware and Teach. And then, obviously, that helps you in the short term. We got to do the cost work to sustain that benefit into '14, and that's why I say we'll accelerate renewal savings as fast as we can so that when we get out of this fiscal year, we got a run rate that allows us to stay on the 2014 glide path, the EPS glide path that we've been on.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just one last one. On that '14 glide path, what's the use of proceeds that you expect for the divested businesses?","Michael B. Polk","Well, we don't know what the proceeds will be yet. So until I know what the proceeds will be, I think I'll hold off on answering that question, but there's obviously a number of different things that we can do. And you can see through our behaviors over time that we strike the right balance between managing our capital structure and doing shareholder-friendly things.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I just want to try to understand a little better the growth rates x SAP and particularly Baby, Tools and Commercial. And, I guess, the context I'm looking for is that you guys just said you probably didn't go heavy up on marketing this quarter. You probably pulled a little back. What's the sustainability of those growth rates and can you tie in, I guess, the investments you've made so far on the savings that you've generated as to why or why not these growth rates where they are today, the 4.9 in Commercial, the 6 -- or the 7.9 in Baby & Parenting. How sustainable those are?","Michael B. Polk","Look, like I said, I'm pleased with that. You'll remember, last year, we've made a significant investment in sales force using the Project Renewal savings focused on Commercial and on Tools. And the benefit of those choices, remember, it's in the emerging markets, particularly in Latin America. The benefits of those choices don't play out immediately. You have to hire the people, you got to train the people, and we're starting to see that really play out in both businesses, particularly on Tools. Commercial Products had a great innovation quarter, the CareLink nurse station is a big innovation in the health care vertical that Commercial owns. And we've also invested in North American sales force in Commercial that's yielding the right dividends -- growth dividends. So I think you're actually seeing the choices we made last year play out. Combination of innovation, strength and selling and absent of a real big step-up in brand support from an advertising or promotion standpoint. That's a pretty good outcome. On Baby, I just got to say that Kristie and her team, both the development and delivery side of that business and our supply partner are doing an amazing job. The CDO is part of that as well, the Customer Development Organization is part of that as well. We're really firing on all cylinders now in our Baby business. And it's a combination of excellent innovation and a strong supply network and relationship and a real investment in strengthened dialogues and seniority of our selling organization in connection to our key business partners. And so we're winning share in North America. We continue to win share in Japan. The gratifying thing to see in the first quarter is that in Europe, we see some stabilization in Baby. So it's very good progress. And I'm pleased with it, and I'm really pleased about the impact that the changes we made in leadership in that team are having. It takes 18 months to 2 years to kind of get things like this to really turn. And this was a broken business in early 2011. And I think it's very gratifying to see where we are today. I maintain a level of constructive dissatisfaction on everything that we're involved with. So I don't tell the Baby people as much as I should about how I feel about them because I don't want them to get complacent, but the reality is we made a good run. Now we've got a lot more to do in Baby and we have a lot more opportunity, and we want to sustain this momentum going forward. And I think you can look forward a couple of months and feel very, very good about it. We see the POS responding to the innovation and the greater strategic dialogue that we're having with our key customers. And I hope we're able to sustain that. We want to keep the pressure on ourselves to do just that.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I guess what are the bogeys that, that business has to hit for you to want to allocate more investment dollars? Is the picture getting any clear?","Michael B. Polk","Look, our strategic priorities are quite clear, Commercial Products, Tools and Writing. Creating a little bit more coherence in our Home Solutions business, but it's a big business for us. We've got to keep that business healthy so that it can spin off the cash and profit that we need to invest to deliver our ambition on Commercial Products, Tools and Writing. And I think the thing we have to ask our Writing -- our Baby team to do is to continue to do what they're doing, which is be very, very sparse in terms of the way they invest their money and managing it as if they owned it because we've got too many other priorities in the other places that offer more strategic value to us long term. What I like about our new portfolio is it's much more focused. So I won't rule out some money flowing to Baby, but I think it's going to really be a story that's built on innovation, which we're obviously really funding, and strong sales leadership and insight to drive conversion at the point of availability. And that'll be the story on Baby going forward. I can't -- there's no -- once you set your strategic priorities, I'm not one for going back and revisiting them. We got a 5-year plan, 5-year framework. We'll continue to do what we need to do to make sure we're creating value in Baby. So we're going to focus on profitability and focus on growth, and we can do it with the resources we have. Obviously, we've shown that. We need to sustain that going forward. And I don't think it's a double-down moment for Baby. If we can deliver mid-single digits, low to mid single-digit growth in that business for the foreseeable future, we will create a ton of value for our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Couple of questions. What percentage of writing instrument sales do Office Depot and OfficeMax represent, ballpark?","Michael B. Polk","We haven't given that number out. I'm reluctant to do that, Connie. I'll just say that one of them is in our top 10 in North America and one of them is not.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. On the discontinued operations...","Michael B. Polk","Connie, that was total Newell I just gave you, not Writing. Of course, they're in our top 5 in Writing.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","On the discontinued ops, what's the magnitude of stranded overhead do you think?","Douglas L. Martin","Yes, Connie, we have stranded overhead in the $0.05 to $0.06 range on a full year annualized basis in those businesses that we've identified and are building plans around to take out. Now some of that is, as you know, there's some art and science in allocating cost across our businesses so it may be -- it could be a little better or it could be a little worse, but in that range.","Michael B. Polk","And obviously, Connie, we don't have to deal with that until we sell these assets. And they will likely be a shared services arrangement in place for a period of time after that. So when I talk about accelerating renewal costs, we need that to cover the dilution effect. We also need it to cover the retained cost impact. And my comments in the commentary contemplated that. So when I talk about maintaining our glide path in '13 and in '14, it's in the context of both the earnings dilution and in the context of our need to cover the retained costs.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then one final question, the trend in your sales in Asia Pacific. So it looks -- I don't know what's been restated. I don't know if my model is up-to-date right now given everything you reported this morning. But it sort of looks like on a core basis, Asia Pacific sales declined in Q1 on top of the decline last year. And I guess in the context, what exactly do you mean by resetting the route-to-market model in China? And what's going on in the Fine Writing business there? And how does it all tie in to the weakness we're seeing in Asia Pac?","Michael B. Polk","Yes, so let me address that. So we continue to have challenges in Australia and New Zealand, which for us is a big part of Asia Pacific. We didn't really call that out, but I'll share that with you. Bill and his team were in Melbourne this week to sort through that, so we'll talk next week when he gets back and we'll figure out what we need to do to get that performance strengthened. It's been a prolonged issue. And we're all -- we all need to address that now. That's probably 20%, 30% of the issue in Asia. The other piece of it though is the choice we're making to reset the Fine Writing route-to-market in China. There's a piece of that, that has to do with us getting more balanced in the way we manage our inventories between distributors and retailer -- and the retail environment. And we made the choice in Q4, when Bill picked up responsibility for the business to change the way we move product through our business model and through the distributors to the retailers. And that's impacted our growth in China on Fine Writing in the first quarter. Fine Writing in China, despite last year's sellout being up 32%, the first quarter was down double digits versus prior year in China. And that was big, and that's certainly big enough to have more than the Australia and New Zealand impact. And we expect that will continue to play forward into Q2. The other piece of the puzzle though is that as the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in China develop and department stores open in those cities, like the ones that had opened in Tier 1 cities, we need to change our route-to-market in those cities because what we've had up until now is a 2-tiered distribution model, effectively a model where you push inventory out in a lot of small outlets that carry your products in those cities. As those cities get wealthier and as development moves from the coastline in, we need to apply the same model that we've got in the Tier 1 cities to those cities, which means pulling back on the multilevel distribution model and establishing a distributor retail to department store model. And that's what we're on and about doing, which obviously has an impact on sell-in and inventories. And we want to set the stage for the future in China through both actions. We have some rebalancing to do on inventory in the environment we're in, in the Tier 1 cities, and we have a job to do to reset our route-to-market in the Tier 2 cities. And those 2 things, Australia and New Zealand and that activity are the most meaningful contributors in APAC. And I suspect we'll continue to experience that. The other thing I'd say is more of a strategic comment. Our priority is in Latin America. We've said when we talked about extending our borders that we are going to focus first on Latin America and next on Asia. So I use the language, first South then East. And so you see that playing out in our growth rates in Latin America in the first quarter. If you look at the core sales growth in the first quarter, I think you have access to this, it's nearly 30%, I think -- so it's a very big number. And while I don't believe we'll sustain that rate, we're going to be strong double digits up in Latin America this year across the total portfolio. I want to get Latin America scaled first before we play hard for Asia. We're doing the thinking work in Asia today. We're taking choices like resetting the network to set the stage for the future, but APAC emerging won't be the big priority this year that it will become in '14 and '15.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Rubbermaid Home, this is the first time I can remember when it actually grew. Is that the beginning of a trend? And I know that business is surprisingly related to housing starts and the robust housing economy. So do you think those trends should continue? Then I have a couple follow-ups.","Michael B. Polk","Yes, I mean, we're pleased, obviously. The biggest piece of news is probably the one that won't get a lot of coverage in our results, which is Home growing nearly 4%. So Jeff Hohler and his whole team should feel terrific about that, and all the folks in development supporting that agenda. What's changed there is Rubbermaid Consumer. We've gone through the process of assessing what the real drivers of growth can be in that business, and which we weren't doing enough to put our brands and our products, particularly in food and beverage, in front of the consumer, interrupting the shopping experience or the brand experience around those key holidays where food is central to. So Super Bowl, Easter. We look forward to July 4 and then back-to-school where the pantry changes over and then certainly around Thanksgiving. These are all wonderful moments for us to be pushing our product to the floor, out of the aisle and interrupting the shopping experience with our Rubbermaid Consumer food storage and beverage products. And so you see that coming to life in the first quarter with the first-ever Super Bowl program. We call these 5 merchandising windows the furious 5, and there was only 1 last year, which was Thanksgiving. And so we've retooled how we go to market in the U.S. in Rubbermaid to focus on really giving our customers, shoppers, a brand experience in store around those events, and it really worked in Q1. So we're very pleased about that.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And does that continue, do you think?","Michael B. Polk","Well, I think it should, if we can replicate it. Because we didn't decide to do it until pretty late in last year. Mark and the team, in partnership with Jeff, made the judgment around October to try to play for this idea. And so we didn't have as broad a set of customer participation in the Super Bowl event as I think we will next year. And I think this will strengthen as we go forward, the depth of participation. So I'm really bullish about that, on Rubbermaid. I think there's more opportunity within Jeff's portfolio because we sort of got different businesses performing in different ways. And so, obviously, the biggest one to focus on was the biggest business, which is Rubbermaid Consumer brand. The other thing we've got going on is you see some stabilization in our blinds business. So you heard Doug in his comments say that versus last year, our D\u00e9cor business was only down 1.5 -- what did you say, low single digits?","Douglas L. Martin","That business is up.","Michael B. Polk","Well, there you go, up 1.5%. So that's a big turnaround in terms of the absence of a negative. Now do I think we sustain it there? I don't know. That one is one that's going to be a little bit more volatile. We have to see what happens with J.C. Penney. They're headed in -- they obviously are making lots of different changes right now. Some of which, we think, are positive for us. Some of which are uncertain for us. But that certainly will not be the huge negative that it was last year. So that bodes well. And we've got to work hard on Goody and on Calphalon to make them growth contributors and do it without spending big money. These are Win Where We Are businesses. So that means they don't get the first call on resources. You have to think about -- I've said this before, Win Where We Are means win differently. An example of winning differently is doing what we did on Rubbermaid Consumer this year with the furious 5. And so we need to really unpack these businesses, break them down to their core and build them back up in a way that allows them to grow without big investment. And that's what we're doing. We kind of hope that we're able to sustain this level of performance. I think we'll be certainly stronger than we were a year ago.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the gross margins trajectory, I think you always said that we were kind of in a pricing lull in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So is pricing going to start to come through? And should we see that sort of translate into some gross margin growth?","Michael B. Polk","I'll give you some personal reflections on my leadership, and then I'll let Doug answer the question on pricing. I think I made a mistake last year by aiming off on pricing in the late September, early October window as commodities started breaking. I should have been stronger from a leadership perspective and held what were pricing actions that we had planned, I should have held those pricing actions in place. And we've paid the price from a gross margin perspective in Q4 and, to a lesser degree, Q1. And we have taken pricing starting late Q1 that will start to contribute to the business going forward. But that one's on me. I should have not flinched as the commodities broke and tried to encourage our CEO to sell those things all the way through because it hurt us.","Douglas L. Martin","Bill, what I would say on the margin is you're right. I think the -- and as Mike says, we're beginning to take price in some areas and in some parts of our portfolio, in some parts of our world. And you'll see that begin to come through. But what you'll really see, I think, and you will continue to see gross margin expansion from us, and it will increase through the year. And it's going to be driven by productivity in addition to pricing. And Meri, as you know, joined us in December, and she's been working through plans and finding some early opportunities to accelerate some productivity wins. And we're also, recall, executing on our 5 Ways to $50m of productivity savings, some of which hits gross margin in the second, and part of which hits this year.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's really helpful. So if you also look at the Tools business, big margin contraction and way below our model and, I think, what The Street was looking for. I mean, did that have to do with pricing or timing or kind of what drove that? And does that continue also?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So there's a couple of things. When you look at normalized operating margin, you have 2 big launches, in Hilmor and Irwin Dupla in Latin America, but that's one of those businesses where we should, particularly on the Irwin brand, we should have priced in September and we aimed off. And so that was a -- that turns out to have been a mistake. It recovers steadily through the year. So you have the combination of sales force, you have the investments, you have the combination of 2 launches in Q1 up against weaker gross margins than we would like. They will recover certainly more substantially in the second half of the year than in Q2, but we just didn't have pricing against inflation the way we should have.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And then just one last sort of housekeeping item, more like a modeling question, but it seems that just addition by subtraction, you kind of get to 20 basis points of EBIT margin expansion. So does that mean like the base business x divestitures kind of would've been flat from an operating margin perspective?","Michael B. Polk","Yes, we haven't -- I'm going to defer on giving you the specific answer to that, Bill, but Nancy will follow up with you and try to give you the answer. I think that x SAP, we probably still would have been up or near flat. I think up slightly, though. And what happens with our operating income margin this year is going to be a function of what we spend. I mean, that's basically how the story is going to play out. Because we'll get gross margin back on track. In fact, gross margin, I'm sure, will be up versus prior year. We've said we want that to happen every year. And our outlook is for that to happen again this year. So our income margin is going to be a function of spending more than anything else, and I think that would have been true had we held the disc ops businesses in the mix or not.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And would that spending be a lot more media-related now? I mean like historically -- or not historically, but last year was much more sort of sales force and capability driven it looks like.","Michael B. Polk","When I talk about -- we may do a little bit more sales force work, and we will certainly invest in capabilities like consumer marketing insight and we need stronger -- we just recruited an excellent category management thought leader from the industry to lead the development of our category management capabilities with customers, and we're investing in shopper marketing capabilities. But when I talk about investments going forward, I'm largely talking about brand support. And we got to figure out a way to break apart strategic SG&A for you because -- which is reasonably easy for us to do. I just don't want to confuse people at this point. But strategic SG&A is where our people costs are from marketing and R&D, and as we go down on people cost, you're going to look at that and you're going to say, \"Wait a minute, you're not spending the reality for brand support standpoint, A&P standpoint,\" and we are. Now your question was, is it advertising? No, I think it won't look as a-driven as you guys probably are used to if you're covering fast food and consumer goods. So a lot of e-based communication, a lot of PR-based communication, a lot of in-store communication, but not print and television. The exception to that probably is our Writing business where I think that business responds to that type of investment. So it's horses for courses, I think you'll see an innovation and a brand communication-led change, but not through typical broad reach advertising vehicles that you would expect a fast moving consumer goods business to use, the exception being Writing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So on writing instruments, can you talk a bit about what's occurring here from a category growth perspective? And this is separate from any of the worry over merger activity. I'm just wondering if the shift to notebooks, mobile devices, et cetera, technology is having incremental pressure here on category growth, and given you feel good about your own internal plans, I was also hoping for a little more clarity on just top line growth for the business as we look at the balance of the year, as you got some internal plans to offset any of those external issues.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So look, I think the first quarter, the industry as a whole sort of had laid out some numbers. I see slightly better numbers than what I see some of our competitors having thrown out in terms of category performance, but the first quarter performance of the category in the U.S. was not positive. And I think that's in part due to our absence of marketing support connected to the InkJoy launch from prior year. So we were on television in January, we were doing big communication in that window. So I'm sure the absence of that contributes to some of the softness in the channel given the size of our business. Remember, we're a 40 share of the total writing market in the U.S. So if we're not supporting the category, the category probably is not going to grow as actively as it would otherwise grow. It was not the right window for us to spend our money in Q1 for the reasons I've stated before because our innovation and our money should support the big consumption drive windows. So we want to piggyback our investment when the category is relevant and hot for consumers, which obviously is back-to-school. And I think it can be extended to the shoulders of the season further, but we weren't spending in that window. So we are part of the issue. I think there's channel shifting also going on here, as some folks have talked about. I do not think it has anything to do with technology though. There's no linkage that I can find, believe me. That's the question, do we believe technology is superseding writing? We don't see that. And so I think it's more about activities and some channel shifting that's happening between the office superstore channel in the U.S. and other channels.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then could you give us some perspective on the housing recovery here in the U.S.? How much of a tailwind do you think it gives to your business this year and more importantly as you look out to 2014? And what are you assuming in your guidance for 2013 in that perspective?","Douglas L. Martin","Dara, we do watch that, and we see there are pockets of good news around housing and some areas where housing still is lagging. And as that picks up, it certainly can't hurt our business, but we're not necessarily directly correlated with it. A nice housing boom would be great for us, but where we're starting from is still so low relative to where we went off the cliff in housing, that we think it's going to take a little while before that has a meaningful impact on our business. But we like it.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just last, housekeeping. Did you give the tax rate for the full year you're expecting now?","Douglas L. Martin","Here's what I do on the tax rate for the full year. We've given a range of 25% to 26%, and I think somewhere within that range, you can then take that $8 million or so benefit into your numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason M. Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I apologize; I jumped in a little late. Did you guys talk about the J.C. Penney business and what's going on there and just any kind of impact? I know you're anniversary-ing the impact last year, and I think last quarter was a little bit more nebulous. Clearly, by looking at the segment results, it looks like things are better, if I infer correctly. So just first question, just if you can kind of give a little bit of an update there.","Michael B. Polk","Yes, so I think there's still uncertainty in how JCP is going to -- how things are going to evolve with J.C. Penney. I ask this question pretty much every week of the team that's calling on them, and the headlines there is they're obviously in transition. You've seen their new advertising the last couple of days with new logo. And there -- as best we can tell, they're slowing down their rate of store conversions to the new home centers. But at the same time, they're strengthening their investment in merchandising. And so they're going back to sort of the older -- the old model where prices go up but businesses are sold on a relatively deep discount. It appears that, that's the direction they're heading. I don't think -- I think all the changes going on there are going to be a net positive for us. I think we lose a little bit of opportunity connected to Culinary if they don't roll out their revised store-in-store model as aggressively as they were planning. That's sort of opportunity lost. I think Culinary is going to have an excellent year at JCP this year. And then on blinds, I think that's a business that will respond well to the new merchandising approach they're taking. However, because it's a custom blinds business, it needs the associate in the store to help sell the product. And I'm concerned that they've gone deep on their associate cuts, and that may influence the rate of recovery despite the change in merchandising. Custom blinds require somebody to help a consumer through the experience, and I worry a little bit about JCP's choice to go deep, under the prior regime, to go deep on cutting back on those associates, which may not -- may cause our business not to recover as fast as we -- you might hope with the new merchandising strategy.","Jason M. Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That makes sense. I guess, the second question I have was just thinking about your -- I hope I got the dates right, but your 2 years on the job here, and obviously, we know that there is this war chest of cost savings and that should be helped by -- even by the proceeds of the disposal down the road. If you could think about the cost of doing business, like which categories you're seeing that your expectations over the last 2 years have kind of changed that, there will be a lot more reinvestment into growing those businesses, especially in emerging markets down the road. So I was wondering if you could provide a little bit of context to how you're thinking about that.","Michael B. Polk","Look, I think the longer I've been here, the more excited I get about the possibilities for our business. We have a lot of heavy lifting to do. We've had a lot of heavy lifting to do over the last 18, 20 months, and we have probably another year, a year and a bit of work of like sort to get the company repositioned completely to be able to drive accelerated performance. So I think I would expect our work plans to look very similar and our conversations with you to be very similar as we work through what's a serious amount of cost changes that we're driving. When I look at the businesses, I come back to the portfolio roll choices we made with the Growth Game Plan, and I believe they are right. So Commercial Products, Tools and Writing is our #1 priority. Home Solutions is the fourth pillar, with an opportunity for more coherence within that portfolio, but as a -- and an opportunity to grow but to grow differently than it historically has, so with less investment. Baby, of like kind. Baby is quickly becoming another Win Where We Are business as opposed to an incubate business. It's about winning differently, and we're proving that model out, that we do not need to put big brand support behind these businesses in the traditional sense. But with innovation and good selling systems and good insights, we can drive good growth. So my formula, the algorithm, hasn't really changed at this point. We're just beginning to broaden our footprint into the emerging markets, and you see the acceleration in Latin America as evidence of that. And we have a lot more to learn about how to grow and build brands there through the experiences we will have over the next 6, 12 months. And that learning may influence some of the choices we make with respect to where to invest, in what vehicles, whether it's advertising or whether it's in-store or whether it's e-based or in what businesses. So I think here we are 20 months in, I don't -- I'm not looking at this any differently than I was at the beginning other than having greater clarity in the sense of certainty around -- and a sense of confidence around our ability to do what we said we were going to do.","Jason M. Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And here's just a last question, and hopefully I'm not putting quantification over qualification, but when you think about the guidance now, now you're saying 7% to 10% EPS growth for this year versus the numbers when you kind of pull out the discontinued businesses. And I know at CAGNY you talked about the middle of next year falling into that acceleration phase, which I think by definition is 6% to 9% EPS. So are you saying that acceleration is coming earlier, or am I just putting the numbers ahead of the actual qualifiers behind it?","Michael B. Polk","No, we're not saying the acceleration is coming early. We have a lot of work to do to get the brand budgets to where they need to be. We made a determination that we want to get this portfolio sorted, so we've got a responsibility to cover the costs associated with doing that. And that means accelerating savings, not just through renewal, but in other ways through the business to do that. So I think the way to think about our forward-looking view is that we've got a 1-year event here where we need to -- we have a responsibility to our shareholders to cover the dilution effect and the retained costs issue that creating greater clarity within our portfolio creates. But our frame of reference for the Growth Game Plan is the same, and I'd encourage you to think about it that way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Leigh Ferst with Wellington Shields.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","Could you clarify what you're saying about your leadership team? You say it's in place, but you do refer to various changes. Is it that your direct reports are in place, but there's still changes in middle management?","Michael B. Polk","The changes I was referring to are a level below my direct reports. And so we have a lot of changes going on, Leigh. And we have way more changes to drive over the coming year to 18 months, as I was saying. We put the leadership structure in place; we're now driving an organization through and into action in the company. When we talk about the marketing and R&D changes and say 30% of the costs are coming out, that's a significant change. And when we talk about Project Renewal, accelerating Project Renewal savings, that means we're going to do more cost work that involves people, structures and the like. And so while we're doing that, we're strengthening capabilities. Now my team is set, my leadership team is set, and I'm delighted, and we're really starting to kind of gain our stride. But there are more changes to be driven through the organization and they are substantial, and that's the only way the costs come out.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","And you said the market conditions are right for sale and you referred to the economy, can I assume that there's a good deal environment also in terms of more buyers being interested?","Michael B. Polk","Yes, well, I won't comment specifically on the deal because it's work-in-progress -- deals, because they are works in progress. But in the broader sense, cheap debt, lots of cash, good environment to be selling things. So -- and with the housing -- the housing starts are encouraging, but they're off a very, very low base relative to history. So there's much more upside there to be had. So for a prospective buyer that's in this business and views these assets as strategic, this is an excellent time to be buying, too, given the macro environment and the impending inevitable economic recovery and the inevitable real housing recovery. Because I think we're just sort of bouncing off the bottom at the moment. I read all the headlines, as you do Leigh, but I don't really view them as particularly credible when I look at the rate of new housing starts versus the historical numbers. They're way below still.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","It'll be interesting to watch because we've achieved cheap debt and lots of cash for a while, so it's just intriguing to see.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer period. If we were unable to get to your question, please call the Investor Relations team at (770) 418-7075. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Polk for any concluding remarks.","Michael B. Polk","I would just conclude by saying our confidence has been strengthened by the response of our employees to what is an incredible change agenda. They're embracing the changes we're making better than I expected, and along with what is good performance, I believe this gives us permission to change further and continue to press hard for the full opportunity to unlock our potential as a larger, faster-growing, more-global, more-profitable company.","So I appreciate all the questions and the feedback, and I look forward to talking to you at our next opportunity.","Operator","Thank you.

A live webcast of this call is available at ir.newellbrands.com.","I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Welcome to Newell Brands third quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Ravi Saligram, our President and CEO and Chris Peterson, our CFO.","During the course of today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management\u2019s expectations.

Good morning everybody, and welcome. I'm absolutely delighted to have joined Newell Brands and I'm excited about the company's future. In the first 30 days of my listening tour, I visited a e-commerce group, the design center, two manufacturing plants and all seven businesses, during which I've had an opportunity to review our product lines, the state of the business, as well as conduct town halls where I've addressed over a thousand employees and met with nearly 150 employees in small group settings.","Let me share my early read on the company. We have dedicated and passionate employees, who want to win. I admire their resilience. They've gone through a lot of churn in the past two years. We can maximize their potential and drive better outcomes through strong leadership, and providing clarity and stability of direction and priorities.","We have an opportunity to optimize our organizational structure to better leverage our scale, functional capabilities and provide continuity to our go-to-market approach with our top customers. We need to find the appropriate and harmonious balance between being centralized and decentralized without causing significant internal disruption.","We have an opportunity to better integrate our businesses and create a common unified go-forward bringing Newell culture. We will work hard to create an external focus, improve employee engagement, and develop aligned cohesive teams.","To this end, I will point to Steve Parsons as our new CHRO, and he joined a week after I did. Steve partnered with me in turning around OfficeMax and is skilled at leveraging human capital, and attracting top talent.","We have iconic brands with strong equity that are household names. However, several need to be refreshed and rejuvenated through timely and meaningful innovation that appeal to today's consumer. We will also work on strengthening channel management through appropriate brand segmentation. I'm excited about our foundational e-commerce capabilities at our eCommerce central excellence based in Hoboken. It is very impressive to see that our global online sales are in the very high teens as a percentage of total company sales, excluding our commercial business.","This percentage is much higher than the CPE and durables average. We also have excellent sales teams that call on retailers, and it's very satisfying to see that their efforts have driven double-digit sales growth in online sales and consumption. We do have an opportunity to improve the digital IQ of our individual businesses, and become a truly digital first company.","This will serve to build eCommerce as a towering strength and competitive advantage for the company in the long term. In conjunction with eCommerce we will also be sharpening our skills in utilizing influencers, and leveraging social this is an embryonic muscle, but a great way to stretch our media dollars especially given the more discretionary purchase patterns of our brands.","I have lived in six countries and worked across 50, and I've been President of International in two companies. With that perspective, I believe, International is a tremendous growth opportunity for Newell in the long term. Today, we do not have an integrated Newell business in any country or region. Each business has its own international footprint and with the recent exception of Canada, offices of each of our businesses are typically not even in the same city in individual countries.","Suffice it to say, our international efforts are highly fragmented. Next to the U.S. our largest country is Canada, and it has not yet achieved a half a billion dollars in sales. In fact, only eight countries outside the U.S. have sales over $200 million and one close to $100 million. But our footprint and operations extend to nearly 50 countries. We do have pockets of strength. We have an excellent Oster business in LatAm that is growing, Yankee Candle in the U.K. that's growing rapidly. A strong brand reputation for Coleman in Japan and strong Writing franchises in Europe and LatAm.","Our first step is to understand what we have in terms of resources and capabilities, prioritize drive countries and categories, and lay down the foundation for becoming a truly global company. This is a long term opportunity, and we'll need to tackle it deliberately, systematically and methodically.","Our portfolio of businesses though is a tale of two cities. It is great to see that Writing, Baby, Home Fragrance and Connected Homes are growing core sales and demonstrating good operational health. Although Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Food are currently declining, I believe these are good businesses, and with the right strategic and executional focus and driving innovation, I am confident that we'll get these businesses back on track.","Now we are challenged by two businesses; Appliances & Cookware and Outdoor & Recreation, where we've been out innovated, and these are not short term fixes. We'll do deep dives into root causes, ensure we have the right level of domain knowledge and institutional memory, get on top of consumer -- core consumer trends, sharpen our category focus and implement well thought out turnaround patterns.","I agree with the framework of the turnaround plan that Chris has articulated for you, and we'll continue to relentlessly execute against its key tenets with a high sense of urgency. It is heartening to see the progress we're making on reducing complexity in terms of SKU reduction, consolidating ERP systems, and implementing productivity programs. The improvement in the cash conversion cycle is terrific, and will continue to drive this lever to improve cash flow.","But I'll take this opportunity to congratulate Chris Peterson on his leadership not only as CFO, but as interim CEO. I appreciate his calm logical manner and rational approach to tackling problems, and I have in a short time, to respect his business judgment. I think his recommendation to the board to keep the Rubbermaid commercial products business will pay dividends in the long term.","Having worked on B2B businesses for over 20 years, I think our RCB could once again become a jewel in Newell's crown in the long term. I am pleased to let you know that Rubbermaid was admitted to Fortune's most admired company list in the 80s, and also in the top 10 list from 1985 onwards for several years. I say pleased to let you know since some of you millennials on the call, may not have been born yet in the late 80s unlike me.","In fact in 1993, Rubbermaid was number one on Fortune's most admired list, and known for its innovation. I'm confident that we will restore the business to its past glory. Let me conclude with my key near-term priorities. First, I want to complete my listening tour and meet key external constituents including customers, suppliers and investors.","Second, I want to ensure that we have the right leader and the right leadership teams in place, in each of our businesses and functions. My emphasis for beyond inspirational leadership, domain and functional expertise, teamwork and collaboration, and ability to be nimble and agile, and how the appropriate level of mental toughness given we're in a turnaround.","And last but not least, an obsessive focus on the consumer and customer. Third, continuing to align on the right level of resources to affect the company's turnaround plan and move forward with an even greater sense of urgency. I'm a cash flow junkie. And Chris and I will continue to focus on reducing our cash conversion cycle.","Significantly accelerating operating free cash flow is very critical to reducing our debt and working aggressively to achieve our target leverage ratio. Fourth, better understanding our portfolio brands, categories and channels and developing a long term plan to win and drive core sales growth.","And the fifth priority, better understanding the innovation pipeline, and taking the necessary action to accelerate new product development and designed refreshes. On the whole, I'm extremely happy with my decision to join Newell brands. I'm optimistic about our future. I want to thank all 30,000 of our employees for their warm welcome and embracing my leadership, and their hard work in 2019.","Over the coming years, we will be laser focused on driving sustainable profitable growth, accelerating cash flow to reduce debt, and systematically adding to shareholder value. I'll now turn it over to Chris, to talk about our third quarter results and the tangible progress we're making on the turnaround plan.","Chris Peterson","Thanks Ravi, and good morning everyone. The Q3 results we announced this morning reflect a strong quarter of progress. We are making decisive and strategic choices to turn the company around, and drive shareholder value. And we are encouraged with the results thus far, and the building momentum within the organization.","It's still early days, but we have a number of positive proof points to share with you today. The financial results were in line or ahead of our expectations across all key metrics. For the second consecutive quarter, four out of seven operating divisions delivered core sales growth. We made further headway on productivity and cost controls, which translated into better than anticipated margins and earnings per share. And year-to-date operating cash flow of $424 million more than doubled relative to the prior year, reflecting strong execution on working capital initiatives.","The organization is getting back into the rhythm of consistent delivery. These strong results give us the confidence to raise our full year outlook for both normalized EPS and cash flow from operations.","From a strategic perspective, we are making progress on all five pillars of the turnaround plan to position Newell brands for long term success. One of our most important strategic objectives is to return the company to sustainable and profitable sales growth. We're focused on five key themes, including launching compelling and differentiated innovation, implementing omni-channel marketing, strengthening customer relationships, driving eCommerce share gains and accelerating the international business.","We believe that retooling and upgrading our innovation and marketing approach and moving to a digital first mindset are critical to returning the company to core sales growth. This is also a key to increasing our brands relevance and ensuring that we are driving purchase intent across all channels where consumers shop.","We are revamping our innovation approach to increase our speed to market, with a focus on insights and analytics, social listening, and artificial intelligence. We've created a new process that is bringing external innovation into the company to complement internally generated ideas. We have moved away from a channel specific marketing function, toward an omni channel approach.","We started the new digital tech platform implementation this quarter with five sites currently leveraging the new technology. It will take us about six to 12 months to roll it out across the portfolio, which will significantly improve the consumer experience with our brands, while at the same time reducing complexity, driving cost savings and improving capabilities.","Although still early days, we are making strong progress on the top line; Writing, Baby, Home Fragrance and Connected Home & Security all delivered core sales growth this quarter. eCommerce sales accelerated sequentially to a double-digit growth pace with strong momentum across all divisions.","International markets grew core cells as well, although they are still punching below their weight, which presents a meaningful opportunity for growth going forward. In total, our two year stacked core sales growth improved by 450 basis points from the second quarter.","Second strategic pillar improving operating margins through productivity and overhead cost savings is also showing meaningful progress. We have more than doubled our gross margin productivity funnel since a year ago. From our beginning point of 90,000 SKUs, which excluded the RCP business, we've taken out about 18,000 SKUs to date or 20% with concrete plans in place to get to the 50% target reduction by the end of next year.","We are making good progress on moving excess and obsolete inventory too, which helps post SKU reduction efforts and working capital. We remain on track to close three manufacturing plants and 10 distribution centers by the end of 2019, simplifying our supply chain footprint.","We have a number of initiatives in flight focused on overhead cost reduction. For example, we are integrating the support functions of the Food and RCP businesses, which we believe will better enable top line growth and cost efficiency. We are centralizing and moving a meaningful portion of our consumer service function offshore. We are on track to reduce our number of consumer service locations from 65 to 6 by the end of next year.","We are on track to reduce our office footprint by about 10% by the end of next year. Additionally, we were on track to cut the number of IP applications across the company by 85% by the end of next year, as we remove redundancy and simplify.","We continue to make progress on reducing systems complexity and standardizing systems across the organization. During the third quarter, we completed the SAP conversion of Appliance & Cookware in Asia, which gets us to four completed SAP implementations in total for 2019.","Our third strategic pillar is strengthening the portfolio. We announced last quarter, that we are retaining the Rubbermaid commercial product business, and work is underway to optimize its contributions to the portfolio. This morning, we disclosed our decision to keep the Mapa\/Spontex and Quickie businesses as it became apparent that the economics of keeping them in the portfolio are more attractive than divesting them.","Similarly to RCP, Mapa\/Spontex and Quickie generate strong cash flow with operating margins ahead of the total company average. Keeping these businesses will be accretive to sales, operating margins, earnings per share and cash flow in 2020 and beyond.","Mapa\/Spontex and Quickie will be included in continuing operations as of the fourth quarter, as part of our Food and Commercial business. This means that upon the closing of the U.S. Playing Card Transaction which is currently expected to close by year end, we will officially conclude our divestiture program.","We recognize that this decision puts pressure on the leverage ratio in the short term. We remain committed to substantially strengthening the balance sheet and reducing our leverage ratio. We have a high degree of confidence in the cash generative ability of the company and we are comfortable that a short term deferral of our leverage target is outweighed by the benefits of higher cash flow expectations over multiple years.","With the completion of the divestiture program, it seems an appropriate time to make a change that we have wanted to make and that is to talk about our leverage ratio as a calculation of net-debt-to EBITDA rather than gross debt-to-EBITDA.","As you know, most consumer product companies calculate leverage using net debt, and I believe net debt is a better measure, since it recognizes the benefit of cash on the balance sheet. So under that updated definition, we now expect to attain a leverage ratio of approximately four times by the end of this year, approaching three and a half times by the end of 2020.","We have spoken to the rating agencies about this change, and shared with them the strategic rationale for the decision to keep Mapa\/Spontex and Quickie as well as the financial ramifications.","In our view, with the decision being a accretive to sales, margins, earnings per share and cash flow, the relatively short delay in reaching our target leverage ratio is a beneficial tradeoff longer-term. To that end, the company successfully completed a 700 million debt tender offer during the third quarter, and reduced gross debt by $425 million.","Just last week, we announced plans to redeem another $300 million in outstanding debt, which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter. So as you see, we continue to make progress on strengthening the balance sheet.","The fourth plank of our turnaround plan focusing is on accelerating our cash conversion cycle through better working capital management. We are driving significant progress here with more to come. Year-to-date operating cash flow $424 million has more than doubled a year ago number. The team is doing a good job on clearing customer deductions faster, extending payment terms, and reducing inventory, both through SKU reductions, as well as improving our planning and forecasting processes.","The results are encouraging with higher than anticipated progress today giving us confidence to raise the operating cash flow outlook for the full year to $700 million to $850 million from $600 million to $800 million previously. The last of our five strategic pillars is building a winning team and significantly improving employee engagement.","Ravi has shared with you his aggressive onboarding schedule, and his decision to bring in Steve Parsons as our new CHRO. Steve will be instrumental in partnering with Ravi, myself, and the rest of the executive team to lead our people, employee engagement agenda going forward.","Just last week, we got the results of a pulse employee survey that showed significant improvement in employee engagement since the one performed in the fall of 2018, which is consistent with the informal feedback we've been collecting from our town halls. While we still have lots of work to do on this front, it's encouraging to see that employees are feeling more excited about being part of Newell brands, and more competent in the leadership of the company.","Let me turn now to a detailed review of our Q3 financial results. Net sales declined 3.8% versus last year to $2.5 billion. Core sales were down 2.5% toward the higher end of our guidance range. Writing, Baby, Home Fragrance and Connected Home & Security grew core sales, eCommerce groups grew double-digits.","Normalized operating margin contracted 50 basis points to 12.7% better than our expectations due to strong traction on productivity and cost optimizing initiatives. Normalized gross margin declined 40 basis points to 35.1% as productivity savings in combination with favorable mix and pricing were more than offset by headwinds from inflation, tariffs and foreign exchange.","The SG&A to sales ratio moved up 20 basis points this quarter, reflecting significant progress on overheads, offset by a planned increase in A&P spend. Debt pay down over the past year resulted in net interest expense savings of $31 million versus last year. We recorded a normalized tax benefit of $59 million which was better than anticipated due to favorable discrete tax benefits.","Normalized net income from discontinued operations was $16 million below the $55 million in the year ago quarter, reflecting lost contribution from completed divestitures. At the end of Q3, we had 423 million diluted shares outstanding. The company delivered normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.73 which was well ahead of our guidance range due to better than expected operational performance, as well as a more favorable tax benefit. Normalized diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 6% year-over-year to $0.69.","Turning the segment results, please note that we have reorganized our reporting structure to accommodate the move of the Rubbermaid commercial products business to continuing operations. Our Q3 financials reflect four operating segments versus three previously.","Appliance & Cookware is now its own standalone segment, and we are reporting RCP and Food as one segment called Food & Commercial. There are no changes to the learning and development or home and outdoor living segments.","Core sales for the Home & Outdoor Living segment grew 1.3%. The Home Fragrance business continued its momentum from Q2 with core sales growth driven by distribution gains and strong performance from eCommerce and Europe.","The Connected Home & Security Division had a very strong quarter, partially due to timing of sell in prior to Fire Safety Month in October, which benefited Q3 at the expense of Q4. Core sales for the Outdoor & Recreation Division were down year-over-year as expected.","Our Learning & Development segment grew core sales 0.5% with both Baby and Writing contributing to this outcome. We were pleased with Writings performance at back-to-school where our brands gained market share across the core Writing category. That strong performance was partially offset by softening trends in Slime, which although still a meaningful business driver for Elmer's, is off from its peak levels.","The Baby Business also grew core sales, driven by compelling innovation and the strength of our brands. Core sales for the Appliance & Cookware segment declined at 3.7% as anticipated. The LatAm business is doing well, but the North America business continues to be challenged. While we are certainly not satisfied with this outcome, it is a significant improvement in the trend versus where the business was in the first half of the year.","We are focused on rebuilding the innovation pipeline to drive sustainable profitable growth over the long term. Core sales for the Food & Commercial segment declined 11.3% this quarter.","Our Food business was impacted by a timing shift and the sell in for Black Friday that will benefit Q4. At RCP, that business has been run for EBITDA maximization while being held for sale, with product line rationalization and lower margin subcategories unfavorably impacting core sales.","We believe that with a closer integration into the ongoing operations of the company, and a renewed focus on sustainable and profitable growth, we can reignite core sales growth in line with our CPs more attractive historical trends.","Moving on to cash. The company generated $433 million in operating cash flow in Q3, ahead of plan. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $424 million has more than doubled a year ago level, in spite of the loss contribution from divested business. The improvement reflects stronger business performance as well as the benefits from strategic initiatives taken to improve working capital, including improving, the customer deduction resolution process, extending payment terms closer to benchmark levels, taking out SKU complexity, and improvements in demand forecasting.","We continue to see a significant multi-year opportunity to improve the company's cash conversion cycle. Before discussing our outlook, I'd like to point out that in the tables to the press release, we provided supplemental information, which shows the impact of including Mapa\/Spontex and Quickie and continuing operations for Q4 and full year 2018.","This move increased both net sales and normalized operating margin, but reduced normalized EPS by a penny due to the recapture of depreciation expense on these businesses. Similarly to our discussion last quarter on RCP, moving Mapa\/Spontex and Quickie from discontinued operations to continuing operations requires the company to restart depreciation expense because in accordance with GAAP, assets held for sale are not depreciated.","The annualized non-cash depreciation expense for Mapa\/Spontex and Quickie is approximately $10 million. Our updated outlook for Q4 and full year 2019 will be based on a comparison with the metrics in this supplemental schedule.","With that frame of reference, I'll walk through our updated outlook for Q4 and Full Year Results. For full year 2019, the Company expects to deliver net sales of approximately $9.6 billion to $9.7 billion reflecting a low single digit core sales decline.","Normalized operating margin expansion of 30 basis points to 50 basis points to 10.6% to 10.8%. We are tightening the range on both the low and high end. We expect price increases, productivity improvements and overhead cost reductions to more than offset the unfavorable impact from inflation tariffs and currency, while simultaneously funding additional A&P investment.","We expect a normalized effective tax rate for continuing operations in the high single digit rate, and we are raising our guidance for normalized diluted earnings per share for the total company to a range of a $1.63 to $1.68. We are flowing through some of the upside that we delivered in Q3, and fully covering an incremental $10 million of depreciation from the inclusion of Mapa\/Spontex and Quickie.","We are also raising our forecast for cash flow from operations by nearly 11% at the midpoint to $700 million to $850 million reflecting improved operating performance, better than anticipated progress on working capital, and benefits from additional tax planning initiatives. This forecast includes approximately $200 million of divestiture related, cash taxes and transaction costs, and restructuring and related cost.","The outlook assumes no share repurchases. As we look to the fourth quarter, we now expect net sales in the $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion range with core sales declining 2% to 4%. Normalized operating margin will contract 10 basis points to 50 basis points to 11.0% to 11.4% despite sustained progress on overheads and productivity as we plan to increase A&P spending versus 2018.","The normalized effective tax rate for continuing operations is estimated in the mid 20% range. This yields normalized diluted earnings per share for the total company within a $0.35 to $0.40 range with a diluted share count similar to Q3.","Turning to 2020, while we are early in the [indiscernible] I want to share some preliminary perspective about how we are viewing next year. We're closely monitoring the macros, particularly surrounding tariffs and currency movements. We are targeting another year of sequential improvement on top line growth, with sustained efforts behind productivity and cost optimization driving margin improvement. A portion of which is expected to be reinvested, behind select capabilities and brand support to set the company up for the long term.","We are still in the early innings of going after the working capital opportunity, and are optimistic we will continue to shorten our cash conversion cycle, and improve total company operating cash flow year-over-year.","We will share more details surrounding our 2020 guidance during our normal schedule of the Q4 earnings call in February. In closing, we are encouraged by the progress we are driving through the turnaround plan, and excited about the longer term opportunity for this company.","Before opening for Q&A, I just want to say that it has been a real pleasure working with Ravi over the past 30 days, and I'm looking forward to continuing the turnaround journey together.","Nancy O'Donnell","Okay. Thanks, Chris. Before we turn it over to the operator for Q&A. I just would like to remind you that we're going to ask each caller to limit yourself to just one question. We're going to try to wrap it up on time and at the same time fit in as many callers as possible. So thanks for your cooperation and operator, we're ready to take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, Ma\u2019am thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, good morning. My question picks up Chris on what you were just talking about with 2020. In Ravi\u2019s comments there was a lot of discussion about how there's a need for more innovation, there's a need for a lot of work. But I know, the turnaround is sort of in full swing on, and we've been talking about bringing more innovation to some of these categories for a while. So bottom line, do you think 2020 is going to see core sales growth, or do we have another year of declines in core sales? Thanks.","Chris Peterson","Yes. I think as we think about 2020. I think, what I said is that we're expecting to show sequential improvement in 2020 versus 2019, but consistent with Ravi in my view we have a couple of businesses, notably Appliance & Cookware and outdoor and rack that I think are going to be multi-year turnarounds because we need to rebuild the innovation pipeline in those businesses and those businesses are both competing in about 35 product categories.","So I think it's too early for us to give numerical guidance, but I expect that you'll see us deliver sequential improvement versus this year. I don't expect us to be to the full potential of the company until we get the Appliance & Cookware and Outdoor & Rec businesses turned around.","Importantly though, I do think we're also going to make progress on operating margins as I mentioned. And I think that, that you'll see us from an operating cash flow standpoint do even better next year than this year.","Wendy Nicholson","And I assume\u2026.Yes.","Ravi Saligram","Yes. Wendy I -- sorry Wendy. Yes I don't want you to take my comments amiss in the sense. I think Chris articulated it very clearly that we will continue to improve. But the tale of 2 cities is a very real issue. And that also applies when you think about we're not sort of an 80-20 rule company. We've got tail channels tail customers tail categories. So we either need to really start growing very fast in the businesses that we're growing and we'll continue to push on that and then find ways to mitigate the declines.","So I think it will just be a matter of -- it's not if it's just when. And because we are very confident that this will -- we will get to growth it's just a matter of when. And -- but all our efforts are laser-focused on that. But in the meanwhile I think all the things Chris said this is a very good picture of continuing improvements on a lot of metrics not just on the growth side you should look at the cash flow and the operating margins and the like.","Wendy Nicholson","And fair to say though the stuff you were talking about with the international opportunity which is very exciting and it's something I think we've been waiting for it for a long time. But logically that type of growth is more like a 2021 and longer term that's not something where a light switch can be turned on and add much to the top line next year. Is that fair?","Ravi Saligram","I think look we've got -- I think Chris referred to this in his remarks already because there are pockets of growth where we're growing and in Latin America and I think I referred to it in my remarks as well. But you're right that the big international opportunity which is more long term you can't just return something. Having been president of international in a couple of different companies the biggest thing with international is people capabilities making sure you pick the right drive countries so that you don't have flags on maps and really driving for depth rather than breadth.","So it will take us time. But I do think our brands are well suited for the international opportunity. That is very key that -- whether you think about India or China and the kinds of businesses we have with Baby and Writing. These are all tremendous places where population growth is occurring. And I think long term this is a fabulous opportunity","Wendy Nicholson","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","BillChappell","Thanks. Good morning.","Ravi Saligram","Good morning, Bill.","BillChappell","Just kind of a thought on the outlook for the upcoming holiday season. Just trying to understand especially some of your seasonal businesses like Home Fragrance like Appliances. I mean do you feel you're set up fairly well? I guess in particular do you expect Home Fragrance to continue that growth as you go into the holiday season? And -- or is this more of a there's a lot of things that are in transition you probably weren't fully prepared to get ready for this holiday season so we'll see more step change going into next year?","Chris Peterson","I think on the Home fragrance business we've really turned the corner. So Home Fragrance has delivered core sales growth both in Q2 and Q3. I think we're very well positioned for the fourth quarter. And you can see that we're gaining distribution at our -- at major retailers as we're transitioning the business away from a purely retail store-focused business to more of an omni-channel model with wholesale playing a bigger role. So I expect on Home Fragrance that we're very well positioned and you'll see us well positioned to have a strong holiday season in that business.","Ravi Saligram","Bill I'd just add a quick thing to that. I did my review there. And this was a great example where the leadership works and the team there is very cohesive. And what I like is their strategic shift to redefine the business from Yankee Candle to real Home Fragrance business and they're looking at different opportunities. And so I think we can -- I think that business has a lot of legs.","BillChappell","And just\u2026.","Chris Peterson","The only other thing I would -- go ahead Bill.","Bill Chappell","I was just saying just to follow-up. I mean there's been transition risk of moving and you still have a fair amount of stores would you say that's largely behind you?","Chris Peterson","Yes. So this year we're going to -- we've closed 75 stores to date. We generally closed stores after the holiday period because the way to maximize value is not to close stores going into the holiday period. I would expect that we'll continue to close underperforming stores at the beginning of next year and focus on the stores that are profitable.","But what's exciting is that the growth that we're seeing in wholesale is more than offsetting that from a core sales perspective. And so I think that business is well positioned. We're also back to growth on eCommerce in that business. And so both on our direct-to-consumer site and through e-retailers we're back to core sales growth.","So I think we're navigating that shift well. And the other piece on that shift in addition to the top line is that the margin improvement in that business is substantial because the business we're shifting out of underperforming stores is shifting to channels where we make significantly higher operating margins. And so that business this year will be up and operating income very strong double digits.","Bill Chappell","Yes, sorry for my [Indiscernible] question.","Chris Peterson","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So I want to go back to Ravi your comment on the brand refreshes. I was curious which brands do you think have the most urgency from a refresh perspective. And then I was also curious in terms of how you think about the time line in terms of how long it could take for a brand refresh.","Ravi Saligram","Yes. Rupesh good morning good to hear your voice again. So Rupesh I think look the 2 businesses that are challenged are Outdoor and the Appliance business. Clearly we've got some brands that were really very prominent in yesteryear we need to update them. Coleman would be one definitely and it's a great brand with a great reputation. But I just think that with the competition that we have had both at the higher end with Yeti and lower end with Igloo we just need to get on top. But the brand equity is great. Consumers love the brand. We are doing good marketing things in terms of going to festivals and stuff but we need a little bit more product innovation.","And we've already got that going. But I think there's more work to be done. I think on the appliance side if you take a look at like something like Mr. Coffee. And I think that's another brand that while we put out different things out there I think that's a brand that we need to think through. I think Calphalon is a great brand and a terrific brand. We just need to get the channel segmentation right and just figure out how we take it to the next level. So those would be just a handful that I would say. The last one I'd say is Contigo which is a terrific brand. I remember it from my OfficeMax days when it was a pioneer in that segment. I just think they have a lot of potential there. And so we need to drive that a lot harder and a lot faster.","Rupesh Parikh","Great, thank you best of luck with the efforts.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Yes, thanks. Good morning. First off Ravi welcome and thanks for your opening comments. I guess as you and Chris think about the path ahead it just seems listening to your prepared remarks and the Q&A thus far that there's so much change in flight. Lots of discrete needs across numerous -- lots of discrete needs and numerous initiatives under way across just all of the company's various business lines.","And to your point geography-by-geography overseas. So I guess the question is to what extent are you able to step back and view the company's turnaround as one cohesive program versus just a huge program office of smaller turnarounds? And to the extent that there is one program how would you summarize the most critical variables toward continued success as you think about 2020?","Ravi Saligram","So let me start with it and then I'll let Chris take shot at it as well. So Steve I think one thing -- I'll start with your underlying premise about a lot of change. There is no question that this company has gone through a lot of churn in chain and a lot of disruption. So as I come in new the thing that I'm telling myself and all our employees and management team is if we decide to make any change we need to think about the prize with the Z and the price that we pay for it. So is the prize that we're going to get by making any change worth the price that we'll pay? So the cost benefit. So really we'll not be making changes for the just sake of changes. And so I think that will be very critical. I do think that when you're in a turnaround there are different levers you need to pull.","And -- but central to this really to me is that hey we've got -- if you think about 3 buckets we've got to get growth and that growth will come through innovation. You've got to get cost down and efficiencies which will help the margins. So a lot of the things in terms of simplification whether it's SKUs systems all of that just goes into becoming a more efficient organization. And then cash flow. So really those are the buttons. We're just trying to -- there may be different initiatives but we're very clear that there is a cohesive program here and it is not just a project management office that is just churning out. Because look one of the things -- one big change that Chris already started and I'm going to continue this is not going to be a consultant-driven organization. This is going to be run by operators who have a very clear view of both the short term and the long term. Chris?","Chris Peterson","Yes the only thing I would add to that Steve is that when we -- when I came in about a year ago I went through a listening tour similar to what Ravi is doing and we put in place a turnaround plan that we've been executing against for probably the last nine months. And that turnaround plan which I laid out at -- in previous earnings calls and conferences is very focused on the 5 things that we talked about here and that Ravi mentioned as well.","And I think we've had consistency in that turnaround plan over the last nine months. And so it hasn't been a student body left or a student body right. The tactics underneath it we're continuing to monitor and we're driving a lot of different change with regard to complexity reduction productivity initiatives a change in how we develop innovation and interact with the consumer.","But I think all of those things are in the right direction. And what I'm excited about is that with Ravi coming in I think we'll make it even sharper. And I think we can move forward in a very positive way. And we're already seeing the results. This is the third quarter in a row that we've met or beat our plan and expectations on all financial metrics. And so we're 3 for 3 which begins to rebuild credibility as we go forward here.","Ravi Saligram","So I'll just add 2 quick points. When I came in and during the course of time as I was interviewing I had a chance to look at the turnaround plan. I really think it's very sounded and it's just back to basics. This is not rocket science. And one can say \"Hey do you need a highfalutin strategy model?\" We've got good brands. We have good people. We just need to execute and be laser-focused on a few things and do them well. My job when I come in part of it is to really inspire our employees to do their best. That I think I am -- I fervently believe that employees are at the heart of our business.","And we've not I think yet today galvanized the full potential of our employees and how do we get them to believe that there is a great future and that it's additive. And that 30000 employees is actually equivalent to 300000 because you're taking all their power and getting them very focused on a few things. And my job is to with the management team help explain bring it down to the basics. So -- and that starts with let's get focused on the consumer get focused on the customer let's understand the trends get on top of it quickly. Speed is very critical in all of this and be ahead of the curve. And over time once we get the turnaround effected look -- we'll look at the next phase. Then we may want to -- for the next growth phase. But right now back to the basics turnaround is what we need to do.","Steve Powers","Okay, thanks so much for all that I'll pass it up.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James & Associates.","Joe Altobello","Good morning. Thank you Ravi for your high-level thoughts earlier on the opportunities that you see at Newell. You did emphasize the need for stability in the organization obviously. And so just to be clear should we interpret that as there's unlikely to be any major changes in the transformation plan? And again I realize it's early days but perhaps some mid-course tweaks here and there over the next few quarters.","Ravi Saligram","Joe thank you for that. Look I think I would not -- because there are 2 plans around I think there was an old transformation plan and that is not what I'm referring to. I'm being very crystal clear that it's the turnaround plan that Chris has articulated and talked about each component which is a back to basics hey let's get this company on the right footing. So because transformation is too highfalutin a word for me I'm -- you've got to be very careful about that.","We are in the throes of our turnaround get the basics right. And yes I think all the tenets of that make a lot of sense so there is no point in changing when there's no need to and we're making terrific progress. Now some of the execution will -- and the tactics over time we'll learn and we'll improve. So for instance social media. We just are nascent. We got started on it. Now how we do it we may want to change. I may make some structural tweaks but there are tweaks they're not going to be wholesale changes. Leadership team we have a good leadership team. I may make changes where I feel it's necessary. But what you're not going to see is a complete upside down because I don't think that is right for the company at this stage. We're on a good path we just need to build on that momentum.","Joe Altobello","That's very helpful. And just shifting gears to North America. Core sales were down 3.8% in the quarter. I think that was pretty similar to the number that we saw last quarter despite increased A&P investments and the strong growth that you guys saw in eCommerce. Was that just a tougher compare? Or was that also due to the inclusion of Rubbermaid Commercial in the quarter?","Ravi Saligram","It was a little bit of both. So let me just address that. So if you look at the total company's core sales growth of negative 2.5%. while we're not satisfied with that number it did represent on a two-year stack basis about a 450 basis point improvement in Q3 versus Q2 speaking to your point on tougher compare and that's certainly true in North America as well. If you look at our guidance for Q4 that represents about another 250 basis point improvement and the two-year stacked core sales growth trend versus Q3. So although we're still guiding in Q4 down 2% to 4% we're cycling through tougher compares and we're making sequential progress on our two-year stacked growth trends. The higher A&P in Q3 was largely spent behind the Writing business and I think we were very happy with the results from that.","Because Q3 is the all-important back-to-school season for the Writing category and we won the Writing category during the back-to-school season. So we grew market share in the back-to-school season in the core Writing business and grew core sales per division. The core sales for the division doesn't show the extent completely of how much we won during the back-to-school season because it was somewhat masked by the Slime trend coming off. But the A&P spend certainly played a big role in that effort. So I think we were pleased with the results from that. It doesn't mean we're not going to look at how do we make it better and more effective going forward. But the core sales came in at the high end of our guidance range and we're excited about the sequential progress we're making and expect to continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren Lieberman","Great, thanks. Good morning. As you talked about this is -- let's not sort of overcomplicate this in terms of what we need to do and not have a big highfalutin strategy and so on which I really appreciate let's execute on these brands. One of the things when I looked back over the last couple of years that has I think caught these great brands by surprise is the -- is just competition. Sort of that Newell wasn't the only company giving attention to these categories through innovation through addressing emergent consumer needs. So Ravi how are you thinking about that side of the house? Sort of beefing up the consumer and competitive insight and intelligence capabilities to really make sure that you don't fall behind again because that's where the hole you're digging out of right from a growth standpoint.","Ravi Saligram","Yes Lauren. Thank you for that. Look I think the most important thing for this is you've got to have your organization and your teams have an external focus versus an internal focus. These problems start when you are looking very inwards. In the last several years with the acquisition with structural changes which might not have made sense there was also divisions on a development delivery organization that might not have optimized things. I just think that we've got to get our teams to have that winning spirit and just get on top of trends. Because a lot of these trends we should have seen. And it burns me up that we missed some of them and I've only been here a month.","And I want every employee to feel that way because in consumer brands you got to have the obsession that you want to delight the consumer and you always got to be ahead of them. So insights become very important. Social listening becomes very important and not being steeped in the past. So you've got to get a 360-degree view of how the consumer is moving and anticipate and make sure that your innovation cycle is speeding up toward that. The second part of it is focus. Because look you can't -- every innovation is not going to be a needle-mover.","So you've got to also have new news. Sometimes it may just be a packaging refresh. Sometimes it may be just how you talk about the brands. But there's always got to be new news in a category in a business where there's discretionary purchase patterns. So we're going to ramp this up. It's going to take us a little bit of time. And we are in different stages in different businesses.","For instance Writing where they have the year of the pen. I'm very excited about the things they're doing. And especially with Sharpie and stuff like that. So I just think they're in different stages. We will get this cranked and go forward. Because I hate to lose out to the competition because that means we were asleep at the switch and we're not going to let that -- it will take us time to get there but we're going to rev this organization to really have that competitive spirit and that obsession with the consumer and customer because you've got to make sure your innovations are as important and favored by the customer and not just for the consumer. So if you get the price point right the safe channel segmentation's right etc.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital.","Nik Modi","Yes, thanks. Good morning, Ravi I just was hoping you can provide some thoughts on your background with OfficeMax and Ritchie Bros. And maybe some best practices or learnings from your experience at those companies especially as a Newell customer at OfficeMax and how you think you can apply those experiences to what you see at Newell today.","Ravi Saligram","Thank you Nik and it's good hearing your voice again. So Nik I'd say it's a product of a few things the experiences. So I have been in -- I've lived in 6 countries worked across 6 different categories and -- or 6 totally sectors both B2B B2C SC Johnson where my consumer packaged goods came in. But look the key thing for me is when you get into a company to always start with a clean slate and say what is the situation here versus do -- oh I did that there's a -- don't be formulaic in your approach. That's number one. There's a second philosophy which is people come first. You truly got to believe that your people are your biggest asset. And to me it's not about always a you've got to have only the best people but how do you bring out the best in people. Because that is very very important. And I don't think we have really maximized that potential at Newell. We will go break down the silos and break down all of this -- we've got to fully culturally integrate the company. And I did that at Ritchie Bros. when we bought OfficeMax. The third is to make sure that especially if these companies for one successful leadership complacency sets in.","And you start thinking you believe in your own stuff and that's when you miss the innovation. It's someone in the garage who comes up with things. And you have set paradigms whereas the person outside is thinking in a different lens. For me the fact that I've worked in so many categories helps me look at patterns and say how do you take disparate and view them into one single pattern. So the other thing I'm very respectful I think it's very important for domain expertise institutional memory and knowledge. So that if every -- if you only have generalists running places you lose a lot of momentum. You need people who have burned time in their jobs especially in marketing in sales because you want continuity with customers with your top customers the same people calling.","You also need a cohesive horizontal view. So today we are I think a little bit too much we're geared from too much centralization to maybe a little bit much on the division focus. How do you harmonize that. So that when you present yourself in front of all the big top customers there's also a Newell voice in there. So I think a lot of these things that -- for me the Newell thing is very exciting because it's the culmination of my career for all the experiences I've had to bring to bear.","And the last one I'd say is today any company that does not think of itself as digital-first is doomed. So -- and for us we already have the foundation. But you got -- it can't just be the center of excellence in eCommerce. The entire company has to think digital social media. So gone are the days you when just said \"Oh it's all TV.\" you've got to look at -- and one of the surprises for me when I came in was that maybe a couple of years ago we didn't really allow social media and influencers which is shocking.","Chris corrected that and we have now got a nascent initiative going. So I just think that there are a lot of ingredients in our company for success. They've got proven brands. They've just fallen behind a bit but I am very confident we'll get them back to their past glory.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thank you. Morning, everyone. Welcome Ravi. Ravi I wanted to come back to a portfolio question. It sounds like you're reasonably comfortable with the portfolio as it currently stands. You also mentioned though that the company will be in the process of doing a deep dive on Appliances & Cookware as well as Outdoor & Rec. So I'm just curious does that leave the door open for potentially some strategic considerations there? At that point when you're down with the strategic review is it possible that you do decide to divest those businesses?","How do you view the attractiveness of those categories now and the brand's positioning they're in? It sort of begs the portfolio questions a company should be in the businesses that they're in and not necessarily the ones that they are in. If the company's balance sheet was in a different position today would you buy either one of those businesses? Arguably the answer to that may be no. So I'd be curious to get your thoughts there. And then a quick housekeeping Ravi is it your intent to provide long-term targets sales profit earnings growth etc.? And if so when should investors expect that?","Ravi Saligram","Okay. I'll answer the first question. And then I think Chris mentioned that the divestiture program is done. And look I think at this point we're quite happy with the portfolio overall. But within the portfolio because we've got -- so for instance Appliance & Cookware we have 36 categories. So -- and we're kind of leaders overall but we've got to look at hey can we really have best in particular segments. And are there certain things that we may want to evaluate do they make sense to still be in. Because it's very tough when you say we've got to conquer all 36. So we may want to -- we'll evaluate certain categories should we prune some. There's also some things that just don't make sense. Like in Germany I've just learned we've got a condom brand.","And really that's not strategic to us. So those are the kinds of things that we may want to sharpen our focus. So it's a sharpening of the focus. I think it's premature for us to really come to any conclusions that just because these 2 businesses are at this stage not firing on all cylinders that there shouldn't be a conclusion that they're not part of the portfolio. We have to look at it get the turnaround plans. Because they have good brands. These are all highly reputable brands. And look I worked in my past with a lot of brands that were icons. Holiday Inn as an example. And so it is just how do you restore them and how do you make them relevant and current. Chris do you want to add to that?","Chris Peterson","Yes. I'll just say on the guidance point we'll provide guidance for next year for 2020 on the next earnings call which is our normal cadence. And I think we laid out at CAGNY sort of long-term aspirations last year and I don't think -- relative to the benchmarks I don't think anything has really changed versus that. So that will be our plan relative to updating guidance for next year and beyond.","Operator","That is all the time we have today for question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Saligram for closing remarks.","Ravi Saligram","Thank you very much everyone. I really appreciate your being on the call and your interest in Newell.

Our team has been working hard to address these challenges head-on. And in the third quarter, we've made good progress.","As a reminder, we're focused on five core areas. First, returning the business to a consistent pattern of delivery. This means setting appropriate milestones and delivering against them, making our numbers quarter-by-quarter. Second, we're working hard to optimize our cost structure by delivering on our ongoing savings programs and extracting to retain costs related to the divestitures, we will and have made as we transform our portfolio.","Third, we're focused on increasing cash flow by driving profitable growth, making meaningful progress in working capital and reducing the complexity across our business. Fourth, we are reshaping and focusing the portfolio on our most attractive consumer businesses, executing the divestitures and using the proceeds to delever and repurchase shares. And fifth, we are repositioning the organization for more consistent and sustained operating performance, restructuring division and function designs, while simultaneously strengthening and upgrading talent.","In the third quarter, we made progress in all five of these areas. Specifically, we delivered sequential improvement in core sales growth in all segments in all regions with Writing returning to growth and e-commerce, excluding the absence of Toys\"R\"Us, U.S. Baby Registry growing double digits. We delivered 13% normalized operating margins, exceeding our expectations and year ago performance. Despite increased inflation, the July round of tariffs and the negative impact of foreign exchange.","Pricing and productivity were positive contributors in the quarter and we made substantial progress on overheads through efforts to right-size the organization. We delivered over $570 million of operating cash flow, an increase of $389 million versus prior year as a result of good progress on inventories and on payables as efforts to renegotiate payment terms on sourced finished goods have begun to take effect. And we completed the divestiture of Rawlings and Waddington late in the second quarter and Goody this quarter, generating $2.6 billion in after-tax proceeds. In that context, we paid down nearly $900 million in debt, exiting the quarter with net debt down $2.5 billion versus prior year. We completed a tender offer for another $1 billion debt in October and we passed back over $600 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our share count in the third quarter was about 4% lower than year ago.","As for the remaining non-core businesses, we're well along on the sales process for several with others beginning to take shape. We're on track to deliver about $10 billion in after-tax proceeds through these divestitures and we'll use the proceeds coupled with our operating cash flow after investment in the business to continue to de-lever and also buy back shares at very attractive prices.","On our fifth priority, over the last two quarters, we've taken steps to right-size our organization, actioning change in several functions including IT, marketing, R&D, design, and e-commerce. We've made the difficult, but necessary decision to restructure and those actions have contributed to our professional head count on the continuing businesses being down by about 10% compared to where we stood at the beginning of the year. We are laser-focused on strengthening the operational performance and financial flexibility of the company. While we know we have much more work to do, third quarter was one of sequential progress. We will continue to execute with a sense of urgency in repositioning Newell Brands for sustainable growth. And in the quarters to come, we will turn the page on this challenging chapter in our history.","Let me pass the call to Ralph to walk through a more in-depth review of our financial results and then I'll return to provide perspective on the balance of the year. Ralph?","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. As I go through the financial results, please note that the discussion of the income statement metrics reflects our continuing operations. I'll remind you that under GAAP, all overhead costs and interest expense not directly related to discontinued operations are allocated to continuing operations, which burdens margins and profitability in both 2018 and restated 2017 results. The company is implementing action plans to fully offset retained costs over time.","Reported net sales from continuing operations of $2.3 billion declined 7.7% versus last year due to lower core sales, a roughly 140-basis-point headwind from foreign exchange, as well as the impact from the adoption of the 2018 revenue recognition standard. Core sales from continuing operations contracted 4% year-over-year in Q3, which represents good sequential improvement from Q2 is minus 10%, but we're slightly below our expectations. The areas that came in short of our expectations were in the Appliances business and Home Fragrance in EMEA, while Writing came in better than planned.","Reported gross margin increased 80 basis points versus last year to 35.9% as the benefit from productivity, pricing and the positive impact of the new revenue recognition standard more than offset inflationary pressures and other manufacturing costs related to inventory reduction. Normalized gross margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 35.7%. Reported SG&A expense of $576 million represented 25.3% of sales versus 27.9% in the year-ago period with restructuring and integration costs moving down significantly year-over-year. Normalized SG&A expense of $517 million or 22.7% of sales was slightly favorable to the 22.9% in the year-ago period.","In the third quarter, the company recorded an $8.1 billion non-cash impairment charge from continuing operations, largely attributable to the significant decline in the company's market cap during the third quarter. The impairment test, which we formally conduct annually in the third quarter is based on a sum of the parts valuation but is capped at the fair value of the company defined as the enterprise value at a reasonable control premium. Given the significant pressure on Newell Brands' shares in the recent months, the majority of the impairment was driven by the reduction in the market cap with the remainder attributable to a change in cash flow projections from what was assumed in the impairment test that we performed last year.","Largely due to this non-cash charge, the company reported an operating loss of $7.9 billion. Normalized operating income was $296 million compared with $319 million in the prior year. Normalized operating margin came in at 13%, up 10 basis points versus last year. We remain on track to deliver normalized operating margins in the 12% to 12.4% range for the back half of this year with a sequential step down in Q4 margins as we plan to increase A&P spending to drive consumption.","Net interest expense was $106 million down from $116 million in the year-ago period as we have reduced our net debt balance by $2.5 billion year-over-year. Based on the deleveraging actions we have taken thus far including the recent tender, we now expect full year 2018 interest expense of approximately $445 million.","This quarter's tax benefit of $1.2 billion exceeded the year ago benefit of $131 million, primarily due to the tax benefits associated with the impairment charge and the integration of certain legal entities. The normalized tax benefit of $69 million compares to last year's benefit of $61 million. We now expect the full year normalized tax rate for continuing operations to be a benefit in the mid-30s range.","Reported net loss from discontinued operations of $317 million included $517 million in impairment charges related to assets held-for-sale and compared to net income of $123 million last year. Normalized net income from discontinued operations was $129 million as compared to $156 million in the year-ago period with the year-over-year comparison reflecting the loss of income from the businesses that have been divested in 2018, which include Waddington, Team Sports and Goody.","We ended the quarter with 471 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding as we repurchased approximately 19 million shares during the quarter. For 2018, we expect a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 480 million shares and a fourth quarter weighted average share count of approximately $470 million (sic) [470 million].","Reported diluted loss per share for the company was $15.10 as compared to reported diluted earnings per share of $0.48 in the year-ago quarter. Reported diluted loss per share from continuing and discontinued operations was $14.43 and $0.67 respectively. Normalized diluted earnings per share were $0.81 as compared to $0.86 in the prior year. Normalized diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.54, same as last year as the decline in sales was offset by overhead reductions, interest savings and taxes. Normalized diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.27 compared with $0.32 in the previous year.","Now, turning to our segment results, net sales for Food & Appliances were $722 million, a decline of 11.4% versus the prior year. Core sales were down 5.9%, reflecting weakness in Appliances due to continued competitive challenges in the U.S. The Home & Outdoor Living segment delivered net sales of $727 million, down 6.8% year-over-year, with core sales down 5.9%, largely driven by distribution losses on Coleman in the U.S. and weaknesses in Home Fragrance in EMEA and Yankee retail stores. Our Connected Home & Security business grew double digits.","The Learning & Development segment posted net sales of $829 million, which represents a 3.9% decline year-over-year. Core sales were down 0.5 point. Our Writing business grew year-over-year and a significant sequential improvement. Baby also improved sequentially, but was down year-over-year reflecting the hangover impact from consumer purchases that were accelerated into Q2 to take advantage of the liquidation sales at Babies\"R\"Us.","Operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $572 million versus $183 million last year with the year-over-year improvement reflecting favorable working capital movements as well as reduction in restructuring and integration costs and cash taxes. We're on track with our deleveraging plans and repaid almost $900 million of debt during the quarter, comprising the term loan, commercial paper and the October maturity. In October, we launched a tender offer for $1 billion of additional debt, which is substantially complete as of today.","During the third quarter, we returned approximately $620 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to make progress on the divestiture front as we closed on the sale of Goody in the quarter. The other divestiture processes are advancing and will provide us with additional capital deployment opportunities in the coming months.","I'll now turn the call back to Mike.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Ralph. Looking to the balance of 2018, we expect consumer macros to remain generally healthy and our retail landscape to continue to stabilize.","On Baby, we've now come through the two most difficult quarters relating to the Toys\"R\"Us bankruptcy. Year-to-date, our sales to TRU are roughly $120 million lower than year ago with about $55 million of that amount impacting the third quarter. While we have two more quarters to go until our Baby business fully laps TRU's bankruptcy, we've made good progress shifting share to other retailers, particularly in the large baby gear categories of toddler car seats and strollers. Baby has been one of our strongest performing businesses over the last five years and we expect once we lap the transitory issue associated with TRU, the Baby business will return to its brand and innovation-led value-creation track record.","On Writing, our choice to accelerate the retailer trade inventory reset into the first half of 2018 has put a significant portion of the associated headwinds behind us. This is particularly true in the traditional distributor trade. We experienced a solid back-to-school, despite spending less than we did a year ago, with Writing returning to growth in the quarter. We expect that trend to continue. While retailer-driven changes will likely continue to emerge, we do not envision any near-term challenges of the magnitude we've had to deal with. Recent news regarding Sears and Kmart does not pose an issue for Newell Brands.","For the balance of the year, we expect core sales growth in our continuing businesses to improve sequentially in all segments. The improvement in core sales growth should be driven by the highest level of advertising and promotion spending this year in support of e-commerce activation, holiday merchandising and new innovations, like our premium line of Calphalon Appliances featuring all of the durable construction and craftsmanship that Calphalon cookware is known for along with a sleek modern finish and premium functionality; and, our Oster Hand Mixer with HeatSoft technology that gently softens cold butter to room temperature 12 times faster, resulting in lighter and creamier batters; and, Graco's new Sense2Soothe Swing with Cry Detection technology that has eight different motions that mimic how mom and dad naturally move and an audio system that detects cries automatically adjusting the swing settings to the combination that best soothes baby; and, Yankee Candle Elevations with a Platform Lid, which boasts a newly designed tapered glass silhouette and dual-purpose lid that acts as a platform for the candle while it burns; and, new Onelink Safe & Sound from First Alert, a transformative innovation that combines intelligent protection from smoke and carbon monoxide with superior audio capability that serves as your home speaker system and intercom, compatibility with your main connected home platforms and built-in virtual assistants. This new innovation turns your smoke detector into a two-way communication device that keeps you connected through the entire home. These are just a few of the new innovations that are flowing to market as a result of the brand development and design work completed over the last 18 months to 24 months.","With the expected sequential improvement of core sales in the fourth quarter, we've reaffirmed our full year net sales guidance between $8.7 billion and $9 billion. With respect to margins, we're making steady progress dealing with increased inflation, tariffs and FX through our ongoing cost and productivity programs and our tariff mitigation efforts. There have been two rounds of tariffs implemented in the third quarter with another step up in certain categories expected in January 2019.","Through the summer, we've enacted several mitigation efforts such as repatriating production into our U.S. manufacturing locations where it makes sense, renegotiating our sourcing contracts when possible, off-shoring production outside of China where possible and negotiating with the USTR office for tariff exceptions. Where we cannot mitigate the tariff, we are working with our retail partners to offset the tariffs through pricing. These customer conversations have been pretty constructive, as our own retail partners deal with the same challenges on their own brands that we have with tariffs.","Importantly, we've been successful at negotiating an exception for most of the U.S. tariffs planned on baby gear, which represented a substantial portion of the original $100 million annualized tariff exposure communicated with Q2 earnings. However, the U.S. government has subsequently announced its intention to increase the recently implemented 10% tariffs to 25% at the start of 2019. If those tariffs do take effect in early January, our annualized tariff cost exposure would return to the original $100 million communicated in August.","We have already announced pricing tied to the early January new tariff levels. In this context and given the solid margin delivery in the third quarter, we've left our continuing operations normalized operating margin outlook unchanged at 12% to 12.4% for the second half of 2018. We're reaffirming our full year total operating cash flow outlook of $900 million to $1.2 billion and we have increased our outlook for total company normalized earnings per share by $0.10 to a range of $2.55 to $2.75, reflecting our third quarter performance and new tax planning benefits.","There are three growth opportunities we will continue to work on: reigniting growth in our U.S. Appliances business through stronger innovation and e-commerce penetration; broadening our distribution footprint on the U.S. Coleman business as we come into camping and outdoor season this coming spring; and driving profitable growth on Home Fragrance in Europe through more constructive merchandising programs and the deployment of WoodWick to Europe. Work is underway on all three of these opportunities and we expect to make progress over the next few quarter in each of these areas.","Before we close, I want to spend a moment on the impairment charge we took this quarter. As Ralph explained, the majority of the charge is dictated by the third and fourth quarter pull-back in the stock price. Clearly, our performance on certain businesses from both legacy companies contributed as well. While the volatility in our environment over the last year has been unprecedented, we acknowledged the need to change our approach to reflect the new set of circumstances through the Accelerated Transformation Plan launched in January.","The ATP is a plan that maximizes value and sets the stage for the future. We are convinced that this new path is the right one and are on our way to delivering the expected outcomes. Our momentum is beginning to build. We see green shoots in many places and success stories are beginning to emerge. The team has shown incredible determination, perseverance and the drive for results through this period. We are all working to reignite our core performance and create value for shareholders.","Again, we're focused on five key areas: strengthening our operational performance, optimizing our cost structure, increasing the cash efficiency of the company, executing the divestitures and reallocating capital to delever and repurchase shares, and rightsizing and strengthening the organization. We're making good progress in each of these areas. Thank you for your continued interest in Newell Brands as we go through this transformation period.","With that, let's take your questions. Operator, over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning and thanks for...","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hi, Rupesh.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe to start off, so you mentioned that you expect an improvement in core sales growth in Q4. Do you still expect...","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","...to be back in positive territory?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","We'll see how that plays out. I think it's possible that we end up in positive territory, depends on the recovery in Writing and how significant that is, the movement on Baby. We should see improved performance on Appliances with the launch of the innovations that I was speaking to. It's possible and I think that would be a great outcome if it occurred. I think the thing we're trying to do is to stay focused on sequential improvement and taking this one quarter at a time. There's lots of uncertainty at the end of the quarter related to how things will unfold with respect to tariff pre-buys and that could be a variable that drives performance up or down. So this will be a month-by-month thing and I think we're certainly in better position than we've been at any point in the year.","Our spending levels are up in the fourth quarter, our innovation is stronger in the fourth quarter, the retail landscape is stabilizing with a large part of the Writing headwinds behind us. And we are making progress on the share shift we intend to deliver related to TRU. So, I'm more optimistic than I've been at any point through the year and I think the team is doing a good job of executing and things will play out in the fourth quarter as they do.","Our primary focus is on making sure we create the most value out of the ideas we're bringing to market and continue to make progress on the cost and cash agenda we have as a company, while executing the divestiture program completely and fully reallocating capital to delevering and repurchase. So lots to do, that agenda is broad. Third quarter is a good indicator that we're headed in the right direction. And I think the way to think about the fourth quarter is another quarter of sequential progress as we turn the page on 2018 and move into 2019.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. And I'm going to slip in a second quick question. So with the divestitures, it sounds like you guys are still comfortable on achieving that $10 billion in after-tax proceeds. So just curious what's driving that comfort level and from your, I guess, perspectives earlier this year, are there any changes in the timeline of achieving that $10 billion target?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","No, our timeline is the same and our comfort level is the same. We have a number of processes under way and they are coming down the homestretch. And there is nothing that we can envision that will get in the way of our delivery.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay, great, best of luck for the balance of the year.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thank you, Rupesh.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Hey guys, good morning.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey Joe.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Just wanted to go back to something you said Mike, I think in May looking ahead to 2020 and I know a lot has changed since then, but I think you kind of laid out the big picture, $9.5 billion company on the top line and normalized operating margins of about 15%. First, is that still a reasonable target given what you know today. And then second, if it is maybe if you could help us bridge the 10% operating margin you're looking at for this year to get to 15% by 2020. I know a lot of that's stranded overhead and (28:59) you that. But if you could sort of tell us what this company looks like in two years and sort of how you get to that margin number? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Sure. Well, look, I think you're right to kind of point out the need to deliver against the cost agenda. We have to get the retained costs that are associated with the divestitures out of the system. We made good progress this year, that's a critical variable. Delivering the core growth acceleration is another critical variable. I feel good about the progress we're making there and the work that we've done over the last two years on innovation is beginning to come to market as evidenced by the list of ideas and product launches that I shared with you.","That has to all bear fruit. Obviously, the environment has changed and will continue to change and so we need to overcome those changes to include the emergence of tariffs, to include a higher inflationary rate, to include FX. I mean these are the things that with the exception perhaps of tariffs, these are the things that businesses need to overcome and there will be ebbs and flows in those challenges, I'm sure, over the next 18 months. So, we've got work to do as everybody does in terms of confronting the sort of the new realities of those variables. But I wouldn't draw any conclusion about the future, about 2020 at this point. We'll work through the puts and the takes and we will continue to look at this every quarter. I think the margin progression in Q3 is an important indicator of our ability to make progress and make progress fast.","So, we've got to work the plan, we've got to deliver to offset the headwinds through pricing productivity and the cost initiatives. And we've got to be nimble and smart and adaptive to what will undoubtedly be sort of a changing landscape through the next 18 months or so. But at this point, I wouldn't want to get into the specifics of the bridge because I think there will be a lot of moving parts. But our ambition is firm and our point of view is consistent with what we've expressed in the past.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful and I totally understand. If I could ask a second question on Writing, it sounds like you do expect the growth you saw this quarter to continue. Is there a risk that we see another leg down in terms of inventories in the office superstore channel. I think if you look at Staples and their merger with Essendant, they're talking about years of inventory reductions. Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah, we've come through a really intense period of inventory reduction in the traditional Writing channels, particularly in the distributor trade or the wholesale portion of that Writing landscape. And we are building our point of view on growth going forward in the context of our delivering to the new inventory targets that our retail partners have established for themselves. And so that work is underway and ongoing. Don't envision major steps down. We've just come through that period where we accelerated the major step down into the first half of the year. However, we will continue to have headwinds in inventory that will come out of the channel, but that's built into our guidance and we're being very plan full (32:47) about it.","The Staples and Essendant combination is one where we will keep our eyes on, however, as I said, in the first half of the year and quite frankly back into 2017, inventories have come down substantially in the traditional distributor trade and I would characterize Essendant as one of those distributors. So we made a lot of progress in an 18-month window with them getting to their articulated targets, and of course, we will be vigilant on making sure that our sell-in and our sell out matches through them so that we don't have any further issues to confront in the future. But I'm very pleased with the progress. Team's done a good job. It was a very painful nine months to go through and while we have some more work to do, the vast majority of the work is behind us.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hi, Andrea.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. Hi. How are you? Thank you. Good morning. So, Mike, I was hoping to \u2013 if you can comment on the pricing you were able to realize so far in the third quarter. And what is included in your guidance for fourth quarter?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And also I would appreciate what half \u2013 yeah, so I have a follow-up later. Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Okay. So on pricing, we experienced positive price. And when we talk about price to you, we talk about net realized price, which is the combination of programming, which is our gross-to-net activities and invoice pricing. We had positive price in the quarter and we expect positive price in the fourth quarter as well.","We've had inflations through the year at levels higher than we originally anticipated in resins and energy, and so we priced for both those on costs and for the portion of the tariffs that we've been unable to mitigate through the mitigation actions I described in the script. And we priced in July for those early July tariffs, which were the first round. We've priced again at the end of September for the second round of tariffs; that's the 10% tariffs on what are called the 301 categories. And we've announced pricing for the last round, which is currently slated for the beginning of January on the 301 categories.","So we've had generally constructive conversations around these price increases. You have to live through their implementation to be able to declare whether you've been successful at landing those prices and you have to work through those moments. We're in the midst of that on the late-September pricing, and so far so good. And we've had \u2013 the normal levels and the appropriate conversations you would expect regarding the January next round of tariff increases. There's some views out there that those may not happen. We've assumed they will and we are planning as such. So hence, we've announced those pricing actions. We've triggered the 60 day to 90 day lead times that we have by contract and we expect pricing to go into effect in early January, and we'll work through the details of that customer-by-customer.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful. And the other follow-up that I have is on tax. I appreciate that Ralph had said 30% positive effective tax rate, right? So I'm trying to find the $0.10 improvement in your guidance. Is it mostly related to that \u2013 I'm trying to backup, obviously, there are a bunch of moving parts in terms of credits and deferred tax that I saw on your disclosures. Is it fair to say it's mostly because of the discrete item? And also, how much would you say is your effective tax rate now for continuing operations, so that we can kind of model going forward?","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. The tax rate in the quarter was favorable to our expectations and it's really partly related to timing because it is hard to predict exactly when these discrete items fall. So yeah, the benefit, as you point out, that moved the EPS up was largely related to the tax rate on the quarter. I had said that our tax rate for continuing operations for the year would be a benefit in the mid-30s and that's a result of some of the discrete items and some tax planning initiatives that we've had.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I would add to that is that I think it's noteworthy, our earnings \u2013 our EBIT came in stronger than our expectations and, obviously, higher than Street estimates. So, there's a blend of underlying sort of organic progression in Q3 and tax, clearly. But I think the headline that we're moving the $0.10 on tax, I think, is the right net headline to kind of embrace.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. That's helpful. So then, from a continuing \u2013 kind of like more normalized way of taxes, should we go back to that number that you initially kind of guided? Or \u2013 because I think that, obviously, the goodwill impairment was not anticipated. So if we go back to that kind of normalized tax rate, that should be the one we look kind of like in the outer years, I'm assuming.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","You're speaking beyond this year, now? Just to be clear.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","I think we've said in the past, on a continuing basis our tax rate excluding discrete items and things that would come up would be in the low 20% range, between 20% and 25%. That's what we've said. And I would continue to model in that way going forward.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. So I have a question on your divestitures. Could you give us a status where you're at in the process of executing on the remaining divestitures, and then maybe the pace of announcement that we can expect going forward? And then, I'd really like to hear how confident you are in your ability to hit the $10 billion target. And wondering if you can't get the price you expect for an asset sale or maybe there aren't any buyers, at what point do you make the decision to just hold on to the asset and take it out of discontinued ops? And then, just a final one on this topic, would you consider selling more assets to hit your $10 billion target in case you fall a little short, or just simply live with falling short of your goal? Thanks.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Sure, sure; so, great questions. We're well on our way to deliver the outcomes we committed to, the $10 billion of after-tax proceeds. As you know, we have three processes coming down the home stretch. We've got Jostens underway. We've got Pure Fishing underway. We've got the U.S. Playing Cards business underway, and we're just gearing up on the next round of divestitures. While I hesitate to give you kind of specific answers to the timing question, you should feel relaxed, as we are, that those things will play out as they are ready to play out. And we're not going to compromise value for the sake of timing. That said, there's nothing in the way of having those processes that are well down the curve delivering on the original timetables that we shared with you.","So, our confidence \u2013 as I said, I've got real conviction around the $10 billion. The processes are working as we would expect. Obviously, there's all kinds of moving parts that happen with every one of these negotiations, as you would expect, and while the way we get to the outcome may change, auctions \u2013 process by process, the outcome is within our reach and we continue to be committed to delivering it.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So if I could just, sorry, circle back and push a little bit. If you find yourself, six months from now, you're not getting the price that you think is warranted, I mean, would you consider just holding on to that business? I guess, I'm trying to think through worst case.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","So yes. So look we're not going to \u2013 we've said right up front, we're not going to \u2013 despite all the kind of commentary that's out there in the media, we're not going to do fire sales. So we're committed to getting the right value for these assets. You can look at precedent deals and have a pretty good view of what multiples you ought to be able to get on these different businesses versus peer multiples.","And so far we've done extremely well on those processes as evidenced by Waddington and Rawlings. And I think you should expect some that are really strong and others that are more aligned with historical norms. And those will play out as we finish the work. But, look, I'm not at all distracted by what I'm reading in the headlines, that's not the way these processes are playing out. We've had a lot of competitive interest in these assets. And as evidenced by our progress to-date and, you should expect us to continue to have that kind of success.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. And then if I could just ask one final question on your share repurchases.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Sure.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Given where your stock price is right now, just wondering maybe why you guys aren't being more aggressive with your share buybacks right now? And then how are you planning to balance the deleveraging and share repo through the end of this year and then maybe going forward? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Right. So we continue to be committed to allocate the net proceeds after-tax to both delevering and repurchasing shares. Obviously, at $16, $17, $18 a share we're deep value right now, so this is the sale of a lifetime, which is exciting in some ways and in other ways not so exciting. But we have the good fortune of having a strategy that has us bringing a significant amount of proceeds in the very near term and those proceeds are going to be put to work in the way we suggested they would be put to work.","So the good news is when we did our original work and thought about where our share price was going to be when the proceeds became available, we weren't ever envisioning $16 a share, or $17 a share, or $18 a share. So those proceeds have even more leverage than they previously had and we're looking forward to applying the capital once we have the opportunity to do so.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Bonnie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Lauren.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Good morning. Hey. So first thing was just when you guys talked through the impairment charge, you've mentioned the market cap of the company, but also a change in cash flow projections versus where you were a year ago. So I just want to confirm kind of what that long-term cash flow projection is now, which also may well not have changed versus two months ago, I realize it's an annual task. But I just wanted to double check on that.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah, Lauren, I'd separate our impairment testing from because my comments were really relative to the impairment test that we did a year ago. And so as we looked at the projections on the businesses we did update those internal projections again versus last year and feel frankly we've made reasonable estimates and been prudently conservative in terms of that outcome. And as both Mike and I mentioned again the majority of the charges related to the current market cap of the company on it. So it's really a reference to what was used in the impairment test last year was \u2013 is as we updated the projections.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So no change in terms of what we all would be expecting vis-\u00e0-vis conversations we've had with you publicly over the last couple of months?","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","No. I think, Mike talked about just earlier the outlook of the company, and how we see it over the next couple of years.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Can we just talk a little bit, I guess, about Appliances and I wasn't sure of in the language in the release, if there were incremental distribution losses or if this was just kind of a continuation of what started earlier in the year?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And just talk a little bit about any visibility you have into shelf space from \u2013 you know, promotional space and so on?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Sure.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then the online versus the offline activity around the Appliance business in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I think, the issue we have in Appliances is similar to the issue we have in Outdoor and in the reset windows from spring, we lost distribution on a couple of products categories in Appliances in coffee and in what we call cooking appliances at a mass, big mass retailer and same thing on coolers within Outdoor. Those losses were in the spring reset. And so what we've been experiencing through the entire year is lapping the comparators to a period where those \u2013 that distribution was in place. And as we come through the fourth quarter into the first and second quarters we fully lapped on both businesses those issues.","On Appliances, I think, there's more to sorting out that \u2013 those brands and our opportunities there in the U.S. than simply lapping distribution. That's why the innovation that we're beginning to bring to market is so important to the renovation of those brands. And so these are excellent assets with great equities, but those equities are latent. We need to apply the brand development agenda that we applied to brands like Graco and brands like Paper Mate over the last number of years to brands like Crock-Pot, to brands like Mr. Coffee, to brands like Oster in the U.S. And that's the work you're starting to see flow into the marketplace with the innovations I spoke to. That pipeline is full and we need to continue to develop it and we will. The other thing that we need to do on appliances in particular is make sure that the consumer can find the broad assortments that we will be launching on these brands in the U.S. And that's where it becomes really important for us to leverage the digital shelf which is way more broad than the physical shelf in brick-and-mortar environments.","It's important for the consumer to see the offerings we got and we'll bring to market on brands as we premiumize through functionality, form and finish these brands. And so e-commerce is an incredibly important element to the renovation of our appliance brands. And the team is working really hard to both land our innovations in the physical environment of brick-and-mortar while leveraging the e-environment in the digital shelf to profile the full assortment that we've got available. And I think it's the combination of those two things on Appliances that will be critical to our success going forward. That's why it takes a little bit more time I believe to get appliances up to its full potential. But I think you should still see sequential improvement in part through the innovation we're launching today when coupled with a more successful distribution outcome in 2019 across the business.","And of course, we've got a beautiful business in Latin America that's doing extremely well, run by a really investable team and leader. And we'll continue to invest there and the same in Australia, New Zealand. So we have a broader business and simply view as the thing we tend to talk about is the U.S. opportunity.","But that's the story on Appliances and we're glad to be through this start-up window and our brand development agenda in that business, and we're glad to start to see ideas like HEATSOFT technology on Oster hand mixers and the line of Teflon appliances that leverage all the equities of our cookware business now come into the space. And you should expect more from us as we move forward.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, great. Hi guys, good morning.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Steve.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. So first just a couple of cleanups on the fourth quarter guidance and then I have a follow-up. But on the cleanups, I think, the guidance implies about $700 million to $1 billion in fourth quarter operating cash flow. Just curious given where you stand now is there a reason to favor the high end, the low end, or is the midpoint a good reflection of your current plan? And then also you may have mentioned this, but just do you have an expectation for how much discontinued ops might contribute to your fourth quarter net income?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. So on operating cash flow, we've held our guidance range of $900 million to $1.2 billion. Obviously we had a very strong performance in the third quarter, part of that working capital-driven and some of that will kind of reverse out into the fourth quarter. But we know we're clear, we're beginning to get \u2013 make real traction here on the working capital front. We have a lot of room to run as you know with working capital optimization. So we expect to continue to reduce inventories into the fourth quarter. And the work we're doing on complexity reduction going forward will in 2019 enhance our ability to make further progress.","As I mentioned on payables, the procurement team is doing a nice job of both renegotiating and leveraging our scale to get fine synergies that flow through to the P&L. But as they're doing that they're also renegotiating payment terms with our sourcing partners.","And particularly in Appliances, we're getting some big wins on extended payables terms through the procurement work. So we're beginning to make progress. I think this is an area of focus and intense \u2013 significant opportunity and you should expect us to make more going forward.","But I do think that we've held guidance for the full year. You'll see some timing shifts from Q4 into Q3. But on balance we feel good about the progress we're making on cash flow. And obviously that's really important to the overall capital deployment strategy that we have. Ralph, I don't know whether you want to handle the other.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Well, we're not really guiding specifically on discontinued operations, but it's clearly reflected in the range that Mike alluded to.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes. I think the thing to think through is how you \u2013 if you're measuring progress quarter-to-quarter, I think you have to think through the timing effect of assets sold and how their income flows out of our disc ops P&L. So clearly Waddington and Rawlings were out of the P&L for the entire third quarter, but Goody was not. Goody sold later in the quarter. That will have an impact in Q4 and depending on timing on any of our other processes that might have an impact as well. Our guidance assumes we're holding with everything that's held through the end of the year, if something gets done faster there will be some impact to disc ops. But obviously we would prefer to get the processes done and reallocate the capital given where we are.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then you mentioned anticipated step up in A&P in the fourth quarter. And I guess, the question is...","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Is that always planned? Or are you spending back some of the upside you might be getting from Writing improving a bit faster-than-expected just to put yourself in a better position in 2019? And I ask that question just because stepping back from the outside I think there's some perception that just about everything Newell has been doing the last 12 months has been focusing on the here and now, fighting fire, trying to get back to the state of relative normalcy.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Sure. Yes.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And maybe there's some truth in that, but I was hoping you could just also talk about how much time the organization may have had to devote to longer-term planning setting out for future growth because, clearly, it's important to return to that stability, but then once we're there I guess what I'm trying to get at is how a position you think you are to resume growth. And can that pivot happen in 2019? Or is it going to take more time?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we've said that our \u2013 we said and I've communicated this in multiple occasions, but we think this business requires A&P spending between 4% and 5% of revenue. And in the third quarter, we spent in that range.","So the third quarter wasn't unusual relative to our normal range of spending; although, it was down versus prior year because, if you recall, prior year we got hung out without delivering the revenue, but you commit your spending well in advance. And so, that was the dynamic that was unique to Q4.","But we're not changing the way we think about brands and spending on the business. The marketers are focused on building their businesses and their brands over time. We're spending more in Q4 because money flows to ideas. And we've got a number of really interesting innovations that are unique and will benefit from us building awareness and driving trial on them. And we'll get the annuity of future purchases, repeat purchases or gifting purchases going forward, based on word of mouth and the experience that consumers have with the ideas we're bringing to market.","So our logic around the fourth quarter really isn't \u2013 it's not about trying to spend to develop the category for the next quarter. It's actually tied to the marketing programs we've got on these new product launches, and the seasonal spend associated with things like Yankee Candle and the Appliance businesses in the gifting season.","So we've got a lot of good ideas that are flowing to market. We've backed them up with money, which you should expect us to continue to do going forward. Q2, Q3, Q4 tend to be our higher-spending quarters, Q1 \u2013 because that's when the consumer is looking for our categories, and Q1 tends to be the lower spending quarter. And that's the way you should expect our A&P to flow over time.","You should also expect us to spend between 4% and 5% and, depending on how much progress we make on cost and margin, we will have flexibility to spend more towards the high end of that range in any given quarter; or, if we got ideas coming, we'll spend to the high end of that range. And when we \u2013 and so, there's incentive on the part of the marketing organization \u2013 the divisions to find the room in their P&L to invest.","Clearly, our focus has been across those five priorities that I described to you. And one of them is cost and one of them is cash; one of them is profitable growth. And so, those three agendas all intersect to create the brand-building work we do.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you so much.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hi, Olivia.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, Mike. I want to get back to core sales, because you do seem more optimistic than you were last quarter, given quite a few initiatives and the pricing. And we're also one quarter further removed from the Writing reset and the Toys 'R' Us liquidation. But you aren't committing to the growth that you felt comfortable with three months ago, so just trying to understand what's changed over the course of the last three months that makes you less comfortable with committing to that low single-digit growth target that you voiced last quarter?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's a good \u2013 a fair question. We've got \u2013 I just want to make sure we give ourselves the room to succeed. And overpromising and debating tenths of basis points of core sales growth when every tenth represents about $9 million of revenue, which is about four hours of daily sales, is not a situation I want to find ourselves in going forward. That said, there is \u2013 I think it's going to take a little bit longer on Appliances and on Coleman to kind of deal with some of the challenges we have in those businesses. I don't want to rush the work in Europe on Home Fragrance Europe, where we're trying to unwind a set of tactics that I don't think are sustainable.","So if I put pressure into that system for them to solve that problem quickly, we end up actually not getting the margin benefit we hope to get. And I think we got to see those things all the way through before leaning our shoulder into getting the growth. And so, I mean, there are things like that that cause me to be a little bit more cautious. But they are on the edges and we're taking a lot of price connected to tariffs. And look, you don't \u2013 you can't really fully account for the volume sensitivities and elasticities associated with those pricing actions. So giving ourselves a little bit more breathing room for the price vol mix kind of play out in the marketplace given the sequential pricing we've taken, I think, is a prudent thing to do.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's helpful. Thank you, Mike. And then, if I could just switch over to a quick housekeeping on gross margin. Can you guys break down the drivers between pricing productivity, FX, et cetera, just so that we can better understand the path going forward?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I think the biggest contributors in the quarter \u2013 underlying contributors were pricing and programming. And productivity \u2013 gross productivity and the flow through of productivity to gross margin is accelerating, particularly what we call VAVE, which is the work we do on packaging cost, the work we do on our product design costs. Those should continue to get traction and accelerate through the fourth quarter into next year.","Procurement is another source of savings to gross margin and it's obviously been a big contributor over the last number of years to our synergy delivery. Procurement will continue to play a role, as I was mentioning, on those sourcing contracts. They're offset by higher inflation in resin and in energy; although, it's intriguing to see what's happened the last couple of days on energy prices. We'll see how that plays through to the market; and clearly, tariffs which has been sort of this dynamic situation.","So we were pleased with the outcome on gross margin in Q3. Part of that was driven by the recovery in Writing, and the over delivery on Writing, but some of that Writing mix benefit was offset by Home Fragrance not delivering its numbers. And so, it sort of washed out. But going forward, I think mix has the potential to play a role in a way it hasn't up until now as Writing gets into a more consistent rhythm of growth, and we lap some of the Home Fragrance headwinds related to getting into a more virtuous rhythm of growing in Europe that is more profitable. And so, we'll see. We'll see how that plays out, but those are really the moving parts within gross margin that we have to keep a close eye on and that we will manage very actively.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one more question. Our final question comes from Nik Modi with RBC capital.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hi, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good morning. Hey, Mike. How are you? Just I was hoping you can just give some context on the CFO search. I know we're getting to the end of the year here, so just wanted to see if we can get an update on that. And if I could just squeeze another one in on your Writing business in Latin America and if you can provide some context on how that's doing at the moment. Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah, sure. So our Writing business I'll start with the second part of the question and close with the first, Nik, if you don't mind. The Writing business in Latin America has not had a good year in 2018. In part because there was a dynamic that was happening out of Latin America that was creating pricing problems in North America in the e-commerce marketplaces. And so we pulled back hard on the throttle this year in Latin America to eliminate and dry up the 3P sales that were finding their way into the U.S. and creating issues for our 1P sales on e-com marketplaces whether they were retail.com or Amazon.","And so our logic for this was we want to get the ASPs, the average sale price up so that our partners can achieve their \u2013 our strategic partners can achieve their margin expectations and therefore allocate our gross-to-net programming to programming as opposed to inside margin. That's a lot of detail and I'm sorry for that. But Latin America Writing had a down year as we cleaned up a whole bunch of noise that was hurting our ability to drive profitable sales through our e-com marketplaces in the U.S.","That work is largely behind us, so the good news is we come out of the third quarter and can start to more profitably grow and we have to maintain the disciplines in Latin America to avoid the diversion issues that created problems for us in North America. So on Writing LatAm that's the commentary we'll provide, and I think, we're going to find ourselves in a better place going forward.","On the CFO search, we're well on our way. We've had good engagement with a number of candidates both internal and external. The Board is engaged in the process and we're coming down the home stretch.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Polk for closing remarks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Well, what I would like to say actually if I don't see any names in the queue is I'd like to say something to our people, which is, thank you. The kind of determination, perseverance and drive for results that you've demonstrated through an incredibly difficult chapter in our history has been remarkable to be part of with you. And I can't tell you how much of an asset that is to our company going forward.","And I'm looking forward to putting another quarter of progress on the board in the fourth quarter and then turning the page to 2019 and getting back into a more normal rhythm of performance that we've all become accustomed to in our recent history. So, thank you for that and thank you for all of our investors that have been patient with us through this period of time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, a replay of today's call will be available later today on our website at newellbrands.com.

After a brief discussion by management, we will open up the call for questions. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellbrands.com on the Investor Relations home page under Events & Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download.","I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Mike Polk, our Chief Executive Officer; and Ralph Nicoletti, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to point out that we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, core sales and normalized EPS. Schedules of non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in our press release. Forward-looking statements made during the call reflect our current views. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations due to a number of risks and uncertainties which are described in our press release and SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements going forward.","Thank you. And I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. We've had a good start to the year. Consistent, competitive growth coupled with increased earnings momentum and in-line cash flow delivery have allowed us to raise earnings guidance and increase the dividend.","Net sales were about $50 million above our expectations and core sales grew 2.5%, with growth in all four regions and in four of our five new reporting segments. This is a competitive outcome in a volatile environment that was enabled by our multi-year focus on brands, innovation and e-commerce, and our ability to play our portfolio across diversified categories, channels and geographies.","We delivered over $115 million of savings, which generated good, normalized operating margin. And, as a result, we achieved stronger than expected normalized EPS of $0.34.","We've reaffirmed our full year 2017 net sales and core sales guidance, and have raised normalized EPS guidance by $0.05, reflecting our latest estimate of held for sale timing in a less negative forex impact than originally expected.","We're pleased and particularly encouraged by some specific performances. E-commerce, which represents over 10% of our global net sales, grew strong double digits. Our international markets contributed meaningfully to our overall core sales growth, with nearly 12% growth in Latin America, over 5% growth in Europe, and over 4% growth in Asia-Pacific.","Within the five new segments, we had standout business unit results on Writing, Baby, Appliances, Waddington, Jostens and Process Solutions. Each of these businesses delivered core growth of greater than 5%. And Yankee Candle returned to growth, driven by continued double-digit growth in Europe, building momentum behind distribution wins in North America, and our new personalization platform making its way to our retail stores towards the end of the quarter. While inventory reduction by U.S. retailers was a meaningful headwind in the first quarter, I'm encouraged by how well our businesses delivered through this turbulence.","In the U.S., our aggregate market share grew over 40 basis points in Q1 and we grew market share in categories that generate two-thirds of our U.S. sales. Our differentiated relative performance has been enabled by our ability to quickly adapt programming to changing conditions, our leverage in the scale and diversification of our category and channel footprint, and our agile ways of working as a hands-on entrepreneurial leadership team.","In the first quarter, we've also made very good progress strengthening and focusing our portfolio, completing six transactions in or just subsequent to the quarter. We completed two acquisitions, the Sistema food storage business and the WoodWick fragranced candles business and four divestitures: tools, consumer storage totes, fire building and fire starting, and our rope and chain business. And we've announced an agreement to divest Teutonia, our central European baby gear business.","With the available net proceeds from divestitures, we reduced debt by over $700 million, bringing our cumulative debt reduction since the Jarden transaction to nearly $2.8 billion as of the end of the first quarter.","So we're making good progress and I'm very proud of our people. They've achieved these strong results in the context of significant organization change and the startup of our new operating model. Importantly, the board shares this confidence, and this morning we announced a 21% increase to the quarterly dividend.","So, as I said, a good start to 2017. Let me hand the call over to Ralph for a deeper dive into the quarter and then I'll return to provide perspective on the balance of the year and reflections on the path forward.","Ralph, over to you.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As Mike noted, we are delivering competitive results in the midst of transforming our organization. We achieved 2.5% core sales growth, delivering over $115 million in synergies and Project Renewal savings, and made good progress deleveraging the balance sheet. We believe we are well positioned to deliver our full year forecast despite a challenging environment.","As we walk down the income statement, I want to point out that we are in our last full quarter of comping against pre-Jarden transaction results. This makes it a bit more difficult to parse out the underlying progress of the business, as the acquired Jarden businesses had a margin dilutive impact on combined results and, of course, we now carry higher interest expense and share count.","On an underlying basis, we are generating strong operating income growth and the work we're doing on cost synergies and Project Renewal savings is having a meaningful positive impact on margins. These benefits will become more visible after we anniversary the transaction on April 15, 2017.","So with that in mind, let me turn to the details. First quarter reported net sales were $3.3 billion, a 148% increase versus last year, which was largely attributable to the Jarden transaction. Core sales increased 2.5%, with notable growth drivers being in Baby, Appliances, Writing, Food Storage, Jostens, Waddington and Process Solutions. Core sales growth was broad-based geographically with growth in all regions.","Reported gross margin was 34.2% compared with 38.5% last year. Normalized gross margin was 34.5%, compared with 38.6% last year. The declines in both reported and normalized gross margins were driven by the negative mix effect related to the Jarden transaction, input cost inflation and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency, which more than offset the benefits of synergies and productivity.","We reported SG&A expense of $930 million, or 28.5% of sales, a 100 basis point decline versus last year despite higher acquisition and integration costs. Normalized SG&A expense was $778 million, or 23.8% of sales, a 170 basis point decline.","The improvement in both SG&A ratios is driven by the mix effect from the Jarden legacy businesses, which with the exception of Jostens has historically carried a lower SG&A ratio. SG&A also benefited from cost synergies and other savings, which more than offset the impact of the incremental investments we are making in brand development, insights and e-commerce.","Reported operating margin was 4.8% of sales, compared with 9.5% in the prior year. Normalized operating margin was 10.6%, compared to 13.1% in the prior year. Interest expense of $122 million was an increase of $93 million year-over-year, reflecting higher borrowings used to finance the Jarden acquisition.","We continue to anticipate 2017 interest expense of around $475 million. Our reported tax rate was 19.2%, compared with last year's reported tax rate of 21.9%. The normalized tax rate was 28.1%, compared with 27.2% in the previous year. We continue to expect the 2017 tax rate to be about 23%, reflecting anticipated discrete tax benefits in the third quarter, where you should see the rate substantially below the other quarters in the high single digit low double-digit range.","We ended the quarter with 486 million diluted shares outstanding, up from 270 million in the prior year, reflecting the shares issued for the Jarden acquisition. We now expect the full year share count to be at or around 490 million shares.","Reported EPS was $1.31 compared with $0.15 last year, which is largely attributable to the impact of the $784 million gain on the Tools divestiture. Normalized EPS, which excludes that gain as well as transaction-related expenses and certain other charges was $0.34, compared with $0.40 last year.","Turning now to our segment results. Please note that we are now reporting in our new segment structure of Live, Learn, Work, Play and Other. You can refer to our IR website for a detailed review of the new segments and a preliminary unaudited recast of 2016 quarterly data.","Our new Live segment, which includes Appliances & Cookware, Food, Baby and Home Fragrance divisions, generated net sales of $1.1 billion, compared with $322 million in the prior year. Core sales increased 2.7%, reflecting strong results from baby innovation, appliance merchandising and club channel growth and new distribution on Food Storage, partially offset by some softness in Cookware, as it comped the launch of Calphalon Select in the prior-year period.","Net sales in the Learn segment, which comprises Writing, Jostens and Fine Writing, were $569 million, compared with $385 million in the prior year. Core sales increased 7.6%, driven by strong growth on both Writing and Jostens. Writing growth was driven by geographic expansion on Sharpie, innovation on both Sharpie and EXPO and slime-related promotion on Elmer's, partially offset by retailer inventory reductions in pens and pencils in the distributive trade. Jostens growth was driven by good underlying results in Scholastic and new business related to the Cubs World Series rings.","In the Work segment, which includes Consumer & Commercial solutions, Waddington and Safety & Security, net sales were $614 million, compared with $269 million in the prior year. Pro forma core sales declined 2.9%. Waddington contributed strong growth across all of its product categories with continued double-digit growth on the Eco product line. The Commercial & Consumer solutions business was negatively impacted by inventory destocking, primarily in the distributor channel, and some refuse and cleaning distribution losses in the home center channel.","The Play segment, including Outdoor & Recreation, Fishing and Team Sports, generated net sales of $628 million, compared with $61 million in the prior year. Pro forma core sales grew 0.5% as growth from Contigo beverage containers, Coleman coolers and Team Sports was partially offset by inventory destocking at Fishing and ongoing challenges on Coleman camping.","The Other segment, comprised of Process Solutions, Home & Family and assets Held for Sale, contributed $388 million, compared with $278 million in the prior year. Core sales grew 12%, with good growth on (13:41) and Process Solutions. About $8 million of the Process Solutions growth relates to zinc pass-through pricing with the balance driven by volume growth and distribution gains in both coinage and applied materials.","During Q1, operating cash use of $289 million reflects the expected seasonal nature of working capital across both legacy businesses. Also, this year there are some anomalies in the pacing of cash flow that I would like to point out. Cash tax payments of around $340 million, related to our tools divestiture, will flow through operating cash flow starting in the second quarter. Additionally, cash interest payments related to the increased debt levels from the Jarden transaction occur primarily in April and October, whereas last year, payments started in October.","Importantly, we remain on target to achieve our deleveraging program goals for the end of 2017. As of today, we have reduced gross debt by $1.1 billion through our recently completed tender offer. We expect to pay down approximately $1.8 billion of debt in total this year, and cumulatively $3.9 billion since the acquisition of Jarden. As a result, we expect to have leverage at about the targeted EBITDA range at the end of the year, well ahead of schedule.","In summary, we are pleased with the progress we made during the quarter as we both delivered on our commitments and invested in the future during a time of significant transition.","I'll now turn the call back to Mike.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Ralph. Let me now give some quick context on our outlook for the balance of the year and then transition to a discussion about the progress we're making transforming the company.","This morning, we've reaffirmed our 2017 full year guidance for net sales and core sales growth, and raised our normalized EPS guidance by about $0.05, actually, exactly $0.05 per share to $3.20. There are two factors that can influence where we fall in our 2017 full year guidance ranges: the delivery of our synergies and savings commitments, and the consumer response to our planned brand activities.","With respect to our cost synergies and savings programs, we're right on track. We delivered over $115 million of incremental cost savings in the first quarter against our full year commitment of greater than $300 million. These savings have emerged quickly because we acted with speed in 2016, implementing both the first and second waves of procurement savings and the rapid reconfiguration of our organization.","While in the first quarter the benefit of these savings are not as visible in our year-over-year normalized EPS results because of legacy Jarden seasonally low profits and the negative impact of incremental interest expense and higher share counts associated with the transaction, the savings are flowing into the P&L just as we expected, strengthening our underlying margins and also funding our strategic growth investments. So we're right on track with where we expected to be, and the disciplined execution of the Transformation Office gives us full confidence in our 2017 delivery.","We're also making good progress and expect to deliver competitive levels of core growth towards the middle of our full year guidance range. Our core growth delivery will be dependent on excellent execution of our growth priorities, continued strong e-commerce growth, and continued market share gains in an environment of modest category growth.","Despite withstanding substantial inventory pressure over the last six months, we're beginning to realize many of the revenue opportunities of the combination. We also see the benefits of our investments in e-commerce, design, innovation and brand-building, yielding strengthened new product, new distribution and new marketing plans in many of the businesses.","We just launched new products like Sharpie Art Pens, EXPO Ink Indicator markers, Paper Mate Color Leads mechanical pencils, Ball Spiral Fresh preserving jars, Crock-Pot Cook & Carry portable crockpots, Rubbermaid balance Meal Kits, and Graco SnugLoc, a new product that dramatically simplifies car seat installation.","We're deploying our portfolio and driving new distribution with Coleman camping and cooler wins in the club channel, Paper Mate InkJoy gels now expanded to Europe, the direct selling of Graco baby gear in Canada, and Yankee Candle U.S. wholesale distribution wins which should help the business in the second half of 2017.","And we're driving new brand activity to markets around making slime with Elmer's to meet the incredible consumer-driven need to make slime with Elmer's and personalization kiosks into every U.S. Yankee Candle store by Mother's Day, and by broadening our back-to-school eventing beyond writing to include Marmot, Rubbermaid food storage and Contigo, many of these programs amplified by our rapidly scaling e-commerce capability in both Retailer.com and pure plays like Amazon.","So again, we have a line of sight to delivering consistent, competitive growth with full year core sales growth towards the middle of the guidance range.","Perhaps as importantly for the long term, we're making two substantial capability investments. First, we're expanding our brand development and design capabilities across much of the newly-scaled portfolio. We've fielded new product concepts and to test at a high pace with nearly 500 ideas tested since the beginning of the year through May, and the test results are encouraging.","The second big investment we're making is in e-commerce. We are leveraging and substantially expanding the combined resources of both legacy companies into a new enterprise-wide, global e-commerce division. This standalone division has global P&L responsibility for all aspects of our Retailer.com, direct-to-consumer and pure-play businesses. The division is about 250 people strong, on its way to over 500 people by year end, with many experienced e-commerce leaders having joined Newell Brands from the outside.","We believe e-commerce is already an advantaged capability for Newell Brands and with these investments we hope to widen the gap. So while we're mindful of the challenging retail environment and the potential for more retailer turbulence through the second quarter, our confidence in our delivery is grounded in the knowledge that we have a leading portfolio at brands, we have advantaged capabilities in innovation and design, a peer group-leading e-commerce organization, a long list of opportunities for international deployment and core distribution, the scale to out-spend and out-execute our competition, and a world-class team working on realizing the savings and cash benefits of the Jarden combination, and a track record of integrating new acquisitions with cost and revenue benefits quickly captured. This is a proven model and playbook that we've executed before and we're confident we can again.","We believe Newell Brands represents a unique opportunity and this is a unique moment. We have the privilege of leading the development of one of the most exciting household good brand portfolios in the world, brands that hundreds of millions of times every day help make life better for consumers where they live, learn, work and play. These brands compete in large growing global categories, categories that are responsive to brand activity and innovation, categories that are unconsolidated, composed of subscale competition, with little to no private-label competition.","As a result, these are categories with low cost of growth which creates the opportunity, with relatively modest investment, to deliver competitive performance. The scale benefit of the combination with Jarden and our new operating model unlocks substantial investment firepower, releasing $1.3 billion of synergies and savings, funding the creation of an advantaged set of capabilities and innovation in e-commerce, and increased brand A&P, while simultaneously driving margin improvement.","We expect these investments, when applied against subscale competition, to drive consistently competitive core sales growth. And when coupled with expected normalized operating margins, increase to yield double-digit earnings per share growth compounded over the next five years. We're actively strengthening the portfolio, focusing our actions on categories with the greatest potential. With net proceeds from divestitures and cash from operations, we've reduced debt by nearly $3 billion as of the first anniversary of the Jarden transaction. And in early 2018, we expect to reach our targeted leverage ratio range of 3 times to 3.5 times, about one year ahead of our original plan.","We also expect annual cash from operations to approach and then pass through the $2 billion per year threshold, reaching that milestone no later than 2019. With today's announcement, we've raised the dividend in line with our targeted payout ratio range of 30% to 35%, and we expect to grow the dividend in line with earnings going forward. We believe that the annual cash from operations after CapEx and dividends, coupled with increasing borrowing capacity from 2018 onward, will create further opportunity to complement the very competitive organic outcomes described in this talk with further M&A derived benefits.","We expect Newell Brands to be one of the most transformative value creation stories in the consumer goods industry. We are clear in the path forward and could not be more committed in our drive to deliver. That is our unique opportunity and why this is our unique moment.","Let me pass the line back to Eric to help facilitate questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Couple of questions from me. Mike, about two quarters ago you talked about organizational screen. The organization is moving so fast through the transition. Where are we in that process? Is it starting to fade away in terms of people getting back, some of the screen being lifted, more alignment, more line of sight in terms of what they need to do? And then the second question, just from a macro perspective, many companies that have reported so far have indicated Jan and Feb are tough, though March and April look like they've improved. So I was hoping you can provide some context on that and where we are on this whole inventory destocking situation.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. The organization change, Nik, that I was referring to was really quite profound, particularly in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017, we ramped the organization and got into a rhythm rent to speed and got into a rhythm of operating. So we're coming through that start-up curve in the first quarter and in that context we're quite pleased with the outcomes. The more distance we put to those changes, the better that rhythm will be and the better the execution will be.","So that certainly is a variable that will help us over time. There are changes happening in different parts of the world. We focused in the U.S. first because that's, obviously, where the biggest revenue stream is and we've made those changes largely now. We've moved on and made changes in Canada and we will, over time, make changes in other parts of the business, but the vast majority of the change in our biggest market is behind us.","With respect to category growth, category growth has been modest. I think it's very difficult for you guys to see that in the data that you look at, if you're pulling syndicated data for two reasons. One, syndicated data has never been a great predictor of our business because of the coverage issues associated with our channel breadth. And secondly, given the development of our e-commerce business at 10% of revenue globally, it's even higher in the U.S. And given the strong double-digit growth that's happening in that channel and given the fact that the syndicated sources don't really cover most of that, you guys wouldn't see what we're capable of seeing in our models.","That said, growth has been modest and the thing that's driving our performance is share performance in the measured channels, which I mentioned, the rapid growth of our e-commerce business, and actually the international contributions. And the diversity of our categories is a real strength in moments like this, where we cover \u2013 we have a broad set of categories that compete in different context than traditional retail.","So all of these things contributed to the very competitive performance we had in the quarter and will continue to contribute going forward. We don't expect and we don't see a material shift in category growth at this point, so our growth going forward is really going to be dependent on the things we do, which will be all about executing our growth priorities and continuing to develop and diversify our portfolio of channels to include the big e-commerce bet that we're making.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just looking at the four new segments you have, I'm curious as you think about over the next few years, obviously, Learn is already tremendously profitable, but of the Live, Work and Play segments, where do you think there is the greatest structural opportunity to cut costs? Can you rank those businesses, obviously, Learn at the very top and then the other three? Ultimately, what kind of margin should each of those segments generate or at least how much improvement do you think we can get out of each one? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. Good question, Wendy. Look, I think everyone of our businesses will see their operating margins improve. Other may be challenging depending on what's going on with commodity dynamics. There may be moments where that doesn't step up. It could move one way or the other on us but each of Live, Learn, Work, Play will get the benefit of synergies playing through. We've talked about this before, about a third of those synergies flow to gross margin. About two thirds of them flow to overheads. So some of those will see pretty good gross margin progression based on sourcing benefits and procurement benefits flowing to margin and all of them will see the benefits of overhead reductions and those are pretty profound.","We've got a good chunk of our synergies, cost savings, and Project Renewal savings in flight, but we have a lot still ahead of us, so I think all categories will see improvements. Sometimes you'll be able to see that in a quarterly result, sometimes you won't because, as you know, we manage resources, A&P resources, very dynamically. We don't let those resources get trapped in segments or in divisions, so we move them around through this hands-on sort of entrepreneurial approach to putting the money where the news is. And that can cause, in any given moment, a category operating margin to contract as a result of a surge in spending, but that's part of the strategy.","Our scale leverage is in some ways applied when we tackle a category country sell and flood that sell with resources to establish a brand or build a bit of news out, in a way that our subscale competition can't. So that dynamic management of resources may lead to less visibility to what I've just said to you, and that in any given quarter we might step back. But, in general, with $1.3 billion of cost synergies and savings from the Transformation Office flowing into the P&L, every business should improve their operating margins over time.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then just another question if I can, a quick one. The product line exits and SKU discontinuations or whatever you want to call it for this year. I mean, given where you are, kind of year-end of the integration, do you think that number needs to go up over the next 12, 18, 24 months? Are you finding \u2013 forget about just inventory reductions in the trade, but just as you think about the businesses, is there much more opportunity to streamline what you offer in terms of the range of SKUs such that that might negatively impact the top line as we go into next year? I know that's a long time away, but just order of magnitude. Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","So great question. We will continuously work on reducing the complexity in this business. And there's an important working capital benefit associated with that and I think there's also a margin benefit associated with that. Our efforts to date have been focused in parts of the Work segment on Rubbermaid Commercial Products and within the Learn segment on our Writing and Creative Expression businesses.","As we discussed in prior calls, the writing work, the complexity reduction for Writing will happen in two tranches, one that we just finished in this cycle of Q4, Q1 and another that will occur again in Q4, Q1 of 2017, 2018. But, all that said, we're not going to take a pass on growth because we're executing those changes. These are changes that will need to be planned and delivered through. So, we had some challenges in Commercial Products, if you go back to Q3 with that transition, but, in general, we ought to be able to grow through the change.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. So can you discuss your near-term, top line visibility here in the balance of the year, particularly in Q2 given the difficult comparison and the tough environment in CPG in general? And to turn the question into more of a strategic longer-term question, it seems like, based on your comments, there was some U.S. retailer inventory pressure, but obviously the strong market share performance in your portfolio sort of offset that. So can you just give us an update on the level of top line responsiveness you think you're seeing in your business to higher spending and marketing and R&D, both on the heritage Newell side where you're years into the higher spending, but also any initial thoughts on the Jarden business so far and its response to higher spending, or if that's more to come going forward? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Dara. It's a good question. We expect more headwinds in the second quarter connected to the retailer transitions that are occurring. We were successful in overcoming that headwind in Q1 as a result of the diversity of our portfolio and channels, as a result of the share gains in modest growing categories, as a result of the broad-based growth in the international contribution, and as a result of the tremendous surge in momentum we have in e-commerce. So those four variables contributed to our ability to deal with the acute issue that's happening \u2013 was happening on inventories in the U.S. That algorithm is available to us and we continue to expect it to serve us for the balance of the year.","Our momentum on legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses with brands and innovation is contributing to the market share growth, but we also have good growth on appliances in reasonably healthy categories. So there are pockets of growth that cut across the entire portfolio that are fundamentally driven, despite the inventory pressures that are in the system.","As I said, we expect that to continue into Q2. We don't know for how long, but we expect it to continue and we're assuming it does in our planning. These things are not as \u2013 these types of issues are not as smooth and predictable as you'd like them to be, but we've got that built into our thinking.","With respect to heavy up spend, we're actually not spending at heavy up levels yet. We expect Q2 and Q3 spending to be up versus prior year as a percentage of revenue as we come into high seasonality for many of our businesses, but our market share growth in the first quarter was not spending derived. It was derived from new products, strong new products, good sales execution in the face of turbulent headwinds, and the other three variables; diversification, the channel and portfolio geography and e-commerce.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the e-commerce side as a follow-up, did you see growth accelerate significantly in the quarter versus recent trend if you look at the last few quarters as you put some of the learnings from the Jarden side of the business to work or with the new organizational structure and head count you mentioned you're bringing in? And if I could slip one last one in, the synergy number was really strong in the quarter, greater than $115 million. So wouldn't that imply upside to your $300 million full year synergy number? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I think I'll take the first question, and Ralph, you can take the second. But on e-commerce, we have \u2013 both companies, both legacy companies had strong histories and had made significant investments in establishing an approach to e-commerce. And what we're doing is leveraging that history, those teams, and now scaling it in an integrated enterprise-wide global capability.","And we saw tremendous growth in both pure play and Retailer.com in the quarter and very good growth in our D2C businesses. Our focus is on pure play and Retailer.com. That's where our energy is going. We in fact just came back from our fourth annual Top to Top at Amazon, and we're having ongoing conversations with the Targets and Staples and the Walmart dot-coms of this world about how to scale our presence.","We're learning as we go. I mean, the growth results were extraordinary. The growth as a percentage of revenue is more than two times, at least in my experience, more than two times the size of most fast-moving consumer goods. So the channel contribution to the company is quite large in the U.S. more than 10%. And we're learning, but we're learning as we go.","We executed a really brilliant thing at Amazon, a corporate event with 500 different items profiled in the Newell Brands day, a web takeover at Amazon in January, which really worked. And so we have tremendous opportunity here both in getting the right assortment available, in the geographic expansion of our presence where our retail partners are, and so we expect to be able to continue to push this and over time accelerate the growth contribution.","As you know, we expect 50% of the growth between now and 2021 to be derived through e-com, that by 2021, we're north, probably north of 20%, maybe as high as 22% of our total revenue. And this scale in this channel positions us well to deliver differentiated growth rates versus our peer group of companies.","And so strategically, we know this is critical. The two planks, really three planks that will drive the company going forward are brands and innovation, the playbook we've executed in the legacy Newell Rubbermaid story, e-commerce development, the story that's unfolding as we speak with a big differentiated bet made there, and geographic deployment, international geographic deployment. These three things are the big levers available to us as we set up the future. And you should expect us to pull them in the right way, in the right sequence as the organization is ready for us to do so.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","And, Dara, just regarding your question on the flow of synergies, you are right, the way it looked in the first quarter, we were above what I'll call an average run rate for what we projected, which as Mike said, we're right on track to be over $300 million of synergies and renewal savings this year. But the principal reason in the first quarter you see the number elevated is that in the first quarter, related to Jarden, there was a lot of executive management costs that we are now, we're saving and we're realizing those in the first quarter. So that will balance out a little bit more evenly over the course of the year.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Hey, just going back to the commentary maybe six months ago about how much of the business you were either going to divest or exit, where are we on that? It seems like most of it has gone towards divest and you haven't really exited a whole lot of that business. Is that the right way to look at it in terms of going forward on the effect on the P&L and core sales?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. We've been able to sell many of the assets we were worried we wouldn't be able to. And that's worked out well for us. So as you know, there are two bigger divestitures left to draw to completion. One is the winter sports business and there's a process in full flight around that. The other is our heaters, humidifiers and fans business, which we're just ramping to begin. Our assumptions are that we can move quickly on heaters, humidifiers and fans, and that we get the winter sports business wrapped up sometime in Q2.","And then there's some smaller brands that we're also working on, but they really are not going to be material in the scheme of things. We've absorbed a bunch of headwinds on the business over the last year that we haven't really spoken a lot about and those are embedded in our core sales performance with respect to either geographic exits of categories or individual product families. But those things are largely behind us. We'll always be weeding the portfolio and so you shouldn't expect us to not have those things ahead of us, but I don't think any of them will be substantial enough to really talk about with you guys or call out.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Well, is there a way to quantify? Like, I'm looking at sales growth this year, how much now exits will impact that core.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think that they will be a material impact on our \u2013 material headwind in the business. The bigger challenge in the business as headwind is the retail landscape, which we've talked about. Without that, you would've seen different outcomes in our core growth numbers and that would have been an easier bridge back to our prior commentary.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then...","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","But, I really don't want to dimensionalize specifically how much the inventory effect was because I've consistently said that we've got to work around that. That's just the way it is in the industry these days as consumers shift channels and we need to reach consumers where they shop and that headwind is something we need to accept and overcome.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just a couple of specific, maybe a further update now that we're a quarter into the writing instrument launch in China, where you think that's going. And also on Yankee Candle, since Mother's Day is, as a reminder, this Sunday. Maybe how April and early May have gone, do you feel like that's a good testament that Yankee Candle is in good hands or in a good place after a turbulent holiday season?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes. So as I said in the script, we've taken this personalization platform into every Yankee Candle store in the U.S. So we've now created these kiosks in-store where you can do personalization. We've also, and we're in the midst of bringing WoodWick, as a brand, in store, so that we've broadened the brand footprint within our Yankee Candle stores. It's too early to know whether, how this will play out on the full year. I will tell you, some of the feedback we're getting from our store associates with respect to the personalization platforms is, it's extraordinary how excited people are and the kind of testimonials we're getting. You pay a premium price to do customization and personalization in-store but the kind of engagement is really promising.","It's too early to declare whether that's a function of timing related to Mother's Day or whether that's going to be a sustaining impact for \u2013 a positive impact for us. I'm convinced that there will be a word-of-mouth effect that will help traffic into the stores over time given the amount of emotion you read in some of the testimonials we're receiving. But that's still to be proven. I'm also quite confident that WoodWick in-store is going to be an added value addition.","All that said, I think we will continue to have pressure on retail. Our guidance assumes negative comps on retail and our model assumes we build a business, a growth business, on Yankee Candle through the wholesale footprint trying to replicate the per-capita consumption metrics we've got in the UK, which interestingly enough is the strongest per capita development of the business. And so there's tremendous opportunity for North American wholesale distribution. Even if it comes at the expense of our own retail stores, we are going to make Yankee Candle available to consumers where they shop and we've not really begun in Canada beyond one retail partnership and there's opportunity across Europe for the brand.","So we're very optimistic about the future of our Home Fragrance business. We've got a lot of people working really hard to kind of build this platform out. I think personalization and e-commerce will be a big part of the story over time and we want the brand presence and availability to be within arm's reach of the consumer. So there's a lot of work happening here, but the one thing I will say is that you should not expect us to get the positive comps and we don't, either in year expect for positive comps with retail no matter what we do in that setting and our strategic plan assumes a ratcheting down of our retail presence over time as consumers shift online with their purchases. So that story is going to play out, we're very confident about the outcome and we're excited to continue to invest in the business to be able to deliver that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congratulations on the quarter. First one Ralph, on cash flow, and then I have a follow-up question on the core sales guidance. But, with respect to cash flow, Ralph, thanks for the guidance there looking out to 2019. I think that's helpful for people, with respect to reaching close to $2 billion a year by 2019.","A few questions there. Can you confirm that all cash costs associated with the Jarden synergies are included in that? Second question would be, is there any working capital benefit? And then the third piece maybe Mike, this one is for you, neither the near-term annual comp or long-term incentive include cash or ROIC, if I'm not mistaken it's normalized EPS, core sales, normalized EBITDA and TSR. Is the inclusion of cash flow or ROIC something you think the board would consider? And then I have a follow-up on the core sales guidance. Thanks.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. First, the numbers include all results of operations, so cash flow doesn't get adjusted for anything. So that would include any type of costs related to integration and in particular would reflect the stepped-up investments we're making to ensure the delivery of the $1.3 billion that Mike had guided to, so that's clearly in there.","And then in terms of working capital, very, very modest improvement in working capital. We're really focusing the near and here on the organization and the stability and to get the business on the continued momentum that we're building, but limited working capital is counted \u2013 improvement is counted in that number. So we would view that as probably an upside as we get traction on that over time.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","And then with respect to the question about cash flow or ROIC in the comp structure, I think it's an important topic and it's one that we're discussing with the board for 2018 and beyond. My orientation is to drive towards cash flow metric as part of the long-term comp. It will keep the pressure in the system to deliver through that $2 billion threshold which we think we crossover in 2019 and obviously it's a big part of the story, perhaps an underappreciated part of the story given the transition year we're in and the cash taxes associated with the Tools gain. But this is going to be \u2013 this plus the steady, consistent competitive levels of core growth, this is the story and this is the thing that adds optionality to the value creation element of the story.","And so we're excited by it, we're energized by it, we want to deliver it, and I think you're right, I think that we should in some way be held accountable for it through some of our, either our short-term or long-term comp. The board will make that call. It's actually on the agenda for tomorrow's board meeting believe it or not. But, we'll see how that all plays out over the next couple of board meetings. It won't go into effect obviously until 2018. We made the judgment this year, as you know, to flip gross margin percentage into the mix so that we created a sharpness of accountability in that space and I think that will serve us well also, but I think your point is well taken. You had a follow-up on core sales.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Thanks for the comments there on cash flow. So, Mike, the follow-up is, it seems like category growth has certainly slowed not just in your business but across the board but you maintained guidance. So you talked about a bunch of this. But \u2013 so implicitly your outlook for the underlying business and the market share gains that you hope to achieve has gotten better. So a couple of things; what specifically does get better? And then, Mike, I think you talked about modest category growth, is that flat? Is that closer to one to two? So just trying to better understand what gets you to 2.5% to 4% in the balance of the year and is 4% attainable? If category growth is something closer to flat to up 1%, is 4% even on the table? So any commentary there would be helpful. Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes. So, good question. So we guided towards the midpoint of our guidance range of 2.5% to 4%. We delivered 2.5% in the first quarter. Obviously, we delivered it in a slightly different way than we anticipated given the inventory headwinds in part driven by strength in international, in part driven by diversity of categories in some unique businesses that performed quite well and in part driven by a better-than-expected e-commerce division performance and strong shares in the core.","I would assume, in the first quarter our market growth was effectively flat and so our growth came in that \u2013 our market share growth came in that context and I'm speaking to the U.S. We would expect some of that to be tempered in the back half of the year so we should get some \u2013 some of the headwinds will be tempered, so we should get some category growth through the balance of the year but we're not counting on it.","So, our growth has to come through sustained outperformance in e-commerce, good contribution for our international markets and continued strong share performance. In the most recent 12-week period our market shares in the U.S. were up 41 basis points and the most recent four-week share period, our market shares were up over 70 basis points. So those are the types of things, that type of momentum is what's going to be required in a more sustained fashion to deliver towards the midpoint of the range. Implied in the midpoint of the range is a stronger back half than the first half.","I think we continue to have headwinds in Q2 from an inventory perspective, but we're hopeful that we do a little better in Q2 than we did in Q1, but we're still calling the midpoint of the range and we see \u2013 and the comps are tough in Q2, but the comps get easier in the back half of the year and we should see some progression through that period. Do we see a 4%? I don't know. Is it possible that in any given quarter we deliver 4% growth in this environment? Possible. Is it probable? Probably not. It's a tough environment out there, but do I think we get towards the middle of the range? Yes I do.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck, guys.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, and congratulations, guys on a good quarter. I guess two questions. The first one, if you could talk about maybe the confidence in the innovation pipeline for 2018. So I'm just thinking about the longer-term 3% to 5% organic sales. You talked a little bit about some of the revenue synergies. So I was just wondering, I would think 2018 is when you would see more of the combined R&D efforts really coming together. So maybe if you could talk, I guess, first about some of the differentiation that you see in the innovation pipeline for next year, as well as maybe some of the additional channel expansion opportunities on the revenue side that get you within that 3% to 5% as we think longer-term. That's the first question.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes. So, Jason, as we've said, the gestation period on new ideas is anywhere from 18 to 24 months, but we should see these ideas flow in, and every project is an idea, so we should see these things flow in in a layered way where we get improved innovation contribution to growth, probably starting from about the middle of next year onward, if you look at that timetable from idea to market. The good news is we've been spending a fair amount of money on research through 2016, into 2017. In my comments, I mentioned that we've tested 500 ideas since the beginning of the year through the end of May, operating roughly at about 100 ideas a month, which is great.","You've got to have a certain idea flow at the front end of the funnel to get accelerated outcomes at the rear end of the funnel because many of these ideas fail, many of the products don't fulfill once they start to be built against the concepts. And so you've got to have that sort of algorithm set up properly. We do. It's too early to declare what the core sales impact will be. But we've done this before and we've seen the results of that. If you go back and look at the period from 2013 through middle of 2015, into back half of 2015, you see the momentum in the legacy Newell Rubbermaid business.","A big chunk of that was related to the branded innovation work that we did. So our confidence is grounded in the fact that we've done it before, and the fact that we are seeing encouraging test results. But it's a little premature for me to declare exactly how that manifests itself in core sales. It's going to be dependent upon the progressions of the ideas through the funnel, the kind of retailer excitement we were able to generate, the kind of money we've got available to us in the P&L to be able to support those ideas. But that'll play out over the next few months.","Our brand development and our marketing planning work for 2018 gears up here over the next couple of weeks and is in full flight by the middle of July. And maybe we'll offer some more perspective towards the end of the summer on exactly what we think the implications are for 2018. Of course, all of this happens in a context, and we need to be mindful of the context in which we're executing. And, hopefully, the experience we've had in the beginning of this year, with respect to the retailer environment, subdues, and gets into a more normal state. And if it does, then things should play out as expected.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. I appreciate the color. And, I guess, the second question, is just on \u2013 within the 2.5% to 4% you're looking this year, what do you think the impact is of like, I would call it net pricing? So you talked a little bit about some input costs but, obviously, currency is lessening, so maybe the ability to take pricing versus I guess, some of the support you have to give to your retailers as the shift to online starts to pick up, just the balancing of merchandising dollars that would flow as kind of gross-to-net. So I was just wondering if you could talk maybe broadly or however you want to talk about it, but just maybe that subject matter. Thanks.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","When you look across the portfolio, there's a lot of different moving pieces in here. In aggregate on the year within the 2.5% to 4%, there's not that significant a benefit from pricing when you look across the portfolio. There's some places where we have priced, particularly where commodities have moved, but then on the other side we're ensuring that we're also driving the growth and distribution on the business that we have. So, in aggregate, not a significant impact on the 2.5% to 4%.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","And as the environment tempers a little bit on the transaction forex front, while it's still negative, it's not as negative as we had in the plan. It takes a little bit of the pressure off. That said, resin costs are unfavorable relative to plan, and so these things sort of are washed out against each other in the year. But we've done a lot of pricing in that period from 2013 through 2016, connected to the strengthening of the dollar and, in general, we have the capacity to price, particularly in Latin America and in the emerging markets in general. UK has been tougher and we're grateful that the FX environment has moderated a little bit and taken some of the pressure off of our gross margins in that situation.","So, but on balance, Ralph's comments are dead-on that we don't have a huge amount of pricing built into this year's plan, and the tempering FX environment helps offset some of these other pressures through the P&L. And it remains to be seen how far that story plays out.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. In terms of inventory destocking, two kind of buckets of questions. First, as you mentioned on the commercial distributor channel, I wanted to \u2013 I just honestly know a lot less about that business, so are those changes demand-driven? Is it channel shift? So anything you could share there would be great.","And then on the more traditional retail consumer-facing businesses, interestingly Appliances was not called out as one of the businesses that really suffered this quarter, and that had been my expectation given the pressure you saw in Q4. So if you could talk a little bit about if in fact there was an inventory destocking in Appliances. You mentioned increased merchandising. If that was new distribution in club? And then also, the inventory destocking around Coleman and fishing. It's a seasonally really small quarter for those businesses, so I was curious if that was kind of clean-up work, if it was left over inventory, anything you could share on those would be good too. Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. So the inventory reduction impacts were broad-based. Some of those are masked in our numbers because we had really strong performance in certain other aspects of the business. So, even in writing, we saw in the distributive trade pressure on pencils and pens. But we had great momentum on markers behind Sharpie Fine Art, behind the EXPO Ink Indicator, geographic expansion of Sharpie to Mexico and France.","We've got a lot of things going on in these businesses. But pressure, even within writing now because of the momentum on markers, because of the continued momentum on glue connected to slime, we were able to overcome that. The good news is that these things are now behind us and eventually we lap these scenarios as we come into 2018 which will serve us well.","In the distributive trade, we saw pressure across the distributive trade for a couple of reasons. One is just basic inventory pressure in that channel. But you have to ask the question why. And what's going on there is similar to what's going on in retail, which is the B2B e-platforms are impacting those channels. And so the same dynamic that's playing out in brick-and-mortar is playing out in the distributive trade. And so over time, we will confront that and adapt to it in the same way that we have on the retail side.","Do we expect this? On pure fishing, clearly, there was a bit of rebalancing and reduction going on there. And some of this is timing related given the new algorithms that are in place at certain retailers with respect to ordering patterns.","On appliances, as you recall, we saw a $24 million order that we didn't get in the period between December 15 and December 31 in the fourth quarter, which in effect was an inventory impact. We didn't see inventory really being a huge issue through Q1, and we've got very good momentum in appliances. We see category growth in that business, and we see share growth in that business right now.","Now I know some others have talked about categories presenting an issue. It depends on how you define the category, and if you take particular product families and define the category that way, it can lead you to one set of conclusions. If you look at it holistically, it can lead you to another. But we saw both category growth and share growth for us in the first quarter in appliances with some really nice momentum on FoodSaver, some nice momentum on Crock, some nice momentum on Oster, and some challenges in beverages on Mr. Coffee.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","And also Sunbeam, what am I talking about. Sunbeam had a great quarter on our heating platform. So that's good news. And the team's terrific and they're focused on how to sustain that momentum into the back half of the year.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just one last question on capital allocation. So surprised and certainly not sad to see the dividend increase come so early. How are you thinking about share repurchases I mean now that debt levels look like they're going to come in much better than originally expected? Do share repurchases maybe turn on a bit faster than previously communicated?","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Lauren, our capital priorities really haven't changed in terms of deleveraging, investing in the business, and frankly, we think over time as we get to the leverage range that we are expecting be in early 2018, we think there's a lot of opportunities on inorganic growth through M&A and as we look at those opportunities, we frankly put those ahead of share repurchases at this point in time.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I think our track record on things like Elmer's or Contigo or Baby Jogger, these types of acquisitions that happen in the core and our ability to really quickly capture the SG&A synergies and then put it into our operating model and drive growth acceleration. I think this is the value creation machine that we created with bolt-ons in the core. And there's a lot of opportunity out there to complement our organic agenda with that type of use of capital. We may over time want to manage share count flat, so as equity gets granted, we may buy back shares to just hold the share count so that doesn't become a headwind. But I doubt in the very near term that we would use capital that way because we see so much opportunity for this complementary use of capital to scale our presence in these core categories.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","And we have time for one more question and that question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hi, Andrea.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi. How are you? Good morning. So thank you for taking the last question. So the last question would be if you can elaborate more on your direct-to-consumer capabilities. Are you fulfilling yourself? It seems like from your comments that you had in the prepared remarks about baby in Canada and also more push in the U.S. So if you can please elaborate how much it represented on the quarter from this direct fulfillment and out of your 10%. I don't know if you include that in your e-commerce, 10% that you mentioned, and is it margin dilutive against 3P, third-party e-commerce? So I would love to get more of a sense of how it is evolving. Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. So direct-to-consumer is the smallest part of our e-commerce numbers but it is included in our e-commerce numbers. The two biggest businesses with direct-to-consumer platforms are Yankee and Jostens. But we also have a nice business with Coleman and we have a building business with Marmot and we've got some interesting businesses unfolding under the Coleman brand. And so there are multiple platforms. We're in the moment, looking across the entire enterprise and looking for a common back-office approach and fulfillment approach.","Today it's very different business by business. Our e-commerce team is working through the mechanics of how to build that business in a profitable way going forward. But to be clear, the vast majority of our results are being driven by progress in pure play and in Retailer.com. And there are a few exceptions to that with good momentum on Yankee. But I think we have a lot of opportunity in our D2C platforms to both strengthen the way we merchandise our brands and then also improve the way we fulfill demand. And we're looking to scale those activities over time.","But we can talk more of that as the teams develop their perspective and their approach. Right now, just to be clear, our e-commerce business is margin accretive to the company, not necessarily at gross margin, but down through the balance of the P&L. Because as you think through the expense lines in overhead, there's a relatively low selling expense as a percent of revenue in our e-commerce interfaces relative to our traditional route to market. And so that's where the benefit comes. It's below the fulfillment line in our overhead structure. So more to come on this over time as the teams really ramp. We'll figure out a mechanism by which to get the group in front of you. One of the things we're thinking through is the Investor Day in late \u2013 in mid-Q4 and we certainly will profile e-commerce there and walk you through all three platforms.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, Mike. This is very helpful, and congrats, again, on the results.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Eric, I think we're done. I want to just, in closing, make \u2013 give a call out to my team. I think this has been an extraordinary six months, both the profound change and executing through the change and I couldn't be prouder of everybody's effort and contribution to performing while we transform. And I think there's a lot to be proud of. A lot of opportunity is still ahead. We embrace this philosophy that good enough never is. And so we're hungry for more and we're excited about the prospect of delivering it. But in the moment, congratulations to everybody on my side.

Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell - Newell Brands, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining Newell Brands Q2 call. With me today are Mike Polk, our CEO; and Ralph Nicoletti, our CFO.","As usual, before we begin today, let me quickly go over the customary Safe Harbor language. Forward-looking statements made during the call reflect our current view. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our press release and in our filings with the SEC that are available on our website.","I'd also like to point out that we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, core sales and normalized EPS. Management believes that providing insights from these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on our website and in our press release and 8-K that was filed this morning.","Thank you. And I'll now turn it over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We've delivered a solid set of second quarter results. Consistent, competitive top line growth, coupled with strong double-digit earnings growth has enabled us to reaffirm our 2017 full year core sales growth and normalized EPS guidance and increased our 2017 net sales guidance to reflect our latest view on held-for-sale timing and foreign exchange.","Net sales grew just over 5% compared to prior year, and we delivered 2.5% core sales growth against our toughest quarterly prior year comparator. These results represent a competitive outcome, enabled by our multi-year focus on brands, innovation and e-commerce and our ability to play our strengthened portfolio across more geographies.","We delivered over $80 million of savings and synergies in the second quarter, which contributed to strong normalized operating margin growth of 130 basis points and normalized EPS growth of 11.5%. Operating cash flow is $48 million compared to $597 million in the prior year.","The prior year results reflect substantial benefits related to the timing of the Jarden transaction that do not repeat in 2017. Since the transaction completed last April, we've made excellent progress deleveraging the balance sheet and are well on our way to achieve our leverage ratio target of 3 times to 3.5 times. In the second half of 2018, we begin to accumulate a surplus of cash and our borrowing capacity, which will be available to be put to work.","We're particularly encouraged by the breadth of performance. We delivered core sales growth in all four regions: North America grew 2%; Europe, 2.5%; Latin America, over 9%; and Asia Pacific, nearly 5%. E-commerce, which represents about 10% of our global sales, once again, grew strong double digits. Our brand and innovation program when coupled with our strong e-commerce and brick-and-mortar selling capability had the expected impact on our market shares.","In our large U.S. market, we increased market share by nearly 60 basis points, with market shares increasing in product categories that generated over 70% of our U.S. sales. This represents an acceleration in share growth from the first quarter, led by Writing, Baby, Food Storage, Fishing, Coolers and Team Sports, which all delivered greater than 100 basis points of share growth versus prior year.","Correspondingly, many of these businesses had standout core sales growth, five businesses: Writing, Baby, Waddington, Team Sports and Safety & Security grew core sales greater than 6%, with Writing and Waddington both delivering double-digit core sales growth.","For Writing, the second quarter of 2017 represented the fifth consecutive quarter of core sales growth and the third consecutive second quarter of double-digit core sales growth. The strong Q2 selling in most formats at advanced back-to-school bodes well for a strong back-to-school sellout in Q3.","Encouragingly, Home Fragrance, which struggled towards the end of 2016, delivered another solid quarter, driven by strong growth in Europe and U.S. retail comp store sales growth of nearly 3%, associated with the Mother's Day personalized candle program in our retail stores. We plan to scale and replicate this program in Yankee's fourth quarter.","Additionally, the repositioning of the Yankee Candle brand in our wholesale markets has begun. We are transitioning the Yankee Candle brand across all formats and geographies to one global treatment, priced consistently in the better tier across all channels. We're also establishing one global sub-brand under Yankee Candle called Home Inspiration, which will be priced at a value to the Yankee Candle master brand in the good tier.","In the context of this new brand architecture, we have gained distribution across several key retailers in the U.S. So positive changes are underway at Yankee Candle. More broadly, the fundamentals are good across the business and are improving as we head into the second half of the year. That said, like most others in our industry, we continue to face pressure from retailer inventory reductions and retailer consolidation in the U.S. And sometimes the impact can be pretty sharp, and that was certainly the case for our Fishing and Fresh Preserving businesses in the second quarter.","Combined, Fishing and Fresh Preserving core sales declined about $30 million in the U.S. despite market share increases in both categories. There's no doubt that this event took a bit of the bloom off the rose in the quarter for us.","In general, though, I'm encouraged by how well our businesses are performing in the context of the ongoing turbulence in the marketplace. Our ability to deliver quite good results has been enabled by our agility and responsiveness to changing conditions, our leverage in the scale and diversity of our category, channel and geographic footprint and our hands-on entrepreneurial approach that gives us visibility to issues and opportunities in real-time. So a solid first half of the year. We're making very good progress in the transformation, and I'm proud of our people in their performance.","Let me hand the call over to Ralph for a deeper dive into the results. I'll then return to provide perspective on the balance of the year and some reflections on the path forward. Ralph, over to you.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As Mike said, we are pleased with our second quarter results. In a challenging environment, we achieved 2.5% core sales growth. We delivered over $8 million in synergies and Project Renewal savings, which is having a meaningful positive impact on margins. Operating cash flow remains on track for the full year, and importantly, we are well-positioned to deliver our full year forecast on both P&L and leverage metrics.","Let's turn to the details. Second quarter reported net sales were $4.1 billion, a 5.1% increase versus last year, which was partially driven by the benefit of acquisitions, including an extra two weeks of contribution from the Jarden business as well as contribution from held-for-sale businesses for longer than we had originally assumed.","Foreign exchange was 70 basis point headwind and core sales increased 2.5% with notable growth drivers being Baby, Appliances, Writing and Waddington. Core sales growth was broad-based with growth in all geographies.","Reported gross margin was 36.4% compared with 28.4% in the prior year, which reflected the absence of last year's inventory step-up impact from the Jarden acquisition. Normalized gross margin was 37%, compared with 37.2% last year. This slight decline reflects the negative mix effects of the Jarden's stub period and the Tools divestiture. We also spent roughly $10 million or 30 basis points this quarter related to repositioning of the Yankee Candle brand in our wholesale markets, partially offset by the benefits of cost synergies and other savings.","We reported SG&A expense of $955 million or 23.6% of sales, a 90 basis point decline versus last year. Normalized SG&A expense was $807 million or 19. 9% of sales, 150 basis point decline. The improvement in SG&A ratios is partially driven by cost synergies and other savings. We also saw a benefit from the positive mix impact of the comparison with last year's two weeks stub period in which Jarden, which historically had a lower SG&A ratio was not included in the prior year results. These benefits more than offset the impact of the incremental investments we are making in e-commerce, brand development and insights.","Reported operating margin was 10.4% of sales compared with 3.6% in the prior year. Normalized operating margin was 17.1% compared with 15.8% in the prior year. Interest expense of $115 million compares with $127 million last year, which included some onetime impacts from the Jarden transaction. We anticipate 2017 interest expense of around $470 million.","Our reported tax rate was 17.6% compared with last year's 20.3%. The normalized tax rate was 26% compared with 29.2% in the previous year. We now expect the full year tax rate to be between 22% and 23%, slightly favorable to our previous guidance. We continue to anticipate discrete tax benefits in the third quarter, which will drive a normalized tax rate in the high single-digit, low double-digit range. We ended the quarter with 486 million diluted shares outstanding, up from 450 million in the prior year, reflecting a full quarter of outstanding shares issued for the Jarden acquisition. We continue to expect the full year share count to be at or around 490 million shares, including the 6.6 million shares recently issued in the settlement of four dissenter lawsuits.","Reported EPS was $0.36 compared with $0.30 last year. Normalized EPS, which excludes transaction-related expenses and certain other charges, was $0.87 compared with $0.78 last year.","Turning now to our segment results, our Live segment generated net sales of $1.3 billion compared with $1.1 billion in the prior year. Core sales increased 0.2%, reflecting strong results from Baby, particularly in North American car seats and solid contributions from Appliances and from Home Fragrance's retail and international growth, partially offset by softness in Cookware and Fresh Preserving.","Net sales in the Learn segment were $1 billion compared with $912 million in the prior year. Core sales increased 6.6%, driven by strong results in \u2013 with strong results from Writing, with good international growth on Paper Mate in both Latin America and Europe. U.S. growth from Sharpie, EXPO and Dymo, and most notably, very strong growth from Elmer's, driven by slime. This growth was partially offset by inventory destocking at key retailers, particularly the office superstore channel.","In the Work segment, net sales were $738 million compared with $707 million in the prior year. Core sales grew 6.3%. All operating divisions grew in the quarter led by Waddington's continued strong results.","The Play segment generated net sales of $782 million compared with $685 million in the prior year. Core sales declined 1.2% as growth from Team Sports, Beverages and Coolers was offset by challenging conditions for Fishing, including inventory destocking and a key fishing retailer bankruptcy.","The Other segment contributed net sales of $246 million compared with $533 million in the prior year, reflecting a number of divestitures completed in the last 12 months, including Winter Sports, Tools, D\u00e9cor, Teutonia, Lehigh and the Fire building business. Core sales declined 2.1%, with growth on Process Solutions, offset by weakness in Home & Family.","We generated $48 million of operating cash flow in the quarter compared to $597 million in the second quarter of last year. Cash flow in the second quarter of 2016 was unusually high, benefiting from a couple of onetime impacts related to the close of the Jarden transaction. First, there were substantial cash outflows in the stub period from April 1 to April 15 prior to the acquisition that we did not have to fund. Secondly, there was a benefit on cash interest since no interest payment was due in the quarter related to the acquisition debt. The total cash interest benefit was around $175 million. Cash flow in the second quarter of 2017 of $48 million was affected by higher inventories in support of back half growth initiatives, particularly where we are tight on capacity, such as in slime demand and in our Waddington business. And to a lesser extent, excess inventory in areas where we experienced trade inventory liquidation such as in pure Fishing and Fresh Preserving.","We also paid an incremental cash taxes of $50 million principally related to the Tools divestiture. There will be an additional Tools related cash tax payments of approximately $225 million in the third quarter and an $85 million payment in fourth quarter, all of which are contemplated in our cash flow outlook.","Importantly, looking at the balance of the year, we are on track to achieve our cash flow and leverage goals. As a result, we expect to have leverage at or near the target EBITDA range and by the middle of next year, ahead of schedule.","I'll now turn the call back to Mike.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Ralph. This morning, as I mentioned earlier, we reaffirmed our full year core sales growth guidance and normalized EPS guidance and raised our net sales guidance. The increase in net sales guidance reflects the positive impact of foreign exchange and the fact that we kept our held-for-sale Tools and Winter Sports businesses longer than we originally anticipated when we provided our initial net sales guidance at the beginning of the year.","We're tracking towards the middle \u2013 towards the midpoint of the new net sales guidance range. As you will recall, we increased our normalized EPS guidance range by $0.05 in May, with first quarter results, to reflect the benefit of holding tools longer and the benefit of foreign exchange versus our initial guidance. Today, we have not raised earnings guidance further because the favorable foreign exchange rate differential between May and now is largely offset by the negative earnings impact of holding the Winter Sports business through the first half of the year. Our former Winter Sports business lost over $25 million in operating income in the first half of the year.","As a result, our normalized EPS guidance range remains $3 to $3.20. We continue to track to the midpoint of that range, which is $0.05 above our original normalized EPS guidance for 2017. There are three factors that could influence where we fall in our 2017 full year guidance ranges: the delivery of our synergies and savings commitments, our ability to sustain double-digit growth on our e-commerce businesses, and the consumer response to our planned brand activities and innovations.","With respect to cost savings in our synergy programs, we are right on track. We delivered over $80 million of incremental cost savings in the second quarter. This brings our 2017 year-to-date savings to $198 million against our full year commitment of greater than $300 million. Cumulative savings since the beginning of 2016 are now $410 million.","We have actioned but not yet realized another $270 million that we expect to flow into the P&L over the next 18 months. We expect about half of these actioned but not yet realized savings and synergies to be delivered in the second half of 2017, consistent with our current guidance. So we're right where we expected to be and the disciplined execution of the Transformation Office gives us full confidence in our 2017 delivery.","With respect to sustaining our strong e-commerce momentum, our guidance assumes we deliver strong double-digit growth in both the third and fourth quarters. Today, e-commerce represents about 10% of our global business or about $1.5 billion of revenue. Through the first half of 2017, our global e-commerce business has grown strong double digits. We've increased our rate of investment in e-commerce beyond what we originally contemplated at the early stages in the combination and are well on our way to reach our near-term design of 500 dedicated e-commerce employees by the end of the year. We've opened e-commerce offices in Seattle and Hoboken in close proximity to our largest e-commerce retail partners and will open a third office in London later this year as we extend our capability to Europe.","The velocity with which we've scaled this team has been extraordinary, and the team is doing a terrific job of transforming our capability while simultaneously delivering the strong growth we expect. These new resources and our strengthening capability positions us to deliver the strong double digit growth we've assumed in our 2017 guidance.","The third factor that could influence where in the range we deliver relates to the impact of our brand activities in the second half of the year. We have good underlying momentum, driven by our strong and building brands in innovation activities and our double-barreled selling capability in e-commerce and brick-and-mortar. As mentioned earlier, we see this playing out in our market share growth of nearly 60 basis points in the U.S. with that increase accelerating from the first quarter results.","In the second quarter, we saw good traction from the activities we layered into the market, with personalized kiosk in Yankee Candle stores driving comp stores sales growth of about 3%, a roughly 10-point reversal in comps from the first quarter. In slime activation, our numbers resulting in a 14 share point share gain with our investment in advertising activity, driving glue market growth of nearly 40%.","The deployment of our portfolio is also working with more focused selling approaches into new geographies. This activity has started to yield strong results, with excellent growth on Baby Gear in Canada of over 30% related to the launch of a new direct selling model and double-digit growth on Waddington as a result of deploying more selling resource against more vertical channels and good momentum on Writing in India and in the Shanghai test market where both initiatives contributed to nearly 40% growth on markers and pens in the Asia-Pacific region. These are early wins.","New products, new distribution, more focused selling resource and stronger brand activity builds into the second half of 2017 with exciting growth programs on Baby Gear, Appliances, Cookware, Home Fragrance, Waddington, Commercial Products, Beverages and Writing. Brand investment also increases in the second half of the year, with strength in merchandising frequency and increased advertising and promotion support.","So with this strong back half, we expect to deliver core sales growth acceleration into the second half of the year in the upper half of our full year core sales growth guidance range with sequential acceleration in our growth rate from Q3 to Q4. We have assumed no further major U.S. retailer-driven disruptions in the second half of 2017 as we lap the step-up in activity that started in the fourth quarter of 2016.","While we are mindful of the tough environment, our confidence is strong and grounded in the knowledge that we have a leading portfolio of brands, advantaged capabilities in innovation and design with the best still yet to come, a peer group leading e-commerce organization, a long list of opportunities for core distribution and international deployment, a world-class team working on realizing world-class levels of savings and the scale to outspend in the determination to out execute our competition. This is a proven model and playbook that we've executed before and are now in the midst of executing again.","I have the privilege of leading the development of one of the most exciting household goods brand portfolios in the world, brands that hundreds of millions of times every day help make life better for consumers where they live, learn, work and play.","We expect Newell Brands to be one of the most transformative value creation stories in the consumer goods industry. We have a clear path forward and could not be more committed and driven to deliver. That is the unique opportunity that's Newell Brands.","With that, let me turn it back over to the operator to help facilitate questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And we will take our first question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hi, Olivia.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","How are you?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Great. How are you?","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good. Thank you. First, in terms of the second half core sales uptick, is more of the new products coming more from the Jarden side or the legacy Newell side? From what you talked about it, it sounded like it was a fairly good balance. And then where is the new distribution coming from? Is it existing retailers taking on more, or are you starting to be able to leverage sort of the legacy Newell footprint for Jarden and vice versa?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","So great, great questions, Olivia. It's a pretty good balance, although I want to be clear, the things that we're launching are things that don't really tie to the big investment we've made in insights. Those \u2013 that work to fill the innovation funnel really will yield in the middle of 2018. So that upside is still in front of us. But we actually have some very strong and exciting things going on across a number of different businesses.","We've got a very big launch on cookware. I don't know whether you have Calphalon at home, but we do. And the way our pots and pans are designed, and most cookware is designed the same way, they tend to take over the drawers in your kitchen. And so, one of our really bright clever designers has figured out a way to design a Calphalon set of cookware that's stackable. And so we launched stackable Calphalon in the fourth quarter. That's going to be a big launch. Some of that may ship in Q3, but the big merchandising events will happen around the fourth quarter. We have a big launch connected to what we call our Crocktober drive period on Crock-Pot. I really don't want to describe what the innovation is, it's just a little bit early even though the sell-in has happened to retailers, the shipments haven't yet occurred and I just assume keep our competitors in the dark as long as possible, but it's going to be a really exciting event come October across the landscape, so we're really looking forward to that.","We've got Baby Gear launches in Canada and the U.S. We got a really cool new stroller launching that we call UNO2DUO, which is a stroller that really conveniently extends from a single stroller to a double stroller without really much effort at all in a part of moms. We've got some exciting new stuff coming on Writing connected to coloring and gifting in the fourth quarter. So we've got a broad cross-section of activity coming, plus we have tremendous amount of marketing and merchandising activity set up around back-to-school, of course, and around Black Friday.","So the back half was always going to be the more loaded half of the year for us for two reasons. It's natural; so it matches the natural flow of our business, but also in the first half of the year, we've been changing basically everything; the entire organization, new people, new roles, consolidating structures. So this wasn't the period of time to be launching a lot of new items into the market. So it's the natural phasing in our business and the natural phasing of our \u2013 in connection to the natural phasing of our change program.","Olivia, what was the second question? I got lost in the innovation. I am so excited about them.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, more about \u2013 no, that was great, I'm glad to hear that. And then just in terms of where the new distribution is coming from, is it existing retailer, is it more or...?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. It's a blend of two things. I mean, we've got \u2013 I described what we're doing on Yankee Candle and we've got some big wins in North American wholesale coming on Yankee in the back half of the year. Some distribution regained other reposition distribution at some very big retailers, so that's terrific.","We're pressing assortment into our pureplay.com partners and our retail.com partners, so when you think about availability and assortment that that to me is core distribution as well. And there were some businesses that were not available on some of the biggest dotcom platforms that we've got, whether they're retail.com or whether they're pureplay.com. And we've got plenty of room just to optimize our assortment on virtually every one of our categories.","We pushed BRILLIANCE and FreshWorks and Rubbermaid into distribution last year. We're working to figure out how to capture more physical shelf space for all the innovations that are coming on Rubbermaid. And so that work has been underway, that's contributing to the Food Storage growth that you see and I mentioned in the market share data. And that will accelerate in the back half of the year with the launches \u2013 further launches on BRILLIANCE and FreshWorks in the cutting end of those distribution items into retail and the optimization of our Food Storage assortments. So I could go category-by-category.","Beyond the core distribution, we're pressing now with the check factory on Yankee up and running in Europe. We've got opportunity in France, in Germany, in Italy to press the shoulders of our portfolio out from our U.K. anchor and our Italian anchor. And as we talk about earlier, we're continuing to develop our Baby Gear business in Canada as a result of the change in our selling structures.","And the Waddington and Commercial Products stories will really be about distribution expansion to more verticals, where we, in the second quarter, I described it is more focused selling resources. We've extended the coverage of the sales force in Waddington, and we will be doing the same thing on Rubbermaid Commercial Products in the third quarter to be able to cover more verticals. And the whole point there is broadened distribution.","So we're \u2013 the stage is set, of course, the environment is not easy right now, but the stage is set. And we'll see how well we execute.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. And then if I can just follow up on the cost saves, nice continued progress in Q2 relative to your $300 million target for the year. Retail environment is challenging. You touched a little bit on the commercial environment too. Any change in terms of your view on how much may need to be reinvested over time relative to the one-third, two-third breakout that you referenced in the past?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. We have to stay flexible on this. I mean, we want to spend into our strategic agenda. That said, we don't see our investment profile changing versus what's been assumed all along in our guidance. We have a step-up in A&P, first half to second half of about 40 basis points. Our back out spending is certainly planned ahead a year ago. I think that's great. We're investing in overheads, in insights and in e-commerce, obviously, with the scaling of that organization. I think we've got the investment profile right for now.","But to your point, we don't live in a static environment, so the environment unfolds in a different way than we may end up adjusting our thinking on some of that. But at the moment, I wouldn't suggest that, that's top of mind.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, Mike.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Stephen Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Hey, thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hello.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","So inventory destocking, it's clearly been a theme there throughout the year and it clearly had an impact in Q2. Can you frame for us a little more detail how those impacts compare with your going in expectations? In the quarter that just closed, it sounds like they're a bit more severe than expected. And then how you expect the impacts to flow over the back half. Any outsize to watch out for Q3 or Q4?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Sure. So, I mean, the impacts are pretty sharp when they occur. We won't talk to you guys about the normal ebb and flow of inventories, but I'll just give you a sound bite. First half, point-of-sale growth on Fresh Preserving, plus 2.4% in U.S., so good POS sellout. As I mentioned, share growth in the second quarter. Invoice sales in the U.S. on Fresh Preserving down 21% in the first half. So that's a sharp stick in the eye. We didn't call that severe a change and it was most acute in Q2.","In Fishing, there are two things going on. It's inventory step-down to the Walmart and a couple of other places, but one of our top six customers declared bankruptcy, right, as the season was turning into high seasonality. So these are things you \u2013 certainly you have to prepare for as best you can, but when they occur, you're oftentimes not precise in how you manage those things.","And so, these events are \u2013 we're in the middle of what has been a structural change in retailer attitude that started in the fourth quarter of last year. As you'll recall, we missed a replenishment order on Appliances after Black Friday. There was a $24 million order at Walmart. And the good news is, as we come through Q3, we lapped the vast majority of that step-change in the environment, which means that all of these changes are now in the base. And so the environment would have to get materially worse than last year's environment for us to face headwinds from Q4 onward.","And \u2013 so that's our view of the view forward. We may not be precise or right. There're certainly some structural things out there that we've been living with for years, office superstore contraction, the rebalancing of that retail landscape. We've done very, very well in our Writing business in the context of that.","So I say when I say recognizing that there is certainly more to come in this space, but I don't think it has as profound an impact on the business as the last three quarters and a month or two through Q4 of the last year is at. This will go down as one of those cycles that the industry goes through. And once we get through the fourth innings, into the fourth quarter, I think the degree of impact lessens.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, that's great. And then in your prepared remarks, you talked about how Yankees were gaining momentum at the core, which is great as we approach that Q4.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","But we've also talked in the past about rationalizing the store footprint and some door closings potentially as we go forward. So can you remind us where we are in that process? And then, if there's any way to size any potential top line headwinds associated with those door closings, particularly as we get to Q4, where is the big Yankee quarter?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. There are a bunch of leases coming due in the middle of this year, but no more than 15 stores, 20 stores out of 600 stores. We're not going to go \u2013 at this point, we don't envision going proactive on store closures. But there is unproductive stores and then leases expire, we look at those things. We also don't envision opening new stores because we believe the future of this brand is going to be a function of \u2013 on this business a function of our core route-to-market. But we don't see a radical change in the retail store footprint other than as leases expire. We may change that point of view in the future, but that's not built into our plans right now.","We're intrigued by the impact we had in Q2, flipping the comp store sales growth as profoundly as we did with the personalized platform launch around Mother's Day. In the month of May, comps were actually up plus 7% on the quarter, plus a 3%. So the real question is, with this renewed activity in store whether \u2013 what is the effect going to be in Q4, which is, to your point, is the high seasonality for that brand.","And obviously, the real quarter that matters. Last year, we didn't have the kind of ammunition in store that we will have this year. We'll see how that plays out. That's probably one of the points of uncertainty. The good news is we will have much broader wholesale availability in the fourth quarter with all of these wins that I was describing in the North American wholesale markets, U.S. wholesale markets, and we have broader presence in both pure play and dotcom.","So I think we're much better positioned on Yankee Candle as we come into the back half of this year than we were a year ago. But there's always a point of uncertainty as to whether this program that really worked well in May can be replicated in the high seasonality window and have the same effect. We've assumed improvement, for sure, in our numbers versus the experience we had prior year, but we haven't been quite as bullish on our Q4 assumptions as our outcomes were in Q2.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","That's great. I've got more, but I don't want to hung time. So I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hi, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just to follow up on Yankee. So the repositioning also looks like it comes with a price adjustment. You mentioned it but we've seen it on new lower price on Bed Bath & Beyond, it's not yet reflected on the Yankee website. So if you could just walk through the rationale of lowering the price point on that core piece, if there is a plan to have a higher end product maybe with one of the other brands in the Home Fragrance portfolio. And then how you're sort of matching and thinking about the gap the lower end product and will the core Yankee be available in some of these new wholesale accounts or regain wholesale accounts that you've suggested?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes, so our focal point is on the Yankee Candle brand. So the big mass wins are all Yankee Candle brand-related. It's interesting, Lauren, when you look at the average retail price paid by the consumer for our products, they pay a lower price in our own stores than they were paying in the wholesale markets because of the frequency of promotion. So what we're doing with the price changes is making sure that the consumer is paying roughly the same price irrespective of whether she buys it in our store or whether she buys it in a Walmart or Target or Kohl's or a Bed Bath.","And so that's what we're doing, we're leveling the playing field. So the price adjustments aren't really happening in retail, they're happening \u2013 they'll be happening in the wholesale market. And the way we look at it is we look at the average retail price, not the everyday selling price. So beyond the average price adjusted for the frequency and depth of promotion. And so that's what we've done with Yankee.","At the same time, as we launch Home Inspiration as a second tier good positioned brand, we're going to eliminate all the other trademarks that we had out there goes away \u2013 Simply Home goes away and there is a couple of different trademarks that were in the U.K., they all go away, so we have a two-tiered structure, good and better.","Your question about best is a great question. We've got a really wonderful brands in Italy called Millefiori. We have a whole bunch of concepts in test that go super-premium. Again, we'll see how they go through the development process, but you can envision going way up from a pricing perspective.","I don't know that will be Yankee branded, we'll learn more over the coming quarters, and we'll decide whether that's something for next year, whether that's something for years beyond. But yes, this is an important aspect of what we're doing, and we end up with really good gross margins vastly accretive to fleet average in a much bigger business.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. And then on Calphalon, I know you were clear on the \u2013 given some parameters on Fresh Preserving. But it sounds like cookware Calphalon was also a little bit soft in the quarter. Was any of that \u2013 I don't think it's typically an important quarter for Calphalon, but any kind of strategic managing down of inventories or trimming shipments ahead of the fourth quarter launch? And how broad is the stackables? Is it going to be across all of the lines of Calphalon? Is it a new product line within Calphalon? Just curious about the dynamics of that?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes. So stackables will live primarily at this point in our main price tier. So it's not going down, we're keeping the benefit up. You're right to notice that the change year-over-year in Calphalon business as we call Calphalon, we called it out in order to point out that Appliances has been doing reasonably well within Appliances and Cookware. Calphalon in the year ago period was in a period of liquidation of a whole bunch of sub-brands. If you recall, we went through a multi-tiered structure and fixed the brand architecture on Calphalon in 2016 first quarter and into the second quarter. And it's lapping all the liquidation that was associated with all of the changes we made in that window. So that's the primary issue, but it's a very competitive market. I think of all of our competitors, I think when I look out there, I always mention Pilot and Writing, I think SEB in Cookware is actually quite a good competitor.","They've done a nice job with ALL-CLAD and a couple of other brands. So that's not an easy competitive marketplace for us. And so we need to continue to innovate, we need to advertise, that's why we are more excited about the prospects for Calphalon in the back half of the year.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. And then final thing was just Elmer's, you've called out supply constraints. So anything you can share on that part of those plans to increase capacity if you, just say, will absorb the higher cost and I guess it's contact manufacturing because it's unclear fun \u2013 the degree to which it's a fad that runs its course.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes, we think certainly there's a surge in slime making that's going on now, but I think this has a much longer half-life than most of these types of activities because of mom and child consumer \u2013 I mean, mom and child involvement. There's incentive on both sides to continue to do this sort of thing. But there certainly were costs associated with being able to serve the demand. And we also took advantage of the surge in growth on Elmer's to deal with what were going to be in a proactive way, what were inevitably going to be conversations with some of the distributive trade on the balance of our Writing portfolio. So we were able to do some interesting things with respect to inventory positions on everyday writing pens and pencils in Q2 and get those things behind us with some of the distributive trade with the benefit of the surge in demand on Elmer's, which is good for the long haul.","But there's some \u2013 there's both a mix effect negative in our margins associated with that. And we mortgaged a little bit of growth on Writing that we could have gotten. All that said, still strong double-digit growth. So your point about whether you self-manufacture versus you handle the surge through third party, we did both. We added a shift. We added a couple lines into our North Carolina factory, but in no way was that going to be enough to cover the upside impact, a 14 share point increase in the context of a 40% increase in the market so it's a meaningful impact.","And so you're right, we've chosen to take the margin hits associated with that in order to serve the demand and also to do some underlying things within the business that I think serve us well for the long haul on the balance of the Writing portfolio.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, guys, good morning. So first question I want to go back to cash flow for a second. Sounds like, obviously, the second quarter of last year was a pretty tough compare. But just curious, did the first half play out as you expected? And how should we think about the full year? I think last year you guys generated about $1.5 billion in operating cash flow in the second half. I would imagine you guys would expect it to be a little bit better than that this year.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Joe, it's Ralph. Regarding your question, first, we did \u2013 as we planned the year, we did expect to have full year cash flow below a year ago because last year, you heard from our remarks, was elevated a little bit by the fact that we had the stub period of Jarden, which really was a cash outflow period now coming into the full year in 2017.","As we got to the first half of this year, we build inventory at this point in time, and we've been doing that and then we've \u2013 and the seasonal flow into the back half of the year will be consistent with a year ago. We're on track to hit our leverage targets at the end of the year and essentially, everything we saw in the second quarter doesn't make us feel any different about our full year view on cash flow. We expect to be in and around the $1 billion range on the full year.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","And the only build, Ralph, that I'd make is that because of the cash tax payments on Tools, the year-over-year comparator will look a little bit different. And Ralph laid out the flow of those Q3, Q4.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting to e-commerce and the assortment expansion you guys mentioned this morning, which brands do you think are underdeveloped in e-commerce? And where specifically are you adding those \u2013 are you adding in terms of your assortment? And what do you have to do to sort of fix that and get those brands online?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Listen, in general, I think everything is underdeveloped despite the fact that in our Baby Gear business, 40% of the revenue globally \u2013 40% of the revenue in the U.S. is e-based. So I think consumers are shifting in this direction. You need a multi-channel solution in all of these categories. And every brick-and-mortar we chose trying to figure out how to create a closed system where if somebody comes into the physical space, they convert within the digital space, within the banner. And we want to work with everybody on all that.","So what do we have to do? We're running as fast as we can possibly run. We entered the year with about 200-plus people. We'll exit the year with about 500 people that are dedicated; the vast majority of these folks coming from the outside. We're building an organization that's unique and differentiated versus what I think most other people in the space have because it's a closed system and represents the channel across the entire enterprise, including selling resources and trade marketing resources and supply chain resources. So I think we're doing everything we can to capture the opportunity. I believe we're growing off a much bigger base where 10% of our revenue globally is e-commerce. When I look at some of the numbers that folks have reported off much smaller basis, our growth rates off of that 10% base are pretty much in line with what other people are reporting off of much smaller businesses. And so we're running and gunning. There's a whole bunch to learn, both in our camp and in the retailers' camps. In consumer durables and discretionary products, you have a two-step process to purchase. You have to prompt consideration, which is in a 3D environment, you do that by getting off shelf and into the aisle.","And then you have to drive conversion with the product proposition at a value. In 2D environment, the learning is all around how do you prompt consideration and because the conversion part is relatively straightforward. And so we're stepping up our investment in page search. We're working hard on advocacy and every one of these businesses have different paths to the triggers that prompt consideration. And so we're excited by the progress we're making, but we believe we have a lot of work still to do. And well, we, obviously, have focused for now U.S.-centric but this organization contemplates a global footprint. So I've mentioned the London office that's going to be a very important trigger for European development.","And at the same time, we have a big opportunity in both the retailer.com and pureplay.com. And then we got a big opportunity in our own brand stores to we're growing double digits there, but we want to grow profitably so figuring out how to do that and doing it in a disciplined way and creating scale of architecture in the backroom in support of that really quite important. So a lot of work to do. This is a multi-year journey for us. There's no flip the switch moment. Obviously, we're capturing a lot of benefit right now, but we expect to sustain that kind of growth into the future. And we got a lot of work to do to deliver that.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Understood. Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hi, good morning. So Mike, I think this is the second quarter in a row where Appliances has seen a pretty strong growth. And it's sort of trending opposite with what we're hearing from others in terms of the category. So could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the category and where your growth is coming from, whether it's U.S.-based, international, sort of which channels or specific products it might be coming from and whether you think it's sustainable? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. I think our Appliance business is doing well where we've got solid innovations, and we have a monster business, terrific business in Latin America that's just absolutely one of the best Latin businesses. I've had the privilege to work with, build around the Oster brand. So the Appliance business, its strength is Latin America and U.S., we got a pocket of strength in Europe in the U.K. with the Breville brand, which we have the rights to in the U.K. and then we've got a nice business in Australia and New Zealand around, believe it or not, the Sunbeam brand, which borrows a lot of the product offerings from Breville and brings it to market across multiple appliances. So it looks like Oster in Latin America.","So we have these pockets. These geographic markets, and the opportunity, of course, is to build out a much bigger appliance and much more consistent appliance brand across \u2013 a set of brands across the world. In the second quarter, we had good growth in slow cooking and in our coffee business, but not as much growth in home products in Q2 as we had in Q1. And so we got pockets of growth is the best way to describe it.","On balance, we're pretty happy with the growth rate, but it's still very early days. Remember, Appliances and Cookware is a developed for growth business. So this is a business where we're investing a lot of time and energy in building a pipeline of ideas to strengthen these brands. And the real value from that investment doesn't yield in growth until middle of next year and beyond.","So in the interim, we've got an excellent brand with an excellent pipeline in Latin America. We've got pockets of ideas in the U.S. and we got a nice business in the U.K. And we play the levers that we've got to play until we get to a more substantive pipeline of ideas in the back half of 2018.","In terms of market growth, I hear the numbers that people are quoting. I guess, we define the market differently in-depth. I don't want to \u2013 it's not helpful for me to contrast versus what other people say. We see low single digit market growth across how we define the category, which is across all the categories that we compete in, so \u2013 in the U.S. And that's the only push we really have a good measurement of it, but that's, obviously, by far, our biggest market. So I don't know if that's helpful.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","No, that is. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. So Mike, you touched on your e-commerce success in your prepared remarks and in response to Joe's question. Obviously, you've got a big advantage today in terms of the sales mix exposure versus peers. Is that mainly in your mind because you've set up the e-commerce as a separate function and closed system, different than a lot of your peers and resourced it more in terms of head count and spending? I am just trying to get at what you think are kind of the key sources of competitive advantage so far that have allowed you to prosper. And more importantly, going forward, do you think you can sustain that competitive advantage as you look out longer term?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. So great question. Part of our strength in our momentum in these businesses has to do with the development of a few of our categories. And the fact that those categories, which naturally developed online earlier through us as a leadership team, on both sides of the company into the channel earlier than I think other consumer goods have been drawn in. So our experience curve is longer than most fast moving consumer goods companies. And through that learning, we came to the point of view that the right way to structure the organization for maximum impact is the one that we've pivoted towards \u2013 at the beginning of this year.","I think we're getting terrific yield on that, but it's very, very early days, Dara. So, I think the upside in the structure is ahead of us as opposed to behind us. Do I think we stay ahead versus others? So I'm sure that some of our blue chip peers, which we don't compete with directly, have the resourcing if they were to choose to go into the space to do what we're doing as effectively as we are if they were to organize the way we're organized.","I don't know whether they have the institutional flexibility to do what we've done. We're effectively a start-up, so we start from a white sheet of paper a year ago, and we're able to design the structure without a lot of organizational challenges we're shifting from something to something. So I do think it serves us well. I think creating a community of practice and a close set of accountability is really, really important. And then holding them accountable \u2013 the team accountable for managing the channel conflict issues that can arise from such a structure effectively is also really, really important.","But I don't think we've seen the upside yet from the bet we've made. We got an incredibly talented group of people, mostly who have come from the outside. And I think that's going to really serve us well relative to our direct competitors. I think other than in the odd circumstance, where somebody hits one out of the park and an idea, we ought to be able to beat our direct competitors in the space with the capability we're building.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's very helpful. And then separately, your commentary on top-line growth in the back half of the year really sounds pretty positive on this call, particularly with the ramping innovation and distribution, you've got much easier comparison. So is a 4% core sales results in the back half of the year potentially in your line of sight? I would argue some of the commentary would suggest it's possible. I know it sounds crazy in this environment, but it seems like it's possible.","So just kind of curious and how much slacks do you think you have in the back half of the year with some of the internal initiatives you have if there continues to be more external volatility?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. So in my guidance, what I said was that in the back half of the year, we'll be in the top half of our range, which top half of the range is 3.25% to 4%. So in order to average somewhere in the top half of the range, you have to have pretty good and then I also said sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. So in order to deliver that outcome, you need to be in one of those quarters. Either of those two quarters are both pretty strong and balanced or one of those quarters has to be right up against the top of the range.","And I think it's possible that we could get there or even beyond depending on what happens with the retail environment in one of those quarters. I don't think that quarter will be the third quarter, because we have the uncertainty of what we're up against with respect to inventory and retailer changes in Q3 still. Q4, on the other hand, we lapped the big appliance change from a year ago and the real wildcard will be what happens with Yankee and retail and whether all the other changes we've made more than offset any potential risk in that area. So the upside associated with the changes we made offset any potential risk in Yankee retail. I think that's the \u2013 those are the question marks that are out there. And the flow that I think we've considered and the activity's certainly set to deliver that, the question becomes landscape and our execution.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thanks. Good morning, Mike.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Good morning.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I just wanted to clarify something that you just mentioned in terms of how you expect organic sales to sort of ramp. You did just mention that Q4, you expected to be the strongest organic sales. So trying to get a sense of your innovation pipeline...","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","...and if most of the stepped up innovation will be in the market during third quarter, so you're going to benefit from that during Q4? Or is it going to be more evenly spread in the second half in terms of innovation?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes. Yeah. So pipeline fill will happen in Q3 on many of these innovations. There's a bit of a question mark in the month of September as to whether retailers will take their Black Friday inventory late September or whether they're going to take it in October. That's to be determined still. That could influence the flow between Q3, Q4.","The bulk of the consumer experience with our new products in the back half of the year will happen in Q4, but the shipment and revenue flow partially will occur in Q3. So we get the pipeline in many cases in Q3 and then we get the sellout and the replenishment in Q4, depending on retailer behavior in September, October. So those are the \u2013 that's the inside baseball sort of view of what we're dealing with and we'll see how that plays out.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Then just a couple of other quick questions, if I may. First, on your stepped up spending on e-com. Could you quantify the increase in the quarter and then how much spending is expected to ramp in the second half?","And then secondly, on back-to-school, I know it's early days, but just would love to get your initial read on how that's been trending, and I know you touched on it a bit, but how does it compare to higher...","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes. The thing that I would \u2013 the way I would deal with the math on that is and I'm not going to give you a specific number; I'll help you kind of form your own. If you think about the big spend in e-com, it's really relates to people. And so as I said, we entered it with around $250 million, we're going to exit with around $500 million, making assumption about what total comp looks like to those people, and you can back into sort of annualized investment.","There's also programming costs, but the thing to be careful of here is, obviously, a big part of this is funded by the movement of resource from our traditional design or old structure to this structure. So it doesn't mean that it's all incremental. In fact, most of it's not. So I think that's the way to think about it. Does that make sense?","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. It does.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","And rather than quote a number and then have a competitor have a number they can react to I'll let you sort of back into it.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, fair. And then what's your initial read on back-to-school just in terms of how it compares to prior years? I know it's a bit early. I'm just trying to get a sense if there is any revenue shift that you're expecting from the second quarter into Q3?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","No. This is actually the most favorable July 4th treatment you could have for a Q2 sell-in. So I've read some of the commentary, I don't quite get that. I think the \u2013 what people are referring to, I think, in some of their commentary is that it's sort of a shortcut to an explanation. I think there's been a fair amount of inventory rebalancing in the distributive trade in an office superstore channel that's gone on in the first half of the year in the stationery categories. So I think that's the primary thing.","I don't think back-to-school timing. This is about the most favorable structure you could have for a Q2 sell-in for back-to-school because of the fact that July 4 in the \u2013 was a Tuesday and the merchandise for July 4 was on the floor, so there was room in our retailer warehouses for us to sell-in inventory at the end of the quarter. So we don't see any timing-related shift.","That said, there's always different behaviors on the part of retailers with respect to their merchandising activity. So I was referring to sell-in timing. There's certain retailers that have gone early this year and one retailer, in particular, that's gone later than they went last year in the office superstore channel. And we'll see how that all plays out over time.","And to your point, that's \u2013 while school's open in many states in the Midwest now this week and I think in some of the Southern states it starts to open next week, so back-to-school has happened in the Northeast and then out West, it's still \u2013 we're still ramping into that window. But our early numbers look pretty good.","And based on the aggregate sell-in in Q2 on Writing, we would expect a really good sell-out, and we'll look and watch order patterns in September, presuming that our share momentum continues, and we get the sell-out, which we should. That we'll watch that order pattern dynamic at the end of September into October, again, to see whether there's any rebalancing. We think we've made a prudent assumption in our guidance for Q3, but you really don't know until the very, very end.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Mike. Just a quick one for me. The market share gains look pretty impressive. Can you just kind of help us understand what was kind of underpinning the game? So is this distribution versus innovation versus just better execution, A&P? Just trying to get the underlying drivers of the market share gains.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses, we have a very full innovation funnel. We've profiled some of them in Q1 and Q2, and those innovations are really doing very, very well. Believe it or not, some of the businesses that hurt us the most with respect to top line in Q2 have the strongest market shares. Our Fishing shares are well over 300 basis points versus prior year. So ironically, one of the strongest performing categories. So sellout's happening well, we've got good distribution, we've got good merchandising activity in that category. So we've got a pretty broad swath of increased market shares across both platforms, innovation driven, and like you see, Newell Rubbermaid, core distribution driven and merchandising-driven on legacy Jarden for the most part.","So as I said, we tracked 75 different product, well, I didn't say this, but here's a tidbit, we tracked 75 different product families in the U.S. and both their market growth, market share, POS and of those product families, over 70% of \u2013 categories accounting for over 70% of our revenue experienced increased market shares, which means very broad-based share growth, which is great.","This is, by far, the most important metric that we look at to get a sense for whether our ideas and our execution is happening. And this is what you want us to focus on. You don't really want us focusing only on sell-in, you want us focusing on sell-out. And if we're able to sustain this kind of share growth and by the way, our markets in the U.S. grew over 2% in the second quarter.","So while they're down a little bit versus prior year, they're growing in line with GDP growth. And that's good. So these are the things that are the live indicators that give you a sense of your forward momentum, and it's a balance of execution and innovation, less so investment in the first half of the year. We kept our powder dry for the back half where we have more activity.","So I wouldn't point that out as a key contributor to blend of e-commerce, core distribution and innovation on legacy Newell Rubbermaid that's driving this. When we quote market shares and market growth, we have the ability to include e-commerce in those numbers, whereas you guys, I think, you're buying syndicated data have a tougher time seeing the true underlying performance of both the categories and the brands. So the numbers I'm quoting reflect our tailored database.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then just one more quick one, Mike. In the past, you've talked about opportunities to kind of cross leverage the Jarden renewal, kind of retail channels and distribution channels. Are you seeing that evolve already? Or is that still something that has yet to kind of transpire?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Well, no. We're getting leverage out of each other's selling structures. So when you create a focus selling capability around Commercial and Consumer solutions, for example, as a division, you've got the power of a Rubbermaid Commercial Products sales structure that is now being leveraged on Quickie on the MAPA, Spontex businesses. And the reverse is true in Europe where you've got a MAPA, Spontex business with both professional and the consumer-facing portfolio. It's doing quite well. You've got the opportunity to piggyback from the Commercial Products on the back of that. So we're doing that work right now. And then from a product perspective, we began to do that work. So Comb and Beverages, for example, launches in the back half of this year.","We'll see how well that does. I think that's an interesting potential platform for us. It goes up against the Yetis of this world. And so the store is playing out as we expected it to, but the bulk of the product-based ideas come later \u2013 later in the cycle, later next year. The opportunities to leverage selling system happen now.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, we will take our final question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A couple housekeeping questions, I guess, on the guidance. First, it looks like you get about $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate. Can you just confirm, I want to make sure I heard this correctly that the timing of the divestitures and FX, you're supposed to completely offset and there's no benefit there. I just want to make sure I understand there's no sort of moving parts within the range, where there's higher level of investment, et cetera. So that would be the first question.","And then, Mike, for you, the second question is just more how the core sales outlook has evolved over the past few months. And I guess, I ask that in the context on the first quarter call, you saw unlikely that the company could deliver 4% sales growth in any quarter in the current environment. And it doesn't seem like the environment has gotten much better. And now, the guidance sort of implies in your commentary suggest that you could do north of 4%, maybe even like close to a 5% number and one of the quarters in the back half of the year. So I am just trying to reconcile, I guess, and maybe this is the function of your better visibility on distribution sort of \u2013 have more sort of visibility on the lift you're going to get from innovation. Just trying to reconcile the more bullish view, particularly within the context that the quarter was fine, albeit even a little bit light versus what you had guided to with the 2.5%, you'd expected some sequential acceleration there. So any commentary there would be helpful. Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Kevin, thanks for the question. I will take the core sales one. And Ralph can handle the tax question and forex question. So, Kevin, I don't recall ever mentioning 5%, but thank you for asking them, and letting me clarify. I said nudging up against the higher end of our range for this year, which is the high end of our range is 4%. So I don't like to provide quarterly guidance.","I think it's possible that we get to that level in the fourth quarter. But I'm not guiding specifically to it. I think with respect to the profile in the year, Q2, clearly, was a little bit below what we expected. I had called slightly better than Q1 basically is what I said, in line with maybe a little bit better is basically the language I used in \u2013 for Q2 in Fishing and Fresh Preserving, the issues there certainly undermined a potential to deliver that. So that was a little soft.","Our outlook for the back half of the year hasn't really changed, so we're always calling acceleration and performance. We never got quite as specific to say sequential improvement between Q3 and Q4, but that was always the profile, the plan as you would expect because of the flow of activity. But in the time between the changes we've made in the first half. So I think that would be my answer on core sales growth. And we'll see maybe someday in the future, we have a 5%. But I think that doesn't happen until we get into the thick of our innovation activity on the legacy Jarden businesses. But more to come on 2018 and beyond when we get a little bit closer to that timeframe.","The other thing that I said in the speech \u2013 in the script was that this presumed no major retail-driven disruptions in the back half of the year. And I think that's a good assumption to make. We've experienced many of them. I think other than a surprise bankruptcy; I think we are well aware of where the issues are. And I think we've contemplated particularly given the things we've been able to do in Q2 on Writing, we contemplated the risk profile that could emerge from office superstores in the back half of the year. So I think we have well in hand, but again, our guidance would be disrupted by a major bankruptcy. But again, I don't see that. The profile of our retailer base is such that that doesn't look like there's anybody in our top 15 for sure that would ever be in that circumstance.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","And Kevin, on the housekeeping items you mentioned upfront, you had it right on the divestiture timing changes relative to the FX Mike had in his remarks that was still neutral and no effect on the EPS. On tax, I think it was just a little high at $0.03. It's probably a little closer to $0.02 benefit, but as we guided the tax rate down to 22% to 23%.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes. And Kevin, just a little bit on the FX, the thing that I was trying to communicate, I don't know if I was clear about it is when we guided up to $0.05 in the first \u2013 with the first quarter results, a portion of that was Tools held-for-sale longer and a portion of that was the FX benefit from January 1 through when we were sharing. In the first quarter, we told you we had about $40 million of inflation that was in the business. Some of that was anticipated, some of that wasn't. So that was out there as well. So they're always moving parts underneath the numbers. And then the Ski's business loses a lot of money in the first half of that year. It's a bipolar business. You lose big money in the first half, and you make money in the second half. And the timing was what the timing was. We got good value for that asset, but we had to hold it longer than we anticipated, and that I quoted $25 million, most of \u2013 a big chunk of that is Q2-related. So those things sort of washed out and materially offset each other. My language I use was largely offset, not precisely offset, so to be clear.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes, thanks.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Polk for closing remarks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","I would just say this to my team, which is probably the only group left on the phone call. I'm really proud of your results, it's an incredibly challenging environment and to deliver this kind of performance in the context of our changed agenda and the landscape we're living with is really pretty extraordinary, so thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

Polk","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 2012 results call. Our objective today is twofold: First, we'll review our first quarter results and share some observations about our performance; second, we'll discuss the progress we are making driving our growth game plan into action.","Let's get into the results. We posted a solid set of Q1 numbers that represent the positives delivering full year results in line with our guidance. Importantly, we delivered these results in the context of a significant change agenda. We've aligned our organization around the new growth game plan, executed the European transformation SAP EPC cutover, driven Project Renewal into action, and delivered our third consecutive quarter of consistent results, getting the business back into a predictable cadence of delivery.","I'm proud of the team. They've been fully engaged and continue to demonstrate their ability to drive delivery and drive change at the same time.","Net sales growth this quarter was a very solid 4.6%. Core sales growth was 5.2%. We estimate that about $28 million in net sales were pulled forward from Q2 into Q1, associated with SAP implementation in Europe. Adjusting for this pre-buy, core sales would have been up 2.9%. The 2.9% underlying core sales growth is stronger than we anticipated when we guided the full year at the end of January.","As you recall, we thought we'd be in the lower end of the 2% to 3% full year guidance range in the first half of 2012, as a result of less merchandising support in Western Europe during the SAP transition window and operational challenges on D\u00e9cor. This planned slowdown was more than offset in Q1 by strong performance on our Professional and Baby businesses.","Q1 normalized EPS was $0.33, a year-over-year improvement of 14%, and $0.02 better than consensus. Adjusted for the benefit of the SAP pre-buy, normalized Q1 EPS would have been approximately in the middle of our full year EPS guidance range of 3% to 6%. We delivered 10 basis points of normalized operating margin improvement, despite increasing strategic SG&A, about 90 basis points. The increased strategic SG&A investment was fueled by continued progress on structural SG&A, down over 80 basis points versus prior year and good sequential and year-over-year improvement in gross margin to 38.3%, up 20 basis points versus prior year.","Our 38.3% gross margin was our highest result in the last 6 quarters, despite continuing challenges from operational issues in our U.S. D\u00e9cor business. Importantly, cash flow was over $60 million better than prior year, and we returned over $40 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","In Q1, our Professional segment had another strong quarter, delivering core sales growth of 10%, with the reported sales up over 9%. This continued strong performance was broad based. Our Consumer segment core sales declined 2%, with reported sales down 2.6%. This downturn was driven by the continued challenges in D\u00e9cor which, while expected, masked a very good quarter on the balance of our Consumer segment. Writing, in particular, had strong performance with excellent innovation on Parker and Paper Mate having a positive impact on those businesses.","We have made good progress resolving the operational issues at D\u00e9cor. Q1 represented sequential improvement in customer service versus Q4, and we believe we'll see further improvement in all key metrics in Q2. The D\u00e9cor business should return to more normal operating rhythm in the second half of 2012.","Our Baby & Parenting segment delivered outstanding growth in Q1, with reported and core sales growth of 21%. Our Baby growth rates were enhanced by weak year-ago comparisons and some onetime benefits that either don't repeat or reverse out in the balance of the year.","Our expectation for the remainder of the year is for more modest performance. Importantly, the Baby results due reflect steady progress with Graco POS positive in the U.S., and excellent momentum on Aprica in Asia, partially offset by continued challenges in Europe.","Excluding the SAP pre-buy, 8 of our 9 global business units grew core sales in Q1, 5 of the 8 grew core sales greater than 5%, and 2 of the 5 grew core sales greater 10%. In the emerging markets, core sales grew over 14% in Q1, with double-digit core sales growth in most of the major countries.","Our Q1 core sales grew nearly 3.5% in the developed world. Excluding the SAP pre-buy, developed world core sales would have been up about 1%, with strong growth in Japan and solid results in the U.S., offset by continued sales declines in Western Europe.","Our key growth initiatives yielded the impact we expected in Q1. Industrial Products & Services achieved their 9th consecutive quarter of double-digit core sales growth. Rich Wuerthele and his team are simply doing the fundamentals right, superior products, superior selling systems, new market entry and everyday great execution.","Parker Ingenuity continues to be deployed into new markets with a very successful launch in Japan. I visited a number of our customers and salespeople in Japan a few weeks back, spending time both in Tokyo and Osaka, our Fine Writing business looks terrific. We will launch Parker Ingenuity, with Parker 5th Technology into China in Q2 2012.","IRWIN delivered double-digit sales growth as a result of continued new product momentum and strong 'Irwinization' merchandising programs across the Americas. Our blue wall and other merchandising vehicles are getting the IRWIN brand and our new innovations in front of contractors in a more effectively way than ever before.","Paper Mate InkJoy has been launched in virtually all countries where Paper Mate is sold. Market growth is accelerating, and our shares are up over 100 basis points in the latest 13 weeks in the U.S.. Importantly, Paper Mate growth is driving about half of the category's growth despite having about a 14 share of market in the U.S., primarily on the strength of Paper Mate InkJoy.","We're gearing up in partnership with our customers for back-to-school, and the heavy launch support behind InkJoy is still in front of us. On Baby, Aprica's momentum continued with growth of over 50% in Asia. I met with our team, as well as our largest global Baby customer when I was in Japan. Our customers are pleased with our innovations, and we're working in partnership with them to continue to build the market.","Finally, Rubbermaid Medical continues to deliver outstanding results with core sales growth of over 30% as we continue to scale this brand. My brother-in-law and sister-in-law just had their first baby this past weekend, and I had the opportunity to go welcome my nephew Jacob into this world. For me, I'm not sure what was more thrilling, to see and hold little Jacob, which I got to admit was really cool, or to see and hold the 8th Rubbermaid Medical M38 cart systems that were in the Maternity Ward of Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey. That was just as cool as holding little Jacob.","Beyond these initiatives, our efforts to unlock the trapped capacity for growth are also progressing well. In Europe, we've migrated our ERP systems to SAP, and are operating in an EPC model as of early April. The teams in Europe have worked nonstop over the last few months and have done a great job to get us to the starting line, and we're ramping up order processing and fulfillment as we speak.","There are several weeks of handholding and issue resolution in front of us, as there always is in an SAP conversion. But the trend line is positive, the transition was managed well, and things are progressing as expected.","Project Renewal has good traction as well. Q1 represents the first operating quarter for our simplified group in GBU structures, 3 groups to 2, 13 GBUs to 9. So far, the teams are functioning really well. We've also implemented our new U.S. selling organization. We have created integrated cross-functional customer and channel teams at most of our top customers and in most of our channels. We still have GBU level salespeople on those teams, but they now report to a sales leader for that customer or channel who is responsible for developing our strategic relationship and our joint business plans across the total portfolio.","We transitioned to this new structure in the U.S. in Q1. We've held top to top meetings with many of our customers, and we already have a funnel of new commercial ideas flowing into the business.","Importantly, this strengthened customer-facing capability comes with lower costs than in the previous design, as duplicative selling structures at the GBU level have been eliminated. Beyond our selling structure change, we've announced the closure of our Rubbermaid Consumer factory in Greenville, Texas. We should be up and running in the second half of the year in the rest of the network with capacity utilization increased and gross margin benefits flowing through to the P&L.","So the European transformation and Project Renewal are progressing well. We've also announced our drive to reduce indirect procurement in partnership with IBM. Together, these programs have given us the flexibility to begin to fund increased investments to strengthen brand building and selling capabilities on our priority businesses in our priority markets.","In Q1, we began to invest in increased selling coverage in Latin America on our Professional and Writing businesses, and to fund early in the year support behind the Paper Mate InkJoy launch in North America and Latin America. There will be more investments to follow as we move into the second half of 2012 and into 2013.","So we're pleased with the Q1 results. They're a solid first step toward delivering our full year guidance of 2% to 3% core sales growth, 3% to 6% normalized EPS growth, up to 20 basis point improvement in normalized operating margin, and cash flow of $550 million to $600 million.","The team is working hard to establish a cadence of delivery in the business that is consistent and predictable. At the same time, they're embracing and implementing the changes necessary to create a bigger, faster growing, more global and more profitable Newell Rubbermaid.","Before handing over to Juan for a more detailed dive in the numbers, I'd like to discuss the impact of the SAP pre-buy on next quarter's results and also punctuate a unique event in the Q3 year-ago period that I've mentioned before, but want to highlight again.","First, the European SAP pre-buy effect on Q2 is self-evident. The roughly $28 million of pre-buy revenue and the associated EPS in Q1, will reverse out in Q2. Additionally, we will not return to normal merchandising support in Europe until the end of May or early June, once our order management systems are back to full capacity.","The Q2 reversal of the Q1 SAP benefit, the lack of EMEA merchandising support, coupled with peak ForEx pressure and generally poor European macros will put pressure on Q2 results. While none of this is new news and is all consistent with the guidance previously provided, I would point out that the best way to evaluate our results at the end of June will be on our first half numbers versus prior year.","As I mentioned on our January call, the other unique event in the numbers relates to the management incentive true-up that occurred last year, as it became apparent that we were not going to deliver our targets. The bulk of that benefited -- benefit flowed through to EPS in Q3 2011.","This year ago benefit will create about a $0.04 to $0.05 EPS hurdle for us to clear in Q3 2012. With the reversal of the Q1 SAP pre-buy in Q2 and the year ago incentive plan true-up in the prior year Q3 base, the middle 6 months of 2012 will be tough months to lap with respect to EPS growth versus prior year.","That said, our strong start to the year puts us right on track to deliver in the full year guidance range, although EPS growth will be more skewed to Q1 and Q4 than it normally would be.","With that, let me hand it over to Juan.","Juan R. Figuereo","Thanks, Mike. And good morning, everyone. Starting with our Q1 results, our net sales of $1.3 billion represent an underlying core sales growth of 5.2%, or 2.9% excluding the impact of the EMEA SAP pre-buy.","In North America, net sales grew 1.1% and core sales grew 1.3%, led by very strong growth in our Professional and Baby & Parenting segments. The Consumer segment North American core sales declined year-over-year due to the negative impact of the D\u00e9cor business.","Outside North America, net sales grew 13.6% or 15.4% excluding ForEx. Adjusting for the SAP pre-buy, international core sales grew by almost 7%. Both Latin America and APAC, which are priority growth markets for us, delivered double-digit core sales growth with Latin America increasing 10.9% and APAC increasing an impressive 24.6%.","Although EMEA's reported core sales growth was 12.7%, after adjusting for the impact of the SAP pre-buy, the region showed a core sales decline of approximately 3% mainly due to the continuing tough macro environment in Western Europe.","Gross margin was 38.3%, a better-than-expected 20 basis point improvement over a tough year-ago comparison. Pricing, productivity and mix more than offset input cost inflation. Versus the prior year, pricing contributed 100 basis points to the gross margin improvement, while inflation had a 130 basis point adverse impact.","SG&A spend increased $18 million compared with the prior year and on a percentage of sales basis increased 20 basis point to 27.3%. The main driver of the increase was higher brand building and strategic spend, as we continued to invest in demand creation initiatives in focused growth areas.","The Newell Professional segment, where we are showing the strongest growth trends, was one of these focus areas. And in our Consumer segment, support for the Paper Mate InkJoy launch and geographic expansion in the Writing business was another.","Operating margin on a normalized basis increased 10 basis points to 11%. Interest expense for the quarter was $20.2 million compared with $21.9 million in the previous year. This improvement was due to lower debt levels. Our normalized tax rate in the fourth quarter was 23.5% compared with 24.9% in the prior year quarter. The change in the normalized year-over-year tax rate was primarily driven by the geographic mix of earnings and the timing of certain discrete items recorded in the quarter.","We continue to expect the full year tax rate to be essentially flat to last year at around 26%. During the quarter, we used cash of $47.4 million for our seasonal operating needs, a 56% improvement over the prior year. This was a very good outcome considering the incremental working capital needs in the quarter to support SAP go live in Europe. The main drivers of the year-over-year improvement were lower incentive cash payments related to our 2011 management bonus, as well as lower customer programs partially offset by higher pension contributions.","We continue to make steady progress improving our working capital. We were able to maintain our cash conversion cycle essentially flat versus prior year in spite of incremental need to support SAP go live in Europe, which included extended terms for customer pre-buys, supplier prepayment and targeted inventory build.","We returned $40.6 million to shareholders in the form of $24.2 million in dividends and $16.4 million paid for the purchase of 0.9 million shares. We retired $250 million in medium-term notes in the quarter, which was bridged with short-term lines that we plan to pay down with operating cash flow in the second half of the year.","We believe our balance sheet will continue to get stronger and towards the second half of 2012, we should be close to our desired comfort range of 2.5x adjusted leverage ratio.","Turning now to our 2012 outlook. As Mike covered earlier, we are reaffirming our full year guidance. We expect full year core sales growth of 2% to 3%. With key currencies strengthening against the U.S. dollar, we are now widening our range of expected foreign currency translation impact on sales for the year to a negative 100 to 200 basis points.","This assumes average exchange rates for 2012 remained around recent spot rates. We anticipate normalized operating margin to expand by up to 20 basis point. This guidance reflects our expectation that we will generate gross margin improvement as productivity, improved product mix and pricing more than offset inflation, and that we increase strategic SG&A spend to support our growth game plan.","We expect interest expense for 2012 to be approximately $80 million, with debt reductions to occur in the second half of the year. Our normalized full year effective tax rate for 2012 is projected to be around 26%, which would imply an approximate 27% rate for the balance of the year. We expect 2012 normalized earnings per diluted share between $1.63 and $1.69 or about 3% to 6% growth. This EPS guidance excludes between $110 million and $130 million of planned restructuring and restructuring-related costs associated with the European Transformation Plan and Project Renewal.","Operating cash flow is expected to be between $550 million and $600 million for the full year, including $110 million to $120 million in restructuring and restructuring-related cash payments. Capital expenditures are projected at $200 million to $225 million. ","In conclusion, with Q1 behind us, our outlook for the year has not changed. We continue to anticipate headwinds from continued economic uncertainty in Europe, some gross margin pressure in the first half of the year, as we work through our D\u00e9cor issues and unfavorable foreign exchange. But there's positive news as well. Our businesses are gaining momentum. We are seeing good growth in the businesses and regions where we're focusing our investments. The Professional segment had another strong quarter helped in large part by the sales force investments we made. Our Writing businesses are performing well, largely driven by innovative new products and superior commercialization programs. And we are seeing continued momentum in our emerging markets, again, where we are investing resources to accelerate growth.","In summary, our first quarter results give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk","Thanks, Juan. Let me now update you on the growth game plan we unveiled at CAGNY subsequent to our January earnings call. The growth game plan is designed to sharpen our choices and strengthen our capabilities for accelerated performance in the marketplace.","At the heart of the growth game plan is a belief in growth as our primary source of long term value creation. There are a lot of big areas in the growth game plan. It's a transformation strategy that will direct our efforts for the next several years, and we've already begun putting the plan into action.","The first step was to simplify our business. We've already done this through Project Renewal, simplifying our design around 2 fields of play, Consumer and Professional.","Second, we need to make sharper portfolio choices in order to fuel accelerated growth on our brands and businesses that have the greatest right to win. And we need to pivot a portion of our portfolio to go where the growth is happening in the world, the emerging markets.","We have done this by aligning our businesses against 3 different portfolio roles: win bigger, win where we are, and incubate for growth. Like creating this where-to-play framework, we can now be more single-minded about deploying resources to the higher growth opportunities, while tasking the slower growth businesses to win more effectively within their current geographic footprints.","We will expect all businesses to grow, but in different ways and at different rates. With the clarity of the new growth game plan, our efforts and resources can be much better aligned with our growth platforms. You are beginning to see some of the savings associated with simplification being reinvested in increased selling systems in Latin America on Professional and Writing, as well as increased brand building investment behind new product launches, like Paper Mate InkJoy.","We've been pushing hard to pivot the organization and drive this new strategy into action. There is much more to share and much more to do. I invite you to join us at our upcoming Investor Day on May 24. We'll take the time to give you a clearer sense for the growth game plan, and the actions we are taking to accelerate our performance.","With that, let me open things up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the retail channel in the U.S. Obviously, good January and February numbers, maybe less so in March. But particularly, I guess in the DIY businesses for you guys and those channels, how have the channels progressed? What's your view there? How have your share positions progressed in those markets?","Michael B. Polk","Look, we feel good about the underlying consumption momentum in our business. You see that in our share results on many of our businesses. Not all, but most. So we see good share progression, and we see decent category growth rates as well. So we feel pretty good about the underlying conditions in the U.S. at least. Europe's a different story, but the U.S. looks to be a more interesting environment than it was a year ago. Now some of that -- some of those conditions and some of the growth specific to our Professional businesses may in fact be an artifact of perhaps a little bit of an earlier spring in half the country, but in general, conditions look pretty good. There are a number of our retail partners who are changing their merchandising strategies and approaches. Those are things that we don't control, we have to adapt to. And we do that in partnership with them, and those are choices they make in the context of their strategic agenda. And we see that happening in a couple of places, but no more so than you would normally see. And our challenge, our leaders have to adapt to that environment and figure out how to adapt their merchandising programs and their marketing programs to that reality. But as I said, in general, the environment's not -- at least looking a little bit more favorable than it has historically. Historically, being the last 6 quarters or so.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. And I guess since you brought it up, can you talk a little bit about -- a little more detail on what you were just talking about some changes in how the retailers are doing things? What do you mean by that, I guess? And what sort of changes are you guys going to have to adapt to, do you think?","Michael B. Polk","Well, there's some that are happening in a way that work for us and some that are happening in a way that create some uncertainty, but are important for the retailers. So the most probably profound change that's out there that we look at is J.C. Penney's change in strategy, which for many of our businesses has an impact on how they merchandise. It's not a bad thing. It actually has the potential to be a good thing. But as retailers transition from one point of view to another, you need to move aggressively and be in touch with what it is they are trying to accomplish. Of course, we have to bring our agenda to life through their strategic framework. I always say that, we want to go to market in the language of the customer and in the context of their strategies. And our agenda needs to sync up and be amplified in the context of what they are doing. And that's probably the most significant one at the moment. Obviously, a year ago, Wal-Mart went through a change of similar ilk going back to some of the basics that had made them such a strong partner for us. And so this always happens. It's not unique to the window we're in. And that's one of the powers of the new sales structure we're putting in place, will be to have a single voice accountable for those customers and to be able to anticipate some of those changes such that we can create the most commercial value in the context of their business agenda.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. And I guess one last follow-up on that one. Is there -- has there been a near-term impact on your sales or your share or your positioning at retail in general? Or do you project a near-term impact? And can you talk about that a little bit, which direction that would be in?","Michael B. Polk","Well, our new selling structure is going to create value for us over time. I talked about 2 jobs to be done in the company: one, to create more commercial value out of what we're bringing to market in the markets where we are; and two, extending our geographic footprint in a disciplined way to the higher growth emerging markets. The change in selling structure we put in place is designed to enhance and develop and deliver more commercial value in the markets where we are. So I expect that structural change to deliver more growth for us over time, and the beautiful thing about it is it comes at a lower cost as a percent of sales, but it elevates our conversation from a transactional conversation with each other to a more strategic conversation, by putting one person and one team accountable for the development of our joint businesses. So I expect positive things to happen over time. We've just transitioned to that structure in Q1, and so there's nothing in our numbers today that show any benefit from that choice, but the future will.","Operator","Your next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","On the Professional and Baby businesses, excluding the contribution from SAP, the pre-buy. Can you give us a sense of the contribution -- I mean, is it consumption or retailers stocking up on inventory that was driving the sales of those businesses excluding SAP?","Michael B. Polk","Sure. So it's a good question. Let me start with Baby because I think that's the one that's sort of -- is most eye-opening in terms of the trend shift and there's a number of things going on in that number, and I think it's worth sharing those things with you so that you can extrapolate forward as you look at how you view our business. Let me give you the headline first on the full year. We expect to deliver growth on Baby in 2012. And as you recall, I said that we were attempting last year to stabilize the business in the second half of 2011, return it to growth in 2012, and that agenda is right on track. Importantly, you should not extrapolate Q1's growth rate to the full year, about half of the growth is related to timing differences in selling year-over-year, specifically the absence of an inventory liquidation in the prior year period. So about half of that is a onetime event that we always had in our numbers because we knew it was going to happen. That's not truly underlying performance. The underlying performance, though, has strengthened over the last 4 to 6 months. We've got low to mid single-digit POS growth in Graco in the U.S., and we've got strong double-digit growth on Aprica in Asia. And that's partially offset by continued declines in Europe. And what we're focused on is sustaining the POS growth in the U.S. in partnership with our retailers. We are looking to extend the tremendous Aprica share and revenue growth we've experienced over the last 4 quarters in Asia. However, that will moderate as we lap the step up. That growth rate will moderate as we lap the step up in Aprica's performance from last Q2. Because this is the 4th consecutive quarter of good Aprica results. So we don't fully expect to grow Aprica in Asia for the balance of the year at the same growth rate, but we do expect it to grow nicely because we're continuing to build our share position, and we've got an excellent team there that's focused on the right things. The offset to that, we expect the problems in Europe to continue until we get our 2013 new items to market, which won't occur until late 2012. Now as you recall, we've moved the fellow who is running our Aprica business in Asia to Europe to help us straighten that business out, Tom Brown. And he's landed, and he's getting his arms around it. And I think the opportunity might be, if we can stabilize Europe before those new items hit. But there's no sign -- I think it would be a bad assumption to build into the core forecast to assume we could do that. The net of all this is we'd expect to grow lower-single digits in 2012, and we're going to push ourselves to drive towards mid single-digit delivery. I think that's a stretch as I look at things today. But if things break our way, like Europe's stabilization or if the Aprica growth rate in Asia exceeds the growth rate we built in, despite lapping the step up in the year ago period. It's possible. But the key thing on Baby is to not take the 21% growth and extrapolate forward, you'd over rank your estimates if you were doing that. On Professional, about 60% of the SAP pre-buy is related to the Professional business. And so despite that SAP pre-buy, we've got very, very good results and it's broad-based. And this is a very attractive business from my perspective. As you know, from our discussions at CAGNY, it falls into the win bigger portfolio roll. And this is -- win bigger means it will be our first call on resources, whether that's human capital, financial resources. It's on trend with the move, from rural living to urban living in the emerging markets. And our opportunity is to take what is a differentiated set of product propositions and brands and a very good selling system, a repeatable model grounded in those 3 things and deploy it more broadly in the world. And so, we will continue to press our Professional business for accelerated performance, and the numbers in the first quarter at around 10% core sales growth are flattered in part by the SAP pull-forward, but that really isn't what explains the numbers at that level. It's just good underlying performance and excellent leadership. So those are the 2 questions you've asked. Of course, we have another business in the quarter that is important to talk about, and that's D\u00e9cor, because that's actually -- while it came in exactly where we thought it would, right on our expectations, it certainly was a down draft in both growth and margin in the quarter. So excluding D\u00e9cor, our Consumer segment core growth rates and margins and excluding the SAP pre-buy associated with the other Consumer businesses, it would have been positive, as a result of the good results on our Writing businesses. So D\u00e9cor hurt the optics of our performance. So the way I look at this is that the Baby onetime benefits of weak competitors and the absence of the inventory liquidation is offset by -- sort of washes out against the D\u00e9cor underperformance, and those 2 things normalize out as we move forward. We fully expect D\u00e9cor to make sequential improvement in Q2 and to get back into a normal rhythm of delivery in the second half of '12. So hopefully, that creates a framework for you to look at our Q1 results and build your view forward. Those are the key moving parts.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","That was very helpful. Just one follow-up. You've spoken in the past about an increase in the dividend. I was wondering if there was any better sense of the timing of that event.","Michael B. Polk","Yes, of course, as you recall, we've said, and we're committed to making our payout ratios -- our dividend payout ratios more competitive. We said we want to drive our dividend payout ratios to the 30% to 35% range. And today, we're sitting right around 20%, slightly below. And so obviously, we need to continue to progress against that commitment. This is, of course, the board's call, not management's call, but there are -- there's nothing really that I can see that would get in the way of us taking a step toward that objective that we've set in the near term. And I was pleased with the cash delivery in the first quarter. We're working hard on working capital to drive -- to improve our cash conversion cycle, and so -- and we've got an eye towards where our leverage metrics will be at the end of 2012. So I've said previously that our ability to take a step toward that dividend payout ratio is not dependent on any unique commitment with respect to leverage metrics or really, there's nothing in the way from an earnings perspective of us being able to take a step in that direction. So it's simply a matter of timing, and I'm pleased with Q1. I'm pleased with the gross margin delivery in Q1, which gives us breathing room to be able to make that choice and recommendation to the board. And when the board decides that they're comfortable, we will announce a stat.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is there a way to try to figure out what the POS growth was in the quarter relative to the 2.9% organic x the SAP pre-buy?","Michael B. Polk","We don't look at POS in aggregate. I think POS is slightly ahead of it, and I just -- I make that judgment ahead of the growth in our markets. I make that judgment just based on the share data that I look at. We saw the GDP growth this morning and that wasn't particularly exciting. And so 2.9% looks slightly better than that as well. So look, we're building share and our market growth is improving versus where it's been. Is our POS growth ahead of the 2.9% underlying? I actually -- we don't look at it that way. In 1 or 2 of the businesses where we do look at it, it is. But we don't look at it across the total business.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And then, Juan, just on the tax rate, the 27%. I thought we were going to have an inflection once the EPC came up, which happened in April. So is it fair to say that, that's probably a conservative estimate on the tax rate? And then also if there's any cash flow implications of doing that?","Juan R. Figuereo","The 27% for the balance of the year or 26% for the full year does reflect the benefit of EPC beginning after -- in the second half of the year, really beginning in May. As you will recall, we had a big benefit in Q4 from the EPC legal entity structuring. So the fact that were able to maintain flat rate means that there's a benefit coming through. We estimate about $0.03 per share will be the tax benefits of EPC this year.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Good. That's helpful. And then just in terms of the commodity tenor as the year progresses, I think you said 130 basis points for the first quarter. How does that kind of look as the year progresses?","Juan R. Figuereo","The inflation outlook will be slightly less than in the first quarter for the rest of the year, but it should continue in the 100 to 150 basis points range.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, I'm going to keep going if you don't mind. $9 million, I guess, of renewal savings in the quarter, and I think you're going to exit the year at a $100 million. So also, kind of what's the tenor of the savings coming through?","Michael B. Polk","Look, the saving are coming through exactly as we expected them to, and we see the big step up as we move through Q2 into Q3. We some more things that have to happen. We've announced a big series of changes, but the value of the savings don't flow through into the second half. So you got the manufacturing changes, you've got distribution network changes, where all of that's been announced and people know, but the physical shifts don't occur and have a material impact into the second half of the year. So we're right on track with renewal, where we expected to be.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And then the 90 basis points from strategic spending? Can you break that down a little bit more granularly, like where that money went? And then, is that probably the right number for the full year?","Michael B. Polk","We'll see on the full year. I got to watch the gross margin delivery. So that's why I didn't want to guide SG&A specifically. But the 90 basis points in strategic spending is broken into both A&P increases and selling system increases. The A&P increase is focused on our Writing business because, as you recall, we launched InkJoy at the end of last year, sort of counter seasonally. And we've supported it with good marketing support in the first quarter, which is what's driving our share performance and the nice step up in category growth rates, and the overall revenue performance in Writing, as well as the Parker Ingenuity launch in many countries around the world. So the A&P is focused in the Writing businesses, and the selling systems are supporting the Professional businesses, specifically our Tools businesses in Latin America, and also Rubbermaid Medical in the U.S. And so those are the 2 places where the money has flowed. Of course, it's been funded by an 80 basis point reduction in structural SG&A, which is in part driven by renewal and 20 basis points improvement, a little bit more than 20 basis point improvement in gross margins.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And then going forward, I think you're going to add bodies also. So you have the systems in place in the selling side, so...","Michael B. Polk","Yes, Bill, when I say systems, I'm talking people.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got you.","Michael B. Polk","It's feet on the street in Latin America and in Rubbermaid Medical systems.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. One, going back to Europe on that Baby side and with Tom Brown coming over. Can you talk about how you guys are evaluating, like country by country? I know that Germany and the U.K. are attractive markets. But certainly, right now, I'm just wondering how you're evaluating where you want to play and maybe where you might decide to exit, if possible?","Michael B. Polk","Well, look, I mean, we do look at our business in the way that you're describing it. So we look at GBU by country cell and without getting too specific, we make judgments about potential and competitive landscape and those drive how we prioritize which cells we'll bet on and which ones we'll defer betting on to a later date. And Tom is working through that with Christie for Europe, as well as Christie looking at that around the rest of the world. So obviously, 2 cells that are of critical importance to us. So the U.S. and Japan in our Baby business. And you've hit the 2 major cells in Europe, U.K. and Germany. And so, we focus on -- we'll focus our investments against those opportunities, and we'll look at the other opportunities and try to hold those businesses together in the most efficiently, while we're placing investment bets on the opportunity geographies. But without getting -- Jason, I don't want to get too specific on where we're going to do what. We have some pretty active competitors that I'm sure are listening to this call, and that would give them all the information they needed to do their roadmapping.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess the second question is really about One Newell. And I guess just wanted to kind of draw upon your experience with One Unilever, like how long did it take to kind of see the returns come through? Maybe just any -- I know after CAGNY, I think you were meeting with some of the retailers and just the reception that you've gotten so far with this program. So just maybe if you could just draw on your past a little bit and how quickly you think that, that could turn around? Again, understanding it's different categories but the same concept.","Michael B. Polk","Look, I think we're going to see a nice benefit from this. When I talk about increasing the commercial value of the things we're bringing to market, the way we're going to do that is by being more selective and less democratic in how we allocate resources and by strengthening our selling capabilities in the markets where we are. And so this change allows us to elevate the conversation from the buying point, a transactional level, to a more strategic conversation. So I personally already participated in top to top meetings with -- in the homes -- without getting specific, in the home center channel, in the office products channel, in the mass merchant channel, and we will continue to dialogue at that level to create ambitious growth-oriented plans from our businesses. And what I said in the call, in the script, was that we're seeing an interesting set of ideas now flowing out of that sales structure, that offer us opportunity for growth. Because the team is representing the total portfolio now and in the past, they were really focused on their individual categories. So new ideas are coming in every day, and just like we have an innovation funnel, we now have a commercialization opportunity funnel of ideas that we can go after. Some of them are attractive, some of them are not, but the fact that the dialogue is occurring and that the function, the customer development function is now engaging with the businesses about opportunity to accelerate growth, that's a very constructive and positive development. I think we'll see some value out of that in 2012, certainly in the back half of the year. But the reality is, the full value comes next year. And there's much more to do. So this is the first step, but there's more to do. There's more opportunities. As soon you as you start thinking that way, you see all kinds of opportunities for growth and also for cost.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And just a housekeeping and then I'll hop off. Did you say, I think you bought back about $16 million worth of stock, and I know you had I think $250 million left in the authorization. So I was just wondering if you could talk about buyback and then just how aggressive you may be over the next year or so with that.","Juan R. Figuereo","I would like to remind you that our philosophy is actually not to be aggressive as we want to be opportunistic. So basically, you'll see us buying more when there's a big discount to what we consider fair value of the stock, and you'll see us buying less as we approach that value. The program to date, we've bought about $62 million against the $300 million program.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you say if you bought anything in the month of April with your stock a little bit weaker over the last few weeks?","Juan R. Figuereo","I can tell you that through the end of -- yes, we have been in the market in April.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. I guess first, in terms of the positive surprise you guys saw on the quarter, even adjusting for the pre-buy. It seems like given the strong growth you saw in international, that most of the surprises were on the international side. Is that correct? And if not, where did you see some upside surprise in the U.S.?","Michael B. Polk","I'm pleased with the Baby momentum in the U.S. Some of that is a rollover out of Q4 and was built into the base. But some of the Baby over deliver -- was over delivery in the U.S. and it's core consumption-based. We continue on our Tools business to see very, very good momentum. And as I said, sort of the warmer earlier spring certainly contributed a bit of that, but we've got very good innovation programs on IRWIN, and we just have a superior selling system on Lenox. So we're seeing good traction with those businesses. So it's not just emerging markets. It is -- those core businesses in the U.S. are performing quite well. And obviously in Writing with InkJoy's launch, we have good momentum in those businesses around the world. As I said, we've launched InkJoy now in every market where Paper Mate is sold. So that is contributing both in the developed world and in the emerging markets. Now all that said, I'm really pleased with the growth rates outside of the U.S. They're not quite to the ambition we've set for ourselves, for 2013, '14, '15, but they're a step towards that, and this is before we've really pivoted our resources against them. Because as you recall, we just shared with you the growth game plan, the framework for thinking in February at CAGNY. We got the board's approval to it in November. So we've built the 2012 plan in a different context, and so we're shifting the activity systems in the business towards the growth game plan, but it's a transitional year in that respect. And so we haven't seen the full upside of what we intend to do in those markets. Now that said, I've always said that job one is to get more commercial value out of the markets where we are and to attack the structural cost in those markets so that we spinoff enough cash to make those investment bets. We need to demonstrate that as our first step. But strategically, I would hope that over time we can deliver even more out of the emerging markets, but I'm pleased with it.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","On that point, in terms of the emerging markets, how should we think about the profitability ramp as you go forward in 2012, '13 and beyond? I mean, obviously, it's a going to need some investment that you've talked about that in the past, but when should we start to see not only the top line impact from those investments, but the bottom line impact as well?","Michael B. Polk","Yes, what we've said is, we're going to go after the opportunity for accelerated growth in the context of a commitment to deliver steady sequential improvement in operating margin, operating income margin as a company. And so our investment profile will be governed by the desire to deliver that. Now, what we've also said, and we explained at CAGNY, is that our margin structure in the emerging markets is very high. It's very good. In part driven by the pieces of the portfolio that we have in those markets, and that should structurally continue, although for a period of time we will need to step those margins back as we invest for growth. And the way we'll fund that is by getting the cost out of Western Europe, and the cost out of North America such that we get the margins up there. The net effect of it should be margin enhancement for the company, steady, sequential improvement in operating margin enhancement and operating margin delivery and operating margin growth. And we've said this year that we envision delivering up to 20 basis points of normalized operating income margin, and I think we should be committing ourselves to doing that going forward, as I said in the discussions around the longer-term guidance.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. Just one last one, if I could. In terms of the -- your growth game plan, you talked about allocating resources differently than Newell has done in the past. I would imagine some of those discussions you have are positive discussions, and some of the discussions you had with business leaders might be a little bit more difficult. How has the organization -- or at least parts of the organization that may see less resources, adapted to this new reality?","Michael B. Polk","So, Joe, what we did this year to enable that conversation to occur in a productive way is we changed our compensation system. If you recall, we had the 43 different bonus pools, management incentive pools last year. This year, we have one, total company performance. And so we've taken the constraint off that would have inhibited the movement of resources -- either human capital or money across business. And so, that was an important first step. The other thing that we're attempting to do through targeting is to establish targets that are relevant to the roles that those businesses play. And again, '12 is a transition year, '13 will not be. We've already started having conversations about our 2013 plans and targets. And those plans and targets reflect the strategic ambition we've set for each of those different businesses. So there is a way for everybody to benefit from this pivot, as I describe it, because everybody plays a different role and has a different set of metrics that they're accountable for delivering. In service to an outcome that should be greater than the sum of the parts, and that's been our historical opportunity. We simply have been a holding company adding up the individual businesses. What we\u2019re trying to do is make the whole greater than the sum of the parts and accelerate our growth trajectory by doing that. Of course, it's just a plan at this point. So we need to live it and operationalize it and drive it into action. So I don't want to overpromise at this point, but it's a framework that will drive our choices over the next several years, and it won't change because we know it's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'll try to ask both in one breath. I know most kids are getting out of school, but maybe you could give us an idea of what you're seeing for the back-to-school, kind of from what you're hearing from retailers for both the Writing business and Office business? I mean, whether they're getting more encouraged or if it should be any different there? And then second, with what you said in terms of kind of some of the timing and headwinds over the next couple of quarters, would do expect -- and I know you don't give quarterly guidance -- earnings to be down over the next 2 quarters on a year-over-year basis and then should really bounce back strong in fourth quarter?","Michael B. Polk","Look, I think in the way I've described our earnings profile, this year is going to look unusual, and it'll have 2 nice bookends, which I don't love because it creates a little bit of drama as you go through the year, but that's the way it's going to flow. I don't want to get specific, Bill, on whether we're going to grow or not grow EPS in any given quarter. We're going to push ourselves to grow EPS every quarter. Even though in particular, Q3 is really difficult because of the bonus true-up in that window. So I think -- I don't want the -- I got people listening to this call, so I don't want to take any pressure out of the system for them. But obviously, Q3 will be a challenge in the mix, and Q2 obviously has a challenge associated with the SAP flip. But we're going to -- we've got better underlying growth in Q1 than we anticipated having at this point, and I don't know how the story will play out, but I'm hopeful that we -- these folks have really demonstrated that they can change and deliver at the same time. So setting the ambition at the right level is important in order to continue to build the confidence in the organization. So I would love it if the story ended with 2 quarters of growth in the middle versus prior year from an EPS perspective and the bookends I have described, but I just don't know yet. I don't know whether we're going to be able to deliver that. Part of that will be a function of whether we can really make headway on gross margins. I'm pleased with the gross margins, and they're impacted negatively by the D\u00e9cor performance in Q1. So if we can figure out how to get that D\u00e9cor negative out of the mix and hold it altogether everywhere else, then we get to a different place than what we've built in. But time will tell, and I think you need to -- I got a little bit more explicit in this call because I really wanted you guys to think about that as you look at what we have to do in order to make it happen. Now what I won't do is I won't manage the business in 90-day increments. We just laid out this strategic framework for an ambition for the company, and choices in any given quarter to step towards that ambition may have consequences in terms of the EPS flow. So the fact that I've got to lap a management incentive bonus true-up in the prior year window is not going to cause me to not invest in the strategic initiative even if there are consequences with respect to EPS growth in the 90-day window. And I know that we'll try to manage it and bring visibility to that, which is what I've tried to do today, so that you can anticipate it, and we don't get into any missed expectations. But at the same time, the thing that is the dominant logic for me, and the thing that's driving choice for me is consecutive steps towards the ambition set out in the growth game plan.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just following back up on the Office products for back-to-school, anything you're hearing early from the retailers?","Michael B. Polk","No, I mean it's obviously a critical window. And it's going to be -- as it always is, it's going to be a real competitive battle. And our partners are clever, and they'll play us off each other, and we'll have to be clever and think about how to navigate through those waters. The good news is, we've got a great innovation in our hands that will be marketed fully in that window of back-to-school, and we didn't have that in the year-ago period. We've got great share momentum, over 100 basis points increase in share, market share. In fact, I didn't say this in the script, but in the latest 13 weeks, Paper Mate is now the #2 brand in the total writing category behind Sharpie. And so we've got good momentum, fundamental momentum in this business. It's going to be -- there'll be a battle like it always is. So I'm not going to project how the story will end in that 4 or 5 week compressed window. But we've got the tools to go after it, and we're fully resourced to do it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to ask a little bit about some of the Consumer businesses you didn't touch on, namely Culinary and even Rubbermaid Home. Just -- it seems like home improvement trends that I've heard from some other companies and from retail sales reports and so on, do seem to be improving, so I would have thought those businesses might have seen a little bit of pick up as well. So can you talk about momentum in those?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. We've got a great innovation funnel coming on Rubbermaid Consumer in the cleaning area and then refuse, and so I'm excited about those. Those innovations are in front of us, not that -- they were not being fully marketed in Q1, but they get marketed and they sell in, in a bigger way, in the middle to later half of the year. Culinary, it's a great brand. Calphalon's a great brand. And we continue to have good delivery on that business. Last year, I was flattered by increased distribution. As you recall, the J.C. Penney sell-in. So we've got to lap that. So the growth rate certainly in 2012 will not be as dramatic as the growth rates were in 2011, but the fundamentals of that business are wonderful. We've got a really terrific leader and team on that business, and we continue to build out our innovation agenda there. So I'm very encouraged by that. I think it won't be the driver it was last year for the lack of the onetime benefit of the Penny sell-in, but not -- nothing to do with the fundamentals. And on Beauty & Style, we're just launching a new line of hair dryers and curling irons, and it's really an important addition to that portfolio. So we're  playing on both sides of the aisle, and that's just flowing into market as we speak. So we'll see how our heat style range does. But I think the brand, the products look quite good, but it's -- again, it's still in front of us.","Lauren DeSanto - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. And just to make sure I understand completely, that's a totally new add to that business, right? The heat filing?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. If you walk, Lauren, if you walk that aisle where hair accessories are, it usually sits on the other side of the aisle. So and our competitors have both offerings in their portfolio, and now we do as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Really on Baby & Parenting, I think you've been pretty clear that I think the balance of the year looks like on a revenue basis kind of flat to down-ish a bit. I wonder if you could comment a bit on the profitability, the contribution margin in the first quarter was pretty spectacular as was the overall operating margin, how do you see the profitability of Baby & Parenting for the full year versus last year's operating margin? And maybe comment on the contribution margin.","Michael B. Polk","I was very pleased with the operating margin delivery in the Baby business. Certainly benefits from the tremendous momentum we have on Aprica in Asia, which is a higher margin business in the balance of the line, and so we're getting a mixed benefit on margin in Baby. But it's also driven by some big and tough calls that Christie is making on cost. And so it's the combination of those things and a strong working relationship with our key supplier on Graco, our partner or sourcing partner and working together on cost. It's been a very good 90-day window. The challenge going forward will be that the mix benefit that's coming from Aprica in Japan because we lapped the step up in that performance, that will be less meaningful for our business in the out quarters, although we'll still see some of it. And so the real driver of margin delivery and improvement over time will be getting the Graco business moving in North America. And although I'm happy with that progress, the really material step up will come when the '13 innovations flow through. It takes about 18 months from concept development to market. And so the real test of the new strategy will come in 2013. And I think we'll do well this year, don't get me wrong, but we've got such a down draft in Europe and there's not a material catalyst there, that it won't be easy to get mid single-digit growth in Q2, Q3, Q4. Now that said, we're not taking the pressure off Christie and she's not taking the pressure off her team. So we're going to push ourselves toward that. But not at the expense of anything strategic going forward.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But I don't think you commented on the profitability for the year. The contribution margin in the first quarter was 47%, if our math is right. Is that about what it will be for the year or will it be...","Michael B. Polk","No, it won't be, because you're looking at the year-over-year improvement in profit that's driven on the back of the mix improvements in Baby related to Aprica. We're going to get some improvement. Certainly, some material improvement versus prior year, but not at that rate.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just my last question or a follow-up question is on -- what's left to do on SAP? Can you kind of maybe refresh us? We've talked a lot about the pre-buy. How much is left to do? And are you seeing any benefits now from SAP? It's been a process now for, I think, 4 years.","Michael B. Polk","Yes, I know, it's been a journey. We certainly have visibility into cost and complexity, and we have visibility into working capital complexity. And we're -- the real opportunity is to now mine that. We're delivering above expected outcome with respect to European transformation. That project will yield a higher IRR than what was committed to the board, in part by strong operational results, and you see that in the operating income margin in EMEA, but also by a better outcome from a tax perspective. So we're starting to get the benefits. There's a lot of work still to do in Q2, and that's why we've tempered some of the growth ambition in the first half of the year related to the start up that has to occur. So when we talk about go live, that simply is -- it gets you to the starting line. And we've been for the last 3 weeks, operating in an SAP EPC model in Europe. And we're ramping up where we thought we would be. But like any other SAP conversion, there's a lot of work to be done on issue resolution, and you have to tackle them as they come. We are not seeing anything material that would suggest that we won't be able to deliver to the expectations we've set for ourselves within the business on start up. I think we don't get to a fully stabilized, normalized delivery until the end of Q2 in Europe. And once we clear that, then we have sort of an open door to move to the next project. And the next project for us will be in the Latin America. We prioritized Latin America ahead of Asia, and specifically Brazil. And so we have a lead team in Brazil now thinking about how to scope the opportunity, and that will be the next project on the horizon.","Juan R. Figuereo","I would add to that the SAP project since the beginning, Budd, we review it with the board every quarter, and we look at benefit [indiscernible] versus the initial business case. And I can tell you that, generally, we're ahead of what we had expected when the project was approved.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","When do you think it will all be done, Juan or Mike?","Juan R. Figuereo","Europe is done this year. We've begun to do some of prework in Latin America. And now there's discussion going on about what is a right timing for APAC. But we're looking at probably another 2 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So gross margin came in better than expected in the quarter. Juan, can you talk specifically about what drove that, and does that mean there's some potential upside to your prior full year expectation? And I know you touched on this, but can you just update us, in general, on the pricing environment here, and if you've held on to all the pricing you've implemented?","Juan R. Figuereo","Yes, we did hold on. We did get all of the pricing that we implemented. In fact, the pricing was slightly ahead of our expectation. So that contributed. We also mixed up, because the businesses that recorded the faster growth in the quarter, particularly versus expectation, tended to be the higher margin businesses, so there's a little bit of mix there. And last, there was a slight benefit from inflation, it was slightly better than our expectations for the quarter.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And do you think those are things that generally extend in the balance of the year, or is most of it really mix related that dissipates as we look at the balance of the year?","Juan R. Figuereo","Also we had a ForEx impact benefit, by the way. The inflation -- our outlook for the balance of the year is slightly better than it would have been a couple of months ago. So I mean that should continue through the balance of the year. The pricing was a pricing really from 2011. So that's already -- the incremental benefit will read through the balance of the year. And we hope that the mix benefit will continue, depending upon how the business has performed in the balance of the year.","Michael B. Polk","I can tell you, Dara, that I really like the taste of 38.3%, but it sets an ambition towards something even higher. And it's good to get a step up. This gross margin delivery at 38.3% happened despite a D\u00e9cor down draft in the numbers, and it's the highest gross margin delivery we've had in 6 quarters, which is also encouraging. So we've got a lot of things we want to do going forward in the growth game plan. Some of it will be enabled by ripping the structural cost out. Other things will be enabled by continuing to work gross margin up. And so I felt terrific about this outcome, particularly in the context of the D\u00e9cor down draft and also in the context of a negative mix effect associated with the Baby gross margins. So while Baby gross margins improved period-over-period, it mixes it down. So we're going to work hard on this one because it gives us the kind of flexibility, both from a growth perspective and also from an earnings perspective. And so if we can handle it and hold it, we will. Obviously, it's going to get tight. Like I said, as things get competitive in Q3 in our Writing businesses, and we're going to -- probably #1 is to maintain competitiveness. So we'll manage through all of those things, but one of the calls to action within the business is to really look at this number and ask ourselves whether we can continue to build on it.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And it sounds like the European SAP implementation is proceeding well. Do you guys have comfort that execution risk or any potential hiccups is kind of behind you there? Or where do you stand from an execution risk standpoint in implementing that?","Michael B. Polk","Yes, I think it's premature for us to kind of put the mission accomplished banner across the aircraft carrier bow. That said, things are going exactly the way we anticipate that they would go. And I'm very proud of the team and pleased with the energy, the work effort has been really commendable. But there's going to be issues that we're going to have to confront. We need to work through that. This tricky stuff as you try to do SAP across 20 countries and across all the businesses we've got. That said, we've put the right resources against it. But like any SAP start up, there's always issues that need to be resolved, and we're right in the middle of that. So there's nothing that alarms me, but it's premature to declare success.","Juan R. Figuereo","Yes, we're still in the hyper care phase of the implementation. Our team basically categorized it as crawl, walk and run. So the crawl is behind us. We're still in the walk phase before we run.","Michael B. Polk","And there's some businesses that are running already, and there's some that are just getting out of crawl into talk. And that's how it'll play out for us between now and probably middle of June. Certainly, by the end of the quarter, hopefully, we'd put a punctuation point on the conversion and move on to the next opportunities.","Operator","And your final question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just in thinking about your presentation at CAGNY on your strategy. You had put some of the businesses into buckets to, at least temporarily, I guess, in the near term, kind of curtail international expansion. Can you enlarge upon your thoughts there? Is that just sort of because right now you don't feel that's the best return on investment? Or are those businesses that really long term are not really going have much of a global opportunity? Can you just kind of talk about that? And going along with that, kind of your thoughts on acquisitions and divestitures? I know you've got a lot of other important strategic things going on and it might not be top of mind, but have you done like a portfolio analysis of things that you really think could be divested or are you just completely putting off that thought process? And is there any chance at all of acquisitions right now if the right thing came along?","Michael B. Polk","Good question. So Linda, the answer is that there's tremendous opportunity in the win bigger categories and that's going to require investment. And what I want to make sure is that we're single-minded about those choices. And it doesn't mean that those other businesses don't have attractive growth opportunities in the markets where they are. They do. And we're continuing to invest for that. But I don't want resources spent on things that we're not likely to operationalize over the next couple of years when we have investment opportunities in the win bigger categories. And so for the foreseeable future, at least for the next several years, those businesses need to look to build their share positions and develop the markets in the markets where they are, and we will resource them to do that. Like I said, every business must grow. We're just going to grow them differently and at different rates. It doesn't mean they don't have potential in the next chapter to be part of our strategy for emerging market expansion. We've got some beautiful brands there. So they all have the potential to play. We've picked the businesses that have the highest potential to piggyback on some macro trends and have brands and products with differentiated product propositions and commercial systems. We picked the pieces of the business that offer the most upside, and we'll talk more about this at the Analyst Day in May and give you the background for some of those choices, in a way that you can probably dive deeper on than you were able to at CAGNY or certainly in this call. With respect to M&A, like I said, we've got about $100 million to $200 million worth of business that somebody else probably could create more value with than we can. And if the right suitor came along for those businesses, we certainly would listen. And if we get the right price, we certainly would listen. Even if it does cause us some challenges with respect to retained cost, you just have to make those strategic choices when they present themselves. And so we definitely would do that for those businesses. On acquisitions, I continue to think that our #1 job is to get this business back into a cadence of delivery and then pivot the organization towards the strategic roadmap we've articulated in the growth game plan, with a focus on organic growth, not on external development. We need to build that story out before we complement it with M&A, and we have -- and so we've made that clear within the business, and that's certainly clear with respect to how we're allocating capital. Now that said, we can't control when those opportunities present themselves. And if the right strategic thing presented itself, we'd have to take a look, or if the right bolt-on presented itself, we'd have to take a look. But job #1 is to get the business systems in place in those markets and to shift our activity systems to delivering the growth ambition we've laid out organically.","Well, thank you, everyone for participating in the call today. As we said, we're pleased with our start for the year. We're getting back into the cadence of delivery that is consistent and predictable. And we look forward to seeing many of you in Atlanta, as many of you as can join us on May 24 for our Analyst Day, where we'll spend time explaining exactly how we're driving the new growth game plan into action. Thanks, everyone. Enjoy the weekend.","Operator","Today's call will be available on the Web at newellrubbermaid.com and on digital replay at (855) 859-2056 with an access code of 70623881 starting 2 hours following the end of today's call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellrubbermaid.com on the Investor Relations homepage under Events & Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download. I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell","Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Mike Polk, our President and CEO; and Doug Martin, Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-Q, as well as in the appendix to our press release.","Also during the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP results may be found in the press release and on our website.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike Polk.","Michael B. Polk","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call.","This morning, we reported a strong set of Q4 results that represent our 10th consecutive quarter of consistent delivery. Core sales grew 4.4%, the highest quarterly sales growth in years. Growth acceleration was due to new distribution wins, a substantial increase in advertising support and improving innovation, particularly on Baby, Tools and Commercial Products. The increased investment in advertising was funded primarily by overhead reductions related to Project Renewal, resulting in normalized operating income of 12.2%, equal to the prior year period. Normalized earnings per share was $0.47, up 9.3% versus prior year and $0.01 ahead of consensus. Operating cash flow was $304 million, up 16% versus prior year.","Growth in the fourth quarter was broad based, with all 4 geographic regions delivering increased core sales. The U.S. grew 3.5%, ahead of market growth, suggesting continued market share momentum. Importantly, our strategy of extending our geographic footprint into the faster-growing emerging markets continued to take hold, as Latin America once again delivered strong double-digit growth with core sales up 32%.","4 of our 5 business segments grew core sales in the fourth quarter, with Tools, Commercial Products and Baby delivering very strong growth. Tools core sales increased 8.1%, driven by new distribution and strong innovation in Latin America. We're off to a very good start with our extended Tool portfolio in Brazil, which has gotten excellent distributor response. Commercial Products increased core sales 8.2%, as a result of broadened selling coverage in North America and Latin America and the global launch of our new Executive Series hospitality cleaning lines for luxury hotels. Baby delivered outstanding core sales growth of 15%, driven by stabilization of our business in EMEA and strong share gains and double-digit core sales growth in North America, as a result of new distribution and new premium innovations.","These results are very promising and reflect the power of our brands and our new business model. When we get innovation, marketing and execution right, we can build our categories and build our share.","Importantly, Writing returned to growth, delivering just over 2% core sales growth in the fourth quarter, with good results on Sharpie and Paper Mate, partially offset by the expected contraction in the North American office superstore channel.","Home Solutions core sales declined 1.2%, as distribution gains on Calphalon and Goody were more than offset by a decline in Rubbermaid Consumer sales, driven by timing of Black Friday shipments and increased customer programming costs.","So on balance, a very strong quarter: 4.4% core sales growth; normalized EPS growth of over 9%, $0.01 ahead of consensus; strong operating cash flow of $304 million, up 16% versus last year; and nearly $400 million allocated to dividends and share repurchases. All in are pretty good outcome and one we are very proud to have delivered.","Fourth quarter capped off a very good set of full year results. We delivered sequential improvement in performance in 2012 -- 2013 versus 2012, meeting or beating the midpoint of all 4 full year guidance metrics.","Core sales grew 3.2%, above the midpoint of our 2% to 4% guidance range despite beginning to exit parts of our EMEA business. Normalized operating income margin increased 30 basis points to 13.3%, above the top of our guidance range. We were able to deliver this outcome while investing substantially in advertising and insights in the second half of the year. Normalized EPS increased 9.6% to $1.83, near the top of our initial $1.78 to $1.84 guidance range and above the midpoint of our revised $1.80 to $1.84 guidance range. Normalized EPS of $1.83 represents an all-time record high for Newell Rubbermaid. Operating cash flow was $605 million, above the midpoint of our guidance range of $575 million to $625 million, despite making an incremental $50 million voluntary pension contribution in 2013.","Importantly, our strong cash generative business, coupled with the Hardware and Teach Platform disposal proceeds, enabled us to allocate $644 million to dividends and share repurchases.","2013 has been a year of great progress for Newell. We've established a consistent cadence of delivery, while simultaneously executing a very big change agenda as we drive the Growth Game Plan into action.","In 2013, we deployed a new operating model, which reorganized the company around its 2 core activity systems: brand development and commercial delivery. Within the development pillar, we established a global R&D, design, insights and marketing organization that is focused exclusively on building the strategic growth agenda for each of our brands and categories. Within the delivery pillar, we consolidated 9 global business units and 2 business groups to 5 operating segments, established a global supply chain function and we began to roll out our one-company Customer Development Organization, or CDO, to countries outside the U.S. Our ambition with the CDO is to elevate our work with customers, from transactional negotiations about distribution and merchandising to more strategic joint customer business plans that increase shopper involvement with our categories, while collaboratively improving profitability for both Newell and our customers.","This new operating model has changed the nature of Newell Rubbermaid from a holding company of 9 individual businesses to an operating company, where our 5 business segments leverage a strong set of functional capabilities, organized and led across the company as a whole.","Our new marketing insight and design organizations are now working to drive a more robust innovation pipeline and bigger, more impactful brand growth ideas as a result of significantly increased investments in consumer insights, design, marketing and e-commerce. Our new global supply chain organization is strengthening our productivity funnel, unlocking costs in sourcing and establishing a focused agenda to reduce our working capital, while simultaneously strengthening our capabilities across all 5 supply chain disciplines of plan, source, make, deliver and serve.","Our Customer Development Organization is broadening and deepening customer and channel reach through a one-company approach to customer and channel leadership, using the resulting renewal savings to invest in increased retailer and distributor coverage and new capabilities in category management, shopper insight and shopper marketing. At the same time, as we are changing the way we work as part of the new operating model, we've begun to execute the next phase of the transformation of our EMEA business, simplifying our footprint and reducing complexity in Europe, with a goal of increasing profitability and focusing resources for growth against our most attractive country category sells.","We also successfully disposed about $300 million of revenue related to our former Hardware and Teach Platform businesses and began the process of recovering the retained costs associated with that sale.","Through this intense year of change, people have stayed focused on delivering new growth ideas to market, like Irwin's new expanded line of tools in Brazil; or Hilmor, our new brand of HVAC tools and accessories in the U.S.; or Rubbermaid Commercial Products Executive Series line of cleaning products for luxury hotels around the world; like new Sharpie Neon markers; or year-2 support on Sharpie Metallic markers; or new breakthrough advertising on Paper Mate InkJoy; and new advertising on Irwin as part of the strengthened National Tradesmen Day; like new distribution on Calphalon in multiple retailers and a big new distribution win on Goody; or the tremendous execution around the Furious Five, our first-ever set of corporate-scale merchandising events in the U.S. Like the extensions of Rubbermaid LunchBlox food containers and the new line of beverage containers; or new Graco innovations like FastAction Fold Jogger and Modes 3-in-1 strollers. These have been great wins in the marketplace, delivered in the context of significant change.","So a very good 2013, one that we can all be proud of having delivered.","With that as an opening, let me pass the call over to Doug for some more details on Q4 and the full year. And then I'll return to provide perspective on 2014, after which we'll open the call for questions. Doug?","Douglas L. Martin","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to briefly walk you through our Q4 results, update you on our progress with Project Renewal and then take a minute to talk about cash flow and the balance sheet.","Newell's Q4 reported net sales were $1.49 billion, which represents a 2.9% increase over the prior year. Core sales, which exclude the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, increased 4.4%. Gross margin was 37.4%. Pricing and productivity were offset by inflation and unfavorable mix in the quarter, as a portion of our core sales growth was driven by businesses and regions with lower than fleet average gross margins.","Normalized SG&A expense was $375 million or 25.2% of sales. The composition of our expense continues to change. We increased advertising and promotion expense by more than 20%, including about $10 million for our InkJoy TV ad campaign, which ran in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Australia, with very good POS results. Product development expense, which includes marketing, R&D and consumer insights, was up almost 10%. These significant increases behind brand support were funded through cost savings from Project Renewal and more disciplined overhead spend control.","Normalized operating margin was 12.2%, unchanged from the prior year. Reported operating margin was 10.7% compared with 10.5% in the prior year. Interest expense was $15 million, down nearly 14% versus prior year. And our normalized tax rate was 19.4% compared with 20.5% a year ago. Normalized earnings per share, which excludes restructuring and restructuring-related costs, were $0.47, a 9.3% increase from a year ago. The increase was primarily attributable to the acceleration in core sales growth, complemented by lower interest and tax expense this quarter and a lower share count.","Fourth quarter reported earnings per share were $0.41 compared with $0.35 last year. We generated strong operating cash flow of $304.2 million during the quarter compared with $261.3 million in the prior year. The increase over last year was driven primarily by improvements in net working capital.","We committed to returning $392.8 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $42 million in dividends and $350.8 million for the repurchase of shares mostly under the accelerated share repurchase program announced in October. The EPS impact of the share repurchase in the quarter was about $0.01. Recall that under the $350 million ASP, approximately 80% of the estimated total shares were delivered at the outset, with the remainder to be delivered upon completion of the program in the first half of 2014. Our $300 million open market share repurchase plan was suspended during Q4 and will return to active status this year. We have $43 million available under that authorization, which we intend to use by the middle of the year.","Turning now to our segments.","In our Writing segment, reported net sales grew 0.5% to $433 million. Core sales increased 2.1%. Our Latin America Writing business continued to deliver strong growth, more than 25% this quarter, fueled by increased pricing and a strong back-to-school performance. North America had good results outside of the office superstore channel with overall sales down slightly and EMEA trends were unchanged, down mid-single digits. Fourth quarter normalized operating margin in the Writing segment was 21.8%, a 340 basis point improvement over year-ago results, driven by pricing, productivity and Project Renewal-related cost savings, offset by increased advertising spend behind the InkJoy advertising campaign.","The Home Solutions segment fourth quarter net sales declined 1.9% to $423.9 million. Core sales were down 1.2%. Calphalon had another strong quarter, driven by distribution gains, as did Goody. Rubbermaid Consumer sales were down modestly, a portion of which was timing related.","As we mentioned last quarter, we shipped some Black Friday merchandise earlier in the season than we did a year ago.","Home Solutions normalized operating margin was 13.7%, an 80 basis point decline versus the prior year, reflecting input cost inflation and increased customer programming costs, partially offset by renewal savings.","The Tools segment delivered a second consecutive strong quarter, with reported net sales growth of 5.3%. Core sales growth was a very robust 8.1%, largely attributable to our success in Brazil with our expanded product offering. Both our innovative double-sided hacksaw launch and the expansion of the tool belt initiative have driven share and distribution gains in Brazil. Normalized operating margin in Tools segment was 8.6%, down versus last year's 11.4%. This represents sequential margin improvement from Q3, as the initial launch costs of our Brazil expansion are behind us. The decline versus a year ago was due to ongoing marketing and promotional expenses to support the growth initiative and increased selling and systems in Latin America and APAC. We expect to realize further operating margin leverage in 2014 as we continue to drive top line growth, the investment picking behind our Irwin brand.","Reported net sales in the Commercial Product segment gained 7.6% and core sales increased 8.2%. I guess, an easier comparison from a year ago, we generated strong volume growth in both North America and Latin America this quarter, driven by a favorable programming, pricing and new innovation like the Executive Series and HYGEN Disposable Microfiber. Operating margin for this segment was 7.6%, down versus last year's 11.7%, due to higher input cost inflation and advertising and promotional expense, partially offset by pricing.","Our Baby segment had another stellar quarter, its best this year. Reported sales growth was 12.4% and core sales growth was 15%. In North America, we are winning against our competition and growing the category with distribution gains, pricing and innovative new products across virtually all of our Graco platforms. Q3 normalized operating margin was 9.4%, up 250 basis points to last year, largely the benefit of renewal cost savings and increased leverage, partially offset by mix and transactional FX.","Looking at Q4 sales by geography. North America grew 2.8%, primarily as a result of strong performances from Baby and Commercial Products. In EMEA, core sales increased 1.1%, attributable to sales growth from Tools, Commercial Products and stabilization of the Baby business. In Latin America, core sales grew 32%, driven by very strong results from all of our Win Bigger businesses. And in Asia, core sales increased 2.3%, as we saw modest growth in Writing and Tools. Developed world core sales grew approximately 2%, driven primarily by a solid U.S. growth rate of 3.5%. Our emerging markets business grew approximately 17.3%, attributable to very robust growth trends from Writing and Tools in Latin America.","Moving now to cost programs. We continue to make good progress on Project Renewal. And through the end of Q4, we are on plan, having realized approximately $200 million in cumulative savings. These cost savings enabled the branding capability investments this quarter and will enable more investment in 2014. We expect these investments will drive accelerated core sales growth in our priority businesses and markets.","And lastly, I want to take a moment to discuss cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated $605 million in operating cash flow in 2013. We generated another $190 million in proceeds principally from the sale of our Hardware and Teach businesses. We spent $138 million on CapEx, which was down about $40 million year-over-year, partially driven by a smaller SAP investment. We made an incremental $50 million voluntary contribution to our pension plans. And we paid out $174 million in cash dividends and committed $470 million to repurchase shares through the combination of our ongoing open market authorization and the $350 million accelerated buyback plan. That's a total of $644 million committed to shareholders in 2013. At the same time, we reduced our outstanding debt by $82 million and increased cash by $43 million.","As we exit the year, our balance sheet is in a strong position. We have $226 million in cash on hand and close to $1 billion in liquidity. We have no long-term debt maturities until 2015. And our debt-to-equity EBITDA multiple and interest coverage ratios are all very strong.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mike for additional comments.","Michael B. Polk","Thanks, Doug. While pleased with 2013, these are very early days. We've not yet hit our full stride. We are encouraged that our performance has accelerated at roughly the same time our change program has peaked. I would not have predicted the degree to which this acceleration occurred in Q4 '13. And while not ready to declare our ability to consistently deliver core growth at or above 4%, we are all quite intrigued by what our Q4 results might imply about our ability to do so in the future.","As we emerge from this intense period of change, our people can see the promise of the Growth Game Plan starting to come into focus. And the energy this provides has started to build within the organization. In this context, we're well positioned to deliver another year of sequential improvement in performance in 2014. The insights and research investments we've made through to 2013 are beginning to yield results. Our development teams are placing over 50 unique concepts per month into tests, and these concept test results are hitting positive strike rates of 70% to 80%, which are way above our ingoing expectation and external norms. These results confirm the strength of our brands, that our categories are ready for innovation and that strength in innovation will unlock growth acceleration at Newell Rubbermaid.","Our 2014 growth plans pivot on fast-tracking innovation, creating much stronger brand advertising, driving continued distribution expansion and portfolio deployment and investing significantly more in advertising and promotion.","As we compare our 2014 plans to 2013, we begin to see real opportunity from the combined power of development and delivery.","In this context, we have established the following full year guidance for 2014: core sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%, despite the product line and geographic exits planned in EMEA and continued contraction of the office superstore channel in North America; normalized operating income margin expansion of up to 40 basis points, despite a significant increase in brand spending; normalized EPS of $1.94 to $2 or 6% to 9% growth, about 1 percentage point above the long-term guidance for the strategic phase of the Growth Game Plan; and operating cash flow of $600 million to $650 million.","Our geographic priorities remain the same in 2014: share growth in North America, strong share and revenue growth in emerging markets with primary focus on Latin America, growth in line with our markets in EMEA on our continuing businesses.","There are 2 dynamics that could influence our full year results. The first is the speed with which we're able to increase advertising and promotion investment, fueled by Project Renewal savings and gross margin improvement. We are well on our way to deliver the savings promised as part of Project Renewal, and 2014 will yield another big tranche. We have a clear line of sight to savings related to the rollover of 2013 cost initiatives, the EMEA transformation and 2014 plans to streamline our business partnering functions.","We should also take a step forward on gross margin. To do so will require our execution on gross margin initiatives to improve in 2014. We were not satisfied with the 2013 full year outcome. Increasing traction from the global supply chain teams and the business segments on productivity and sourcing savings, increased growth yield on customer programming connected to new joint business plans at our top customers and progress on price realization should result in gross margin increases for the overall company.","Project Renewal savings and gross margin increases will fuel a significant step-up in advertising and promotion investment. When coupled with the strengthening innovation and brand marketing plans, the increased investment in brand support should drive a sequential improvement in growth despite the growth headwinds connected to the product line and geographic exits in EMEA and expected contraction in the North American office superstore channel.","The second dynamic that could impact the results is the macro environment in emerging markets. We continue to believe our momentum in the emerging markets is more dependent on our actions rather than the macros, and our guidance does not contemplate any big disruptions in our emerging markets in 2014. We believe this is the right assumption to make given our limited exposure to the most volatile markets. Our largest exposure is in Venezuela on our Writing business.","I want to take a quick moment to comment on phasing through the year. There are 3 factors that could influence the quarterly flow of our growth in earnings in 2014: First is the impact of the prior year SAP conversion in Brazil, which resulted in just over $5 million of sales being pulled forward from Q2 2013 into Q1 2013, primarily on our Tools business. This SAP-related timing shift will depress total Newell Q1 core sales growth by about 40 basis points. This shift in revenue and gross profit into Q1 from Q2, when coupled with a $0.03 EPS onetime tax benefit in Q1 2013, creates a year-ago EPS headwind of about $0.035 in Q1 2014.","The second factor to impact quarterly phasing will occur between Q3 and Q4 2014 and is also SAP-conversion related. We plan to go live with SAP in Mexico and Venezuela on October 1, 2014. This will result in a larger shift of revenue and earnings from Q4 to Q3 2014 than was experienced in the Brazil launch of SAP.","The third factor that will impact the quarterly flow of results is the pacing of EMEA product line and geographic exits in 2014. As you recall, we said we plan to exit about $25 million of business in EMEA this year. The majority of the year-over-year negative core growth impact will likely occur in the first half of 2014. While these exits will impact our growth rates in 2014, we do not expect a material EPS impact given the very low profitability of these exits and the release of structural costs these exits enable.","While we do not provide quarterly guidance, the net effect of these shifts will put pressure on growth rates in Q1 and Q4, with core growth rates in both quarters likely towards the lower end of our full year guidance range; and growth rates in Q2 and Q3, in the top half of the full year guidance range.","Our quarterly EPS growth rates will generally flow with top line growth, with the toughest quarter for EPS growth in Q1 2014 as a result of the $0.035 headwind related to both the impact of SAP timing and the onetime tax benefit from prior year.","I often talk about the difficulty of driving delivery while simultaneously driving change. In 2013, our people did a terrific job of doing just that. They delivered sequential improvement in performance, and our results were at or above the midpoint of all of our full year guidance ranges. Doing what we said we were going to do in the face of tremendous change makes us all very proud. The Growth Game Plan is a strategic road map designed to unlock the true potential of our business, our leading brands and our people. And this past year demonstrates there's great opportunity for both -- for Newell, both in the short and longer term.","Our growth acceleration will always come from the strength of our brand plans and the quality of our execution. We've achieved strong developed world growth, ahead of many peers. With a U.S. 2-year compound annual growth rate of 3.2%, we're proving we can win share consistently and grow our categories. We've begun to more strategically deploy our portfolio to the faster-growing emerging markets: first south to Latin America; and over time, east to Asia. On the heels of nearly 15% core growth in Latin America in 2012, we accelerated core sales growth to over 25% in 2013.","What's more exciting than any of the numbers is the knowledge of what is still to come. My entire executive leadership team is either new to the company or new in role in the last 18 months, and they're focused on building the long-term full potential of our company. Our people have signed up to the Growth Game Plan and are driving change on the core activity systems of the business, which means we now work on the most important things in more focused ways with materially greater resources on our key priorities. Whether I look at the building innovation pipeline, establishing a global supply chain, deepening customer partnerships or building new businesses like e-commerce, we have many, many activities and projects in place today that simply did not exist a year ago. And importantly, we haven't begun to capture the commercial value of these initiatives.","My confidence in a stronger 2014 and further improvement in 2015 is based on this: Of course, it won't be easy; of course, it will require everything our people have to give; and of course, there are all kinds of challenges that will get in the way. That said, our people have proven they can drive delivery, while simultaneously driving change. I'm proud of what they've achieved in the last 10 quarters and I'm excited by what I see ahead. The Growth Game Plan is our road map. Its promise is increasingly becoming a reality.","And with that, I'd like to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from John Faucher with JP Morgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to talk a little bit about the Baby care business, and obviously phenomenal performance here. And I guess, as we look out at the impact on this -- of this business on the margins, is there something you guys can do within the cost saves program to make this less of a drag? Or is it something that you can do from a regional mix standpoint? Or is this just one of those things whenever you gain kind of share within these categories, it's going to drag the overall gross margin down?","Michael B. Polk","John, great question. This business is a really interesting one and it's different from our others in that the vast majority of the finished goods are sourced. And with that becomes a gross margin penalty you pay, but also comes a benefit in the lack of fixed assets. And so if you look at this business on the 3 dimensions that I like to think about businesses, whether it's growth potential, margin potential or the ability to create value, this is a very interesting business now that we've attacked the structural costs associated with it. We can create a lot of value if we grow this business because of the high -- relatively high return on net assets or return on invested capital we have because we don't have the fixed assets of the working capital. So it's a very interesting business in this sense. Of course, to do that, we have to accept the mix negative that comes with gross margin. Interestingly enough, if you look at the P&L all the way down to operating income margin, which you guys have visibility to now, and you look back a couple of years at the progress we've made, you see tremendous progress in operating income margin. And we're getting close to where we think we can be to not have it be dilutive long term if we grow. Now there are some geographic mix benefits if we have those -- if we can grow Japan, we get a mix benefit. But we have to accept some gross margin dilution when we deliver these kind of growth rates to the total company. Now the key for any one of our businesses is for each one of those segments to deliver gross margin improvement year-over-year. We have to accept the mix negative if one of -- at the corporate level if one of those businesses is going to disproportionately grow. But each business should be able to drive their gross margin up year-on-year every year, and that's the discipline we need to build into our company. John, I would say that it's a work in progress with respect to gross margin delivery. I think we're not yet there in terms of our ability to kind of consistently deliver steady increases, and we're working on it. The supply chain -- the global supply chain will help a lot, better discipline around pricing will help a lot and active mix management will help a lot. But this is an opportunity that's still in front of us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I was really encouraged by the core growth of most of the segments -- core sales growth, but we're really not used to seeing this from Newell, as I know you know. So the question is do you think the company's capabilities are such that you can now grow year-over-year on such strong results? Or do you need a little bit more time? And the strong core sales growth in this year's fourth quarter is next year's tough comp?","Michael B. Polk","I think my comments in the conversation about not yet being ready to deliver consistently around 4% growth are right. I think the way I think about 2014 is we're driving our new operating model to speed, and part of that is about accelerating impact of the 4 winning capabilities that we're investing in, whether it's design, whether it's marketing and insights, whether it's customer development or supply chain. And so as those capabilities strengthen, and they will progressively through the year, and as we get a greater yield on the investment, the output starts to strengthen. Then I think we have -- it's certainly within reach to believe that we can grow on growth. Do I think Q4 will be a difficult quarter next year? Yes. But every quarter is a difficult quarter. So I'm not willing to concede that we can't deliver solid growth in Q4 in our guidance range against a tough comp. We've got plenty of time to kind of figure that out. And while we will be impacting Q4 '14 by the SAP pull-forward into Q3, if we adjust for that, I think we ought to be able to deliver in the range. And I think it would be premature to kind of aim off. I think the way to think about our business in general is that we're making sequential improvements, and that we should see increasingly -- you should see increasing visibility to the impact of the capability investments we're making. And to the degree that we're able to continue to attack the structural costs and get those costs out and manage gross margins for increases, you see a convergence between better ideas and capabilities and their impact on the business with better affordability in the P&L to invest behind our brands. And that's the thing that will drive the acceleration phase of the Growth Game Plan. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. Because as you recall, we just put this organization in place this year, and we're -- it's a new way of working, and we're bringing that new operating model to speed. But you can sense the opportunity in the framework that I just laid out. And it will all come down to execution and great leadership and our people understanding the opportunity for the upside.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","That's helpful. Can I ask a question on Latin America?","Michael B. Polk","Sure.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The 32% increase, how much of that was attributable to Venezuela where you have pricing power? I know it's a small business, but that is a factor. And if the currency devalues, what do you think the impact on you is at 50%?","Michael B. Polk","I'll handle one part of that, Connie, and then I'll pass it to Doug. So pricing, certainly, was a factor on our Writing business. We -- I don't -- I'm reluctant to kind of call out a specific number, but it's a material number for both Writing and for the overall company. Although the big driver of growth in Latin America this year was our Tools business and Commercial Products business. As you recall, we strengthened the selling system on Commercial Products. And then Tools, we've made big innovation and selling investments in Brazil, and we're extending those investments to other markets. So pricing, for sure, was a factor, but -- and a meaningful one. So I don't want to discount the observation, but there are other things that play as well.","Douglas L. Martin","Connie, on Venezuela, we've got about $87 million of cash on the balance sheet in Venezuela at the end of the year. So a 10% movement there is about $9 million, either up or down. And we haven't, at this point, built anything into our plan from a devaluation perspective. We've been listening to the President's speeches and trying to get as much clarity as we can around what the next steps may be, but we're holding course right now there. So I would look for a 10% devaluation would move revenue by somewhere in the neighborhood of $8 million and income somewhere in the neighborhood of $4 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I guess, the first question, I want to start off with the OfficeMax-Office Depot merger. You guys alluded to it a couple times this morning, but didn't give any specifics. So I assume you're still comfortable with the impact you laid out a couple of quarters ago, which is about a 30 to 50 basis point drag on the top line -- I'm sorry, on EPS, about $0.02 to $0.04?","Michael B. Polk","Yes, and that's built into our guidance, Joe.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then in terms of Project Renewal, is the incremental savings there peaking in '14? Or did you see the peak in '13?","Douglas L. Martin","No, Joe. I would say that '13 and '14 overall are -- '13 was a little bit heavier than '14 will be. So we'll begin a bit of a decline and then finish it out in 2015.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. One last one in terms of mix. Do you expect mix to be positive for gross margin in 2014 or less of a drag in '13?","Michael B. Polk","It depends on how our Baby business plays out. We've assumed a little bit of a positive mix in our gross margin. But because we see a stronger Writing business in 2014 than we had in 2013, which will mix us up. But if Baby delivers another year like this year, which we have not planned, we believe Baby is probably sort of mid-single digits because it will be difficult to replicate double-digit growth on the full year. But if it does, if it surprises us on the upside, we'll have that continuing pressure on mix. But we have not built that into our plan. Because Writing strengthens in '14 versus '13, we see a slight mix benefit in gross margin.","Operator","Next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First one, one quick question on Asia and then my real question. On Asia, you mentioned that you're up on some growth in Writing now. Have you turned the quarter in terms of Asia Fine Writing? Or is this just a lapping of the previous losses? And then on my second question, I wanted to ask a little bit about the thoughts on the macro environment. And given what looks to be a little bit of a tougher backdrop, can you talk a little bit about your innovation plans for 2014, as well as your spending flexibility? Because it sounds like you're pretty excited about your innovation pipeline for next year, and I assume it wasn't an accident that you didn't name any specific new products. But how do the price points and margins on the new products range relative to your existing product portfolio? And then on top of that, can you talk about the flexibility to turn on and off spending should conditions worsen and you actually need some of that flex?","Michael B. Polk","So our Writing -- our business in general responded pretty well in Asia in the fourth quarter. It's actually driven more by back-to-school programming in Australia, New Zealand than by a recovery of our Writing business in China. Quite frankly, I think the luxury goods market is going to be -- continue to be sluggish there. And while our basic issues on route to market are behind us, the overall market conditions aren't great at the moment. And by the way, we're leaning into investments there. Our focus on investments today are in Latin America. In the future, we'll lean into Asia. So just to be clear on Asia Pacific. Good job by our team in Australia and New Zealand around back-to-school. Remember, it's kind of seasonal there. Back-to-school is in December in Australia and New Zealand. On our Writing business in general, I'm -- I think we've got a stronger set of plans in 2014, both from an innovation and brand support perspective. We've got innovation and brand support planned on Paper Mate, Sharpie, Expo, Waterman, Parker and rOtring. So we've got a full lineup. And even Mr. Sketch, our sort of long-neglected scented jewel of a kids brand has growth plans in place. So we expect our Writing business to deliver better growth in '14 than in '13. But our growth is going to continue to be tempered by this contraction in the office superstore channel in North America. Remember, we're exiting our Fine Writing marketing and gifting business in Europe. And the slower recovery in our luxury goods -- in the luxury goods market in China will temper the upside on Fine Writing in China, despite the fact that we have a stronger innovation pipeline. Olivia, I'm going to hold off on giving you specifics on innovation. We're going to talk about some of this and bring -- shine a bright light on it when I'm with you all at CAGNY. But it\u2019s a -- I would characterize our innovation funnel as a stronger funnel. I wouldn't characterize it as a funnel that's up to its full potential yet. I think it takes us through '14 to '15 before we see the full value of the investments we're making in new capabilities, in innovation, in design and marketing to hit the marketplace. So 2014 should be a stronger year, a year of sequential improvement with respect to the strategic ideas we're bringing to market, but 2015 and beyond is where you'll really see us hit our stride.","Douglas L. Martin","On your final question, Olivia, on spending flexibility, yes, we do continue to increase spending flexibility across the P&L, which is exactly what Renewal was designed to do. So we have less fixed cost overall and more variable cost across the P&L.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. So just following up on Olivia's questions, just on the consumer, it seems like Newell bucked the trend this quarter relative to most companies out there in terms of top line. So I'm just curious, Mike, if you could talk about the underlying category growth rates? Or are you seeing any tailwinds from any recovery in construction or what have you in just the general economies around the world? And then how much is really driven by just innovation and distribution gains? So if you could just help us tease out the 2, that would be really helpful.","Michael B. Polk","Yes, Nik, I really believe that our ideas will always trump the macros. So I do think that it's -- whether it's in the brand work or in the innovation work or the work we're doing -- Bill Burke leads with his delivery organization to strengthen execution. Those things are going to create more traction and more upside for us than sort of either macro tailwinds or headwinds. Now that said, I do think that our Tools business and our Commercial Products business are benefiting a bit from the North American recovery. Some of the things you see out of the home retailers, I think, certainly are benefiting us. We've seen stabilization in our D\u00e9cor business. I think that could be connected, although we can't draw a direct link to the housing market. And so I think that our attitude about the markets is -- our concern about markets are moderating. Our assumptions on market growth rates are basically the same as they were this year. And where is the opportunity and the risk? The risk is in emerging markets. But again, there, I'm quite clear that it's what we do as opposed to what the macros do that will define our trajectory. In North America, we haven't planned for any more of a recovery than what we've seen in the second half of the year. So if there is an upside to the economy, that could help. And in Europe, we've assumed a more-of-the-same outlook. Despite all the headlines I read, I just don't see that playing through in our businesses right now. And we're not investing to create a catalyst yet, to cause that to occur. So our outlook for market growth is more of the same. It's not market acceleration. And while there's a lot of news around emerging markets these days, it's actually much more about what initiative we take as opposed to what the market growth rates look like. Witness our results in Brazil over the last 2 years, despite a really choppy economic environment. And so, I guess that's how I'd answer that question. We don't really typically provide market growth data, Nik, because unlike fast-moving consumer goods, where syndicated data is clean and clear, in consumer durables it's a little bit tougher to get a read on that. You have to piece it together. And I'm not sure it's as useful as our growth rates in terms of getting a sense for how things are going. I look at GDP growth. We're growing ahead of GDP in the fourth quarter, which is great. Same thing in the second -- in the third quarter in the U.S. and I think those are positive indicators.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And just, Mike, following up on your comment about Europe. I'm suspecting that the Fine Writing business in Europe continues to be under pressure. I just want to confirm that.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. I think that more of the same is the right outlook for it, but we're doing a lot of work on our brands now on Parker and on Waterman and on rOtring. And while 2014 may not be the year where we turn the corner in Europe on Fine Writing, the kind of ideas that I see coming that are in early development are really exciting and promising. And so I take a very long view on all these businesses. I can get into the quarterly and monthly and daily numbers like anybody else. But when it comes to our brands, I've got to take sort of a longer view. And I like what I'm seeing on Fine Writing. And that has to transpose into growth in Europe at some point in the future, probably not until '15.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just want to delve a little bit deeper into Project Renewal. And obviously, when you set this out years ago, it provided you the flexibility to make the right investments, especially as you expand into some of the new emerging markets. Can you talk about where you've actually seen the cost of doing business maybe a little bit greater than you've anticipated? And then on the same point, with some of the A&P spending as you're starting to hit your stride, where do you feel that you're getting the right returns on some of that spending now? Because I guess the question is, is that the next couple of years we'll still see a little bit of margin expansion come through, but I'm just wondering at what point do you start to see that you've got the right level of investments or spending in these markets that a lot of the additional cost savings that should come through from Project Renewal, especially probably as it gets its next legs of growth, will kind of flow through to the bottom line? So I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of context on what's kind of changed over the last 2 years?","Michael B. Polk","Look, we -- I think we've shown over the last couple of years that we've struck a balance between investing for accelerated performance on the top line and delivering steady margin improvement -- operating income margin improvement. And you should hold us accountable for continuing to do both. That's why we've guided the way we have. And in fact, we've taken the operating income margin, the top end of the operating income margin guidance range up, from 20 basis points in '13 to 40 basis points in '14. So we want to have that discipline, that governor on the choices we're making because we want to build a sustainable and profitable -- increasingly profitable business. So you should expect us and hold us accountable for that. There are things that have surprised us on the upside over the last 2.5 years. Baby would be a great example of it, where we've both been able to get cost out in a profound way -- look at the operating income margin progression on that business -- while significantly accelerating the growth rate and scaling the business. So creating a ton of value on that business over 2.5 years. That's been a pleasant and positive surprise. There have been challenges in other businesses. We've got a tough business in Rubbermaid Consumer, where there's very limited market growth. And quite frankly, we haven't brought the right kind of innovation to market to value up that category. And as a result, there's always competitive intensity there. The cost of growth in Rubbermaid Consumer is high. And we referenced that when we talked about customer programming costs. So we've got to pull different levers in that business for the kind of outcomes we seek, which is strategic growth, sustainable growth, differentiated product propositions, better innovation. Things that will allow us to create more value and strengthen the Rubbermaid brand. That's going to be -- that is a lot of work. And it's a challenge. And it's going to take time for us to -- probably a little bit more time than we originally thought to really crack the code there. We love Rubbermaid. We love that brand. It's powerful. Its positioning is very strong. When life's in order, you're free to live it. It's a promise of organization and helping you deal with the more mundane things in life, so you're free to do the more important things. And so that's a very powerful brand and we can unlock that. But it's going to require real innovation that's differentiated. We're working on that. But that's a longer -- that's going to take a little bit longer, I think, than we anticipated and may cost us a little bit more than we originally contemplated in human capital and in research investment. So I think there's movements in both directions. I think the -- both positive surprises and then some more challenging situations. We have to be very disciplined in how we extend our footprint into the emerging markets because there's a cost of growth that hits you in structural cost, selling expense, research expense. And you have to make those investments in order to build a sustainable extended footprint. That's not a surprise. But we need to retain the discipline associated with doing that and not opening up too many fronts at once. Because otherwise, we would compromise our commitment on margin expansion as we grow. And so that's a discipline that needs to stay in place, has been in place, needs to stay in place, so that we're not intoxicated by the upside in growth, but at a cost to margin. So Jason, I don't know if that really answers your question. I'm sort of avoiding giving you too many specifics, but kind of giving you 3 different examples of things that require us to be thoughtful as we think about resource deployment.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","No, no, it definitely gives good context. And I guess just a follow-up. As you think about your cash flow, and I think 2015 when you start to feel a lot of that cash flow build, and I know there is like, I think, $1.5 billion of unallocated cash flow that you guys have talked about in the past. So as you talk about some of the -- having the discipline, I guess the question is, will -- should we expect to see you make more investments into the emerging markets with some of that unallocated cash flow? Or should we look at the things like -- that you have been kind of doing along the way, which is the buyback and the dividends and maybe even thinking about acquisitions? So just wondering about the operating versus kind of, what I would call, the nonoperating side of things and the use of the cash flow as you kind of move forward over the next couple of years?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. The chart you're referring to is the chart we presented at CAGNY 2012. And we'll update that in a couple of weeks when we're together to give you kind of a forward-looking view through -- what did we say Doug, through 2018? And obviously, a big chunk of our use of cash over the last few years has been restructuring-related. And that starts to come down over this timeframe. I think that chart also was a little bit too loose on the amount of CapEx that we were planning on spending. I think that chart had us -- that model had us spending about $200 million a year. We don't think we're going to need to do that. But we're working on the next version of that, that gives you another 5-year view forward. And it's very exciting. So this is a -- and it doesn't presume major progress on working capital in what we'll present. So it gives us lots of options. So your question on capital allocation, we're going to have lots of optionality around that. And of course, once we get through this change program, we're going to want to think about growth, not just organically, but also about complementing that organic agenda with an external development agenda kind of focused in the 5 businesses we have.","Douglas L. Martin","In terms, Jason, of whether we would begin or increase investing over plans in markets in some of our emerging markets, I think you need to link the accumulation of cash on the balance sheet or generation of cash over time with the strategic growth objectives that we set out on the bottom line. So the P&L will continue to govern what we invest, so that we continue to increase and deliver operating income to the shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple of things, so 2 kind of housekeeping things. One was, were there any exits in EMEA in the quarter that depressed core sales or not? And then the second was just expectations for the tax rate in 2014.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So Lauren, on EMEA, we made -- we started to exit businesses in Q3. So obviously, there's a flow-forward effect of those choices. And we will continue to exit businesses in Q1 and Q2. So there'll be incremental choices that will begin to be affected. But yes, there was an impact in Q4. We haven't called it out specifically as to what it is. I think we have to figure out how to deal with our choices to exit businesses in the context of our core sales commitments. So it's not really that. I gave you a headline number of $25 million. We got to figure out how to cover that in our numbers. That's our philosophy about it. And so we haven't -- we're not going to call them out by quarter. But yes, there was the rollover effect of Q3 exits into Q4. And there'll be new exits in Q1 and new exits in Q2 that will roll forward through '14.","Douglas L. Martin","The tax rate, Lauren, was -- you should model between 24% and 25%.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just curious about the mention of the customer -- I guess, 2 things. One was the kind of increase in customer programming costs in the fourth quarter for Home Solutions. Is that something that persists? Was it a seasonal issue? Was it a specific retailer? That was one. And the second thing was just, any impact from the further J.C. Penney closures? And then that would be the negative or the positive of the home section reset again that they have coming?","Michael B. Polk","On customer programming cost, it's our most competitive. Rubbermaid Consumer is our most competitive category, and particularly in a couple of the product lines. And we have yet to figure out how to crack the code. And it's going to take innovation to break the cycle. So we've got to cover those costs with productivity, with an attempt at mix management through the more profitable product lines within that portfolio. The fact that we shipped volume that was consumed in Q4 in Q3, but we spent money to drive that consumption in Q4, is in part contributing to the comment that we've made. But this is a strategic issue for us. We just have not invested enough in differentiating, in particular, the storage portion of our Rubbermaid Consumer brand. We've got great differentiation in food and beverage containers. We've got it in garage organization. We've got it in a lot of places, but not in that big center of that brand. And we've got to work on that. And until we solve that and figure out how to get more of a growth yield for the investments we're making through our customers, we're going to always be tight on that particular piece of our business.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So that sounds like, though, the particular call out in the quarter, notwithstanding that it's just a tough spot was -- some of it was related to the timing shift of spending versus shipping?","Michael B. Polk","The volume was in Q3. The spending was in Q4. You get a penalty.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, perfect. It wasn't a change in what customers were asking for or something like that in a particular quarter?","Michael B. Polk","There's always -- on that business, it's always a battle. Did you win the merchandising or did you lose the merchandising to your key competitor? But not -- that wasn't the big issue. The big issue was the linkage of the revenue stream and then the overlay of cost in the drive period.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just the J.C. Penney question.","Michael B. Polk","On J.C. Penney, actually, last year was a good year for us at J.C. Penney. I mean, Calphalon responded. D\u00e9cor stabilized. Calphalon had a phenomenal year at J.C. Penney. So I think they've got different issues that they're wrestling with. The home reset was a positive for us. So we had a good year at J.C. Penney from a growth perspective. And they're wrestling with all their other issues. But in the context of that, they've been good partners on the merchandising side in the...","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So not a worry from the -- is it material or not, I guess, if they're closing doors in 2014 and resetting home again?","Michael B. Polk","It took such a step back in 2011 and early 2012, that it -- that we'll be able to work through that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of housekeeping items. What do you think the share count is going to be for the full year next year? And does it vary quarter-by-quarter?","Douglas L. Martin","It should be about 285 million, Bill, and it will be relatively stable throughout the year. As you know, on the ASP that we launched in the fourth quarter, we got about 80% of those shares in at that time. So that -- about 2\/3 of that is reflected in the share count at year end. We'll get the remaining shares in through the first half of the year and we'll settle those out with the -- we'll settle those out at a weighted average cost of buying those. So we don't know exactly how many shares we're going to get in. But once that settles in, we'll be pretty flat.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And then just in terms of operating cash flow. Based on your guidance and what you did in the last couple of years, it seems like it's been flat. And I know there are some pension contributions. And obviously, there's an overhang from the cash restructuring that's already been accrued that comes out later. But is it conservative for next year? I don't know if you need another pension step up or what?","Douglas L. Martin","We don't have another pension contribution in there, but we do have $50 million to $60 million of cash taxes that are likely to fall into next year, which is why you don't see a more significant step up.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So they pulled forward from '13 and then move into '14?","Douglas L. Martin","It's not pull forward. It's just timing of when payments are made.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then just as you look at the P&L, I mean, shouldn't you have that sort of big onetime step up in SAP benefits coming in 2014? That was always the promise, but we kind of never talk about it anymore. So then in addition to that, the year-over-year pension costs, the P&L-realized pension costs, shouldn't those also come down in 2014?","Douglas L. Martin","On the first one, we should be peaking on the amortization line in '14 on SAP. Remember, we continued -- we did EMEA and then we continued on to Brazil, and we'll finish out Latin America. And the cost of each of those implementations goes down. So you will see a benefit over time. It won't be in '14 though. And then -- I'm sorry, Bill, what was the second one?","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The second one was just the...","Douglas L. Martin","Pension cost.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The pension cost on the P&L, the period ended cost?","Douglas L. Martin","We're a little over 90% funded now on our U.S. pension plans. And the mix of our investments at that trigger point is changing to a slightly more conservative allocation across the asset base given where our funding levels are and what our population of retirees look like and when they'll retire. So that we've shifted the mix a little bit there. So I wouldn't expect a big improvement in pension cost this year.","Michael B. Polk","Bill, one build on the SAP comment because Doug's talking about the IT costs associated with SAP and the impact of lessening depreciation and amortization expense over time starting '15 forward. That's all true. And that's good. And that gives us flexibility in our structural cost. The real upside is still in front of us, though, in terms of mining SAP to unlock -- and I think the benefit will come in working capital. But we see good value coming out already in sourcing, in direct sourcing as a result of visibility. But the real value over time will come out in a better appreciation of the cost of complexity in our business model. And we're going to learn very quickly as we continue the analysis that we have a whole bunch of hidden costs. In marrying the supply chain, they're going to get their arms around that. Again, I don't think it's a '14 benefit. I think working capital becomes a big -- we do all the analytics. We roadmap. We game plan in '14 for '15 progress. But yes, I think there is upside in what we've been able to glean out of the investments we've made there. And we're going to go after it.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And then just a strategic question. Can you just tell us a sort of sneak peak of the 10-K and tell us how much Wal-Mart sales were up year-over-year and kind of what drove that? And then if there's been any competitive response because obviously the category growth rates are still pretty dire. So it's almost all market share and distribution gains. So can you just talk about any sort of...","Michael B. Polk","Yes. I mean, I'll give you a headline. I won't give you their growth contribution to our total company, but you'll see that shortly. Our growth at Wal-Mart was ahead of their market growth last year. We just -- we just had a big top-to-top in November there. And so we had a good year with Wal-Mart based on broadened distribution and good shopper marketing implementation, just overall better execution across the footprint. So it was a stronger year in 2013 versus 2012. And you should probably see their contribution to our overall results go up a bit, although we won't see the final, final numbers for a bit.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And then it's kind of zero-sum there. So have you seen any sort of competitive response to some of the distribution gains? Because it's not like they're expanding your categories on the shelf?","Michael B. Polk","So our market -- I think that some of the things we're doing is expanding some of our market growth rate. Certainly, on Baby, that's true. And so we're not just share shifting, I don't think. Our commitment is to collaborate, to expand the relevance of these categories and consumer involvement with them. So things like Sharpie Neon and Sharpie Metallic, which are premium offerings, that drives value into the category. Of course, we get share gains from it, but it drives value into the category. Same thing with what we're doing on Graco in North America. We're not doing it consistently well across everyone of our businesses, but that's the opportunity. Clearly, there are landscape shifts that are happening across the retail world. We've talked a lot about the contraction in the office superstore channel, particularly on the retail side of their business, not the commercial side of their business. And that's market share that's up for grab. And people are grabbing for it as the office superstore guys pull back from that direct-to-consumer selling. So there's clearly shifting going on. And there's shifting going on with respect to e-commerce procurement. So consumers are shopping online more and more every year. And our commitment is to reach them where they shop. Now all of our partners are building out their platforms to capture that and hold that within their box, but there is some dynamics underway there as well.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And then just one last one. Promotional spending efficiency, it hasn't been a priority yet, I guess. And it seems like there's a lot more trade spending right now, almost in response to some of the weakness on the Rubbermaid home side. But when does that start getting looked at and coming through?","Michael B. Polk","Well, I think we're looking at it, big time now. And we've just changed a couple of elements of our go-to-market program as of 1\/1\/14. It simplifies our trade terms. And we're going to continue to work on this as part of our -- what we call Collaborative Growth Plus, which is the program that we will bring to market through the new CDO. And we have got to strengthen the growth yield for the investments we're making there. And we're making up -- we can spend a lot of money between our invoice price and our net price. And we want to work together with our retailers to put -- our retail partners to put that money to work to drive category expansion, and not just have it -- subsidized tactics that don't yield the kind of trial and repeat we're hoping to generate in our businesses. It's going to take time to do that. Part of that is in the design of the program. Part of that is in the behaviors of our selling teams and the kind of joint customer business planning that gets done. We've -- I've been at 2 top-to-tops over the last 2 months at some of our biggest customers. And we got 30 people in the room, and they've got 30 people in the room. And then we break off into breakout rooms where people are getting into that type of conversation. Are we promising a great yield on that in any of the numbers yet? No, but should we -- should you expect us to over time? Yes.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I mean, I don't want to put you on the spot here, but couldn't that be as efficacious as the Project Renewal savings, just given the magnitude of the trade spending that you guys throw out there?","Michael B. Polk","Possibly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, Mike, a couple of things. So you're saying categories now are ready for innovation. You're saying a factor on the top line now is how fast you can get money into advertising. It's a little -- it's a lot different than what you'd said before. And I think it's an evolution, right? And so you clearly -- you seem to believe more that innovation and marketing matter in these categories. And I know you've believed it before too, but seemingly more so. So I guess the question is, if that 4.4% core that you guys did this quarter that intrigued you, right, for the forward look isn't necessarily sustainable right now, why would that be? What would cause it to kind of come back down? Like where are there things that aren't sustainable? And I guess Baby is a start?","Michael B. Polk","Well, I mean, we're going to be growing on growth on a couple of our big categories. So the question, can you sustain the growth rates as you do that? Baby could surprise us again. I don't know. We've got a good plan. We're actually working on '15 innovation on Baby now. So their plan is set. It's set to be executed. The question is, do we get the consumption yield on it? And time will tell. We were able to invest a lot of money in the fourth quarter on the back of some onetime benefits that we saw -- had modest sight to once we got into the quarter and on the basis of some momentum in the top line that we didn't expect to see in October and November. So we fueled sort of a virtuous cycle. If you get that top line going and you're able to do it with decent margins, it fuels investment firepower. And we had that working for us in Q4. What will keep us from sustaining that level of support? There are 3 things really. It's gross margin, ensuring we generate the gross margin improvement. And the -- I think we're quite confident on Renewal savings, but gross margin delivery, the step-up that we would like to see, that's something we got to manage and watch and see how that progresses because that will fuel a significant portion of the investment, whereas that wasn't necessarily the big driver in Q4. So we need that to happen. And then we have to accept the fact that we're making choices for the sake of the overall financial health of the company, to exit some businesses in Europe, which will be a drag on growth. And we have the reality of the office superstore contraction which will -- and specifically, the Depot-Max consolidation, which has really not yet begun in earnest. I think that's still in front of us. So those are the things that we steer into that give us some concern. We will continue to work hard to manage growth and profitability in Home Solutions. So we delivered good growth in Home Solutions on the full year, but I wasn't thrilled with the kind of margin delivery in that business, in particular, within Rubbermaid Consumer. And so we've got to strike the right balance between both growth and profitability there. We've got to find the means to do that, and even if that causes us to back down on growth rates coming into this year. Now that doesn't explain why Q4 comes off, but it is a variable that's going to be out there, and it's going to influence our thinking on choices we make.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just I guess switching gears just real quick to the tax rate. So a couple of things, I guess. Doug, what's going on? It's very low. Obviously, it was low this quarter. What's the right sustainable rate? And that 24%, 25%, 2014, I mean, is that before any potential sort of goodies that you end up running through there, right? So it -- because right now it would be a $0.05 year-on-year drag on '13 to '14. And do you think you will have to offset that $0.05 drag? Or do you think there's sort of a -- by the time you end up reporting the year, the tax rate ends up being actually lower than that range?","Douglas L. Martin","Yes, Chris, I think, we'll clearly have to offset that drag, but more likely in other parts of the business than in the tax line. And it's, as you know, very difficult to predict when resolution of tax issues occur. So to the extent that we have reserves on the balance sheet that are favorably resolved during the year, you're going to see period tax benefits. And to the extent that they're unfavorably resolved, you'll see a period tax hit. So I think 24% to 25% is a good range over time to manage to for the business, given the planning we have in place. In Q4 specifically, Chris, we had -- as we got into the fourth quarter, we've been negotiating with -- to resolve a number of state tax issues throughout the back half of the year. And we got those resolved in Q4. And they were resolved in a way that was more favorable than we had previously expected. So the benefit in Q4 was really the release of some state tax contingencies.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And why is 24%, 25% right for a business that's as domestic as yours is?","Douglas L. Martin","Well, we are -- we have a very -- we're domestic, but we have a lot of international complexity and a very active tax planning function that is there to maximize the tax benefits across the entire globe for us. So things like the EPC, for example, drives benefits for us. And we consciously structured into that when we were thinking about a reorganization in Europe. And as we went live with SAP in Brazil, we consciously organized into a similar structure that will drive tax benefits above and below the line for us. So we think much more broadly than a pure domestic planning company would.","Operator","Next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up on Bill Schmitz's either ninth or 10th question on gross margin. And just trying to understand, you said you were unhappy with the gross margin in the quarter and I understand some of it was mix. But I mean, are you looking at goals internally? Do you see multiple 100 basis points potential? I mean, is there something tangible that we might see this year or it's just we got to do better?","Michael B. Polk","No, we're all over it. And we're going to sharpen the teeth in our comp systems around gross margin for employees. We have a proposal into the board to do that. We have visibility into all the different components of gross margin. So we can look at things very clearly. When I said I was disappointed, I was really commenting on the full year numbers. We did see progress in Q4. We had positive price realization for the first time in a -- first material time. We saw a little bit of it in Q3, but we saw the progression through the year. That's good. Mary and team have to work productivity harder. And we are. That the whole value of setting up the global supply chain is to build the funnel on cost ideas in the same way you build a funnel on growth ideas. And we have visibility into that now in a dashboard that tells us where we are by business. So we're really -- we know that as we come through Project Renewal, the key lubricant for growth is going to be gross margin increases. We'll always manage overhead with a very tight fist, but the real growth driver and the portability driver will come through gross margin increases. So we're all over it. It's not easy to drive price realization in a flat market, which most of our developed world is. So that's a challenge, but we have to do it. We're going to figure out how to do it. And I told you the levers we're looking to -- we're looking to pull, but this is the conversation piece for almost every engagement I have with the segments, this and their growth. So we've got to make progress. We're going to put some comp teeth into it, assuming the board is supportive. And we'll see how that all plays out next year.","Operator","And your next question comes from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Unknown Analyst","This is Bobby filling in for Budd. A quick question for me. I was just wondering if you could give us some additional color on some of the market share gains in Commercial Products in North America, kind of what you're seeing there or what your attributing that to, and kind of how you expect that to continue to play out?","Michael B. Polk","We've had a good run on Commercial Products. We continue to be challenged by the health care portion of that business. And that will be with us until the uncertainty clears on that vertical, but we had good results in Q4. We're benefiting in Q4 from a change in our selling structure in North America as part of the work we did over the summer to strengthen the CDO and realign resources. We collapsed the leadership structure of our Customer Development Organization, but that enabled us to fund increased retail coverage amongst the distributive trade. And that certainly has helped us in Q4 to have traction in this business. So you're seeing core growth occurring on Commercial Products as a result of better frequency of calls on some of the smaller distributors that we call on and some of the hardware chains. And so that's good news and that should sustain forward. And then we have good innovation. And we've got strong innovation coming in 2014. So whether it's the launch of Executive Series into luxury hotels, which is a new cleaning cart system into a cleaning products line into luxury hotels around the world or whether it's some of the other innovations we're bringing forward that leverage our microfiber technology on cloths and mops. There's a lot of interesting things coming to market on that business, which should more than compensate for the challenges we will continue to have, we think, on health care.","Operator","Your last question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Was the HVAC trade show recently held? I think I saw something about it at the Javits Center in New York, and I'm wondering what the outlook coming out from that or for Hilmor is?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So we were there, the whole contingent. I wasn't because I was in another meeting. But Mark and Bill and the Tools team were in the Javits Center for that event. Look, we've got a great -- we're pleased with where we are, but we have more opportunity on Hilmor. And we're confident that we're going to continue to build this business in the U.S. and that this platform can serve us well around the world as we build out our emerging markets footprint. We've got a superior range of tools and products. We're launching a new line as we come into -- a new extension line as we come into 2014. So that was a good forum for us. As you know, the HVAC season sort of kicks in over the next couple of months. That's when the selling volume really sort of starts to kick in. And so we'll see how that all plays out, but the team was really energized by what they saw. And we're committed to continuing to build that business.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Because I think last year on the timing of the launch, you captured only a small potential of what could have been the year's sales of Hilmor. Do you think this year, you'll capture much more of it?","Michael B. Polk","We think we have upside this year versus last year, in large part because of timing. You're right, Connie, we sort of missed. We were -- I won't describe it as missed. We pushed ourselves to get to market as quickly as we could in the first quarter. But as you recall, we weren't out selling until sort of late January or early February. And so we missed the big trade shows, which were earlier in the season. So we didn't get the yield we would have gotten had we been out there earlier, but there was just absolutely no way to fast track that initiative any more than we did. And so we have more opportunity than we captured in 2013 to be had in 2014. And the teams are working to get it done.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then just one final, I promise. On Venezuela and all the weird stuff that you're absorbing with Project Renewal savings, you're being able to absorb the consolidation of the office superstores. Do you think in the devaluation in Venezuela, those savings will offset that? Or does such an event represent a little bit of downside to earnings?","Douglas L. Martin","I think it may be somewhere in between, Connie. I think we'll manage the earnings piece, first of all. But we have -- during our experience in the last couple of years as we've seen the currency devaluations occur is that we have been successful in at least partially offsetting some of that loss with pricing. So that we've been able to use -- come back that way. And then if we need to use some other spending cuts to manage the rest, we will.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer period. If we were unable to get to your questions, please call the Investor Relations team at (770) 418-7075. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Polk for any concluding remarks.","Michael B. Polk","Well, all I would say is, thank you very much, and thank you for your patience in sticking with us through the end of the call. And again, thank you for your support and your counsel and advice. And we look to continue to deliver in the consistent rhythm we've been delivering.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellrubbermaid.com on the Investor Relations homepage, under Events and Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download. I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell","Thanks, Mackenzie. Good morning. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. With me this morning are Newell Rubbermaid's President and CEO, Mike Polk; and Doug Martin, our Executive VP and CFO.","Let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of performance. Risk factors that may impact these statements are discussed in the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K and in today's earnings release.","Our press release and this call also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, normalized operating margin and normalized earnings per share. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release and is available on the Investor Relations section at newellrubbermaid.com. Thanks, and now I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We have 3 objectives this morning. First, we'll review our third quarter results and provide our outlook for the remainder of the year. Second, we'll discuss the announced expansion of Project Renewal and the 5 new work streams that will accelerate our transformation. And third, we'll discuss the significant change in our organization design in my leadership team that will enable us to unlock the upside of the Growth Game Plan.","This new organization design aligns our resources to our 2 key activity systems, the work we do to develop our brands and categories, and the work we do to ensure best-in-class execution and delivery.","The new organization and leadership we've announced is designed to strengthen our business on both dimensions and lead to accelerated performance.","Our track record of solid results and our demonstrated ability to drive delivery, while simultaneously driving change, gives us the confidence to now accelerate the pace of change to more quickly realize our ambition of becoming a bigger, faster-growing, more global, more profitable Newell Rubbermaid.","A sign of our strength in performance and growing confidence is this morning's announcement of a 50% increase in our dividend, a step change that takes us to the high end of our stated dividend payout ratio target range of 30% to 35%. This is the second dividend increase we've announced this year and the third in the last 2 years, which reflects the board's confidence in the company's strong cash generation ability and in the potential of our Growth Game Plan.","Our new annualized dividend of $0.60 per share is up from $0.20 a share at the beginning of 2011, and now reflects a dividend yield of nearly 3% at yesterday's share price.","There's a lot to talk about, so let's get into the results. We've reported a solid set of third quarter numbers that represent a positive step towards delivery of our full year results in line with our guidance. Net sales were $1.54 billion, in line with consensus. Core sales grew 1.5%. Normalized earnings per share were $0.47, $0.03 higher than consensus and 4.4% better than our year-ago results. And gross margin improved by 50 basis points to 37.9%. Normalized operating income margin was flat to prior year at 13.7%, with the increasing gross margin offset by an absence of compensated-related benefits in the year-ago numbers. Operating cash flow was strong, at just over $300 million.","Looking at our results through the first 9 months, core sales have grown 2.2%. Normalized operating income margins up 20 basis points to 12.9%. Normalized EPS is $1.27, up 6.7% versus prior year, and operating cash flow is over $357 million, up over 27% versus prior year.","Let's take a look now at segment results. Our core sales growth in the Consumer group declined 40 basis points. This is actually a sequential improvement versus the first half run rate. Year-to-date, the Consumer group's core sales have declined 1.2%. Our strong Writing & Creative Expressions results continued in Q3, but were offset by macro-driven headwinds in our Fine Writing business in Europe and our ongoing challenges at J.C. Penney and D\u00e9cor in North America. I want to recognize the Writing & Creative Expressions team for a successful Back-to-School season. They checked all 3 boxes, selling in Q2, followed by sell-through and replenishment in Q3.","This year, we exceeded last year's replenishment orders, which along with great sell-through results, contributed to a strong Writing outcome in the third quarter of 2012.","Total Writing category POS was up nearly 5% in the Back-to-School window, with Newell brands driving over 60% of the category growth.","Our Professional segment delivered core sales growth of 2.5% in the third quarter despite having lapped a very strong prior year quarter in which we reported core growth of 7.5%.","Year-to-date, Professional core sales have increased 4.3%. Professional growth is especially strong in North America, with share gains in most of our categories. North America Professional core sales grew over 4% in the quarter and are up over 5% year-to-date.","We are seeing softness in Western Europe and Australia, New Zealand on Irwin and Dymo as general macroeconomic concerns resulted in more difficult sell-in and sell-through. This offset some of the North American momentum.","Baby & Parenting had another strong quarter. Q3 core sales growth was 7.8%. Year-to-date, Baby core sales growth is over 10%. Baby's performed well all year due to very strong core sales in Asia as a result of the terrific new item performance on Aprica in Japan, and strengthening results in North America, fueled by better collaboration with customers and stronger Graco innovation.","Year-to-date for the total company, we continue to deliver strong emerging market core sales growth of about 12%. Core growth in Asia Pacific is over 13%, and we have over 12% core growth in Latin America.","The developed world has grown about 1%, with competitive levels of U.S. growth of 2.3%, partially offset by weak performance in EMEA, where core growth has declined nearly 5%.","Given the challenges in D\u00e9cor, the U.S. growth is quite strong, with the combined Baby & Professional businesses delivering year-to-date U.S. growth of over 6%.","Let me now make a few comments on the balance of the year. As a reminder, we've guided full year core sales to increase between 2% to 3%. Normalized operating margin to increase up to 20 basis point, normalized EPS to increase 3% to 6%, or in the $1.63 to $1.69 range, and operating cash flow of between $550 million and $600 million.","As you know from our press release, we have reaffirmed our full year guidance across all 4 guidance metrics. Given the strong earnings performance in the third quarter, we now have a pretty good line of sight to the top of our normalized EPS guidance range. The key factors that will influence the outcome on normalized EPS and normalized operating margin will be the degree to which we accelerate brand-building investment in the fourth quarter.","As we've discussed, we knew it would be a tough third quarter to deliver EPS growth because we were comping against unique compensation-related benefits in the year-ago numbers. In that context, we throttled back a bit on brand-building investment versus prior year. As we progress through the fourth quarter, we will start to invest more in an effort to strengthen our core growth momentum as we exit the year.","Beyond brand-building investment levels, there are 2 factors that could influence core sales growth in the balance of the year. The first factor is the continued momentum of our growth businesses in quarter 4 as they lap step-ups in year-ago performance. We've assumed Baby & Parenting and Writing & Creative Expression are able to grow on top of prior year growth. Combined, these businesses grew core sales roughly 5% in quarter 4 2011.","The second factor is the impact of macroeconomic fiscal policy and political uncertainty in the U.S. and Western Europe as we exit 2012. We are less concerned about near-term consumer response to the uncertainty, believing we captured that appropriately in our guidance. However, we are less able to predict changes in retail behavior, given the macro uncertainties and the potential for retailers to draw down inventories more than they typically would do to manage their key year-end metrics.","At this point, Doug will provide more detail on our financial results, and importantly, take you through our announced expansion of Project Renewal. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of everyone here at Newell, we've made significant progress over the past 9 months since we unveiled the Growth Game Plan. This progress gives us the confidence to press with more urgency towards the Growth Game Plan's acceleration stage. The expansion of Project Renewal is critical to unlocking our full growth potential. Based on our progress to date, I'm confident we can go further and faster than we originally intended. Over to you, Doug, and then I'll return to discuss our new organization design and leadership appointments.","Douglas L. Martin","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll spend the next few minutes covering our third quarter results and our outlook for the year. After that, I'll walk you through some of the details on the expansion of Project Renewal. I'm going to start with Q3. Total company recorded net sales for the quarter were $1.54 billion, a 0.9% decrease versus the prior year, with core sales increasing 1.5%, excluding 240 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency.","Reported net sales in our Consumer segment decreased 2.1%. Core sales, which exclude 170 basis points of negative currency, fell 0.4%, representing a sequential improvement from our first half results. Normalized operating margin for this segment increased 180 basis points to 17.3%, with price and productivity driving improved gross margins and the deferral of certain brand-building investments from Q3 into Q4 contributing to lower SG&A.","In our Professional segment, Q3 reported net sales declined 1.1%, with core sales, which exclude 360 basis points of unfavorable currency, increasing by 2.5%. Operating margin declined 240 basis points to 13.2%. This reflects our investment in marketing activity around our Irwin National Tradesmen Day, as well as strategic sales force and feet on the street initiatives intended to drive future growth.","In our Baby segment, Q3 reported net sales rose 5.2%, with core sales, which exclude 260 basis points of negative currency, increasing by 7.8%. Q3 normalized operating margin was essentially flat to last year at 9.9%.","Looking at our Q3 sales by geography. North America core sales grew 1.1%, led by the Baby & Parenting and Professional segments, which were collectively up 4.7%. In EMEA, core sales declined 2.8%, slightly better than the SAP adjusted run rate for the past several quarters, but still reflecting ongoing macroeconomic weakness in Western Europe. We're getting good growth, however, in emerging markets like Russia and Middle East and Africa. In Latin America, core sales increased 11.3%, driven by continued solid growth in our Tools, Commercial Products and Writing businesses.","In Asia Pacific, core sales grew 6.3%. Australia and New Zealand sales were down in the quarter as the consumers become increasingly more cautious and price-sensitive due to a slowing economy. And though we are continuing to see good growth from Aprica Japan, we are beginning to see some more competitive activity that is the potential for moderating growth going forward.","Our Q3 gross margin was 37.9%, which represents a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year. Productivity and pricing more than offset a 50 basis point negative impact from input cost inflation.","Normalized SG&A expense increased $4.1 million compared to the prior year, and on a percentage of sales basis, increased 50 basis points to 24.2%.  A strong dollar reduced year-over-year expense by $11.5 million, so on a constant currency basis, SG&A was actually up $15.6 million than the prior year.","Higher strategic SG&A spending on sales force expansion and focused growth areas was offset by the year-over-year comparison against last year's Q3, when we recorded a benefit from our incentive compensation true-up. As Mike mentioned, in Q4, we expect to ramp up discretionary spending behind our brands.","Reported Q3 operating margin of 12.3% compares with negative 12.4% in the year-ago period. Last year, we recorded $382.6 million in asset impairment charges that did not repeat this year. On a normalized basis, Q3 operating margin was flat year-over-year at 13.7% of sales.","Q3 reported earnings per share were $0.37 compared with a loss of $0.61 in the prior period. Normalized earnings per share, which exclude restructuring and restructuring-related cost, as well as certain onetime items, was $0.47. That's $0.03 ahead of consensus and 4.4% better than a year ago. About $0.01 of the year-over-year improvement was driven by lower share count with the remainder of the increase being attributed to lower interest and other income.","Interest expense in the quarter was $18 million compared to $21.8 million in the previous year. If you recall, in Q2, we refinanced our outstanding quarterly income preferred securities with lower-cost, medium-term notes. These will generate annualized interest savings of about $0.02 per share going forward.","The Q3 reported tax rate was 35.3% compared with a negative 24.4% in the prior year period. Year-over-year, the change in reported tax rate was primarily driven by the geographic mix of earnings and discrete items recorded in each of the quarters. In the third quarter of 2012, the company's effective tax rate increased; and in the third quarter of 2011, the effective tax rate decreased, both as a result of recording certain tax contingencies, the resolution of tax audits and the expiration of various worldwide statutes of limitation.","Our normalized tax rate in the third quarter was 28.9% compared with 28.2% in the prior year.","Operating cash flow in the quarter was $301.5 million, a $6.2 million improvement over the prior year quarter. We're making good progress in our working capital initiatives with a 3-day reduction in inventory days and a 1.5-day improvement from payables versus the prior year.","We also returned $55 million to shareholders in the form of $29.1 million in dividends and $25.9 million paid for the repurchase of approximately 1.5 million shares. Since we initiated the share repurchase plan in Q3 of 2011, we have repurchased 7.1 million shares at an aggregate cost of $113.3 million.","Turning now to our 2012 outlook. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our full year guidance on all 4 key metrics: Core sales, normalized operating margin, normalized earnings per share and operating cash flow.","Based on our year-to-date results and our current view into Q4, we believe we will come in near the high end of the earnings per share range and in the lower half of the core sales growth range. With year-to-date cash flow improvement of $77 million, we're also on track to deliver operating cash flow within our guidance range of $550 million to $600 million.","We project interest expense to come in between $75 million and $80 million for the year. Our normalized full year effective tax rate for 2012 is projected to be around 26%.","Now I'd like to shift gears a little bit and talk about the expansion of Project Renewal. We have an opportunity to accelerate growth by going after cost more aggressively to fund investment behind our Win Bigger businesses. Achieving growth requires bigger investments in people and in capabilities like brand support, design, innovation and better tools for execution. We know we don't have enough money invested in growth, and this is how we're going to get it.","Today, we announced an expansion of Project Renewal, which encompasses several critical efficiency projects to further unlock trapped capacity for growth and free up funds for investment. We are focused on 5 key work streams. The first is organizational simplification. We will create a flatter, more efficient structure that will free up structural cost for reinvestment behind brands to fuel growth. It will also offer a better -- it will also offer better direct visibility into the business and promote better informed and faster decision-making. Mike will discuss this in more detail shortly. The second area is further EMEA transformation. We will make a step-change reduction in complexity in order to improve profitability. These resources will be funneled to Win Bigger businesses globally to fuel growth. The broader areas we are looking at include SKU rationalization, route to market, supply chain and platform support.","The third area is best cost finance. A new, simplified organization structure that will enable One Newell approaches to transaction processing and information management. Other opportunities exist in shared services to leverage SAP, to move people resources from reporting and compliance to more value-added analytics and decision support.","The fourth area is best cost back office, including consolidated customer service and procurement that offers opportunities to achieve One Newell efficiencies across back office functions.","And finally, there are several supply chain footprint opportunities to optimize manufacturing and distribution globally.","This expansion of Project Renewal will generate incremental annualized cost savings of $180 million to $225 million by the middle of 2015, and will affect just over 10% of our current workforce. The majority of the savings will be reinvested in programming to accelerate growth, and strengthen brand-building and selling capabilities in our Win Bigger businesses and our Win Bigger geographies.","We expect to incur a cash cost of $225 million to $250 million related to the renewal expansion, and record total charges of $250 million to $275 million over the same period of time. We've made good progress in the first phase of renewal and are on track to capture $90 million to $100 million in savings by our target date of Q2 2013.","This has been a fast payback project and a necessary first step to simplify our structure and free up resources. The success of Phase 1 gives us the confidence that we can take this next larger step. It, too, will be a fast payback and will result in a structure that is fully aligned with the Growth Game Plan.","So with our balance sheet in good shape, ongoing operating cash flow can comfortably fund the CapEx required to support our growth plans, cash needs for the expansion of Project Renewal, a dividend in the 30% to 35% payout range, and continuing steady progress on share repurchase under our $300 million authorization.","In summary, while we continue to face business and macroeconomic challenges in parts of our portfolio, we are pleased with our results year-to-date, and remain confident in our ability to meet our full year commitments. We continue to have good momentum across much of the business. We are also executing against plans to mitigate and overcome challenges where they exist.  All the while, we remain focused on the Growth Game Plan and unlocking cost in order to invest in our brands and selling infrastructure to drive sustainable growth as we move forward.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk","Thanks, Doug. As I said earlier, today, we're launching a major transformation of the company, design to drive the Growth Game Plan into action more boldly and more rapidly. Over the next couple of years, we will both simplify and enhance the way we do business to accelerate our drive to make Newell Rubbermaid a bigger, faster-growing, more global, more profitable company.","This morning, we announced a new organization model and strengthened leadership, including top outside appointments to my executive team. We are reorganizing the company around the first 2 pillars of our Growth Game Plan, brand and category development, where we strive to make our brands really matter; and best-in-class execution and delivery, where we're building an execution powerhouse.","The new development organization will be accountable for building big brand ideas, high-impact, disruptive innovation and a true point of difference through superior design and product experience. All of the company's marketing, insight, design, R&D and corporate development talent will be part of the new development organization.","The new delivery organization will be accountable for P&L management and delivering the maximum commercial value from the growth ideas built by the development organization. The delivery team will place much greater emphasis on building true strategic partnerships with our customers and suppliers, optimizing supply chain efficiencies across the company, while also building our go-to-market capabilities in the emerging markets.  All of the company's general management, supply chain, customer and channel development talent will be part of the new delivery organization.","I'm confident this new model will strengthen our performance. When I joined Unilever in 2003, that organization looked very much like our current Newell Rubbermaid structure. In 2006, we deployed a similar organization model to the one we've announced at Newell today. I held top leadership roles in both the delivery and the development pillars of that company, and I know from experience that this model works.","It creates focus on both the important work of developing brands and building disruptive innovation and the urgent work of day-to-day delivery. And through that focus, does not allow the urgent delivery issues to overwhelm and dilute the important brand growth work, as often happens in a single point of accountability models like the one we have today at Newell and Unilever had in 2006.","The model we are now moving to drove significantly improved performance at my former company, and it will do the same at Newell Rubbermaid.","At the same time, strengthening Newell's development and delivery capabilities, we will noticeably flatten our structures, giving bigger roles to key leaders and driving simplification throughout the organization to focus on growth. The company will start by delayering the top of the organization, eliminating the Professional and Consumer groups, while further consolidating the global business units from 9 GBUs to 6 business segments.","The 6 new business segments: Tools, Commercial Products, Writing, Baby & Parenting, Home Solutions and Specialty will be part of the delivery organization. The brand alignments to these new business segments are disclosed online, and we will report our financial results against these new segments, starting with our 2012 year-end results.","In the context of the new organization, we've made a series of new leadership appointments to my team. Mark Tarchetti, the former Head of Global Strategy at Unilever will join the company in January as Chief Development Officer and lead the new development organization. Originally from the U.K., Mark is the founder of the international consulting firm, Tarchetti & Co., has been working closely with the me and the leadership team over the last year to develop the Growth Game Plan.","Prior to starting his own consulting firm, Mark spent 14 years at Unilever in a variety of senior strategy business and finance roles, culminating in being appointed the Head of Global Corporate Strategy, reporting directly to Paul Polman, Unilever CEO, and driving the development of the company's new corporate strategy with the top executive team.","Bill Burke, currently Group President, Newell Professional, has been appointed Chief Operating Officer and will lead the new delivery organization. Bill has a proven track record of outstanding leadership and consistent growth in his 10 years at Newell Rubbermaid, including leading and repositioning the Lenox brand to deliver double-digit sales growth and leading the company's Professional businesses to accelerate international expansion. Bill's businesses have been the growth engine of the company over the last few years.","Bolstering Bill's delivery organizations, our 2 new additions to the Newell executive team. Joe Cavaliere will join the company as Chief Customer Officer, reporting to Bill. Joe has 29 years of experience in customer development and brings an outstanding track record of delivering growth, developing strategic customer partnerships and building world-class customer development capabilities. He is currently the Head of Customer Development for Unilever in North America, and before that, was one of the top leaders at Kraft Foods. Joe has led the transformation of Unilever's customer development capabilities over the last 9 years. I recruited him to Unilever from Kraft, have known and worked with him for many years prior to that, and I'm thrilled that he has chosen to join Newell to lead customer development globally as part of the delivery organization.","The company will also appoint a Chief Supply Chain Officer who will report to Bill. This executive, who we will announce in the coming weeks, brings nearly 30 years of supply chain experience, the last 8 in senior leadership positions at a large industrial products company. Our new supply chain leader will drive sharper execution and delivery to our sourcing, distribution and transportation, customer and consumer services, manufacturing and planning disciplines.","In development, we've strengthened Mark's team with 2 new appointments as well. Richard Davies will join the company as Chief Marketing and Insights Officer. Richard is leaving his role as the head of Unilever's Global Insights function, where he leads more than 700 people in over 50 countries. Originally from New Zealand, Richard brings over 30 years of marketing, insights and brand-strategy experience to Newell.","Richard's proven track record of creating brands and bringing innovation to consumers, combined with his experiences living and working in markets around the world, make him an ideal leader to raise the bar on our marketing and innovation agenda. The marketing and insights talent currently in the business segments will report to Richard.","Richard's partner in new product development will be Chuck Jones, our recently announced Chief Design and R&D officer. Both Richard and Chuck will report to Mark. The R&D, industrial, graphic and interaction design talent currently in the business segments will report to Chuck.","Bill, Mark, Joe, our new Chief Supply Chain Officer, Richard and Chuck, together with our current functional leaders, will all be members of my Newell executive team.","I could not be more excited about partnering with these leaders as we drive the next phase of our transformation and growth. They're all recognized as among the top in their respective fields, and they will all be key contributors to my leadership team. Most importantly, they all see the same transformational opportunity to build something bigger and better at Newell Rubbermaid through the Growth Game Plan.","The fact that our new teammates have chosen to leave big roles with broad responsibilities to join Newell Rubbermaid is a very strong validation of our potential.","As the result of the structure changed, Penny McIntyre, our currently Group President, Newell Consumer, will leave the company to pursue other opportunities. I wish Penny the best in her future endeavors, and thank her for all of her tremendous efforts and accomplishments during her time with Newell.","In addition, Ted Woehrle, Chief Marketing Officer; and Paul Boitmann, Chief Customer Development Officer, will be leaving the company. I also want to thank Ted and Paul for their service, leadership and impact, and wish them continued success as they also pursue opportunities outside Newell Rubbermaid.","We've covered a lot of ground today. So let me summarize. We delivered a solid set of results in the third quarter and are well on our way to delivering our full year guidance across all 4 of our full year guidance metrics. We've announced a 50% increase in the quarterly dividend that brings us to the high end of our targeted dividend payout ratio range. With the on-time and in-full completion of the first phase of Project Renewal right around the corner in the first half of 2013, we've announced the expansion of Project Renewal. The expansion of Renewal has 5 new work streams that will, by the middle of 2015, generate $180 million to $225 million of incremental savings over that 2.5-year period.","We've announced a simpler, flatter organization model that recognizes -- reorganizes the company around the first 2 pillars of the Growth Game Plan with our structure now aligned to our strategy. And we've appointed a new Newell executive team, with a tremendous blend of top talent from both within Newell Rubbermaid and from the outside.","I see more potential in our business today than I imagined upon joining the company 15 months ago, and I'm energized by the choices we're making, the team we're building and the opportunity that lies ahead.","Our people have proven to me they're capable of driving delivery, while simultaneously driving change. By increasing the pace of our transformation, we will more quickly realize the Growth Game Plan ambition of building a bigger, faster-growing, more global, more profitable Newell Rubbermaid.","With that, let me open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So on these 5 streams, can you allocate the percentage of savings you expect to get from the each one of them?","Douglas L. Martin","Connie, this is Doug. We will be giving more color on the total Project Renewal restructuring or the expansion pieces of it on the call in January.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then what about the timing of the cost and the savings? I mean, it says throughout the life of the program. But it seems like a lot of the change has been made now, the new reporting structure happens right around the corner. So can you give us a little color on that?","Douglas L. Martin","Yes, that will be some of the changes will be happening, the ones that Mike mentioned. It's a relatively small piece of the total, though, that will happen in the next couple of months between now and year end. Most of the activity will begin occurring beginning in the second quarter of next year, and then the different work streams will roll out after that. Again, we'll give you a little more color on that as we get into January timeframe. But I'd remind you that we do intend to reinvest these savings in the business as they're generated to further drive growth.","Michael B. Polk","Connie, just want to build on that. The structural change at the top happens immediately. And so within the -- certainly, my direct reports, that change will happen -- happens effective today. Some of the folks will start to report later in the fourth quarter into the beginning of next year. But we're going to get on with that structure. And in fact, we're meeting later this afternoon with the -- in the global webcast to dimensionalize that for folks. I think the people savings will skew towards the front end, some of the structural stuff that we need to do. The supply chain will be spread out over the duration, and that won't kick in -- the supply chain work won't kick in for a while. We need to give our new Chief Supply Chain Officer the opportunity to own some of those choices, although we've got a pretty clear view of what we need to go through. So you'll see the savings in the cost spread over that 2.5-year window with the organizational work done earlier and the structural supply chain work done later in that 2.5-year window.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara from Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I guess, you guys are set up now with, call it, cumulatively $300 million in savings, which is like $0.75 a share on $1.70 earnings base, like 5 points of margin. I guess, the question is, with that $300 million number, I mean, can you bucket what the reinvestment could look like, right? Because given what you spend on things like R&D, on marketing, right, on your selling organization, it sounds like the reinvestment of that would be multiples of what you spend now, right? I'm just wondering if you could just provide a little color and insight just to help us kind of dimensionalize this stuff.","Michael B. Polk","So, Chris, it is the key question that we are asking ourselves. How much of that flows in and how much of that flows to EPS? Clearly, the intent of -- behind doing this is to unlock the upside in the Growth Game Plan, which is all about shifting our SG&A dollars from structural cost to investment behind our brands. And we've said the majority of the spend will go into brand spending. We haven't said all of it will, however. So what this does for us is it releases the cost and gives us the opportunity to invest for faster growth and for the geographic expansion of our leading brands, at the same time, it's providing a greater line of sight to earnings and operating cash flow growth. So this is the key next step in unlocking the trapped capacity for growth, but also provides that line of sight. We won't spend money unless we're spending money behind ideas that are going to create growth. So I'm not -- and you've seen my behavior over the last 15 months. Money flows to ideas. And so it's really important for the new leadership structure that we've announced and for the new leadership team to get in here as quickly as possible and for us to really galvanize our -- around the set of choices that weren't good investment. Clearly, the portfolio role choices that we've made, the definition of our Win Bigger categories, the choice to, in the disciplined and deliberate way, build out our geographic footprint into a higher growth -- faster-growing emerging markets. Those will all be filters through which we make the choices of what to invest in. And so if you're looking -- as you get greater visibility into our business through the segment reporting we'll do, and as you're thinking about how you build your view forward, I would use those filters. I would apply a disproportionate amount of the investment against the Win Bigger businesses and the Win Bigger geographies, as Doug said. Now we're not going to provide quarterly guidance, and I do think you need to be careful in terms of how you think about the flow of savings into your models and into whatever you do with respect to your projections on EPS. Effectively, the flow of savings will mirror the flow of savings over the next 2.5 years will mirror the flow of savings over the last 12 months. The cost and the benefits over the next 2.5 years effectively are the same cost and benefits that we've experienced over the last 12 months with renewal, if you think about it. And that's, I think, in a broad sense, the way I would look at this with us investing only in the things that we believe in, believe will yield a sustainable growth return.","Douglas L. Martin","Just a reminder, Chris, as well, as we've generated savings this year from Project Renewal, we have begun investing in selling systems, and we've talked about that. So an increase -- and we've also increased strategic spend as we've gone throughout the year on a year-over-year basis by about 50 basis points. So you'll see that shift within SG&A.","Michael B. Polk","But Chris, the things to look at in our portfolio that we'll bet on Writing, we'll bet on Commercial Products, we'll bet on Tools. Those are all our Win Bigger categories. We'll bet on Latin America and then -- because we believe that we need to develop our business south and east. And eventually, we'll bet on China and Southeast Asia. But we'll do it in a deliberate way, in a disciplined way that lives up to our commitment to also deliver steady operating income margin improvement.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And I guess, an unrelated follow-up. I mean, yes, I think, it's great, you got the payout ratio up to 35%. But looking ahead, right, that still leaves 65%. And I think you've said that tack-ons or acquisitions are really not what you're looking at right now. I mean, should we assume that buyback is really where the destination for the remainder of your cash generation?","Michael B. Polk","Look, we believe in the Growth Game Plan. As I've said that over the last 12 months, the focus of the Growth Game Plan is on organic growth. But that over time, we will open our mind to bolt-on acquisitions that are focused strategically against our growth agenda. But now is not the right moment for us to be doing that. So as you look at our capital allocation strategy over a 5-year window, you shouldn't simply shut down that path to making Newell into a bigger, more profitable, faster-growing company. That said, there's nothing transformational out there, so we're going to have a lot of the interesting choices with respect to what to do with the unallocated cash that this business has the potential to generate. We've said our target payout ratio ranges in the 30% to 35%. We've been challenged by some. We think that's not competitive enough. I think Bill was the first one to put that to me a year ago, and we will have other options available to us with respect to providing returns to shareholders. Of course, choices like that are the board's choices. Management can make a recommendation, the board will make a call. And I think all of those avenues are open to us. And what's exciting about our company is the incredible crash-generative nature of the business and the opportunity we have to make even further progress on that front through attacking not just the trapped capacity for growth as it's measured in the P&L, but also the trapped capacity for growth that is measured through our working capital ratios.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on that allocation of capital questions just for a minute. Because I know you have one of the lower dividend yields in the group, but you also have one of the lower multiples. So it surprises me, frankly, that even just year-to-date, we haven't seen more buybacks. You're kind of in that consistent $20 million to $25 million a quarter. And I guess the question is, does that belie some trepidation on your part in the consistency of the results? Do you think there's going to be a better buying opportunity out there? Or is this just a, hey, we kind of want to be consistent for now in terms of our allocation of the excess cash and just make share repurchases more of a regular thing, because I'm surprised you haven't been more aggressive on that front?","Douglas L. Martin","Yes, Wendy, this is Doug. I think it's the latter. And I think when you think about the overall -- our overall considerations for the use of cash, we're obviously funding our renewal programs. We are investing in CapEx then to continue to build out our growth opportunities and our core businesses. We have increased the dividend a couple of times over the last year to something that's consistent with the payout range we'd like to be in. And then we're going to execute our $300 million share repurchase plan on a relatively consistent basis.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And that leads me to looking into next year. And I as I go back to the Analyst Day and the 3 phases of your growth, I think next year is supposed to be in that strategic bucket, and the concept was earnings growth kind of in the 5% to 8% range. But I hear you talk about these actions unlocking the upside, if you will, in your growth plan. And I'm wondering, as we start to thinking about 2013, are you comfortable with all of us kind of going to the high end of the range? I know some of these cost savings take a couple of years to roll through. But are you feeling good enough about the business that we can migrate to the high end of that range in terms of thinking about earnings growth next year?","Michael B. Polk","Wendy, it's Mike. I think you captured it right that we're just emerging into the strategic stage. The choices we're making today are designed, as I said, to unlock the upside. And what I mean by that is, we have an opportunity, if we move through this effectively, to pull the acceleration stage in closer to our current timetable. And I don't think '13 will materially change in terms of what we have to do as a company. '13 is always going to be the big transition year. That's why we're making these changes now to get the talent in here to really fill the funnel. So I don't think it materially impacts the long-term guidance we provided when we first laid out the Growth Game Plan in '13. The question becomes can we accelerate '15 into the tailwind of '14 or the second half of '14? And that's something we will work through over the coming number of months as we get the new leadership in place and we start to really focus our resources and channel them against the biggest impact agenda items we've got. So I think the promise of the upside probably comes a year beyond next, and we'll have to work through whether we can get that pulled forward by a full year or whether it's something less than that. But the language I use was very choice-full. And you're right, this restructuring enables us to accelerate the timeframe to get to the acceleration phase. And I think there's bound to be opportunity here. What's really nice about what we've chosen to do in the 5 work streams is we get a real quick payback on this. It's not materially different than what we have done in the first phase of renewal. And because of that, the effect on uncommitted cash over the 5-year windows is neutral. There's no difference in our uncommitted cash, having executed this program. So you fund it within that timeframe, and you're still left with $1.5 billion of uncommitted cash and increased borrowing capacity that we'll have the ability to do interesting things with. And again, we don't want to get specific about that now, but that will most likely involve a blend of both shareholder-friendly actions and more aggressive point of view on both on M&A.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Pretty excited about some of the transformation, Mike, so congratulations on getting that. Wendy asked the question that I was going to ask about, whether the guidance for next year, the 3% to 4% sales, core sales growth and the 5% to 8% EPS growth, and where might be in that. So let me move onto my second question, which was, you did not name, or at least in the release, the heads of the operating units. So do we have any surprises in that? When will those be formally announced publicly?","Michael B. Polk","They're being announced in the company today, so I'll share them with you now. I didn't want to put them into the press release until our people had the opportunity to hear it from us directly. There are 6 segment leads, 6 business segments that we're moving to. There are 6 business segment presidents that will be appointed -- have been appointed. We are combining Industrial Products & Services with Construction Tools & Accessories. And Rich Wuerthele, who currently runs IP&S, will lead the Combined Tools business. In Baby, Kristie Juster stays put. She's doing a great job in our Baby business, and we're really beginning to hit our stride there and, of course, we're not going to change anything in that place given the momentum we see building. In Home Solutions, which is the combination of Home Org & Style, GBU and Culinary, Jeff Hohler will lead the new Home Solutions business segment. In the combination of Tools and -- the Construction Tools & Accessories and Industrial Products & Services business, we will take the Hardware business and move it into our new segment called the Specialty segment, which will merge with our technology global business unit. David Klatt, who currently has responsibility for the Tech GBU, will assume responsibility for the new Specialty business segment. And Eduardo Senf, who currently runs our WACE business, Writing & Creative Expression, will assume responsibility for the Writing business segment. So those -- and then in the RCP and Commercial Products, we will -- we've appointed Neil Eibeler to continue to lead that business. So as you can see, we've got good continuity of leadership in those key roles. In the context of those changes, Ross Porter, who currently runs Construction Tools & Accessories, will be leaving the company. And as with Penny, Ted, Paul, I do want to thank Ross for his service and leadership over a number of years. He's had quite an impact. And when you make changes like this, good people end up leaving, and I'm optimistic and happy to help any one of these folks really land in key roles, because they're all really talented people and they've made significant contributions to getting us to this point.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Congratulations to the folks that will lead those units, and I echo your sentiments about Ross. We in the investment community have had a long and valued relationship with Ross. So I hope he does well going forward. The last question I have is also organizational, because it looks like Europe is going to change markedly with your General Counsel running that. And I take it that the matrix level of that organization is going to be collapsed? Can you talk a little bit about how that's going to work? I think that's a good idea, but I'd like to understand and see that working.","Michael B. Polk","Sure. So for those who didn't see the leadership announcement, John Stipancich, who is our Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel, will take over P&L responsibility for EMEA and lead the EMEA transformation through a group of European leaders that are on the ground. Gordon Scott, who is our sales lead in EMEA on the Consumer businesses, will become the General Manager of that geography. And it is the one area of the world that we will manage as a geography as we work through the transformation work stream because the critical enabler to unlocking the cost in Europe is to remove the complexity, whether that's SKU complexity or whether that's route-to-market complexity, or whether that's the nature of our go-to-market strategies in small countries across EMEA. And in order to do that, effectively and fast, you need to have somebody that's got accountability for making those choices. And if we were to leave the verticals in place in that geography while we were making the change, we didn't believe we would efficiently be able to make those complexity choices without a lot of cajoling and influencing. And so we're impatient in some ways with respect to unlocking the cost because we have places we want to spend the money for growth. And so we've asked John to step in to lead that work. John's background, John was -- before coming to Newell, involved in private equity, working at KKR & Co. And so he's got a lot of experience in leading transformation work of this sort. And so we've asked John to take the lead in driving that portion of our renewal expansion initiative into action.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","First question is on the expansion of renewal. It seems like over the last decade or so, I guess, one could argue that Newell has been in a state of restructuring or a non-stop state of restructuring and has been fairly restructured over that time. So how comfortable are you -- or how confident are you that you can effectively triple the size of the original renewal program? And then secondly, I assume the spending won't occur until the cost savings actually do materialized?","Michael B. Polk","So Joe, great question. We've got a very good line of sight to each of the 5 work streams. These have been built bottoms up. We have more work to do before we make some final choices, particularly in the supply chain. But we've got a pretty good line of sight to the opportunities and the linkage of cost and benefit. The thing that needed to happen in order to enable us to go after this is the structural choice we've made this money. We had to reorganize and reset the organization structure to enable many of these costs to be accessible. And so things happen in a sequence for a reason. We've aligned the company's structure to the strategy. We've got SAP in place in the 80% of our revenue -- and in geographies representing 80% of our revenue today. Slightly more than that, quite frankly. So we've got visibility into complexity cost in the way that we've never had before. And so we have the opportunity now to pursue these -- the release of the cost. And so that's the logic for how and why we've done what we're doing and in what sequence. Your question about whether we can get $300 million -- cumulatively $300 million of benefit out of the cost structure of this company, and the answer clearly is yes. It's just going to take us time to do that and, of course, we have to balance the way we do that release of cost against the need to consistently deliver our commitments. And so of course, it's going to be the tension that's existed so far that will exist over the next 2.5 years, which is finding the balance between delivery and change, which, as I said, my team has proven to me that they can drive delivery and simultaneously drive change. And that gives me the confidence to really go more aggressively to go bolder and faster to reach for the transformation of the company.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just secondly, on the cost savings you guys are looking for from indirect procurement, I think, the last time you had spoke, you mentioned that you're looking about $50 million of savings by the end of next year. Could you update us on that and where that stands at this point?","Douglas L. Martin","Sure, Joe. This is Doug. We're on track, continue to be on track for the $50 million. And this year, we are on track to deliver about $20 million of that. So we're well on our way. The teams are all engaged and are fully engaged in supporting the initiative and driving the savings that we're seeing.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. Just one last one if I could. The merchandising activity at J.C. Penny, obviously, has been a drag on you guys, in D\u00e9cor in particular. And it sounds like you're hopeful that by next spring that will change or it will improve. How quickly would you expect to see some improvement from J.C. Penney?","Michael B. Polk","Look, I think we're going to have a rough ride with JCP until they do their transition in late Q1 into Q2. It's really focused in our D\u00e9cor and our Culinary business. And to the degree that they can get to the promised land, that could be very exciting for us. So we want to work with them to enable that. In the meantime, we're looking to build our businesses out such that we don't have to deal with such a headwind. Just for reference, through the end of Q3 year-to-date, our core sales globally, x D\u00e9cor, would be up 3.5%. So that's the degree to which this problem has hurt us. So that's pretty solid performance in a really, really tough environment from a macro perspective. And I gave you some insight into Baby and Professional in North America, combined growing over 6%. So we've got many parts of our business performing very well right now and gives us encouragement that when we release cost and put some money behind these businesses, we should be able to see some benefit from that from a growth perspective. So the answer to your question is we're going to have to live with the D\u00e9cor and the Culinary drags as a result of JCP right through that transition in the first half of 2013. But look, I'll take a longer view than this, and these choices are things we can control. I want to focus our new energy around building a really compelling innovation and brand growth agenda through the addition of talent we're bringing into the company and through the structural change we're making that will enable us to create focus, both on development and delivery. And if those 2 capabilities will work in an interdependent way and they're of equal stature, and they together will create a more vibrant future for us. And so our energy is going to that right now. We will work through the J.C. Penney issues in those 2 businesses. And like I said, if they can get to the promised land, that's a very exciting future for us, but it will be bumpy until then.","Operator","Your. Next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could just remind us, I've kind of lost track here, of how much increase in strategic spending you are supposed to have in 2012? And if you think by the end of fourth quarter, we'll be -- you'll be ahead of that or kind of just in line with that or below? And also, you mentioned some shift of spending. Can you just elaborate on that? I think you said from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And then my second question has to do with -- you had said that there was some weakness in Fine Writing kind of in the more mid-price point range. And can you just update us on that? Is that trend improving or is that kind of the same and remind us what geographies, was that just Europe or Europe and Asia? And then third question is have you given, right now, any thought as you've continued to look at the businesses and been longer at the company to divestitures? Are you happy with the potential future for each of the things? Or what's your current thought there?","Michael B. Polk","Thank you. Thanks, Linda. Let me start with a couple of them, and I'll work back towards the SG&A question. So on Fine Writing Europe. As you recall, we shared with you on the last call the concerns we had on our Fine Writing business in Europe as a result of the macro pressure that business was feeling. This is the component of our Fine Writing portfolio that sits probably below $100 a pen. It's not a very high end of our business, which is growing beautifully. It's the area of our portfolio that's sort of caught in between Everyday Writing Instruments and the super premium end of that portfolio. And that was the segment of the portfolio in Europe that was under duress. It's also the segment of the portfolio in Europe that's distributed more through small stationery stores. And these guys are under pressure in this environment, and therefore, pulled back on the inventories or, in some cases, having a tough time financing those inventories. And so that business came under pressure in the first half of the year, and that dynamic continues with us. We've layered more support, more promotional support into the business in the second half of the year. And we'll continue to watch that and layer merchandising funding in to stabilize that business as we move into the fourth quarter. I don't want to play that lever too hard because everything we spent there is money that could be invested elsewhere in more strategic -- bigger strategic priorities. So we have to be careful about that. But our goal would be to stabilize that business until the macros turn in Europe by layering in the right merchandising support. On your question in general with respect to SG&A, we're right where we thought we'd be. Of course, if we had not have the D\u00e9cor problem, we'd be really layering the money in right now. But the D\u00e9cor problem has, and we haven't given you a specific operating income impact, but needless to say, it's been quite significant. And we needed to cover that through the year. Had we not had that problem, we would have been able to layer in even more investment. We have spent, as we've said, $30 million so far on selling systems. That's people, that's feet on the street across Latin America in some select businesses in North America. So we've weaned into selling investments first. And on a constant ForEx basis, our brand investment is effectively flat. So we have yet to layer big money in, in that space. But as we come into the fourth quarter and the line of sight to EPS is clearer, we will start to layer in brand, support money on top of the base we've got today, which is quite substantial. I mean, if you look where we would spend the money, it would be our Writing business, our Professional business. If you're watching TV around the Olympics, you would have seen Paper Mate advertising. If you were watching the Video Music Awards in September, you would have seen Sharpie right in the middle of all that. If you'd go online and you search Sharpie party on Google, you'll see Sharpie everywhere. So I'm not felling like we're short of investment today. But we have some bigger ideas that are coming through the funnel that will require support going forward. And as the new talent gets set, we will have the appetite to spend even more as they make the impact they should make on the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I was hoping to get a better sense of when we should expect to start seeing the top line payback from the higher spending. You talked about the line of sight on generating the savings, but can you expand on the line of sight to when the spending should actually start to materially boost your top line growth?","Michael B. Polk","Well, as we said in the strategic guidance we provided in February, we would expect that acceleration to start to occur through the strategic phase into the acceleration phase. And so what needs to happen first is the release of cost so that we have the investment firepower to put that money behind our brands. As I just mentioned to Linda, the D\u00e9cor problem this year aid into our capacity to invest behind brand. And have we had not that, you'd be seeing that investment happening already. But as we've said, we're not going to just spend without living up to our commitment to both accelerate growth and improve our operating income margin year in and year out. And so we begin to have greater clarity, greater line of sight to opportunities, and as the cost get released, we have the opportunity to layer those into brand-building investment, and you should expect us to start to do that, as we enter fourth quarter and into 2013. And you should expect to see our growth rates sequentially improve in '13 versus '12, as they have in '12 versus '11.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then can you discuss if you're seeing or expect to see any demand benefit from a potential U.S. housing rebound? It sounded like market share were strong in the U.S. in the quarter, but I was hoping for a bit of an update on category growth, and maybe just a general update on macros around the world also.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. I was asked that question this morning by a reporter on the macros. We haven't seen a material change in consumption patterns in North America. The biggest change we've experienced has been in Europe, and that continues to be a tough environment. Same time, we haven't seen sort of the housing-driven balance either. So we haven't seen the upside, the tailwind sort of move behind these businesses. We're winning because we're building market share. And the growth rates that I described for our Professional portfolio is a function of that in North America. So I look forward to the moment where the winds sort of pivot, but we haven't seen that yet. Our planning assumption for next year is that we've got more of the same. We haven't assumed a material change either way. I think from a consumer perspective, that's probably the right assumption to make irrespective of whether we go off the cliff or not. There may be a 90-day wobble in Q1, if in fact we do, with all the media headlines. But strategically, I don't think that is as much of a risk as perhaps retailer response to that dynamic playing out. That's where we get the volatility, more so than in the consumer dynamics. We will have an interesting challenge in the first half of next year because, as you know, summer occurred earlier, at least, in the eastern half of the country last year, which certainly helped our Professional portfolio. But I don't think there's -- we're not experiencing any material impact of the macro shifts on our business. Look at our emerging growth rate at 12% roughly year-to-date. We've all seen the GDP headlines out of China and out of Brazil. But given where we start from, slightly less than $1 billion business, which an absolute sizable, but relative to the market, a huge opportunity. The GDP dynamics in emerging markets aren't really a factor. It's more of what we do and how much we invest to deploy the portions of our portfolio we intend to develop in those geographies than any other macro impacts.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And so core sales be at the low end of your range for the full year, that's more home D\u00e9cor than macros causing some downside at this point?","Michael B. Polk","It's the macros in EMEA than it's D\u00e9cor. And I think that those are the things that caused us to be at the low end of the range. And we have a tough -- and we're starting to lap growth. So we've got to grow on growth. But we're 3.5% year-to-date without D\u00e9cor in the mix. And I don't like to do the withs and withouts, so the reality is we're at Q2. And I think we'll be hard pressed to get above the midpoint in our full year guidance range without some big change in the environment. So I think we've said, the -- we have a clear line of sight to the top of our EPS range. But given the environment, we're sort of in the bottom of our -- bottom half of our core sales range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is there sort of any way you're gauging the effectiveness of some of these investments in emerging markets? I mean, there aren't systems in yet to sort of get an early read on sort of what the payback has been so far. And then if you could just give us the sales to date for renewal?","Michael B. Polk","The sales to date or the savings to date?","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sorry, yes, savings to date.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. I'll let Doug answer the savings-to-date question. This is how we're measuring the investments in -- the renewal investments in Latin America. I'm looking at growth rates. And I look at growth rates, the return on the sales investments in terms of the growth yield we're getting in those geographies. So I'm not looking at it from a financial metric perspective. I'm looking for a specific investment yield in those specific geographies. I've got to look at that in aggregate across the total company. And we're seeing good growth in Latin America by country. So even with the GDP slowdown in Brazil, we've got good numbers coming out of that part of the world and strong double-digit growth in those geographies. And that is a function of getting broader coverage. And so when we complement that with good brand investment and we get to building our brands in the sustainable way, we're going to have a nice financial return on those investments. But it will take a longer -- it's a longer period of time, Bill. It's not something that I actually want to even measure in sort of on annualized basis, the financial return. The growth yield, absolutely. Are we doing it strategically? Absolutely. Are we building our market share from a brand perspective? Yes, we've got to measure that. Do consumers -- what does brand health look like behind those brands? Do we need to measure that? Absolutely. That's the kind of dashboard that we look at.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And, Doug, do you have that savings-to-date number?","Douglas L. Martin","Yes. I do, Bill. The year-to-date number is about $0.10. And the program to date, because we had a little bit occurred on the fourth quarter last year, is about $0.11.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then Mike, we all know you're a very persuasive guy. Can you just give some more color on how you got all these folks to come over? And then maybe if there's any changes to the incentive compensation metrics as you kind of change the strategic direction of the company.","Michael B. Polk","Look, I mean, these guys saw the opportunity inherent in the business. All I had to do is show them a couple of charts.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can I see those charts?","Michael B. Polk","Yes, yes. It's on the Analyst Day. It was that cash chart, and that was to see the essential on that one, the one that talks about our unallocated cash and the increased borrowing capacity. And then, the fact that the brand portfolio is so concentrated. You've got 14 brands that represent 85% of our revenue stream. And these are not brands that are in their twilight. These are strong brands with great light in equity. And so with the right investment of energy and insight, we can really create something powerful with that brand portfolio. And then, you want to work with people you like. So I don't know, maybe that's a factor.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The incentive compensation, isn't it going to be changed in the way sort of people are paid?","Michael B. Polk","No. We are -- we continue to -- I want to put more emphasis over time on the long-term components of our comp. But the metrics we're looking at are going to stay the same. We'll focus on core sales growth, we'll focus on EPS delivery and we'll focus on cash. And then from a long-term perspective, we're looking -- we get comped, all of us, on relative TSR. So I think those are the right metrics in the business. And if we -- if I had a wish, it's that we push more the total direct compensation towards the long-term incentive component of things, because I believe that, that's the best way for our employees to share in the value creation story related to the Growth Game Plan. And I think that while it's a little bit more of a long-term payout, then perhaps they're historically used to, I think it's the right perspective to have and it's the best way that they can create wealth for their family. So I'm encouraging the board to think that way, and I definitely talk our employees about our business that way.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. Then just one quick follow-up. Typically a good back-to-school correlates to a very good Christmas. Is there any reason to believe that it's not going to be the case this year?","Michael B. Polk","Look, we're hopeful. We're launching Sharpie Metallics and we're putting money behind it. It's part of what we'll get brand investments. And we've got a really cool thing going on, on Sharpie also, with respect to our music partnerships. And we get the full core benefit of InkJoy in the marketplace in North America. So we have good things going on in the business. I wish -- I said to the board the other day, the impact of this D\u00e9cor thing is really pretty profound. And have we not had not that issue, we'd be in a very different place. But we got to live with that, and we're going to live with that right into 2013. And if we take this new structure, and we work it really hard, we should start to see some benefits as we get out there into '14 and beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So 2 questions about the structure, the new GBU structure. The first would be -- I mean, you talked about 14 brands, and is 6 GBUs seems like a lot for sort of 14 core brands? And then secondly, was there any thought, given the aligning the structure from a geographic standpoint instead of a GBU standpoint, given the need to focus on the emerging markets businesses?","Michael B. Polk","Well, John, I like having our structure, our P&L ownership vertical by category basically. It makes the interface between those first 2 pillars much easier to manage. So you've got a development owner and a category owner that are both global in nature. One of the complexities in my former company is that you have to marry a category owner up to 20 multi-country geography owners. And that gets very complicated and expensive. So we're not the type of company that can afford to have all those interfaces. So I think this is the right structure for us. We've made a different choice in EMEA for a different reason, which is related to the complexity issue that I raised. But you know what? I don't know what we'll look like 5 years from now. There's any number of possibilities. And for the next period of time, though, this is the right structure for us. It's the most efficient way for us to make the biggest impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with RBC.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of minor things. One, I guess, as we think about 2013 and kind of the step-up in core sales from maybe where you'll end this year and known that D\u00e9cor is going to weigh down. I guess, can you just talk about the relevance of the innovation pipeline you see for '13 relevant to what's out there for '12? So that's the first question. And then the second question, just maybe a little bit more color on the SKU rationalization, maybe where you see some of the bigger opportunities, obviously, not going into specific brands. But if you could talk maybe Consumer versus Professional versus Baby, a little bit more color on that angle.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. In terms of innovation funnel, I actually we've got a pretty good funnel coming forward, both of items that are rolling out of '12 into '13 and new things that we're doing. Some of which I can talk about. Some of which you'll have to wait to talk about until our next call. And it's pretty balanced with good activity in Writing, a very good plan in Baby. We have an excellent selling of our new items for '13 on Baby in the U.S., in Europe, which is new news, which will help. And also, we've got some of the exciting things happening in the Professional business that I can't talk about right now. Plus, we've got some geographic deployment opportunities that we will pursue in '13, which again, I don't want to get specific on yet, but also offer some really interesting opportunity largely in the Professional category. So as I think about the growth levers we've got for next year, those are in round terms, the brand innovation or portfolio deployment components of it. We have as much opportunity in strengthening our delivery as we do in strengthening our development pipeline. And there's as much creativity and joy to be had in building the right assortment by channel and creating strategic partnerships and stripping complexity out of the enterprise-wide value chain from our retailers' cash register back through our supplier interfaces. And that work, which will be the work of the delivery organization, can each both release cost but also drive growth. And I'm as excited about those opportunities, in the channel development opportunities we had, as I am about the innovation opportunities we've got. With respect to the specificity you're looking for on complexity reduction in Europe, there's really 3 levels to this. There's the SKU complexity that you've talked about. And I think there's opportunities in probably our biggest businesses there, which are Writing business and our Tools businesses. But we have to be very careful about that. There's equally opportunity to play for different route-to-market models, depending on geographies. So we have the complexity and the cost associated with a very broad EMEA geographic footprint, but not very big businesses in some geographies. And of course, you want to sustain those businesses, but there's a more efficient way to deliver those revenues through management of our route-to-market systems in a more synergistic way, and that's a different type of complexity. So without getting too specific, but you get the sense for those types of opportunities we'll pursue. John's all over this with the support of the European team and also with some help from the outside.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sarah Miller with SunTrust.","Sarah Miller","I'm on the call today for Bill. But I guess, one last question that we had was, could you provide any more color around the Baby business? I know you mentioned that a lot of your growth in the U.S. was coming more from market share gains. But just if we can get some more color around the overall category, whether you see a lift coming any time soon, both in the U.S. and other geographies?","Michael B. Polk","Sarah, the headlines on Baby are generally pretty positive. We've strengthened our customer partnerships in the U.S. We've got better innovation on Graco this year. We have lapped the step-up in growth in Aprica in Japan, which occurred in Q2 of 2011, and we're sustaining good double-digit growth in Japan on Aprica. We do see some competitive activity picking up in Japan now. So there'll be some challenges there in terms of sustaining that rate of growth, but pretty good performance. The business in Europe has had challenges. And so as we look forward to '13, we're bringing in new innovation platform to market there, which should strengthen the Graco performance in Europe. And we're hopeful that our business stabilizes there. We feel good about the innovation sell-in for 2013 in the U.S. And we're hopeful that we can sustain the growth we're currently experiencing on top of year-ago growth in North America, which we have yet to lap until the fourth quarter of 2012. So Q4 will be the real test for the underlying forward-looking momentum in the Baby business in the U.S., Q4 and Q1. And we're well staged to be able to sustain certainly more than competitive levels of growth.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Lee First [ph] with Wellington Shield.","Unknown Analyst","I'm interested in hearing more about your go to market. I think you've already implemented One Newell sales force. And I was wondering if you could give us examples of success there already and then what kind of changes do you see going forward.","Michael B. Polk","We've -- Lee, as you know, we -- in April of this year, we really rolled out the customer -- the new customer development organization in the U.S. that on the Consumer side of the business took our sales structures from a disaggregated model, where they were in bed -- our sales force was in bed within each GBU and pulled them to the center to -- and organized our field selling teams around customers and channels. And we began to see some impact from that, particularly in the Consumer business, in -- which is where the change was made in late Q3. And I would expect that momentum to continue to build going into Q4 and into the first half of the year. We're seeing great progress with respect to penetrating new customers, which was part of the design ambition. And we're seeing early progress with respect to broadening our distribution footprint. But I wouldn't be objective if I didn't tell you that I think there's a lot more opportunity for us to go after. One of the powerful things about our new organization structure and having it focused around development and delivery is that more energy and more emphasis will go into the development of the right assortment for the right channels, the right pricing strategies, the right merchandising frequencies, the right merchandising vehicles and the right channel penetration strategies for each one of these businesses. If you're a general manager or a segment president in this new model, that's where a good chunk of your energy is going to go in the future. And so having now put the CDO in place, we have the opportunity to leverage it through this new structure more completely. And it was done in that sequence for a reason. You needed to get the CDO done first in Consumer before you'd be able to leverage this model that we've rolled to. Now importantly, with Joe's arrival, we will broaden the umbrella across our total portfolio to manage the customer development landscape in that way. It's not a change for the Professional business, but it brings both organizations together, so that Bill Burke has one go-to guy on customer development. And I think that's very, very helpful. There's opportunity in the future to take that model beyond the U.S. But for the time being, our energy is going to be focused there. And so Joe comes in having lived in this context at Unilever and at Kraft previously and knows how to work the system and knows how to get the most out of a model like this. He knows the critical nature of the partnership between customer development and the general management infrastructure, and he knows the critical nature of the partnership between that general management structure and the development pillar. And so he's operated in this world for 10 years, 15 years, and will be able to help us avoid all the potholes that you have the potential to step in when you don't have that experience.","Unknown Analyst","Are there any examples of success so far that you can share with us?","Michael B. Polk","We've talked about the Office Depot partnership on Rubbermaid Consumer, talked about broadening our portfolio of footprint through our Toys \"R\" Us relationship to include more than Baby on the toy side of that partnership. We're seeing expansion on our food and beverage Rubbermaid portfolio into the food, drug and mass channel. And so there's a long list. And I'll be happy when we have less strategic things to talk about to lay that out. It's a good challenge, Lee. I mean, if we're not clearly communicating all the wins we're getting, I'll make sure to take some time on our January call to dimensionalize that for you.","Unknown Analyst","And on the emerging markets, it sounds like you're focusing on Latin America. Could you just quickly clarify what your strategy is there in the long term and short term?","Michael B. Polk","As we said, we are going to invest behind the Win Bigger businesses and our Win Bigger geographies. The Win Bigger businesses are Tools, Professional Writing and Commercial Products. And all of those businesses have footprints in Latin America. So we are going to leverage those geographies for expanded brand presence and growth. And at the same time, take the same portfolio to Asia. And so geographically, our focus point in Latin America is 3 hubs, Mexico, Columbia and Andina [ph] in Brazil. And those 3 countries will serve as platforms for growth across the total Latin American landscape. In Asia, the prize is in China. We got a foothold there in Fine Writing and the Industrial Products & Services. We've moved talent to our new office in Shanghai to help develop our Rubbermaid Commercial Products business, and we will continue to do so to unlock the opportunity in China and also across Southeast Asia.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer period. If we were unable to get to your question, please call the Investor Relations team at (770) 418-7075. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Polk for any concluding remarks.","Michael B. Polk","Well, thanks for the questions, and thanks for sticking with us through a very complex and complete set of announcements this morning. We've covered a lot of ground. Once again, let me summarize. We've delivered a solid set of results and are well on our way to delivering our full year guidance across all 4 of our full year guidance metrics. We've announced a significant 50% increase in our quarterly dividend that brings us to the high end of our targeted dividend payout ratio range. With the on-time and in-full completion of the first phase of Project Renewal right around the corner in the first half of 2013, we've announced the expansion of Project Renewal. And that expansion has 5 new work streams that will, by the middle of 2015, generate $180 million to $225 million of incremental savings over that 2.5-year period. We've announced a new organization structure that's simpler and flatter, that reorganizes the company around the first 2 pillars of the Growth Game Plan, and our structure is now aligned to our strategy. And we've appointed a new Newell executive team with a tremendous blend of top talent from both within Newell Rubbermaid and from the outside. And so it's a very exciting moment for our company. This is the pivot where we start to drive the Growth Game Plan into action. We launched the Growth Game Plan in February. We initiated the first round of renewal changes in November to bridge to this moment. And now we take a bigger swing at both cost and releasing the trapped capacity for growth, but perhaps, more importantly, building out an organization model and a new team that has the potential to drive the company towards the acceleration stage of the Growth Game Plan, with the ambition of building a bigger, faster-growing, more global, more profitable Newell Rubbermaid. So with that, thanks for your questions and your support, and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Today's call will be available on the web at newellrubbermaid.com and on digital replay at (800) 585-8367 or (855) 859-2056, with an access code of 39786031, starting 2 hours following the end of today's call.

A slide presentation is also available for download.","I will now like to turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending our call today. I'm Nancy O'Donnell, and on the call with me are Mike Polk, our President and CEO, and Ralph Nicoletti, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I would like to point out that we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in our earnings release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","I would also remind you that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results maybe materially different due to risks, uncertainties and other factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update any such statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

And thanks to everyone for joining the call.","On our last earnings call, I unveiled the details of our accelerated transformation plan. In the second quarter, we begin to drive the plan into action. Our industry is changing much faster than most have anticipated. As has always been the case, the consumers driving these changes. She is considering her category in branch choices differently, receiving brand messages and being influenced to purchase in different ways, and clearly is shopping differently.","Her new path to purchase has yielded the rapid development of new channels and is driving major change in retailer and manufacturer business models. Given the nature of our categories in our channel footprint, we're on the leading edge of many of these changes. We're acting decisively and with speed as we look to create competitive leverage in this moment of inflection.","The accelerated transformation plan is designed to focus and reposition the company to succeed in this rapidly emerging new landscape. We expect to come through an intense period of change in 2018 and 2019 as a $9 billion consumer goods company, well positioned to both leverage a set of competitively advantaged capabilities in product design, innovation, marketing and e-commerce and position to gain market share in our home geographies, while fast tracking our international growth and portfolio deployment.","We\u2019ll right-size our organization from the top down to align with our more focused footprint and when coupled with the dramatic reduction in our complexity that comes through portfolio simplification, we will begin to operate more efficiently for improved financial performance. At the completion of our transformation, Newell Brands brands will be simpler, faster and stronger.","In the second quarter, we began to execute significant changes in our portfolio, our organization and our business system. We announced and completed the divestitures of Waddington and Rawlings. We were pleased with both the multiples and the after tax proceeds of $2.5 billion from these transactions. And we've begun to put the proceeds to work, prioritizing deleveraging the balance sheet.","Gross debt and Q2 2018 was $900 million below prior year and plans are already in motion to deliver by an additional $900 million by the end of Q3. Marketing processes for the remaining held-for-sale businesses are in full flight. We continue to expect to generate around $10 billion in after tax proceeds from the divestiture program.","With the next tranche of proceeds, we will deleverage, as maintaining our investment grade rating as a key priority for the company. While deleveraging is the early priority for proceeds, we expect to allocate significant capital to share repurchase over time.","In the second quarter, we took the initial steps to right size our organization with changes announced in action between May and August. These actions included changes on the top team, in our corporate functions and in marketing and R&D.","Our change program is designed to offset the retained costs associated with the divestitures and right size the cost structure to our new portfolio, while also increasing the connectedness and responsiveness of the organization for greater impact in the marketplace.","We also took steps to simplify our operations closing five distribution centers and implementing two SAP cut overs with a third underway right now on our large North America Appliances business. The impact of these actions will benefit the back half of the year and be fully reflected in next year's financial results. We have further work to do on costs. The positive impact of which will build over time.","In the context of these changes, we delivered second quarter results generally in line with our expectations. As a total company, we made progress on margins and they were well ahead of our expectations, driven by strong savings in overhead programs.","For reference, we placed supplemental information on the company's website that provides no illustrative total company P&L for Q2. Our net sales were a bit below our expectations and foreign exchange worsened and the late start to spring impacted our outdoor and fresh businesses.","We successfully navigated through an important phase the Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us liquidation on Baby and the inventory reset that our traditional Writing customers are driving. We also were pleased with the strong innovation driven growth on Crock Pot and Calphalon, in distribution driven growth on and First Alert, WoodWick and Yankee Candle.","Despite the absence of the Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us large online Baby registry e-commerce platform, our overall e-commerce business grew mid single digits percent. Excluding the impact of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, our e-commerce business grew double-digit percent.","While there's much more to do to drive the accelerated transformation plan into action and to ignite the underlying performance in the business, we're pleased with the first half progress we've made, driving the necessary changes to our portfolio and our cost structure, while simultaneously overcoming some of the most difficult retailer issues we\u2019ll have to face this year.","Let me pass the call to Ralph, to walk through a more in-depth review of Q2 results and then I\u2019ll return to provide perspective on the balance of the year. Over to you, Ralph.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thanks, Mike and good morning everyone. As I go through the financial results, please note that the discussion of the income statement metrics reflect our continuing operations. I'll remind you that under GAAP all overhead costs and interest expense not directly related to discontinued operations are allocated to continuing operations, which burdens margins and profitability in both 2018 and restated 2017 results. The company has initiated cost action plans to fully offset to retain costs over time and interest expense will decline through our planned deleveraging.","Reported net sales from continuing operations were $2.2 billion, down 12.8% versus last year due to the headwind from 2017 divestitures, adoption of the 2018 revenue recognition standard and a decline in core sales, which more than offset a tailwind from currency.","Total company core sales were down 6.2% during the second quarter, largely reflecting the anticipated retailer disruption within the Baby business, as Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us liquidated all of its remaining U.S. stores. And our continuation of inventory destocking on the Writing business within the office superstore and distributive trade channels, as well as difficult comparison on Elmer\u2019s.","We also experienced softness in our Coleman and Fresh Preserving businesses related to the late start to spring across the U.S. Reported gross margin improved 50 basis points versus last year to 35.2%, while normalized gross margin contracted 50 basis points year-over-year to 35.1%, as the headwind from higher input costs, unfavorable mix reflecting lower sales in Writing and reduced fixed cost absorption as we managed inventories more than offset the favorable impact of synergies and productivity.","Reported SG&A expense of $614 million represented 27.9% of sales, as compared to 27.5% in the year ago period. Normalized SG&A expenses were $535 million or 24.3% of sales versus last year at 23.2%. While expenses were reduced year-over-year by approximately $52 million due to cost savings and lower trade promotional spending.","Reported operating margin of 3.8% was roughly flat to the year ago a margin of 3.7%. Normalized operating margin was 10.9% as compared to 12.4% last year. Net interest expense was $121 million compared to last year's $115 million and reported tax expense was $53 million versus a benefit of $71.5 million in the year ago period. But that changed stemming from the tax benefits associated with the integration of certain legal entities.","The normalized tax rate was 4.6% compared with 5.5% in the prior year, reflecting continued tax planning initiatives. We now expect our total company normalized tax rate to be in the low double-digits for the year.","At the end of the quarter, we had 487 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For 2018, we now expect a weighted average diluted share count of about 480 million shares.","Reported diluted earnings per share for the total company were $0.27, as compared to $0.46 in the year ago quarter. Normalized diluted earnings per share were $0.82 versus $0.87 in the prior year now.","Now, before discussing our segment results, I'd like to draw your attention to the fact that effective in the second quarter, the company has announced new operating segments for continuing operations, food and appliances, home and outdoor living and learning and development. We will maintain in other segment for businesses held-for-sale in 2017, which includes our tools and winter sports businesses. You can refer to our IR website for a detailed review of the new segments and an unaudited recast of 2017 quarterly data by segment.","Our new food and appliances segment, which includes the Food Division and the Appliance & Cookware division, generated net sales of $621 million, representing 11.9% decline versus the prior year.","Core sales declined 8.2%, as innovation driven growth on Calphalon, Space Saving Cookware and Crock Pot Express Crock was offset by a decline in Latin America sales related to an SAP implementation pull forward by customers into Q1. And softness in food, with a late start to spring in the US negatively impacting the Fresh Preserving category.","The home and outdoor living segment comprised of the outdoor and recreation, home fragrance and connected home and security divisions posted net sales of $742 million, down 6.7% year-over-year.","Core sales decreased 6.4%, reflecting softness in home fragrance in EMEA, in The Independent gift store channel and in outdoor and recreation lost distribution on certain camping items in the U.S. and weakness on tents and coolers related to the late spring. Those headwinds were partially offset by strong growth on First Alert and Yankee Candle in the U.S. mask channel.","The Learning and Development segment, including the Baby and Writing divisions delivered net sales of $839 million, which represents a 15.3% decline year-over-year. We expected the second quarter to be very challenging for both the Writing and Baby businesses, with the former being impacted by inventory destocking in the office superstore and distributive trade channels, as well as the difficult comparisons stemming from the significant pipeline fill on Elmer\u2019s line.","We made good progress on reaching the reduced inventory targets established by our major Writing customers earlier this year and expect the Writing results to improve in the back half in 2018.","The revenue decline in the Baby division was in line with our expectations, as the bankruptcy of Toys \"R\" Us and the full liquidation of its remaining stores in the U.S. weighed on its performance. We believe that we are through the worst period and expected recovery in the back half.","Reported income from discontinued operations was $208 million versus $206 million last year. The reported results include a $598 million gain on the sale of Waddington, which is offset against #136 million loss on the sale of Rawlings and an impairment charge of $454 million taken against Process Solutions.","Normalized income from discontinued operations was $286 million versus $236 million last year. Remember, the discontinued operations benefit from the fact that there is no allocation of overhead costs and no interest expense.","The second quarter also mixes up from a strong seasonal result from Jostens. Operating cash flow in the quarter came in as expected generating a $11 million versus $57 million in the prior year, as favorable working capital movements, lower cash restructuring and tax expenses were offset by reduced operating income and loss contribution from businesses that were sold in 2017 and 2018.","We made progress during the second quarter on delivering the balance sheet which is a key priority for the company, as we remain committed to maintaining an investment grade rating. At the end of the second quarter, upon closing the Waddington and Rawlings transactions, we repaid $829 million of our accounts receivable facility. We expect to reduce debt by an additional $900 million in the third quarter.","As you may have seen in our recently filed 8-K, we have already paid off our term loan balance of $300 million. Given our priority to reduce the leverage, we are allocating the vast majority of the proceeds from the deals that were completed in second quarter towards debt repayment. Although, we have been in the marketplace repurchasing shares as well during Q3, which is reflected in our share count guidance.","We continue to expect that we will generate approximately $10 billion in net proceeds from divestitures over the course of the accelerated transformation plan, including the $2.5 billion already received. That in combination with cash from operations should enable us to deliver - to ensure maintaining our investment grade rating and still have sufficient cash to repurchase significant shares over the next 12 to 18 months.","I'll now turn the call back to Mike.","Michael Polk","Thanks, Ralph. Reigniting core performance and our continuing business is a critical priority and we expect sequential improvement in our operating results in the back half of 2018, despite increased inflation, worsening foreign exchange and the negative impact of the currently proposed and implemented tariffs.","While we expect the retail landscape to remain difficult, the second half impact will be less severe than the first. We expect consumer macro's to remain generally good, with U.S. market growth in line with first half levels at about 1%.","We expect core sales and our continuing businesses to sequentially improve through the back half, recovering to growth by the fourth quarter, driven by strength in innovation, positive price, as the year progresses, increased brand support versus the first half of the year and generally easier comps in the fourth quarter.","Back half launches include Calphalon Premier appliances, Onelink Safe & Sound system from First Alert, Oster DuraCeramic Air Fryer, Baby Jogger space saving City View car seat and Yankee Candle elevations, the first new vessel from Yankee in many years.","And we have big activation platforms at the back to school with the Ooey Gluey Slime Games and through holidays with Crocktober and many other brand initiatives in November and December.","We expect margins to sequentially improve as a result of strong savings programs and broad based price increases, partially offset by higher A&P. We have adjusted our 2018 full year outlook for discontinued operations and the divestiture of Waddington and Rawlings. We expect full year net sales of between $8.7 billion dollars and $9 billion, this range only include sales from our continuing operations. We expect normalized EPS of $2.45 to $2.65, reflecting a $0.20 adjustment for the impact of Waddington and Rawlings.","We expect operating cash flow of $900 million to $1.2 billion, reflecting a $250 million adjustment for the impact of Waddington and Rawlings, including the incremental cash taxes on the transactions.","While we don't usually provide quarterly guidance, the company does expect second half normalized operating margins of 12% to 12.4% in core sales growth to sequentially improve from down low single digits in Q3 to up low single digit percent in Q4.","Three factors can influence our delivery within these guidance ranges. The first factor is the performance of the Baby business in the second half of the year. Despite strong double-digit sales declines on Baby in the first half of the year, our point of sale growth is up high single digits and market share is up over 300 basis points. The team has done an excellent job navigating the turbulence of the Toys \"R\" Us liquidation, driving the desired share shift from TRU to our other customers.","Our guidance assumes we successfully shift the vast majority of the prior year TRU business to other customers and that some of the Q2 purchases that were made at liquidation price points were actually bought earlier than they would have otherwise been purchased, reading a drag on normal dynamics in the second half of the year.","In this context, we expect Baby core sales growth rates to improve in the second half of the year, but to still run below their historical run rate levels, with 2019 being a key inflection point and return to normalcy. Baby has been one of our fastest growing businesses over the last six years, and we will exit this year stronger than ever to key U.S. market. Clearly, we believe the long-term outlook for our Baby business is bright.","The second factor that could influence our delivery is the performance of our Writing business. In Writing, we're making significant progress. We expect to exit the first half of 2013 well on our way to the revised inventory targets set by new leadership and new ownership in the office superstore channel and traditional Writing channel.","In the first half of 2018, we chose to accelerate the delivery of their revised inventory targets in order to get the Writing business back into a normal rhythm of delivery in the back half of the year. We are on track to do that and our guidance assumes success.","We've also now lapped the large 2017 pipeline on Slime from Elmer\u2019s. Our back to school selling has been solid in this context with the season just kicking into high gear and were well staged with strong displays set virtually everywhere.","In 2018, we're focused on striking the right balance between driving profitable sales and winning share in the back to school window. Our guidance assumes continued improvement in margins through the second half of the year and a return to growth on Writing in the fourth quarter.","The third factor that could influence delivery in the second half of the year is the impact of the new U.S. tariffs on China's sourced goods and the retaliatory of tariffs imposed by the EU and Canada in response to the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.","As the tariffs currently stand, the annualized impact on Newell brands could be as much as $100 million. Our 2018 guidance contemplates this impact. While we\u2019ve announced incremental pricing, we\u2019re simultaneously appealing the application, the bulk of these tariffs to the US Trade Representative Office and are considering where possible alternative sourcing options.","Virtually every business has been impacted with the greatest exposure on Baby appliances and food. Two uncertainties could influence the ultimate impact. The first being our ability to land the incremental pricing, the second being the recent escalation of rhetoric, regarding a potential increase in the Chinese tariff percent from 10% to 25% and the most recent round of tariffs announced a few weeks ago.","Our current pricing in guidance assumes a 10% tariff. If the China tariffs are raised to 25% we will amend our price increases upward to reflect the full impact of the tariff.","So let me end where we started. We're living through an incredible period of change. The disruptions we're experiencing present challenges, but as importantly new opportunities for our businesses and our people through this turbulence our strategy remains unchanged.","We're in the business of building leading brands, brands valued by consumers because they play an important role in consumer\u2019s lives and valued because the products themselves are designed to perform better than competition, differentiated on the basis of their function, their form and their finish.","With these superior brands, we believe we can build leading market share positions in any country in the world because we have the scale and know how to establish superior commercial operations designed to reach consumers where they shop.","The accelerated transformation plan will focus in simplify our company around the businesses best positioned to leverage our core capabilities of product design, innovation, marketing and e-commerce. The plan will also radically simplify the company, triggering more efficient operations and improved financial outcomes.","The proceeds from the portfolio transformation will both derisk the balance sheet through the leveraging and generate tremendous value through share repurchase. This plan is in action today and will accelerate through 2018 into 2019.","As I've said, probably our most critical priority is that we reignite the core performance in the business and we expect sequential improvement through the balance of the year and into 2019.","Of course, this is only achievable through the incredible efforts of our people who have demonstrated unbelievable resilience and determination over the last year in the face of some quite difficult circumstances.","With that recognition established and a hearty thank you to our teams, hopefully heard, let's go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Polk","Hi, Steve.","Stephen Powers","Great. Good morning. Hey. Hey, Mike. So I'm sorry if I missed it. I know you've given us the numbers to calculate it, but maybe just quickly to just to clarify upfront, could you clarify what the core sales growth was for just the continuing ops in the first and second quarters.","And while I appreciate the carve out of continuing ops you know, on the sales line for the year, I guess I was hoping in the release today to get your perspective on operating cash flow and normalized EPS for the underlying business as well. So if you can articulate on that that would be great, as we look forward.","But my real question is just from what you have disclosed in the release, does the back half improvement that you're looking to achieve both on the on the sales line, but also on the operating margin line, in the first half it looks like you know, the continuing ops margins were about 250 basis points almost. And then you're looking for those to reverse and improve year-over-year in the back half.","So again the comps get easier, but just to build on what you said in your prepared remarks. Just can you expand a bit on some of the larger factors behind that second half improvement, especially given the tariff uncertainty that you called out? Thank you very much.","Michael Polk","Yeah. So continuing ops core sales in the first half of the year, I think the numbers were minus 8.6 [ph] and that was up stronger - slightly stronger Q2 - and Q1 in a worse Q2 based on the Baby liquidation issues at Toys \"R\" Us. So as you recall Toys \"R\" Us operated a large chunk of stores in the first quarter through about March 20th and from that point forward liquidated their entire fleet and their web platform.","So the front half was about minus 8.6 [ph] It's actually pretty close to where we expected it to be, quite frankly Baby and Writing in the second quarter we're slightly ahead of our forecast with Baby a little bit better than we had hoped. And then the softness on outdoor in fresh preserving were the things that were the bit of new news.","But in general core sales was where we expected it to be, given the two big things we were planning to deal with in the first half, including the TRU issue and including the issue on Writing channel - traditional channel inventory reset.","And so you know, other than the weather related stuff on fresh preserving and on the outdoor category, which contributed to a late spring there weren't many other underlying surprises in the quarter. And we - as I said we expect that to sequentially improve through the back half of the year and return to growth in the fourth quarter.","On margins in the first half, given the - Writing is a very profitable business for us, as you know gross margins - you know 50 plus, operating margins well into the 20s and the inventory dynamics in the first half of the year you had a big mix negative in the continuing businesses, which explains sort of the year-over-year margin softness in the first half of the year.","There are other factors that contributed to that including inflation beyond what we had expected. And so you know, but I think the big factor was the - you know was the fact the Writing business was down double-digits related to us pulling all that inventory out of the office channel and the distributive trade in, and given the 50 plus margins that gross and 20 plus margins in operating income the flow through that mix effect.","So that is largely behind us. I didn't make these comments in the script, but we laid out in Q1 what the shift in weeks on hand inventory targets were for each of the top 4 customers and that three of the four will be those targets by the end of the year with the impact moderating as we go through the balance of the year in the fourth one we'll get there in 2019.","So we're generally on track. That obviously has a flow through effect to every line of the continuing ops, P&L. Remember our Writing business is 30% plus of the total EBITDA of the company. So it can have a really material impact if you've got big swings, like the ones we're talking about.","Steven, on your desire for us to guide continuing ops EPS, we're not quite to the point where we're ready to do that. And so, I'd rather hold the fire on that one until we get into 2019 - the 2019 outlook. But we are giving you a number of metrics that could help you back into that number.","Clearly all the interest expense and all the overhead now comes to the continuing ops, P&L I gave you operating income guidance for the second half of the year for continuing ops. We gave you the net sales guidance on the full year, which when you have a chance to go through all the supplemental tables you'll be able to back out the first half and you should be able to come up with an operating income and - a set of assumptions and the share count based on what Ralph communicated to you and its all in the release, you should be able to kind of come to a view of the continuing ops EPS, but rather than guide that, I'd rather - have you guys kind of come to your own conclusions, a little bit too precise at this point.","Stephen Powers","Okay. That's fair enough. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Michael Polk","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Polk","Hi, Bonnie.","Joe Lackey","It's actually Joe Lackey on for Bonnie. Hi, Mike.","Michael Polk","Doesn't sound like Bonnie.","Joe Lackey","Thanks. So I was - just wanted to talk a little bit about your cash priorities and kind of curious how you're balancing deleveraging versus share repurchases. And obviously how aggressive you'll be with share repurchases, given you are buying back your stock in Q3?","And you know, I think we talked a little bit about some deleveraging looking forward in Q3, but longer term can you talk about how long you think it will take to get to your 3 to 3.5 times leverage target and you obviously are committed to maintaining your investment grade debt rating. But are the rating agencies onboard with your deleveraging plans? Thanks.","Ralph Nicoletti","Yeah. Hi, it's Ralph. You know, to your question you know, first our cash priorities haven't changed. You know, we want to support the base business with good investments there. Want to ensure the dividend stays you know kind of in the range that we've articulated between 30% and 35% and the payout ratio and deleveraging to get to the \u2013 to maintain an investment grade rating is the priority use of cash.","As I mentioned in my remarks, the vast majority of the proceeds that we just received from Waddington and the sale of Waddington and Team Sports are being applied that way. So that's our priority.","You know, within the context of the accelerated transformation plan, there's a significant amount of cash that we're going to be generating with the proceeds and we'll far out seed what we'll need to deploy to deleverage and we'll have the excess cash to make significant repurchases.","But the first priority is to get our leverage ratio in the zone that we needed - that we needed to get it to. So you know we're going to be - you know, we're over 4 right now, although on a net basis - on a net basis this quarter we\u2019re significantly below that. We're below four, almost a 3.7 [ph] on a net basis. And we're going to proceed into the - towards a 3.5 range as we move towards the end of the year, and going past that and we've been in a lot of dialogue with the rating agencies on that.","Michael Polk","Joe, some of this will depend on how quickly deals get completed and how proceeds flow. So you know, we have as I said all of our processes in flight, and Goody\u2019s well on its way. US playing cards is in the midst of its processes, Jostens well on its way and that these things will play out over the next couple of months and depending on whether we're able to complete those deals before the end of the fourth quarter and get the cash in the bank, we'll be able to do different things.","So a lot of this is really going to be a function of when cash is in hand. And clearly, we - as we stated we're prioritizing deleveraging upfront, but we have significant proceeds that are going to go to share repurchase over time and we can flex that as we go depending on where we stand with respect to the underlying performance of the business and the line of sight we have to delivery of the 3 5. And then you know at some point into the future lower.","So I think we're going to have all the room to navigate. We're prioritizing upfront deleveraging, but very quickly we get into repurchasing. And again, timing will determine exactly how this year plays out. But as you know, we're going to - our intention is to get all these deals done and cash in hand in early 2019.","And so we're going to have a lot of flexibility on how to play this in our original guidance around the balance between repurchase and deleveraging is likely to be how the story plays out.","Joe Lackey","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Michael Polk","Hey, Bill.","Bill Chappell","Good morning, Mike. just one clarification and another question, on the commentary on tariffs, I just to make sure I understand, there are $100 million of incremental kind of costs you're placing, you think you can place all that away, so I am just trying to understand, how much of that is in your back half guidance, I mean, how much of the growth or sales grow will come from incremental pricing?","Michael Polk","Yeah, and there's less than a third of that is in the back half of the year, roughly a third in the back half of the year. And we don't know yet how much of the pricing will stick and how much we will land. I think that's one of the bits of uncertainty.","But we've announced pricing ahead of the effective date of - our view of the effective date of this most recent round of tariffs in order to start the clock on customer lead times. So I think we will be effective very, very close to the implementation timetable. And I think if we're in a position where we need to amend the increase for the 25% rate versus the 10% rate that will be tricky and that will be a source of or conversation that we'll have to manage through with our customers.","But the answer of your question is roughly about a third of the cost hits this year and we're hoping we can cover it dollar for dollar through pricing. But we've given ourselves some room and cushion within our guidance to deal with the probability of some conflict around that.","Bill Chappell","Got it. And then just follow up on Coleman, I mean, I know that's an area you've been focused on trying to turn around stabilized for probably about 18 months. But I guess the comment that you had lost some listings for camping, so maybe just an update on where we stand there?","Michael Polk","Yeah, the losses on listings related to the Air Mattress business from Coleman at one particular retailer, I think we're coming through the worst of that phase on the brand as we continue to innovate. If you go back in history and Bill you know, this brand really well from your time covering the legacy companies.","But this brand has been on a really tough slide and one of our customers. I think we're really at the point now where we're beginning to bottom that out. There were a couple of vulnerabilities coming into the year, but I do think that we're going to be in a healthier position if that particular customer going forward, as we continue - as we start to innovate on the brand and premiumize it.","So I feel I feel better about that particular interface and relationship than I have for a long while. We've made great progress. A couple of other big players one in club and one in mass, and we clearly have made terrific progress on our own. DTC businesses, on Marmot, and I think there's an opportunity on Coleman going forward.","And so I think the brands forward looking view is better than it's been in a long while, but there's still a fair amount of work to do here. We're not spending a lot of money communicating around the brands at this point and we have to do more work on the margin structure in order to give ourselves room in the P&L to be able to do that.","And so I think this is a longer term project. Of course, we've got a great business in Europe, with under Campingaz, we've got a great Coleman business in Japan. We've got a really good business in other parts of the world, both from a margin and growth perspective.","But this one cell is the one that is troubling and it's a big one, but we've got the right energy, and people and program you know focused on strengthening that over time.","Bill Chappell","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Priya Ohri-Gupta.","Hey. Thank you so much for taking the call. I guess, just one point of clarification in response to a prior question. So we should assume that the original split of proceeds that you had spoken to is about 55% going towards share repurchase, should largely hold intact?","And then secondly, Ralph, I was hoping you could speak a little bit to how we should think about commercial paper balances in the context of your debt reduction plan, sort of over the course of what happened in the second quarter, as well as with the plan for third quarter. And how we should think about any possible need for a debt tender versus possibly just accelerating some of the maturities that you have in late \u201818s and early \u201919? Thank you.","Ralph Nicoletti","A few different questions in there. Let me take the back part and then I'll come back to the front part. In terms of debt and the ability to deleverage and take out certain tranches, we\u2019ll look at a mix of either taking a make hold approach or a tender.","The good news is you know, kind of where the interest rate environments moved relative to or our issue costs, so we're seeing very, very little frankly no breakage costs on much of the debt. So we're going to be able to retire - we expect to be able to reduce the debt without much breakage costs at all.","And again, the tactic of a tender or make hold, will come into play, but most everything in front of us that we're looking to reduce is on the short end of the curve. So it will be pretty inexpensive. So we're confident we could execute that cost effectively.","As it relates to thinking about commercial paper, you know, frankly right now we actually have none issued, we paid off some of that in the third quarter. And you know, we'll take a look at you know the need on commercial paper as we move into the front half of \u201919, because we'll have some more seasonal needs on - as we build inventory.","But I think importantly you know, we also have a 1.250 billion [ph] revolver that's in place that backstops our commercial paper program. So plenty of liquidity. If you think about it because we're going to be retiring debt on the short end of the curve and we have a revolver in place, as well as good accounts receivable securitization program. So we're set on that front.","Michael Polk","And then on the balance of repurchase to debt. Yeah, the answer is yes. That's the right number to use and we have really a significant amount of flexibility to - like to tweak that one way or the other. Our orientation when we get the leverage ratios down to where we said we were going to be in the commitments we've made and then there are all kinds of other paths to repurchase.","Remember the business is generating a fair amount of operating cash flow. We're not carrying any short term debt now. So you know, we're going to - and we get tons of proceeds from December through probably March. So we're going to have all kinds of flexibility to play this in multiple ways.","But I think the right planning stance, as you build out your models and try to figure out EPS dilution if that's what you're trying to navigate, is that the original guidance is what - is what we expect to be able to execute.","Ralph Nicoletti","And our execution plans have the flexibility to flex that number depending on the business environment. So will - that could modify, so like for instance, right now you know, we're putting the majority of the proceeds - the vast majority proceeds are being used towards debt repayment, and in aggregate the ratio that Mike alluded to is what we're looking at over the total program.","But the significant amount of proceeds come - coming in and give us the flexibility to ensure that we hit the leverage targets that we have and have then the ability to repurchase shares in the market, we\u2019ll deployed M&A at some future point in time.","Priya Ohri-Gupta.","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And if I can just ask a quick follow up on that. So given that you've repaid your CP balance entirely, that's about 700 million or so from under the first quarter. Should we include that in the debt reduction number that you've articulated? Or should we view that as through separate from that? Thank you.","Michael Polk","Yeah, the amount that we repaid from the beginning of the quarter, I wouldn't - beginning of the year, I wouldn't include because we pay some of that down sort of naturally through cash flows in the business. So I would just say that the - you know we've paid a little over $800 million already against the accounts receivable securitization, as I mentioned and then we're expecting $900 million in the third quarter and the CP will be included in that.","And then we'll see how the balance of the year flows. But we're not expecting to issue any more CP beyond what we currently exited the second quarter with.","Priya Ohri-Gupta.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Michael Polk","Hi, Nik.","Russ Miller","Good morning. Hey good morning, Mike. This is Russ Miller on for Nik.","Michael Polk","Hey, Ross.","Russ Miller","We want to ask there on tariff, appreciate the color you shared in your prepared remarks and following upon Bill's question, wondering if you could share any additional details on the puts and takes here, how confident you are on the appeal you mentioned or being able to ship production versus taking pricing. Any additional color on the timing of having any better understanding of the situation? And then I have a follow up if you don't mind.","Michael Polk","Well, you know, the answer to your question is very different business-by-business, we have some businesses that would be very, very difficult to shift production. Something like Baby gear we wouldn't want to do that because of compliance and safety related issues.","We've got a 33 plus year relationship with our supply partner. So we're less likely to do that \u2013 and something on a business like that. On some of our other businesses there is flexibility to move sourcing relationships. The ability to do that in the moment is a little bit difficult.","So there's likely a lag effect. So I wouldn't think that there's a major opportunity in 2018 to accommodate the tariffs that have been put in effect as of July and the ones that are coming as of September. But beyond that time zone into \u201819 there are some possibilities in some of the businesses.","With respect to pricing, I think it's too early to know exactly how much of the pricing will land, but we're not going to - we're not going to - we're not going to hesitate to take the price up.","Russ Miller","That's helpful. And then as a follow up and if you don't mind, on Writing destocking, can you share some more details on where the pressure is coming from and what would the implications be on that potential deal of Staples acquiring Essendant? We understand\u2026","Ralph Nicoletti","Sure.","Michael Polk","This is not - the inventory destocking and Writing is not the classic type of inventory destocking that you might hear people talk about, you might have even heard us talk about. This is a function of new ownership and new leadership coming into virtually every one of the big office superstore customers and into virtually every one of the big distributed to trade customers and that new leadership and new ownership resetting their core metrics and how they're going to measure success.","And that has created a set of inventory metrics and we saw on hand targets that they've set for their total businesses that we need to now shift and adapt to. And so that began last year and we're in the midst of it. We accelerated the big hits associated with pulling inventory out of their networks in the first half of the year to try to get as close to those targets at the inflection point between Q2 and Q3.","We got a long way there. We've got more work to do in 2018, but as I said at 3 out of the 4 customers, big customers, we should be at their targeted levels by the end of 2018 with the fourth trailing into 2019.","With respect to Staple's and Essendant, we'll see how that plays out. But clearly you know, that will create some more headwinds I would expect, but not insurmountable. The big change is the one we're dealing with now where some of these - some of our partners are taking 10 weeks of supply out of their targets.","So it's a huge inventory shift and that - as I said it's largely behind us and as we go forward we'll deal with the normal dynamics associated with the consolidation potential consolidation of players like Staples and Essendant store closures, all sorts of other things that contributed on an ongoing basis to inventory pressure.","Russ Miller","Thank you very much, Mike.","Michael Polk","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thank you.","Michael Polk","Hi, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Good morning. So I was curious if we could just talk a little bit about the go forward strategy for the businesses that you're going to continue to play in. If you just maybe go through like the big ones, what as you look forward do you think about doing differently than you've done to date?","So whether it's from an innovation agenda standpoint, whether it's you know, interactions with retailers, just there is - you know we talked a lot about the kind of what you're exiting and we've talked about simplifying the overall organization. But I still feel a little bit unsure about what if anything might be changing and you know kind of the businesses that you're going to you know stay of course on, that will be really helpful.","Michael Polk","Yeah. Well, look I think it's grounded in a couple of core beliefs. We believe that brands and innovation matter more today than they ever have before. I know there is a number of theories out there about the fact that brands have less leverage. I don't think that's the case. I think it really is as important as it's ever been to strengthen our brands both in terms of positioning, communication and in product design and the presentation and activation of those brands through all of our channels, whether it's brick and mortar or e-commerce, and so that is really, really important.","Given the pace of change we need to operate more efficiently as we bring ideas to market and effectively as we bring ideas to market. So there is within the company a need to strengthen the connectedness and the alignment around the outcomes we seek in the market between those that are responsible for the strategic development for our businesses and those that are responsible for commercial activation. And we've made changes in our design coming out of the second quarter into the third quarter to address some of those opportunities.","So we are going to continue to lean our shoulder into our brands agenda, our innovation agenda and our product design agenda and that will matter more and more over time.","How we activate that Lauren through the different channels we compete in and is really important because more and more of our business is shifting online. Today in the continuing operations globally roughly 15% of our business globally is e-commerce based. So that's either direct to consumer, that's pure play or that's through our retail dotcom platforms.","And I think that probably understates it a bet because there are dynamics out there that get measured as brick and mortar sales that are really e-commerce sales. An example of that Amazon would be 3p sales or third party sales. And so I think our 15% is probably a little bit understated.","And so how we bring our ideas to market and to the consumer has to change a lot. That's why we've created an enterprise wide e-commerce capability and that's why our marketers are shifting more and more of their spending and energy to try to prompt consideration in the way consumers are receiving messages today, which is typically online and are trying to learn different tactics that drive that consideration and convert it to purchase.","And so there's a whole new space and sphere of marketing activities and skills required to unlock the consumer connection to brands. And that's going to continue to change and evolve into our investment profile, both our overhead and our programming is going to continue to shift to that area.","So that's something we've been on for the last year and a half or so, but it's really beginning to get traction and we're going to continue to measure return on investment in those spaces, relative to return on investment in our more traditional marketing channels to ensure we're maximizing the revenue yield on the programming dollars that we're spending.","So clearly brands and innovation continues. We've got to get greater commercial impact through the investments we're making and maximize the return on investment on those R&D dollars and brand marketing dollars. Our return on investment measured is growth yield for dollar spent and we've got to shift both our infrastructure and our skill set and our programming to this new space where the tactics and approaches to marketing you know are changing.","And that's an investment in people, that's an investment in capabilities and that is a lot of work shifting the infrastructure of the company towards those activities in a way from the more traditional activities, as the channel shift continues to unfold.","And then the big opportunity for the company longer term is international deployment. And while we've done a good job in Latin America in a number of our businesses and we're doing a reasonable job in Europe, we really haven't fully deployed the portfolio as broadly as we could and that's - you know that's a future opportunity once we come through this period of change with portfolio and org.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. And that international piece Mike, I was actually going to ask about that. You're seeing that as like a 2020 and forward, is that something that sort of accelerate in \u201919\u2026","Michael Polk","Yeah, we\u2019ve got \u2013 yeah, I think it's not - it's not a big play for us in 2019. I think it's more 2020 onward. We're doing things in India and in China right now in the Writing businesses. We have obviously a huge appliance business in Latin America. But we actually don't play in every Latin country. There is sort of filling geographies in certain of these businesses, and then there is whitespace work to be done in \u201819 to set up \u201920.","Big businesses that have a lot of potential are Writing, Baby and to a lesser degree the Appliance businesses where there are unique propositions that we can bring to market.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. And what happened with Home Fragrances in India this quarter, that was, I mean, it was called out and there's been some significant infrastructure investment in that business historically for legacy\u2026","Michael Polk","Yeah\u2026","Lauren Lieberman","And so just kind of any update on that in particular?","Michael Polk","Sure. I think that's right. I mean, obviously we've built the priority acquisition, the product [ph] factory was built and we've got a good and big business there. There's a series of things we're doing to ensure that our tactics across the U.K. and continental Europe are profitable tactics.","We've made choices to pull back on certain things that just weren't sustainable and that's had a consequence to our performance in Europe. But it's one of those things that is the right thing to do to set up the brand for the long-term.","We're very bullish about the business in Europe. We're going to bring - we're bringing WoodWick to Europe next year. So we have lots of opportunity there, we're just in a an inflection period, last actually couple of quarters have been tough quarters as we pulled back on tactics that weren\u2019t really sustainable.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, thank you so much Mike.","Michael Polk","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Mike. So first I was hoping to understand what you're seeing from POS growth perspective and also what your market share performance was during the quarter.","And then the category growth that 1% seems soft to me, I think at least versus what you guys saw last year in the category. So I was curious what's weighing on the categories you compete in?","Michael Polk","Yes. So category growth was pretty much in line with what we saw in Q1, but you're right, slowed versus what we saw in the back half of last year. I think part of that is our spending levels are more conservative this year. And we were pulling back on a number of different tactics that were less profitable for the sake of margin development. And so it was the leader in the markets that that can have an impact on category growth.","In terms of market share, we've got really very different outcomes by business, as I told you, we got over - we delivered over 300 basis points of share growth on the Baby Gear business in the in the first half of the year and that was even stronger in the quarter.","We've got very good growth on share growth on Home Fragrance, as we move from our retail store footprint to a more wholesale sale based model with triple digit share growth in Home Fragrance. We've got good momentum on our foods market share performance and then some weaker spots. Appliances has been weak in cooking where we're playing from behind and express cooking. We launched Crock Pot Express last year, but Instant Pot came into market in 2010. And so we're playing on the back foot there. But the innovation levels are increasing. We're launching a fourth quart and an eight quart version of Crock Pot Express in the in the fourth quarter and that should help.","Cookware shares have been really strong. The stackable's launch last year has been a positive. So within that appliances and cookare, cookware is strong, cooking appliances weak, coffee weak, blending a little bit better and that we have a whole series of other beverage appliances that are doing quite well.","So I mean, it's a very different profile by business. The POS tracks to you know, those share numbers and in aggregate POS was probably a little bit weaker, although you know, I\u2019ve decided not to be quoting those numbers anymore because everybody tries to triangulate specifically on them, but the POS based on the share performance is probably a little bit weaker in the second quarter than the first.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael Polk","Hi, Olivia.","Olivia Tong","Hi. Three questions actually. First on brand support, just if you could give us an idea in terms of order of magnitude of the increase that you're expecting - that you're putting in place in the second half, particularly which categories brands it's most concentrated in?","Michael Polk","Sure.","Olivia Tong","And then second, I guess, can you just give us what the core sales comps looks like, look like for Q3 and Q4?","Michael Polk","Yeah, sure. So you know, I think maybe I\u2019ll - Nancy will kick me under the table, but I'll just give you another metric. Sophie is probably in the other room about to come charging in and told me not to do this. But I think it's helpful for you as you think about the continuing business going forward.","Our advertising promotion ratios and you know, you've heard me historically talk about the fact that you know, we want to spend between 4% and upward about 5% of revenue in A&P On the continuing businesses in the back half of the year we're sort of in the mid 4s as a percentage of revenue and you should expect us to be in that general zone as we go forward with a desire to increase A&P ratios in \u201919, \u201820 and \u201921, depending on the progress we make on margin delivery. But we're in the mid 4s and continuing operations in that mid to high 4s actually in the back half of the year.","Our advertising dollars are going to be focused on the news. You know, we've learned over time that you don't get as higher return on investment when you spend on anthematic [ph] campaigns, but you can get a pretty big impact behind new ideas.","So Yankee Candle elevations which is this new premium vessel that we're launching, that's going to get advertising support. Our FoodSaver business, which is really responsive to advertising is getting advertising support in the back half of the year. Elmer\u2019s slime which is a big act, we've got this Ooey Gluey slime games initiative that's getting advertising support in the back half of the year. Calphalon appliances which is a big launch of a line of premium appliances that will get advertising support in the back of the year.","So our money flows to ideas is sort of the core principle that underpins how we allocate A&P and obviously our goal is to get more money behind the brands over time. I'm happy with the A&P ratios and the continuing businesses in the back half of the year. But you know, as our innovation funnel begins to materialize in the market we're going to have the appetite to spend more.","But we've got to give ourselves room in the P&L to be able to afford to do that. And our capacity to spend will be limited by the speed with which we get the cost out of the business and get the gross margins up.","Olivia Tong","Got it. And then just the core sales comps in Q3 and Q4 and then when it - and then when it comes the contribution from pricing, does your outlook assume you're successful in implementing all the price increases that you were looking for or there's some challenges in full implementation baked into your expectations?","Michael Polk","Let me answer your first one, I'm sorry I didn't answer that question. I wasn't ignoring it. Comp sales actually get easier as we go through from Q3 to Q4. Q3 is about the same as what we've been experiencing up until now, a little bit softer comp versus Q2 \u201917, but Q4 things get easier in Q1, Q2, obviously will be even easier than Q4.","So Q3 is sort of a - there's not a lot of benefit to be had relative to prior year in Q3, but Q4 starts to - the pressure starts to ease on the comps in Q1 and Q2 the same so of \u201819.","So I think that's how you should think about the next four quarters. Q3 more competitive, Q4, Q1 Q2 a little easier and more breathing room. What was your second - your added questions Olivia?","Olivia Tong","On pricing, just in terms of what\u2026","Michael Polk","Pricing. Yes, so - our divisions are always very bullish on their ability to land price. And so you know, we price dollar for dollar to the cost moves, whether it's inflation or whether it's - or whether it's something like tariffs and obviously we're doing a lot of work on core productivity. And if there's a competitive issue we won't screw up our price \u2013 our relative price points versus competition through pricing.","But the divisions are always quite bullish about their ability to land pricing. You know, we tend to hedge some of that back at headquarters and our guidance contemplates a bit of an offset at headquarters versus what the divisions are assuming for the back half of the year.","Olivia Tong","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Michael Polk","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","Hey, Mike. I wanted to pick up on some of the channel dynamics, so you don't have to be sort of repetitive and repeat to the earlier question with respect to some of the issues with kitchen appliances at Wal-Mart.","But with respect to Wal-Mart though the Nielsen data which you and I have had conversations in the past and the view has been that it's not very representative of the business. But I guess like more recently you know, maybe it has to some degree and understanding it's not picking up particularly online where you guys are doing very well. But it does seem to be more representative, I guess more recently.","Can you talk about some of the challenges there? Because it seems more broad based Mike than just what's going on in kitchen appliances or maybe you know, you guys were a little bit slow with some of the innovation, but the Writing business is struggling, some of the food storage business is struggling and it's been pretty broad based and naturally you know retailers want to grow in all channels, as you do, not just online.","So can you talk about some of the dynamics there, maybe where you guys need to be a little bit sharper, a little bit quicker, is Wal-Mart deemphasizing some of these categories leaning more in on private label and how do you feel like your position here going forward with your biggest customer? Thank you.","Michael Polk","Well Kevin, you've got to win with Wal-Mart they are our biggest customer, as you said and we are winning with Wal-Mart in certain categories and having a tougher time in others, appliances being an example of that. I mentioned coffee earlier and I\u2019ve mentioned the Express cooking arena.","So I don't think it's a question of being late. We're playing - we were playing catch up, as I said Instant Pot launched in 2010 long before we got involved in the appliance business. Our choice to accelerate Crock Pot into Express cooking was done last year, having owned the business for about a year or so I thought our reaction time was pretty darn quick. But it's never good to play from behind. You always want to be the first mover.","In Food Storage, we're doing fine. And Fresh Preserving we're doing fine, in Writing. We\u2019re doing fine, in Home Fragrance we're doing great, in Baby we're doing fine. So I think your characterization of how we're doing in Wal-Mart isn't representative of how we see the data and with the exception of you know, I think your observations about appliances are right on. And as I said in outdoor where Coleman lost the brand advantage to Ozark Trail probably 2009, 2010, again you're playing - we're playing from behind. But as I said, I think the view forward is healthier than it's been in a while.","So I think you've got to win at Wal-Mart, you're right about that. I hope you are not hearing my comments and inferring from them that I'm not committed to a brick and mortar that would be sort of absurd if you were because 85% of our revenue is still brick and mortar based and the vast majority of our infrastructure is still brick and mortar based and we're doing a fine job in many brick and mortar customers. So you've got to win in both and you've got to win share everywhere, irrespective of the category dynamics.","So you know that's the only measure of success. And I'd say we're - we've got very positive outcomes in certain categories and on appliances and outdoor in the one customer that you're focused on which is an important one for us, our largest you know, not so good. But these things don't turn overnight. And they know - they will be addressed over time through brand work and through the innovation agenda.","And you know, until you've got the right ammunition and the right arrows in the quiver you're going to be vulnerable and that is certainly how we've been since the Jarden acquisition in those two businesses that you've mentioned.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. Thanks, Mike. Good luck.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Polk for closing remarks.","Michael Polk","Well, I'd just like to close the way I always do which is with a thank you to our team. As I said in the script you know, I'm always amazed at how resilient and determined you are to deliver through what has been a difficult period of time and a difficult set of circumstances, but your determination, your drive and your grittiness to prevail through these tough moments are one of the core assets of the company. And I just want to thank you for your passion and your support.","Operator","A replay of today's call will be available later today on our website newellbrands.com. This concludes our conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After a brief discussion by management, we will open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] In order to stay within the time scheduled for the call, please limit yourself to one question during the Q&A section. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellbrands.com on the Investor Relations\u2019 homepage under Events and Presentations.","I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Newell Brands 2019 second quarter conference call. Chris Peterson, our Interim CEO and CFO will be hosting the call today. Before we begin, let me remind you that this conference call will include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. I refer you to cautionary language available in our press release and in our SEC filings that describe these risks.","During the call, we will also use certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we refer to as normalized measures. We believe this supplementary information is useful to investors, although it should not be considered superior to the measures presented in accordance with GAAP. You will find reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in today's earnings release tables as well as on the Investor Relations website and of course, in the company's SEC filings.","I'll now turn our call over to Chris.","Chris Peterson","Thanks, Nancy and good morning, everyone. The second quarter results we announced this morning reflect strong progress across all key metrics. We are making decisive and strategic choices to turn the company around and drive shareholder value, as we work to transform Newell Brands into the leading next-generation consumer products company.","Results were in line or ahead of our expectations on all key metrics. Four out of seven continuing divisions delivered core sales growth in the quarter. We were ahead of plan on operating margins, driven by better than expected gross margins and lower overhead costs. Productivity and cost controls are taking firm hold and tracking ahead of schedule.","Normalized earnings per share benefited from pricing, productivity and mix in addition to disciplined cost management. Operating cash flow improved $180 million versus the year ago quarter to positive $191 million, reflecting strong execution on working capital initiatives. While it's still early in the year, the progress we've made to-date on the working capital side as well as tax planning initiatives, give us the confidence to raise our full year outlook on cash flow from operations.","Before going through the results, I want to provide some context on the progress we're making on the turnaround plan. Over the last few months, we've developed a bold and aggressive turnaround plan focused on five priorities: returning the company to profitable core sales growth; improving operating margins through productivity and overhead cost savings; accelerating cash conversion cycle through working capital transformation; strengthening the portfolio of brands and businesses in which we compete; and building a winning team by significantly improving employee engagement.","On the first, focused profitable growth, we are starting to see green shoots across the divisions. We returned to core sales growth in four of our seven divisions this quarter. POS is now growing at our top four customers in both Q2 and year-to-date. Our e-commerce business grew high single-digits in the second quarter, and we returned to core sales growth in the international business. We've got more work to do to expand the success across the broader range of customers and categories, but we're encouraged by the progress we're making.","To win today in a fast-moving omnichannel world, it is critical to engage the consumer at all moments that matter in the path to purchase. An omnichannel marketing is a crucial link in that journey. To that end, we have undertaken a concerted effort to retool marketing and build out our social and digital marketing capability, creating a digital-first mindset. For example, among other things, we've now created a social and influencer marketing playbook and increased influencer marketing spend 4x versus 2018, with 30 influencer events planned for the back half of the year. We think these initiatives will be additive to our efforts to improve purchase intent for our products.","On our second strategic priority; optimizing the cost structure, we are executing on a number of cost reduction and simplification initiatives. For example, during the first half of the year, we took out more than 12,000 SKUs across the organization or about 13% with concrete plans in place to get to the 50% target by the end of next year. We've also made good progress on moving obsolete inventory which helps both our working capital and SKU reduction efforts.","Over the past several months, we've successfully implemented three SAP conversions; the US Fresh Preserving business; the Coleman business in Australia, New Zealand and the Appliances & Cookware business in EMEA. We have another SAP conversion scheduled to go live in Appliances & Cookware in Asia shortly.","Next year, we'll tackle the remaining six implementations and by the end of next year, more than 95% of the company's sales are expected to be on two ERP systems. We continue to make progress on reducing systems\u2019 complexity and standardizing systems across the organization. We are on track to cut IT business applications by 85% by the end of next year, as we remove redundancy; simplify the IT footprint and reduce cost.","We also implemented a new e-commerce digital technology strategy, through which we are consolidating over 12 different architectures into a single new technology stack with superior capabilities and new tools to support the marketing reinvention effort. As part of this process, we've made significant headway and rationalizing the number of sites that we have, with the goal of converting the sites for the vast majority of the company\u2019s brands toward being more focused on showcasing new product innovation and brand storytelling, rather than highly discounted commerce and fulfillment sites.","This approach provides significant cost and complexity reduction and a better experience for consumers. We are also taking steps to simplify the supply chain. During the second quarter, we announced the closing of three manufacturing plants and 10 distribution centers, representing an 8% reduction in the company's supply chain footprint. Driving improvement in our cash conversion cycle is our third strategic priority. We took strategic actions to accelerate the company's cash conversion cycle, which culminated in a stronger than planned cash flow delivery this quarter.","On accounts receivable, we entered into a more cost effective program for accelerating receipt of payments and we improved customer terms compliance by strengthening the company's deduction resolution process, thus clearing customer deductions faster.","On the payables front, our procurement team has renegotiated contracts with hundreds of our top suppliers and have extended payment terms for more than 2,000 of our smaller suppliers to benchmark levels, which in total represent roughly one-third of the company's spend. Negotiations with strategic suppliers continue to take place and as mentioned, the progress made on SKU reduction benefits inventory management.","Relating to our goal of strengthening the portfolio, the company closed on the Process Solutions and Rexair transactions in the second quarter and entered into a definitive agreement to sell the US Playing Cards to Cartamundi Group, with that transaction expected to close in the second half of the year. Utilizing proceeds from the completed divestitures, the company reduced net debt by $777 million in the second quarter.","We also announced an update to our divestiture program this morning. Following an in-depth review, the company has decided to keep the Rubbermaid Commercial Products business. As I was able to learn more about this business and spend time with the team, I have a strong conviction that RCP will create more value as part of our ongoing portfolio.","The commercial business has a leading competitive positioning across attractive, large and growing categories and the RCB - RCP brand commands one of the highest perceived quality scores in Newell\u2019s portfolio. It's responsive to branding and innovation with product differentiation being a key driver of success. It generates strong cash flow with margins that are accretive to the total company average. And it is accretive to both earnings per share and cash flow in 2020 and beyond.","We still plan to pursue divestitures of Mapa\/Spontex and Quickie and we expect to be in a position to close those transactions by the end of this year, at which point the accelerated transformation plan will be complete. We currently project that the remaining divestitures that are yet to be completed, would generate between $675 million and $775 million in after-tax proceeds. All divestiture proceeds generated in 2019 will be directed toward debt pay down as we are prioritizing and strengthening the balance sheet and maintaining our investment grade rating.","As a result of our decision to keep RCP, we now expect to attain a gross debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of less than 4 times by the end of this year and reach 3.5 times by the end of 2020. We have spoken to the rating agencies about this change and shared with them the strategic rationale for the decision, as well as the financial ramifications. And our view with the RCP business being accretive to margins, earnings per share and cash flow, the decision to keep the business strengthens the company for the mid to long-term.","And lastly, but perhaps most importantly, we are focused on building the team and reigniting employee engagement. The senior leadership team has become more visible and connected with the organization through a number of face-to-face meetings, global town halls, webcasts and video communications and through our employee app.","As a result of these efforts, and of the excitement generated by early signs of the turnaround taking hold, employee sentiment is improving. Based on our tracking of internal feedback, employee engagement has increased between 25% and 40% versus the year ago period on certain key measures, such as confidence in leadership, and the future of Newell. There's more work to do here too, but this type of progress is encouraging.","On this engagement front, we made a strategic announcement this morning, that we have decided to move the corporate headquarters to Atlanta. Three of our seven operating divisions; Writing; Baby and Food, representing over half of the company's profits are based in Atlanta today, with approximately 1,100 professional employees located there. I see significant value in moving the Executive Management Team closer to the business, as we endeavor to improve operating performance.","In addition, I believe working in closer physical proximity will promote better teamwork and communication and provide more opportunities for career advancement for our people. The move generates overhead cost savings, although that is not the primary driver of the decision. We will be transitioning to the new headquarters over the next few months and look forward to hosting many of you in Atlanta and 2020.","Earlier this week, the company announced that the Board has appointed Ravi Saligram as Newell Brands\u2019 new CEO and Board Member effective October 2nd. I assume you've all had the opportunity to read the release, so I won't take time today to walk through the details of his impressive resume. I will comment that I've met Ravi and we've had multiple conversations since.","My remit during the transition is to continue to drive forward with the transformation of our business with a focus on the five priorities I shared earlier. My conversations with Ravi and the Board have all been supportive of those goals. I look forward to partnering with Ravi and the rest of the leadership team to further our transformation agenda and drive value creation.","Let me turn now to a detailed review of our Q2 financial results. Net from continuing operations declined 3.9% versus last year to $2.1 billion, reflecting a nearly 2% headwind from foreign exchange, the closing of more than 70 Yankee Candle retail stores year-to-date, and a 1.1% decline in core sales, which was in line with our outlook.","With four out of seven divisions growing in Q2, including; Writing; Baby; Home Fragrance and Connected Home & Security, we are pleased with the sequential progress the team is delivering. Productivity, price increases and mix more than offset the negative impact of inflation, tariffs and foreign exchange, driving a 50 basis point improvement and normalized gross margin to 35.6%.","In recent months, the company has significantly ramped up its efforts surrounding productivity with the funnel of projects up 33% versus year ago, and continuing to build. Overhead costs were down a 110 basis points versus year ago, driven by tight cost controls and restructuring actions. Strong gross margin performance in combination with the meaningful reduction in overheads drove 160 basis point improvement and normalized operating margin to 11.3% which was ahead of our plan.","We are moving quickly to drive the turnaround of Newell Brands and optimize the cost structure with progress evident in the first half results and additional work streams underway. Debt pay down over the past year resulted in net interest expense savings of $42 million versus last year.","The normalized tax rate was 25.4%; normalized net income from discontinued operations was $69 million, below 282 million in the year ago quarter, reflecting loss contribution from seven completed divestitures, which include; the Waddington; Rawlings; Goody; Pure Fishing; Jostens; Process Solutions and Rexair businesses.","At the end of Q2, we had 424 million diluted shares. The company delivered normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.45, which was ahead of our guidance range due to better than expected operational performance. Normalize diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 45% versus year-over-year to $0.29.","Now on to segment results. Core sales for the Learning and Development segment grew 3.5%. Core sales growth was broad-based as Baby returned to growth this quarter, having fully lapped the disruptions stemming from the TRU bankruptcy. The team is reenergized and focused on sustaining this momentum with exciting new product launches hitting the shelves, including a full re-launch of the iconic, Baby Jogger and City Mini platform.","The Writing division maintained its core sales growth momentum, our back-to-school selling shifted slightly earlier than expected in line with the timing of last year. We think our brands are well positioned to win during the back-to-school season. This division is among our first adopters of the marketing pivot toward influencers, with exciting activity planned in the coming weeks and months.","Core sales for the Food & Appliances segment declined 7.1%. As anticipated, the Food division was negatively impacted by the shift of orders on the Fresh Preserving business into the first quarter, ahead of the April 1st implementation of SAP. The Appliance & Cookware division remained under pressure.","Although we are seeing some traction in terms of POS and share development from recent new product activity, including the refresh of the Mr. Coffee line, we need to broaden the innovation pipeline across the entire portfolio, which will take some time.","Core sales for the Home & Outdoor Living segment were down 1.1%. The Home Fragrance business reached an important inflection point and returned to core sales growth, driven by strong performance in EMEA, and distribution gains for WoodWick across a number of retailers.","The Connected Home & Security division maintained its growth momentum, core sales for the Outdoor & Rec division were down year-over-year, but now that the business has lapped major distribution losses, we are starting to see a sequential improvement and share trends as well as in POS.","Moving on to cash flow. The company maintained the momentum from the first quarter and generated operating cash flow of $191 million, an increase of $180 million year-over-year and ahead of plan. This improvement reflects benefits from the strategic actions taken to improve working capital, including negotiation of more favorable payment terms as well as a decrease in receivables.","Year-to-date, operating cash flow is $380 million better than a year ago. As we have stated previously, we are still in early innings of working capital transformation and continue to see significant opportunity ahead and unlocking the cash generative power of the company.","Let's now turn the guidance. First, let's talk about what changed in our 2018 base year results. In the press release, we have provided Supplemental Information which shows the impact of including RCP and continuing operations for Q3 and full year of 2018. As you can see, that change is accretive to net sales and operating margin, but has a slight negative impact on normalized EPS.","Moving the RCP business from discontinued operations to continuing operations, requires the company to restart depreciation expense because, in accordance with GAAP, assets held for sale are not depreciated. The depreciation expense for RCP is approximately $35 million on an annualized basis, or $0.06 per share. The move has no impact on operating cash flow. Our updated outlook for Q3 and full year 2019 will be based on a comparison with the metrics in the supplemental schedule.","As for our outlook for Q3 and full year 2019, we will report RCP as a part of continuing operations beginning in the third quarter. Our revised guidance reflects the incremental annualized non-cash depreciation expense of approximately $35 million for RCP. Our previous guidance did not include this expense. With that frame of reference, I'll walk through our updated outlook for Q3 and full year results.","For 2019, the company expects to deliver net sales of approximately $9.1 billion to $9.3 billion, reflecting a low single-digit decrease in core sales growth and a roughly 150 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Normalized operating margin is expected to grow 20 basis points to 60 basis points year-over-year to 10.4% to 10.8%. This outlook continues to assume that price increases productivity and a reduction in overhead costs, offset the unfavorable impact from inflation, tariffs and currency, while simultaneously funding additional A&P investment.","We expect a normalized effective tax rate for continuing operations in the low double-digit range and normalize diluted earnings per share for the total company between $1.50 and $1.65. Other than the incremental depreciation expense, there is no additional impact on EPS from the decision to retain the RCP business, as we had previously assumed it would be sold at the end of the year. So in effect, we are increasing our pre-tax income guidance on the underlying business by about $35 million to offset the incremental non-cash depreciation expense. This outlook assumes no share repurchases in 2019.","We are raising our forecast for cash flow from operations by $300 million to a range of $600 million to $800 million, reflecting better than anticipated progress on the working capital side as well as anticipated benefits from additional tax planning initiatives. This updated forecast includes approximately $50 million in cash taxes and divestiture related transaction costs, and about $200 million of restructuring and related cash costs.","As we look to the third quarter, we currently expect net sales in the $2.42 billion to $2.47 billion range, with core sales declining 2% to 4% and a nearly 100 basis point drag from currency. This is in-line with our annual guidance and reflects a sequential improvement from the first half of the year and two-year stacked core sales growth trends. We have plan for a 100 basis point to 130 basis point year-over-year decline in normalized operating margin to a 11. 9% to 12.2% as a significant ramp up in A&P spending in Q3 will more than offset sustained progress on overheads.","The normalized effective tax benefit for continuing operations is estimated in the high single-digit percentage range, reflecting expected discrete tax benefits. This yields normalized diluted earnings per share for the total company within a $0.55 to $0.60 range with a diluted share count that similar to Q2.","In closing, we are encouraged by the broad progress the organization is making towards transforming Newell Brands into the leading next-generation consumer products company. We remain steadfast in our ambition to drive shareholder value creation through a return to core sales growth ahead of industry averages, operating margin expansion and an improved cash conversion cycle. We are on track to complete the divestiture program by year end.","We expect to deliver sequentially improved core sales and operating margin results versus 2018, while overcoming significant external headwinds from inflation, tariffs and foreign exchange. And simultaneously, continuing to support the company\u2019s brands and innovation in the marketplace. We are also taking concerted steps to strengthen the company\u2019s working capital metrics and drive operational discipline across the organization. I\u2019m encouraged by the early progress and excited about the opportunity before us.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Thanks. Good morning.","Chris Peterson","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Chappell","First, welcome back to Atlanta. I\u2019m not sure New Jersey has been great for your stock price, so I think much better coming back to Georgia.","Chris Peterson","Thanks.","Bill Chappell","Second, just a little bit more around Rubbermaid Commercial decision. And just trying to understand, I thought over the past, I guess a year, a year and a half part of the reason why that was taking longer to actually sell, was, it had to be split off, you had to do a lot of work to kind of carve it out and so didn't know if there, you now have to reverse engineer, bring it back within the organization and then also a little bit more thoughts on, was it just you weren't seeing offers that were of the right value or you really felt like this was an integrated part of the rest of which is more a consumer-facing business?","Chris Peterson","Yeah. Let me try to provide a little bit more perspective on the decision. So, the Rubbermaid Commercial Products division, as I mentioned, is one of our strongest businesses. If you look at the brand equity scores, the Rubbermaid brand is in the top three of the company's brands relative to the perception quality scores with consumers.","It was always slated as part of the ATP plan to be one of the last divestitures that the company marketed. And in fact, the company never started really the marketing effort for the RCP business, so we didn't take it to market. The good news about it is, as we got into it, because it's a strong business that generates strong operating margins, strong cash flow, we believe that keeping it in the portfolio is going to drive significant value creation and let me just provide a couple of statistics.","So what you can see from our updated guidance is that, keeping the RCP business improves the operating margin of the company for 2019 by 110 basis points, which is driving the improvement in our operating margin guidance. Additionally, if you look at the implied guidance for continuing operations, keeping the RCP business in the portfolio drives our earnings per share from continuing operations for 2019 up by almost 40%. So it is a huge improvement in the underlying earnings per share from continuing operations to keep the business versus sell the business.","We never got fully started on the separation activities. And so we believe that the - just that the now that we made the decision to keep the business, we think there is some opportunity to drive additional cost savings in the -- primarily in the supply chain of that business. But it will eliminate the need for us to do a lot of separation work that we would have had to do, if we continue down the path of selling the business.","Bill Chappell","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you. Good morning. So my question just following out to Bill\u2019s question on Rubbermaid Commercial. So what is the run rate? I'm assuming that obviously the top line was not attractive and besides the fact that it's not consumer-facing. I get the point about margins obviously. But what is the top line growth as we stand right now, and where you think you can take it? And if you can give us like you gave \u2013 Chris you gave a good sense of what's happening at the Appliances business, but where you're going to think that you can reinvest part of this margin into the business and where you think we can see stabilization of the trends on the top line for that one? Thank you.","Chris Peterson","Yeah, so moving the Rubbermaid Commercial business back into continuing operations, we kept our guidance for core sales growth for 2019 the same, so it doesn't really have an impact on the core sales growth guidance for the company.","Our guidance at the beginning of the year was for core sales to be down low single-digits. Now that we're including it in core sales, we\u2019re maintaining that guidance of down low single-digits. So we don't see the decision to include Rubbermaid Commercial back into continuing operations having a material impact.","That being said, within the Rubbermaid Commercial Products business, there's really two different businesses. There's a commercial business, which represents about two-thirds of the business that has been growing over the last number of years at or above the rate of GDP, and that's the business that is very strong, very profitable and we see strong growth prospects going forward for.","There's also a smaller part of the business that's a consumer-facing business focused on Outdoor and Garage and Refuse, and that part of the business is a lower profit margin business that we've been focusing on rightsizing. And I think we've made very good progress there.","And so I think that as we look forward, we think that there's still some optimization work on the consumer part of the business. But I think we feel like we can drive that business back to growth in the relatively short timeframe here once we get through that rightsizing activity on RCP.","Relative to reinvesting back in the business, I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks that, we're guiding the third quarter margin down versus year ago by 100 basis points to 130 basis points for the total company and that really is entirely due to an increase that we're planning in the third quarter in advertising and promotion spending.","And the third quarter, as you know, is a big quarter for us from a seasonality perspective, because you still have the businesses that are summer seasonal in the third quarter, you have the back-to-school period in the third quarter. And so the ramp up that we have versus year ago in advertising and promotion spending is focused on our strongest businesses.","We're planning to increase the advertising and promotion spending in the third quarter against our Writing business, against our Outdoor and Rec business and against a number of our other businesses where we have strong innovation momentum and to keep the core sales growth trend going in those businesses.","Andrea Teixeira","And just to be clear, Chris, this is very helpful. The 100 bps increase over a year ago is relative to the base that is so right, including \u2013 so it\u2019s fully comparable including Commercial RCP back, right?","Chris Peterson","Correct. So, if you look at the guidance chart that we've put in the press release, what you can see is that, we've increased the guidance range for the full year of 2019 versus 2018 by a 110 basis points, and that 110 basis point increase is entirely due to including the RCP business, and what we've done is, we've included it fully in both years, including and the normalized impact of the annual depreciation expense in both years. So it's an apples-to-apples comparison.","Andrea Teixeira","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks. Good morning. I'm sorry to go back to the Commercial Product question. But I - one other things that was cited in the decision to include that business in the divestitures had been the notion of complexity of the portfolio. And that what \u2013 and of course, when that was said, it was certainly a change in course so I just wanted to know if you could comment on how you're thinking about portfolio complexity and having this sort of standalone industrial-facing business versus the rest of it so solidly consumer-facing? Thanks.","Chris Peterson","Yep. So we've looked at the complexity reduction and interestingly, keeping the Rubbermaid Commercial Products business doesn't significantly change the complexity reduction metrics that were previously shared.","And part of the reason for that is, because the Rubbermaid Commercial business is already relatively integrated from a supply chain standpoint with the Rubbermaid Consumer business that the company was planning to keep. And so, selling the Rubbermaid Commercial business would actually have required a separation activity that would have, in some cases, added more complexity during that period.","So, if you look at the premise of the original ATP plan in terms of SKU count reduction, manufacturing footprint reduction, exposure to resin, the decision to keep the Rubbermaid Commercial business really doesn't change the picture with regard to any of the complexity reduction metrics.","Relative to the question on the commercial-facing part of the business. I think, as I've gotten into it and looked at the business, the thing that I was looking at was the Rubbermaid brand plays across both commercial and consumer-facing businesses and if you include our Food business in that, the Rubbermaid brand is probably 50:50 between commercial and consumer-facing businesses.","And the Rubbermaid brand is in driving branding and innovation applies equally and as a critical skill that's required in both the commercial business and the consumer business. So, we think that the fit with our core competencies is very strong across the entire Rubbermaid businesses.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, thank you. And, if I can squeeze in one more, just the retail closures. There's obviously a lot of ongoing movement in the brick-and-mortar landscape and so questions around Bed Bath and JC Penney. So, how are you thinking about that in terms of an impact on whether it's your building and things for this year as you're planning ahead for 2020 and maybe in particular, how you might be approaching the planning cycle differently today than what might have been done at the company previously, given this sort of let\u2019s call it ongoing the changes in the landscape?","Chris Peterson","Yeah, it's a good question. And it's something that we are very focused on. And so, I think one of the things that's very encouraging about the results in the second quarter is that, if you look at the company's top four customers, we're back to point of sale growth in the second quarter and year-to-date in all four of those customers, which we believe are winning customers in the retail environment that is being radically disrupted with digital and e-commerce shopping trends.","We also are excited that we're back to high single-digit growth in the e-commerce business, and that we're back to core sales growth in the international business. And so, the way we're thinking about the business is very much planning for the retail disruption to continue. My view is that, we need to be thinking about where the retail environment is going to be over the next three to five years, and then making our investment choices so that we're playing to win where the market is going to be. And so, our strategy is to invest in winning customers, to invest in digital and e-commerce, to invest in growing the international business and to manage appropriately the decline in retailers that unfortunately are being disrupted and losing share in the marketplace.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, thanks so much, Chris. I appreciate it.","Chris Peterson","Thanks, Lauren.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Hey, thanks. Good morning, Chris.","Chris Peterson","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Powers","Maybe just to round out the RCP discussion. When you parse out all the moving parts, are you able to isolate it all, what portion of the updated $600 million to $800 million in operating cash flow, you can now attribute to continuing ops inclusive of RCP? I know you've historically been reluctant to provide that information, but I'm just hoping we can revisit it, because I do think it's important to understand that go for the cash earnings power?","Chris Peterson","Sure. So \u2013","Steve Powers","Okay.","Chris Peterson","Yeah, so first of all \u2013","Steve Powers","Sorry, I have a second question as well \u2013","Chris Peterson","All right, let me answer the \u2013","Steve Powers","Okay.","Chris Peterson","Let me answer the first and then we'll come back to the second. So first of all, the increase in the cash flow guidance of $300 million is not impacted at all by the decision to keep the RCP business, because the operating cash flow guidance for the company is a total company operating cash flow.","So really what's driving the $300 million increase in the guidance range from what was $300 million to $500 million to now $600 million to $800 million in operating cash flow is strong results on working capital management which is much stronger than what we anticipated as we've gotten into it and started to drive the strategic actions that I've talked about and better tax planning. So the guidance increase is really based on underlying performance of the business is the first point.","Secondly, the decision to keep the RCP business will significantly [Technical Difficulty] the cash, because the RCP business is a very strong cash generating business and a very strong operating margin business. So, I mentioned earlier that keeping the RCP business in the -- if you do the implied guidance, increases the earnings per share from continuing operations in 2019 by almost 40%, and that flows through to cash flow. So I'm expecting that our 2020 cash flow will be significantly enhanced by the decision to keep the RCP business.","It's hard to parse out exactly what the operating cash flow in 2019 is from continuing operations versus discontinued operations. But now that we've made the decision to keep the RCP business, I think the discontinued operation impact on operating cash flow for the businesses that are being sold this year is not as significant as what it was planning to be before the decision to sell the RCP business.","Steve Powers","Okay, that's great color. Thank you. And then the second question was just on the move, the headquarter move. Could you comment at a high level about how many people and what functions you have today in New Jersey and other locations that will be impacted and consolidated into Atlanta? And then just a feel for how confident you are that you can retain key personnel as you make that transition?","Chris Peterson","Yeah, so the company has about 1,100 professional employees in Atlanta today, including most of the corporate employees are already based in Atlanta. In New Jersey, the company has about - just under a 100 corporate employees that will be affected by the move. So there's about a little less than a 100 roles that will be moving from New Jersey to Atlanta.","Additionally, in New Jersey, we have about 200 roles in the e-commerce division. And the plan is to keep the e-commerce employees in Hoboken, because we believe this is a good market for e-commerce and digital talent. And so really, it's less than a 100 people that will be moving to Atlanta or 100 roles that will be moving to Atlanta. We've gone through as you might imagine a very specific exercise, looking at the roles that will be impacted, the people in the roles and we believe we've got a strong plan to manage the transition without any disruption to the business.","Steve Powers","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Okay, thank you so much for taking the call. Chris, really appreciate the commentary around your desire to maintain IG ratings and the focus on debt pay down. As you've spoken with the rating agencies, would you be able to share sort of their perspective on the plan and whether they're onboard with this being commensurate with the current ratings? And if they're not, how could that potentially affect, if at all, plans for future debt pay down and shareholder return? Thank you.","Chris Peterson","Sure. Yeah, so I mentioned that we've \u2013 I met with both S&P and Moody's last week to take them through the revised plan on keeping the RCP business and the revised projections for the company. And effectively what we talked about was, the strong cash generation that we're having in the core business and the fact that we're taking our cash guidance up for the year.","The fact that we're keeping the RCP business which has a short-term increase in the gross debt to EBITDA, where I mentioned that, we expect to be at or below 4 times at the end of this year, but we're \u2013 but we believe we've got a plan to be below 3.5 times by the end of next year. And we talked about how the company is better positioned and strengthened going forward by keeping the RCP business.","I'm not going to speak for where they came out. But I\u2019m expecting that both of them will publish an update note either today or Monday with their conclusion from it, but I will say that, we had very good meetings and the meetings were very productive.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","That's helpful. And I guess just one housekeeping item on the cash flow benefit from better tax planning. Would you be able to quantify how much of the $300 million increase is contributed to that and whether we should anticipate that is something that gets built into the base going forward? Or is it a one-time benefit? Thank you.","Chris Peterson","Yeah, so of the $300 million increase, it's about half that's coming from tax planning and about half that's coming from working capital management improvement. And so, one other things that you'll see in our guidance is, we've also taken down the guidance that we had given previously, where we said we expected to pay about $200 million in cash taxes and divestiture related fees this year to a number that's more like $50 million, and so that's driving about half of the benefit is tax planning and about half is working capital management.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Great, thanks. Good morning. So I guess the first question on RCP, it looks like that business did about $1 billion in sales last year. You raised the sales guidance this year by $900 million. So, our sales down in that business is 10% and if that's the case, and two-thirds of the business is growing, that seems to imply the consumer piece is declining pretty rapidly, if my math is correct?","Chris Peterson","Yeah, so sales in that business are not down 10%, I think that when we did our guidance range, we only guide the year to a single decimal point, not the two decimal points. So, some of that is in the rounding. So, the business is down slightly this year. But as you can see from our core sales growth guidance, we're not changing our core sales growth guidance for the year by including the RCP business. So it's pretty much in-line with the balance of the portfolio.","Joe Altobello","Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of the third quarter guide, core sales trends are implied to get worse down 2% to 4% versus down 1% call it in the second quarter and despite the fact that A&P is ramping up, so maybe give us a little more color on, why do you think core sales trends to decelerate in the third quarter?","Chris Peterson","Yeah, so I look at it as core sales trends are accelerating in the third quarter. And the way I look at it is on a two-year stacked basis. And if you look at the core sales growth trends on a two-year stack basis, the third quarter is improving versus the second quarter by 400 basis points in terms of core sales growth trends on a two-year stack basis.","It's also very much in-line with our plan for the year. So, the minus 2% to 4% that we're planning in Q3 fits very well in our guidance range, which we're not changing for the year of down low single-digits. So, I think we're being appropriately prudent in our planning, but this is very much in-line with our plan and we think that it represents a sequential improvement in terms of the underlying performance given the base period dynamics.","Joe Altobello","Got you. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Hey. Good morning, Chris.","Chris Peterson","Good morning. Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","First a housekeeping question then a broader question on the incoming CEO. So, the housekeeping question is in the Learning & Development segment. Was there any timing benefit with respect to back-to-school there cycling and equally as easy comp, I guess. So that looked a lot better and then sort of tying that in with the core sales guidance that probably looks a little bit worse than then folks had expected? Was there any back-to-school shift there that ended up in Q2 and instead of Q3? So that that's the housekeeping question.","And the broader question, Chris would just be with respect to Ravi coming in, how involved, if at all, were you in the interview process? What do you think Ravi will bring? And why do you think the Board believes he's the right leader for the company at this point in time? And then I think what will be helpful just maybe to put some context on a timeline for investors? As he starts in the fall, can we expect sort of a long-term strategy to be detailed for the company on the fourth quarter call or perhaps down in CAGNY in February, so any contexts with those questions would help? Thank you.","Chris Peterson","Very good. So let me start with the housekeeping question. So on the back-to-school, ship in from on Writing, we did ship in slightly better than what we expected in Q2 versus when we gave the original guidance for Q2, slightly earlier, but not significantly. And so, it round up being about in-line with what we did in the year ago period. So there was not a significant impact of Q2 this year versus last year. But it was a little bit better than we had expected when we entered the second quarter.","As a result of that, there's not really a material difference in Q3. So, we \u2013 I mentioned on the call that we had turned the quarter in four of our seven continuing divisions, with Baby, Writing, Connected Home and Home Fragrances, all delivering core sales growth in the quarter, and I think we feel good about those four businesses continuing on a positive trajectory going forward on the housekeeping question.","With regard to Ravi, I've met Ravi and I've talked with him a couple of times, since meeting him. Obviously the decision to hire the CEO was the Board's decision. But I'm very much looking forward to partnering and working with Ravi when he starts in October. And in the meantime, I've talked with both the Board and with Ravi about the five priorities as part of our turnaround plan. And the Board and Ravi are both very supportive of continuing the effort and moving full speed ahead with our five priority efforts.","Kevin Grundy","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Chris.","Chris Peterson","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","All right, thank you. Good morning, Chris.","Chris Peterson","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","I wanted to ask you about Yankee specifically, same-store sales trends, did \u2013and then did the results in Home Fragrance sequentially improved in Q2 or as you expected. And then on the store closures, how has that been progressing in terms of your expectations and wondering what you're seeing in terms of the conversion there? And then finally, just loved to get your long-term outlook for that business and if it's changed at all?","Chris Peterson","Yeah. Okay, so the Home Fragrance business, I feel like we've made an important change in the inflection of that business for the positive. And so let me try to provide a little bit about what's happening and what \u2013 and where we're headed in that business.","So we continue down the path of closing unprofitable retail stores so that we right size the retail portfolio and generally we're closing stores as their leases expire. We don't expect to fully get out of the retail business, but we expect to downsize the retail footprint over time, and you see year-to-date we've closed I think 78 stores in the first half of the year.","The comp sales trends at those retail stores continue to decline broadly. But the rate of decline has slowed down, because we put aggressive effort at trying to drive better traffic driving initiatives, better conversion and an effort at driving increase in average unit retail prices at the retail outlets that starting to gain some traction.","That being said, the more important part of the business is what we're doing relative to the part of the business that we're selling through retail customers, which is going very well. And so we've partnered with Walmart and launched the WoodWick brand in Walmart. Our business at Walmart is up strong double-digits. The category is growing strong double-digits. The WoodWick brand in Walmart is leading an overall trade up in the category.","And what's happening is, as we've made \u2013 as we're pivoting to more of a wholesale business, the wholesale growth is outstripping and outpacing the decline we're seeing in the retail business.","And the retail business as we're closing the unprofitable stores is becoming a smaller part of the business. So we're very encouraged by the trends we're seeing. And we think we see a bright future for that business as we pivot back to offering some great products where the consumer shops.","The other important thing in that business is that, we've gotten our European business back to growth. And so the European business went through a period where it needed to reset and I think we're on a good trajectory in that business, driving growth broadly across the international markets.","Bonnie Herzog","All right, that was helpful. And if I may, I just wanted to ask about your Nielsen trends, which really appeared to have fallen off a cliff in the last couple of months. So I certainly understand that Nielsen doesn't capture big part of your business. But what's going on in these track channels, especially in categories that are weakening like Appliances, Writing and then Food favorite - beverage storage containers? Thanks.","Chris Peterson","Yeah, so Nielsen only covers about 20% of our business. So 80% of our business is not captured by Nielsen. And I think what's important to understand about Nielsen is, Nielsen misses a lot of the parts of our business that are growing disproportionately fast. So, I mentioned that we're growing our e-commerce business high single-digits in the second quarter and within that we've got some customers that are growing strong double-digits that are not picked up by Nielsen.","So I think part of what's happening is, as the consumer is shifting to purchase more online, and as we are disproportionately investing in winning customers and winning channels, I think that the Nielsen results are less predictive of the company's total results than perhaps what they were in the past. So we certainly look at the Nielsen results. But I think, given that it's only 20% of the business; we're focused on the broader part of the business that is in the winning customers and channels.","Bonnie Herzog","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So just given some of the \u2013 I guess some of the tariff news yesterday, I'm just curious if you have any initial thoughts on the impact of Newell whether any of this has been incorporated and you\u2019re thinking for this year?","Chris Peterson","Yeah so, it's a little bit hard to react to a tweet. And we don't know a lot about it yet, because the USTR office hasn't come out unless that's happened while we're on the call here this morning with a specificity and just to give a little bit of color, we don't know is it based on when the products are exported from China or when they're imported from China, and that has a difference of about a month in terms of when the effective date goes in? We don't know which categories are covered and which categories are not covered and are there any things that are excluded, and we've had lots of discussions with Congress about excluding parts of our portfolio from tariffs, particularly the Baby products where it's a child safety issue.","That being said, under almost any scenario, we don't see the tariffs is having a material impact to this year's numbers, because of the timing of what that would be \u2013 when that will be into effect. So even if it was the worst case scenario from a timing standpoint, and it covered all of the company's categories, and at the 10% level, given the amount of inventory we have in the US and the focus we've got on mitigating actions, including asking suppliers to help cover some of the costs and taking pricing, we don't believe it's a material impact to the company this year.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. And then I mean, if it does go into the fact any sense in terms of how to think about the exposure next year, or if there's any color you can provide in terms of your current exposure?","Chris Peterson","Yeah, I think it's premature to do that. Just because we, given the amount of uncertainty with which categories that would cover; what the amounts are; how it would be implemented. I think it's premature. So, we certainly will provide that as the rules get clear. We also are starting our budgeting process shortly here in the next month or so for the planning process for next year. And so, anything that gets put into place, we would incorporate into that planning process. But it's premature to speculate on the impact for next year and going forward.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, my last question on tariffs, so I know you've taken some actions on pricing year-to-date so just curious how those actions are played out versus your expectations?","Chris Peterson","Yeah so generally, pretty well. So you can see from the results in the second quarter that pricing and productivity more than offset the impact of tariffs, inflation and FX and allowed us to grow our gross margin by 50 basis points versus year ago. The most recent set of tariffs that went into effect in May took the list three product tariffs from 10% to 25%. We've taken pricing actions now across all of the businesses that were affected from that and generally, the discussions with the retailers have gone well, in terms of getting price acceptance from the retailers.","It's a little bit premature to say what the consumer reaction is, because many of those price increases didn't go into effect until the end of the second quarter. But what we are seeing is, generally where we're impacted by pricing, it\u2019s not in every case, but in most cases, our competitors were also impacted by the tariffs. And so there's a desire for the industry to price recover for that, so it doesn't create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for anybody over the medium-term.","Rupesh Parikh","Great, thank you for all the color.","Operator","And we have time for one last question, which will be from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Great, thank you. Want to talk a little bit more about margins. You explained the SG&A with all the incremental advertising, but gross margin was a big swing negative to positive this quarter. Can you unpack that a little bit? And then sort of give a little bit of color into what the second half looks like on gross margin? Thank you.","Chris Peterson","Yeah, on gross margin we've put a very concerted effort in improving our gross margins and the things that we're working on are reducing the company's SKU count. We've now reduced when I presented at CAGNY, I said that at the beginning of the year, we had 90,000 SKUs in the continuing operations business. We\u2019ve already taken 12,000 SKUs out and we're down to 78,000 SKUs. And so we've made a big improvement there.","We also have announced that we're closing three manufacturing plants and 10 distribution centers. And so we're starting to make effort \u2013 progress on our consolidation of our supply chain footprint, and we're focused on gross productivity. And the productivity work that the company has done and is doing is really starting to pay dividends. And so, if you look at productivity as a percent of our cost of goods sold, the productivity results for this year, I expect will be the best that the company has had in recent history.","And if you look at the productivity funnel, this year - at this point for next year versus where we were last year at this time, our productivity funnel for next year is up 33% versus where our productivity funnel was last year at this time for this year. So, I think we're making very strong progress there. I think that the underlying operating progress that we're making on driving gross margin higher is being somewhat masked by the impact of foreign exchange and tariffs and commodity inflation and that \u2013 those impacts will be variable by quarter. But the trajectory on the underlying operating progress on gross margin is very strong and I expect it to continue.","Olivia Tong","Got it. [indiscernible] portfolio decisions that you've made, was it just a look at Rubbermaid Commercial? Or did you have a look at the rest of your business or the entire portfolio and I realized it's not just one person's decision and we got a new CEO coming. But as you think about the portfolio going forward, what's the potential for even more change or a greater assessment relative to what you've already done?","Chris Peterson","Yeah, I think that I did look at the whole portfolio. And I think that we expect to complete the ATP plan with the remaining three divestitures, the USPC which we've already signed a deal that we expect to close. Mapa\/Spontex and Quickie are the two remaining businesses to be sold. And once we do that, I don't anticipate that we're going to have another big program like an ATP type effort.","That being said, we're always going to evaluate the portfolio for improvement opportunities. And that could both be a divestiture related or it could be tuck-in acquisition related, but I don't think you'll see us do a major effort like the ATP plan anytime in the foreseeable future.","Olivia Tong","Great, thank you so much.","Chris Peterson","Okay.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Peterson for closing remarks.","Chris Peterson","Thank you. I would like to thank everybody for participating in today's call and for your interest in Newell Brands. I also want to commend all my colleagues for executing well through a time of uncertainty and transition. While it's still early days in the company's transformation, there's lots to be proud of and a much more compelling future ahead of us. Thank you and we hope you enjoy the rest of your day.","Operator","A replay of today's call will be available later today on our website, newellbrands.com.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellrubbermaid.com on the Investor Relations homepage under Events & Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download.","I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell","Thank you, and good morning, everybody. This is Nancy O'Donnell. Joining me on our call are Mike Polk, our President and CEO; and John Stipancich, our EVP and Interim CFO. We appreciate you joining us today.","We remind you that this conference call will include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including core sales and normalized EPS. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures with the most comparable measures in accordance with GAAP is available in the earnings release and on the IR portion of our website, as well as on our IR app.","This call also will contain forward-looking statements reflecting our outlook for future periods. Due to the uncertainty of these forward-looking statements, actual results may materially differ from current expectations. An explanation of related risks and uncertainties is provided in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these statements.","And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Mike Polk.","Michael B. Polk","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Over the last few weeks, we've announced a series of strategic initiatives that are important to note in advance of our discussion of results.","First, on the heels of the completion of the Ignite Holdings acquisition in September, we have recently completed the acquisition of another leading marketer of on-the-go hydration and thermal products, bubba brands, inc. These acquisitions establish Newell as the leader in the key channels of the fast-growing on-the-go hydration and thermal beverage container category in North America. We also announced our board's decision to undertake the next phase of Project Renewal, one that will generate an incremental $200 million of annualized savings by the end of 2017.","And finally, this morning, we announced our intention to hold for sale our Calphalon outlet stores and Calphalon Electrics business and our Endicia online postage business. These strategic choices are designed to strengthen our portfolio, increase the growth potential of the company and improve our margins. In our discussions of results, we will treat Endicia and the Calphalon businesses as discontinued ops.","We delivered a solid set of results in the third quarter. Core sales grew 2.7%. Importantly, in our Win Bigger businesses of Writing, Commercial Products and Tools, we grew core sales 7.5%. Normalized gross margin increased 140 basis points to 39.2%, driven by positive mix and positive pricing, partially offset by meaningful foreign currency headwinds. Strong gross margin delivery enabled us to more than double advertising support versus prior year. And despite the resulting 190 basis point increase in SG&A, normalized operating margin decreased only by 50 basis points to 14.3%. Normalized EPS was $0.58, an increase of 11.5% versus prior year and $0.03 ahead of consensus. Operating cash flow was $339 million, and we'll return over $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, 65% greater than prior year.","We made continued progress on our Win Bigger businesses in Q3. Writing core sales increased 8.3%, driven by market share growth in most geographies as a result of stronger innovation and heavy third quarter advertising, marketing and merchandising programs. Year-to-date, Writing core sales have increased 8.5%. Tools core sales increased 2.3%, driven by strong volume growth on Irwin in Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, and very good growth of Lenox in North America. Irwin sales in North America declined as a result of slower -- a slower-than-expected distribution center transition in the U.S. Year-to-date, Tools core sales have increased 5.8%.","Commercial Products core sales increased 11.3% in Q3 as a result of strong innovation and volume growth in the U.S., Brazil and China. Year-to-date, Commercial Products core sales have increased 7.3%. Combined, these 3 Win Bigger businesses grew core sales 8.8% over the last 6 months and 7.6% year-to-date. The strong results in Writing, Commercial Products and Tools have helped us absorb the disruption of first half Baby & Parenting harness buckle recalls, the challenge from accelerating foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of our strategic choices to exit certain product lines in Europe, reposition the Rubbermaid Consumer business for profitable growth and to pull back on less profitable Black Friday merchandising across Home Solutions and Baby in the U.S.","Through the first 9 months, core sales increased 2.9%. Normalized operating income margins expanded 20 basis points to 14.0% despite over 100 basis point increase in advertising and significant foreign exchange headwinds. Normalized EPS increased to $1.51, up 11% versus prior year. This earnings outcome has been enabled by significant Project Renewal savings, disciplined overhead management, positive pricing and more aggressive share repurchase activity.","We're pleased with the building momentum in the business, having transitioned to our new operating model a little over a year ago. Since that change, we began to see growth accelerate and margins simultaneously increase. While proud of the progress, we're certain there is more opportunity to be captured in front of us. In that context and as announced this morning, the board has authorized the investment of $200 million as part of the next phase of Project Renewal, which we expect to release an incremental $200 million of annualized savings by the end of 2017.","Our leadership teams have identified significant new opportunities in procurement, distribution, manufacturing, shared services and other overhead. We plan to deliver these savings by tackling the significant complexity in our business and simplifying the way we bring our products to market. The majority of these new savings will be reinvested behind the strong innovation funnel we profiled at our Analyst Day in late September, and increasingly to the development of our capabilities and the deployment of our portfolio into the faster-growing emerging markets of Latin America and then Asia. Cumulatively, we now expect Project Renewal to generate between $470 million and $525 million in annualized savings by the end of 2017.","So we're pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We're well on our way to delivering a solid 2014 and more importantly, setting the stage for an even stronger 2015.","With that, let me hand the call over to John to go through a more detailed review of Q3 results. And then I'll return to provide some perspective on the balance of the year, the phasing of delivery in 2015 and some comments on our acquisition of bubba brands.","John K. Stipancich","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Before I begin, I'd like to remind everyone that effective Q3, we reclassified the Endicia online postage business and the Calphalon outlets and Electrics into discontinued operations. The results of these businesses are reported separately as discontinued operations in the company's financial statements, and my comments will focus primarily on results from continuing operations. The restated normalized quarterly EPS numbers for 2014 are available on our earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website, and the complete quarterly restated results for 2013 and '14 will be uploaded to our website in the near future.","Q3 reported net sales were $1.48 billion, a 1.3% increase versus last year. The Ignite acquisition contributed 60 basis points to net sales. Core sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, increased 2.7%. Strong volume growth in Commercial Products and Writing, along with broad-based positive pricing, drove the growth, partially offset by declines in Baby and Home Solutions, and by planned EMEA product line and country exits.","Reported gross margin was 38.8% and normalized gross margin was 39.2%, up 140 basis points over last year. This improvement was driven by pricing and favorable mix, which more than offset input cost inflation and unfavorable currency. Normalized SG&A expense was $369 million or 24.9% of sales, up 190 bps versus the prior year. We increased A&P spend in the quarter by nearly 150 basis points as a percentage of sales, driven primarily by TV advertising in Writing to support Paper Mate InkJoy, Mr. Sketch, Sharpie Neon and Sharpie Clear View. We also invested in marketing campaigns at RCP behind BRUTE and the HYGEN microfiber launch, and advertising in Baby to support the introduction of our new 4Ever Car Seat.","Normalized operating margin was 14.3%, down 50 basis points, reflecting significant increased strategic investment in our brands and capabilities, which was partially offset by strong gross margin expansion. Reported operating margin was 11.7% compared with 12.2% in the prior year. Interest expense of $14.3 million declined $1.4 million year-over-year. Note though that interest expense will tick up in Q4 as a result of the financing of our 2 recent acquisitions. Our normalized tax rate was 19.5% compared with 24.3% a year ago due to the recognition of discrete tax benefits this quarter. We now expect the full year normalized tax rate to land right around 24%.","Normalized EPS, which excludes restructuring and restructuring-related costs and certain other onetime costs, was $0.58, an 11.5% increase to last year. On a reported basis, third quarter EPS was $0.44 compared with $0.66 last year, but you'll probably remember that we recorded about a $0.26 gain on the sale of our Hardware business last year, which is the primary driver of the year-over-year decrease.","I'll now move on to the segment results. Starting with Writing, reported net sales grew 2.5% to $453.2 million. Core sales increased 8.3%. Our Latin America Writing business again delivered strong double-digit core sales growth, fueled by pricing and the continued success of InkJoy due to expanded distribution and TV advertising. We also benefited this quarter from about $15 million in pre-buys in advance of our October 1 SAP Go-live in Mexico and Venezuela.","In North America, core sales grew low-single digits even after taking into account the $15 million of sales that were pulled into Q2 from Q3 from earlier Back-to-School shipments. Our strong innovation and marketing campaigns helped drive planogram gains and good Back-to-School performance in North America. The Q3 normalized operating margin in our Writing segment was 24.1%, a 40 basis point decrease over the prior year. And strong productivity, pricing and cost management were more than offset by our increased advertising spend.","Net sales in our Home Solutions segment declined 1.4% to $417 million. Core sales decreased 3.2%, driven primarily by the exit of some low-margin Rubbermaid Consumer business and the comping of the 2013 Black Friday promotions that we chose not to repeat this year as the economics were not that attractive. We did generate good growth in the Rubbermaid food and beverage business. Home Solutions normalized operating margin was 15.3%, a 60 basis point decrease, reflecting input cost inflation and increased advertising, partially offset by pricing.","The Tools segment delivered net sales of $214.8 million, a 2% increase. Core sales grew 2.3%. Tools grew in all our international geographies, particularly in Latin America, where we regenerated double-digit growth. Our Irwin North America business showed a year-over-year decline, as shipments were constrained in September due to a slower-than-expected distribution center transition. We expect Tools North America to be back to a more normal run rate in the fourth quarter. Normalized operating margin in the Tools segment was 10.9%, a 510 basis point improvement versus last year. This increase was driven by gross margin expansion behind improved mix, productivity and pricing and a reduction of brand support in North America during the Tools distribution center transition.","Reported net sales in the Commercial Products segment increased 11.1% to $218 million. Core sales increased 11.3%, driven by pricing and strong volume growth in North America, as well as expanded distribution in Latin America and growth in Asia. Commercial Products operating margin was 12.6%, a 60 basis point increase to last year, thanks to pricing, productivity and a favorable channel mix.","Our Baby segment reported $181.5 million in net sales, a 6.5% decrease. Core sales fell 5.8%, a portion of which reflects planned product line and country exits in Europe. Aprica Japan continues to be challenged by increased competitive pressure. And in North America, core sales were flat. We saw positive momentum at point of sale generated by our new Graco innovation and our advertising and promotion campaigns, but the year-over-year selling comp was tempered by some inventory rebalancing at retail. Baby's Q3 normalized operating margin was 5.8%, down 690 basis points to last year, largely due to unfavorable mix, increased A&P spend in North America and a weaker yen, partially offset by pricing.","Looking at Q3 sales, core sales by geography. North America grew 0.6% with strong results from Commercial Products and Writing. In EMEA, core sales declined 2.9%, driven by planned product line and country exits of about $5 million, primarily in Writing and Baby. If adjusted for the impact of these exits, EMEA's core sales increased slightly, due primarily to growth in our Tools and Writing businesses. Our operating margins in EMEA improved significantly as we're realizing the benefits of our transformation initiatives in the region.","In Latin America, core sales grew 33.3% due to strong pricing and volume gains in Writing and Tools. Adjusted for the SAP sales pull-forward from Q4 into Q3, Latin America core sales growth was approximately 19%. Finally, Asia core sales grew 1.1%, as solid growth from Commercial Products and Tools was partially offset by declines in Aprica.","Moving on to cash and the balance sheet. Our operating cash flow was $339.2 million in Q3 compared with $360.8 million in the prior year. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was $343.3 million versus $301 million last year. We returned $150.2 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $46.3 million in dividends and $103.9 million to repurchase 3.3 million shares. The repurchase activity during the quarter contributed about $0.005 to Q3 results. At the end of Q3, we have $37 million available under our authorized $300 million open market repurchase plan. For the full year 2014, we're now modeling an annualized average share count of approximately 279 million shares.","And finally, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We have $132.6 million of cash on hand and about $640 million in liquidity. We financed the recent bubba acquisition with a combination of available cash and low-cost, short-term borrowings. Our debt-to-equity, EBITDA multiple and interest coverage ratios continue to be strong, giving us significant financial flexibility for further share repurchases or acquisitions, should we choose to pursue these opportunities.","With that, I'll now turn the call back to Mike.","Michael B. Polk","Thanks, John. So let's now turn to our 2014 outlook. As we told you at Analyst Day, we're tracking towards the low end of our core sales growth range of 3% to 4%, the middle of our normalized operating income range of up to 40 basis points expansion, the high end of the normalized EPS range of $1.94 to $2 per share, and the middle of the operating cash flow range of $600 million to $650 million. This morning, we reaffirmed our prior guidance.","Our 2014 full year guidance assumes the following for the fourth quarter: the negative effect of worsening foreign exchange and the dilution related to the businesses held for sale; a return to mid-single-digit growth on Tools as the U.S. distribution center ramps to speed and we recover most of the lost sales from Q3; sustained strong growth in Commercial Products, but a pullback to low-single-digit growth in Writing, as the Venezuela and Mexico SAP timing impact in Q3 reverses out in Q4; stabilization of core sales in Home Solutions as continued repositioning of the Rubbermaid Consumer business is offset by sustained momentum in Food Storage; and a sequential improvement on Baby as building U.S. growth is partially offset by continued exits in Europe.","There are 2 factors that could influence where we fall in our 2014 full year guidance ranges. The first factor is the planned recovery of growth on our Baby business. We expect Baby to stabilize in Q4 despite continued European exits and tough conditions in Japan. The key variable that will shape the Q4 Baby outcome is how quickly strengthening POS growth rates in the U.S., driven by strong innovation and new advertising, translate into core sales growth. Q3 POS in the U.S. increased about 5% versus prior year, and POS growth rates in the first 4 weeks of Q4 have strengthened further. In Q3, key retailer rebalancing of Baby inventories and our choice to not repeat some low-margin Black Friday deals from the prior year tempered core sales growth. Our guidance assumes the negative inventory rebalancing effect on growth lessens through Q4 and sell-in rates and sell-out rates converge in the U.S. by Q1 2015.","The second factor is foreign exchange. We've experienced increasingly difficult foreign exchange conditions through the year, sequentially increasing our view of the 2014 adverse foreign exchange impact on normalized EPS from our beginning of the year guidance of $0.04 to $0.07 per share to our latest view of about $0.17 per share, which is about $0.01 worse than our last updated Analyst Day. The team has done an excellent job dynamically managing our business in the context of this significant headwind.","While we do not provide quarterly guidance, let me highlight a few ins and outs affecting our Q4 delivery versus prior year. On the positive side, Q4 EPS will benefit from solid growth, improved gross margin, tight overhead management, reduced share count and the addition of Ignite and bubba to the portfolio. On the more challenging side, Q4 EPS will be adversely impacted by the mix effect of low-single-digit Q4 Writing growth, negative foreign exchange, $0.01 of EPS dilution related to the earnings of the businesses taken to discontinued operations and the absence of nearly $0.045 per share of tax benefit in the prior year period related to discrete items that we do not expect to repeat in 2014. Importantly, despite all the moving parts, we still expect to track to the high end of our full year guidance range of $1.94 to $2 per share.","As you know, we established our initial 2015 guidance for core sales growth and normalized EPS at our Analyst Day in late September. We reaffirmed that guidance today. Let me make a few comments regarding the phasing of next year's sales and earnings. Our 2015 core sales full year guidance range is 3.5% to 4% growth. While we should have a relatively strong first quarter due to the absence of the year-ago challenges, we expect core sales to be near the low end of the full year range in the first half of 2015 and near the high end of the full year range in the second half of 2015. The highest core growth rate quarter should be Q4, when Ignite and bubba growth will both be recognized in our core sales metric. The lowest core growth rate quarter should be Q2, related to a shift of some Back-to-School shipments on Writing from Q2 back to Q3.","The phasing of normalized EPS growth also skews toward the back half of the year, driven by 2 factors. First, nearly 2\/3 of the $0.13 to $0.15 adverse foreign exchange impact is expected to occur in the first half of the year, with the most significant impact in Q1. Second, we expect to increase advertising and promotion by over $50 million in 2015, with the majority of the incremental investment occurring in the first 6 months of the year. The net effect of these factors is that we expect the year-over-year first half normalized EPS growth rate to be lower than the year-over-year growth rate in the second half of 2015. And importantly, we're prepared to accept flat year-over-year EPS growth in Q1 2015 in order to set up the right long-term quarterly A&P spending profile for our business. To be clear, our 2015 full year guidance for normalized EPS of $2.16 to $2.22 remains unchanged.","Let me now turn to bubba. Of all our brands, I have to confess to enjoy saying bubba the most. I've noticed the same dynamic with folks in the office, I don't think it's just me. There must be a little bit of bubba in all of us, and that's why the brand makes us smile. Although the bubba transaction will have a minimal impact on our 2014 results, largely because of timing, we're extremely excited about what this acquisition brings to us. bubba is a leading brand in the durable on-the-go hydration and thermal beverage container category. The brand is well recognized for its iconic head-shaped designs in the U.S. food, drug and mass channels, and has a very strong presence at a couple of key retailers.","The bubba product line fits perfectly with our Contigo, Avex and Rubbermaid brand portfolio, bringing penetration in key channels and across price tiers that we can now leverage to grow our total set of branded offerings. bubba has enjoyed strong growth over the past few years and has a very loyal user base. Over 80% of bubba consumers are repeat purchasers. Like the acquisition of Contigo and Avex, bubba is very attractive because it strengthens one of our core businesses, Home Solutions; it strengthens our presence in a fast-growing on-trend segment of the market; it allows us to leverage our broad-reaching business system to bring value to bubba since its home markets are our home markets; and it's growth accretive, normalized OI margin accretive and normalized EPS accretive in year 1. And last but not least, bubba provides a meaningful cash tax benefit that subsidizes a sizable portion of the purchase price. The bubba acquisition was completed on October 22 and we'll consolidate results as part of the Home Solutions segment starting in Q4.","So let me now close with a couple of reflections. I'm proud of the way our people have delivered results in a tough environment. The team has made tremendous progress navigating the turbulence of the first half of the year related to weather in North America and the Baby harness buckle recalls. Through 9 months, core sales growth is 2.9% and has accelerated to 3.7% over the last 6 months. Importantly, the team has been fearless in protecting the significant incremental investment we're making in our brands, despite having to overcome $0.17 per share of adverse foreign exchange impact on margins and EPS. They've done well by managing overheads tightly, driving gross margin increases across our portfolio and, with the benefit of more aggressive share repurchase activity, delivering both the investment increase our brands needed and a strong EPS outcome. Through 9 months, normalized operating income margin have increased 20 basis points despite more than doubling our advertising investment, and normalized EPS has increased 11%.","These are strong, competitive results, and we've delivered them while simultaneously driving change. We are in the thick of the strategic phase of the Growth Game Plan, investing behind the core activities critical to our business success. Establishing an operating company that unlocks the full potential of our $6 billion business, rather than simply our individual brands or our individual operating units. We're building what we envision will be world-class capabilities in design, marketing and insights, supply chain and customer development. And we've begun to apply these capabilities to strengthen our brands and accelerate our performance, as you saw on our recent Analyst Day.","We've deployed cash back into the business through Project Renewal to unlock the trapped capacity for growth, making Newell leaner and more efficient. Investing a significant portion of those savings into our brands for accelerated growth, while allowing a portion to flow through to increased operating margin. And with the announcement of the next phase of Project Renewal, we now expect to deliver about $0.5 billion of cumulative annualized savings by the end of 2017.","At the same time as building new capabilities and unlocking the trapped capacity for growth, we've strengthened our portfolio by exiting or divesting nearly $400 million of less attractive or less strategically relevant businesses and now acquiring nearly $200 million of growth-, margin- and EPS-accretive businesses, focused in the core of our portfolio. We've also put cash to work, repurchasing nearly $900 million of our own shares over the last 3.5 years while simultaneously increasing the annualized dividend from $0.20 per share in early 2011 to $0.68 per share today. And as we create this new future for our company, we're simultaneously creating value for our shareholders, increasing the market capitalization of the company from just over $3 billion in late Q3 2011 to over $9 billion today.","We're proud of our progress, but more importantly, we're excited by the future. There's a much bigger value-creation story still to be created, and we're convinced that we're on track to both strengthen the company and create that upside. That's the power of the Growth Game Plan and the new Newell Rubbermaid.","With that, let me pass the line to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about this Tools distribution center issue. Just, I guess, I want to make sure I understood correctly that you said you expect to recapture the lost sales. So is there a sort of pent-up orders that you're expecting to ship to meet in the fourth quarter?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. Lauren, so let me describe what we are doing. We're moving the DC from Indianapolis to the Southeast part of the U.S. And we have a start-up curve we envisioned occurring, and it didn't deliver to our expectations. And so we were constrained in terms of our shipment activity in the last part of the third quarter, and we didn't expect to be. Some of those shipments -- I'd say, most of those deferred orders will be captured in Q4. Not all of them though, to be clear, because when you don't deliver to customers' expectations, they'll go somewhere else to fill their -- some of them will go somewhere else to fill their demand. But we do think we get the majority -- most of those orders back in Q4. So it'll reverse out as the distribution center in the Southeast comes -- ramps to speed.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And is it at speed now, Mike? Or is there still a little bit of fixing?","Michael B. Polk","No. We're coming through October, I think we'll be to speed in November. This thing, this is -- obviously, execution is everything. And this is an example of us not executing. This cost us 50 basis points of growth, core sales growth in the third quarter, so it's really a bummer. The good news is it's a discrete event and we'll work through it and we'll learn through this experience. But it did get in the way of us doing exactly what we had hoped to do in Q3. But we'll come through it in Q4. We'll get back on track. And as we move forward into more supply chain transformation work, we'll make sure we don't lose the lessons learned.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then on the Home Solutions business, a little bit of a longer-term question. With the exits or product lines or rationalization that's underway, the Endicia planned divestiture, the Calphalon retail shutting down and then the acquisitions, where do you feel like you are in terms of reshaping that portfolio to what you want it to look like? Are all the steps in play already? Or there's still more that needs to happen?","Michael B. Polk","I think there's more opportunity in front of us, less on the disposal side but more on the acquisition side. We've said we're going to deliver the Growth Game Plan ambition organically, and we're well on our way to doing that. But we also are a very cash-generative business. And we'll put our cash to work probably in 2 ways with the board's support: buying back what we consider to be an undervalued asset, that's us; and also looking to scale the 5 core segments that we have. And our model for doing that is a blend of organic delivery through the Growth Game Plan activities and then complemented by M&A. We think bubba and Ignite are right in the wheelhouse. And there are some other opportunities out there that, if the conditions were right, we would pursue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","This is actually Stephanie on for Bill. I just had a quick question on the inventory rebalance for Baby. Is there any chance you can kind of quantify the impact of that? And then if you expect to get any of that back in the fourth quarter as well?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So Stephanie, it's a good question. John, in his section, talked about our North American Baby business being flat. And he was referring to net sales. And I talked about our POS being up about 5% in the U.S. So I think that's as specific as I'd like to get. In the reality, those numbers ought to match to each other. So sell-in and sell-out ought to be lined up if you've got a consumption-based selling model. And that's where we hope we get to as those 2 things converge by the first quarter of 2015.","Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just a quick -- is there any update on the growth to net optimization program that you announced at your Analyst Day?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. We're making progress to a 1-1 implementation of a new model of going to market in the U.S., which significantly simplifies how we deploy our trade promotion, our customer programming funds and perhaps, more importantly, how our customers earn those funds. So it becomes more of a performance-based model versus a more traditional model that you might have seen over the past number of years of fixed fund deployment to opportunities. So customers will earn money based on their purchases from us and then they will qualify for that money through performance, which typically would be merchandising or new item distribution or things of that sort, shelving initiatives. And so we're very excited by it. It empowers our sales force to sell more. If they sell more, customers earn more. And it creates a very dynamic way of going to market. It's not new to our industry. It's new more to the consumer durable space than it is to fast-moving consumer goods. But what it will do is ensure that our money flows to our growth customers rather than the fixed fund approach, which tends to oversubsidize declining customers and underfund growing customers. So it's a much more progressive model, and we're very excited to deploy it and leverage it.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just want to talk a little bit about the incremental savings. You guys have had big increases in brand support over the past couple of years. So can you talk about how that's going to flow through from a timing standpoint and kind of where you feel you are in your brand investment? Do you feel like the marginal return is still where it needs to be? So how much of that investment will flow -- how much of the savings will flow down to the bottom line versus sort of going back into the business?","Michael B. Polk","Well, John, we haven't gotten that specific in our external communication. We obviously have plans that are laid out by quarter for the third phase of Project Renewal. Let me just start with the strategic side of your question, which is how much in brand investment do you want to put into this business. We're pretty happy with the SG&A ratios in this business. If we were between 25% and 26%, even if we held ourselves to 25%, we've got the right amount of investment firepower in the P&L today. It's just not shaped properly. Too much of it has been tied up in fixed overheads and not enough of it has been behind our brands. And so the last 3.5 years has been about variabilizing that spend and trying to get our A&P investment up and making the right choices with respect to selling investments versus maybe our business partnering functions within the balance of the overhead lines. We have more work to do to get the A&P ratios to where we want them to be. There's no one number system because, obviously, A&P will be highest on our Writing businesses and it'll be lowest, probably, on our Commercial Products businesses, where selling expense will tend to be higher. So it's not one set of levers that we're pulling. That said, on balance for the company as a whole, long term -- and I won't give you a time-bound metric here -- but long term, we want to be in that 6% to 7% A&P ratio range. And in order to do that, within the constraint of SG&A being roughly right between 25 -- around 25, maybe a little bit higher, we've got to get the overheads in line. And that's what we're on and about doing. Or we have to get the gross margin up, which of course, that's what we're on and about trying to do. Now in terms of the phasing of Project Renewal, the third phase of Project Renewal, we obviously have a bunch of savings still to come in on Renewal 1 and 2 in the first half of the year. We've said we'll be between the range of $270 million and $325 million of cumulative annualized savings for Renewal 1 and 2. And we're well on our way to delivering that, and we may even have some upside to that. The phasing in of Renewal 3 savings will accelerate through next year. So our back half will be the largest beneficiary of that work. Front half, we'll be gearing up. So I wouldn't expect that the new savings layer in on top of the Renewal 1 and 2 savings still to come in the first half. I think about those savings -- the majority of those savings phasing pretty evenly through Q3, Q4 and then into -- and then accelerating into 2016 and '17. The work is phased. We've got, probably, I would guess, maybe 15 project work streams that, in total, will ladder up to Project Renewal. And the work is phased with the easiest-to-grab savings first. And then some of the more interesting savings that really create strategic value for us, which are connected to the complexity of our product portfolio, will be phased later. So we've got to go through that simplification process up front in the architecture of our brands in order to enable the release of the more complicated savings through our manufacturing footprint. And you should expect that to phase a little bit later, because that's a complicated exercise that cuts across brand marketing through selling and then into the supply chain. So I know that's not the specifics you're looking for, John, but thematically, that's how I would think about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First quick one on cash flow in the quarter. Obviously, it was down year-over-year. Is there anything sinister there? Or this a timing issue?","Michael B. Polk","No. It's just timing. And John, you want -- any comments on cash flow?","John K. Stipancich","No. It's good. We're still -- we're on track to deliver what we committed to, Bill, this year. And again, it's just timing. If you look year-to-date, I think we're up significantly, so we're in good shape.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. Last year, if you recall, we were -- we didn't have positive operating cash flow through the middle of the year. This year, we did. So it's really just a timing and phasing thing. Our payables are shorter. It's actually a healthier cash flow delivery this year than it was last year, to be honest with you, so.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. Pricing has obviously become a pretty critical component of the organic sales growth algorithm. And I'm wondering, is this commodity pass-through pricing. Or is it real pricing? Because the U.S. commodities start to sort of stabilize and then maybe decline if some of the spot rates hold. Like do you think pricing still is an important variable or do you think it can stick in that kind of environment?","Michael B. Polk","Look, I mean, a lot of our pricing actually is coming outside the U.S. connected to transaction ForEx. And in general, all of our competitors face the same dynamics, except for those folks that are producing locally. So we expect to have to price to cover a lot of that next year as well, so that should sustain. There'll be some caps on what we'll be able to do in Venezuela versus what we've done historically, given the new gross -- new margin cap law. But we still expect a material amount of pricing to flow through. In the U.S., we still expect inflation next year. Despite energy costs coming out or coming down, we have -- we get hit by 2 things. First of all, there's a decoupling of the resin markets from the core commodity that's related to supply, refinery supply and capacity. And that will be an issue for resin for the next couple of years. It really doesn't ease until late '16, probably '17. So that's not going to be -- people like to conclude that oil down, resin down. That's -- or natural gas, resin down. It's not that linear. So we're going to still have inflation. We'll have inflation in our low-cost country labor -- sourced goods through labor rate -- continued labor rate inflation. So we're going to have to price to cover that or work to get the cost out through accelerated productivity. And we're going to have to do a bit of both.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then just one last one. Just on the SKU productivity, what's the sort of timetable for us to start seeing some benefits from that from the SAP implementation? And then maybe it's just me, but it seems like out-of-stocks are becoming an increasingly bigger problem. So is that something you guys are focusing on? And I know that's sort of part and parcel with the SKU productivity because, obviously, the faster-turning SKUs are the ones that are out of stock and the stuff that doesn't turn are the ones that you're putting pretty quickly on shelf?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. I mean, there's 2 ways to manage out-of-stocks. One is to get your shelving right. And you could -- if you're faced out properly on your highest velocity SKUs, you end up being able to manage that dynamic. I think, for us, in the here and now, some of the concerns on out of stocks are related to things retailers are doing in the moment. I don't get fazed by that. I think that's sort of the normal dynamics that go on as people rebalance their positions, et cetera. So that's not a strategic thing that we should worry about. Your point on complexity driving -- increasing the risk of out-of-stocks, and also all kinds of other costs through our business model, is right in the middle of what Project Renewal Phase 3 is going to be about. I've told you guys 21% of our SKUs in Writing in North America account for 90% of our revenue. Well, that's pretty absurd. And there's all kinds of costs tied up in that, and all kinds of issues tied up in that commercially, as you point out. And so this is the type of thing, which is complicated to address, but this is the type of thing that we will address in Renewal 3. And you should expect, as we come through '15 into the second half, for us to be able to expose some of the very specific things we're doing around our Writing business, in particular, as we set the stage to simplify that portfolio and get both the manufacturing efficiencies that come through that and the working capital benefits that come through that. We should expose you to that. We're not ready to do that today. That's at the heart of what Renewal 3 will be about.","Operator","Your next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Canada","I'd like your perspective on the Baby business. When you took over as CEO, the Baby business was so pressured that it got its very own segment. And now it recovered. It recovered very nicely, and once again, we see that the margins got crushed. So I'm wondering if you think it has the right characteristics to remain as part of Newell's portfolio, and how you -- and if it does, how you manage this business given all its volatility.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. It's a great question, Connie. So when I started this job, I was pretty skeptical about Baby. That's why I brought it direct to me. I didn't like the dynamics that were happening between us and our partner. I was really concerned about the gross margin. I was worried that the brand wasn't strong enough to be able to hold up or premiumize. I had a lot of concerns coming into it. And that's why I asked Kristie to report directly to me. And that's why Mark and myself really got into the guts of that business to understand it. And a year later, we moved Laurel Hurd to be the Head of Marketing in the context of the new operating model. And it was the Laurel and Kristie show in Baby. I want to be really clear, I love the Baby business, and I'm really positive about what we can go do with this business. The step back in margins is completely related to the first slug of A&P that we put in the business in Q3, which was a sizable one. We hadn't advertised Graco in a long, long time, when we advertised the 4Ever Car Seat launch. And then there's some mix effects of our Japanese business being under pressure. But I think -- one of the reasons I love this business is because we have an incredibly strong brand. And we've got our relationship with our sourcing partner really focused. They're great collaborators. And so we have a very strong position that we can leverage. We don't love the margins in general, but you have to remember, we don't have the fixed asset base, we don't have the inventory. This is a DI business so -- the majority of it is, so our working capital ratios are very, very favorable. So if you look at the return on net assets on this business relative to the rest of our portfolio, it is almost as strong as our Writing business, despite having a very, very different margin structure. So if we can grow it, we can create a ton of value for shareholders. And given the brand strength, given our building track record on innovation, I'm prepared to invest in Baby and take the hit on operating margins for the sake of investing behind the brand, because I do not think our competitors will do that. And there maybe 1 year or an 18 month contraction in operating income margins that we need to absorb for the sake of catalyzing growth. And so I've changed my tune on Baby from the time when I started, where I was really concerned, to me being way more bullish about this business, particularly in North America and eventually in Asia. So Connie, I don't know if that answers your question, but that's where I stand on it.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Canada","It does.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So I guess -- I know you don't want to give quarterly guidance, but with only 1 quarter left, that's what it is. So Mike, it looks like to the do low end of 3% to 4% for full year '14, you need a 4% in Q4. So I guess, with Writing, as you're saying, low singles, and I think commercial facing a much, much tougher comp, can you just talk about, I guess, what the run rate x the unusual stuff in Home Solutions? Just like how do you think you're going to get there?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. Chris, so on our math, right now, Q3 year-to-date, we're at 2.9% core. So to get to the low end of the range -- the bottom of the low end of the range would be, I think, 3.2%, 3.3% is what we would need in Q4. And who knows, a tenth of a core sale point or 10 basis points of core sales is $1.5 million of revenue. We do about $20 million a day. And so 1\/10 of a basis point is $1.5 million of revenue. So I don't know whether we'll be 3.2% or 3.3% or 3.4% or 3.5%, but I think it's within grasp. And do I know exactly where we'll end up on year-end? No, I don't. But it's that -- that's sort of the fine-tuning required to kind of get into the range. So we're going to do our best to be in that range. I know the sales teams are focused on it like a laser beam. I also want to set Q1 up for great success because I want to get out of this year, where we had to absorb all these challenges from the recall and from the weather in Q1 that sort of derailed our momentum. So it would be great to kind of put a punctuation point on this year and move on to the next. But obviously, we feel a sense of urgency to be where we said we were going to be. That's why we've guided the way we have. We're tracking to the low end of the core sales range and the high end of the EPS range, despite all of the challenges.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it, got it. And could you just -- I guess on advertising real quick. 150 basis points of total A&P is pretty big and it's so far -- I mean, and maybe this is a function of your business, but it's been pretty lumpy, right, episodic in each business based on, obviously, different initiatives.","Michael B. Polk","Yes.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Will it always be like that? Or do you think you'll get to a point where there's just a higher underlying run rate on spend in these businesses?","Michael B. Polk","You know what? I think for at least the next few years, it'll be like that, Chris. I mean, we'll try to help you understand why we're doing what we're doing, but money flows to ideas. The money that we're putting into advertising isn't thematic advertising in general. It's behind innovation. And I think that's where -- that is a premise that you'll see us continue to embrace. So it will flow to the ideas we're bringing to market. Now as you think through our portfolio, those ideas are, obviously, Writing. First priority, because it's a beautiful business, high margin, great brands, lots of innovation coming. Baby will be a priority, even though the operating income margin will contract when we do that, because we have a pipeline of big innovations coming and we want to establish ourselves as the leader, and also take steps to -- while protecting our flank, premiumize the Graco brand because it can carry more premium and more functional benefits to mom. And so that requires support, that requires messaging, that requires convincing people to try. And you'll see that on Baby. You'll see that on Calphalon. You'll see that on Food Storage and our beverage businesses within Home Solutions. You'll see that across our Writing portfolio. You'll see that on the Irwin business within Tools. And we're going to learn on Commercial Products what the right levers to pull are. We're doing a bunch of print right now on the new BRUTE can that we've got. And we're doing print on the new Maximizer Mop that reduces the amount of cotton in a mop head while improving performance. Reduces the cotton content by 30%, so it's much easier for the janitor to use. We're trying print out there, but do we -- we're not sure whether that will work. And if it doesn't work, we'll put the money off and put it into other investments. We're managing the company as an operating company, and so -- not a holding company. So we're not yet in the position where I want to let go of how we deploy what is still pretty scarce A&P resources, even though we've increased it substantially.","Operator","Your next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can we talk a little bit about sort of the next year and the key areas that have to perform to get you closer to making the high end of the sales outlook range as opposed to the low end? And in the context of the macro backdrop, it's certainly gotten a lot more interesting, even since the last time we met at Analyst Day. So maybe you can talk a little bit about the macro assumptions that you have embedded into your outlook.","Michael B. Polk","Well, we think the U.S. is gradually improving, as we've talked. It's interesting that we see this divergence between the macros and our underlying performance in Europe, which is interesting. The macros have worsened in Europe, yet our -- particularly, in the core countries like Germany and U.K., to a degree, France. But our business is actually strengthening, as John mentioned in his remarks. So that's a divergence. The key will be the investment profile -- if we want to sustain that momentum, the investment profile we put behind those businesses. In the emerging markets where -- I certainly read all the earnings call transcripts and see what other people are saying about the emerging markets. And the GDP dynamics in the emerging markets really don't connect at all to our own performance in those markets, because we're in the early days of deploying our portfolio, we're investing significant money and we're getting nice growth yields out of the investments we're making. So I don't think that GDP dynamics are -- have a material impact on our developing or emerging market businesses. In the developed world, obviously, if we faced a U.S. slowdown, that would be a challenge. But we don't envision that in the near term. We also don't envision some wondrous growth rates and tailwinds turning behind the business. Some of the things that are going on from a currency standpoint, so Bank of Japan last night, again, it seems to be a race to the bottom on currencies for Japan and for Europe, which creates a dynamic for us on ForEx. We've proven we can manage through that stuff this year, and we'll do our best to do that so that we can sustain the commitment to increase A&P investment in our business next year. But it sounds like it's going to be one of those dynamics years next year, where we have to manage the movements of currencies and the impact on gross margin. And we may have to embrace more pricing in some of these markets where we end up with a transaction ForEx effect beyond what we've assumed.","John K. Stipancich","And Olivia, to answer the other part of your question. I think for next year, for us to succeed, we have to continue to create momentum we have on Writing right now that we've established. And with the incremental A&P we're putting behind the brands, we should see that. Baby should be getting back -- in North America, back up to the growth that it had before as -- recall, we were hampered quite a bit in Q1 and Q2 as a result of the recall, so we should be able to get that business back to growth. And then probably the third thing is we have to execute. As Mike mentioned, our DC consolidation in Tools was a bit of a step-back for us, unfortunately. And we have a lot of plans for next year, so we're going to be flawless in our execution. Those are probably the 3 big things to make sure that we deliver on our commitments to you next year.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. And remember, the other thing that we won't have is a down elevator next year, Olivia. We don't have the -- we'll have a little bit of flow-through of the European exits into Q1, but then that will be behind us. We've taken a real -- some real lumps this year in core sales related to our repositioning of the Rubbermaid Consumer business. Well, that will continue next year. The degree to which it impacts our overall results will sequentially lessen through the year. And we're very optimistic about Commercial Products and Tools. We've got great plans in place for those businesses. So where do we end up in the core sales range? I don't know. I do know that we will see the benefit in the back half of the year as a result of Ignite and bubba coming into our core sales metrics. We've chosen to be really pure in how we manage that, so even though bubba is small, we're not counting it in core sales until -- the growth in core sales until we lap a year of ownership. And that's the right way to look at things. So you should expect our Q4 numbers to maybe push the high end or even break out above the high end. And as we move through '15 into '16, you should see our progression out of the strategic phase of the Growth Game Plan into the acceleration phase, where we've said that, consistently, we will deliver greater than 4% core sales growth. And we're right on track to do that, in my judgment.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And if I could just follow-up on SG&A. I understand that, obviously, 150 basis points of that was advertising. But even excluding advertisers -- advertising, I was surprised to hear that SG&A would have been up. So was that incremental overhead? And if so, what's driving that and how do you think about spending going forward?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. It's the absence of a couple of unique things from the prior year that create that dynamic in the quarter. So it's not -- believe me, there's no new overhead. So we're really tightly managing that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess just 2 follow-up questions. One, just in light of Project Renewal 3, and I think you're seeing the phasing of the savings somewhere maybe in the back half of '15. And also your last comment about trying to accelerate core sales above 4%. Does this allow you any flexibility in terms of accelerating the expansion into Asia? I know that's something that you're really focused more in Latin America right now and I know Asia you talked at the Analyst Day. But I was just wondering if this gives you a little bit more flexibly to kind of start that process a little bit earlier. And I have a follow-up question on something else.","Michael B. Polk","Sure. You know what, Jason? We're going to be very disciplined about how we take our Writing business into China and parts of Southeast Asia. So we're going to do the work the right way. If we can accelerate, we will. But I'm not -- we're not going to be opportunistic about that because we have to get that right. We want it to be a sustainable growth thread for us for many years to come. And so we think that's our early '16 initiative. All the funding of the research, all the planning will happen this year, and we'll see how that plays out. I don't think we're going to need any of that, nor would I use that lever as a way to strengthen core next year. I don't think we're going to need it, and we won't be ready for it. So I think that's going to stay a 2016 initiative, and I think we're comfortable with that being the right timing.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just, I think, going back to an earlier question on, I guess, the step-up in A&P. I was just wondering if you could talk maybe about the ROI that you're getting, I mean, maybe use Writing as an example during Back-to-School and kind of the replenishment there. Can you talk about the learnings that you see? Where you're happy with the spending that you're doing? Where you think that it can be strengthened? Or just maybe a little bit of context, especially as A&P is going to go up again another $50 million next year. Just wondering the evolution of the process.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So we're learning and adapting as we go. So I think Mark showed a couple of charts at the Analyst Day that really showed a strong correlation between trial and investment on new items. I think he showed a Baby chart that showed you the lock-step relationship between advertising spending and the kind of POS growth we're getting. Where we're spending our money, we see good POS momentum. Not everything has worked. That's for sure. So we learned from Tools last year on some thematic advertising that we did on the Irwin brand, and we've not repeated that this year. We'll learn on Commercial Products. I've got questions as to whether that's going to drive sell-through or whether it doesn't as strongly as we hope. I hope it does. I like the fact that it's focused on our new items in Commercial Products. But that may or may not yield the best growth return for the investments. We'll learn from that. But in general, when I look at the performance of our business, I see good point-of-sale growth rates on the things that we're spending the money on. And we see market share up across every one of our measurable categories. So whether it's Food Storage or whether it's the Writing businesses in aggregate or whether it's -- even the Goody business, which we don't talk a lot about, we see good POS momentum and share growth where we're spending some print advertising. And so we're quite pleased with the yields, the growth yields we're getting on the investments, in general, but we're not going to waste a penny. So our mindset is it's our money and we don't want to mess around with it if it doesn't drive strengthening of our brand or sell-through.","Operator","Your final question comes from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I wanted to just talk a little bit about the out-the-door pricing at retail, what you're hearing in terms of feedback from your retailers in terms of willingness to lean into higher pricing to help offset some of that cost inflation. And then secondly, just related to your A&P. I'm curious around taking some of those content assets that you've had some success with and really globalizing them. How are you thinking about some of the development behind some of the creative that you've done and how applicable is that around the world?","Michael B. Polk","So pricing is tough in static markets. And I think in the U.S., it's probably the toughest market. U.S. and Europe, it's the toughest market to land pricing without commodity inflation. So we're getting -- where we've had inflation, we've been able to price, but it's a tough conversation. And at times, it causes us to lose some of the support you would normally get from a retailer if they don't see that being in their -- pricing in their interest. We have to be disciplined about this stuff. We can't -- as commodities move on us, we're going to have to capture price, we're going to have to get the gross margin progression we're looking for through productivity. And we are being disciplined about that, even though at times it can be very painful. Outside of the U.S., we've gotten pretty good pricing traction because, in our categories at least, there's -- the core competitors are either U.S.- or European-based companies, and they all face the same transaction ForEx dynamic that we do. So pricing is never easy. But with the right lead time, with the right conversations, you can get it done, even in a tough market like North America or Europe. The transfer of insights and then marketing to new markets, we're doing it today on Writing. The work we've done on InkJoy is traveling. We're in 5, 6, 7, 8 countries now with the same advertising idea. The innovation platforms are traveling. We have to be sensitive about landing both in a locally relevant way, so I don't think that we can be simple-minded about this. You have to make sure you get the kind of traction you need with local consumers with these ideas. And so we don't want to blindly deploy. But there's lots of opportunity to take the core of an idea and move it along. And particularly within our Writing business, which is the most -- Writing and Tools, which are the most global of our businesses, we've had some success moving ideas across geography.","So with that, I think that's the last question that's on the table. We appreciate your support, sticking with us through the Q&A and through our commentary. We're pleased with our progress. We're delivering solid results in the context of a continued strong change program, and we're quite confident in the road ahead, in our ability to deliver the guidance we've articulated for both 2014 and 2015.

Our presenters today are Mike Polk, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stipancich, our Chief Financial Officer.","And I'll now turn the call over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We delivered another strong quarter of results and have terrific momentum on our business. In that context, this morning, we reaffirmed the 2016 full year guidance we provided on our last earnings call.","Before we get into the results, let me comment on three strategic initiatives. First, in late October, we completed the acquisition of Elmer's Products. Elmer's, Krazy Glue and X-ACTO represent terrific additions to our great portfolio, and will provide dry period synergies at back to school, great cross-sell potential across our channels, and together with our very fast growing Prismacolor, Paper Mate Flair and Mr. Sketch brands, strengthen our position in drawing and crafts. Elmer's sales will not contribute to core sales until the first anniversary of the completion of the acquisition.","This morning, we shared our decision to deconsolidate Venezuela. We took this decision after significant deliberation. We've concluded that the increasingly restrictive nature of regulations in Venezuela and the limited and infrequent access to U.S. dollars has resulted in the loss of the company's ability to make key operational decisions. We've taken a charge to reported earnings in Q4, and starting in Q1, we will no longer consolidate the performance of our Venezuelan operations. We've been doing business in Venezuela for many decades, and we expect to continue to manufacture and sell our products to Venezuelan consumers despite this accounting change.","Lastly, in December, we announced a definitive agreement to combine Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden Corporation. We secured committed financing to ensure deal closure, begun the process with the regulatory agencies, and have a clear and deliberate path to secure permanent financing. The process will play out over the next few months, and we expect the transaction to be completed in Q2.","We've taken these actions from a position of strength, having just finished one of the best years in our history with outstanding growth, margin and earnings delivery. So with that, let's get into our fourth quarter and full year results. In Q4, core sales grew 6.2%, the strongest quarterly core sales growth in years. Excluding Venezuela, core sales grew 4.4%. Normalized gross margin increased 80 basis points to 38.5% driven by pricing, productivity and lower input costs, which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency.","The increase in gross margin enabled a 70 basis point increase in advertising and promotion investment to 5.5% of sales. And when coupled with a 10 basis point reduction in overheads, resulted in a normalized operating margin increase of 30 basis points to 13.7%. Normalized EPS was $0.56, 14.3% ahead of prior year despite having to overcome a $0.06 negative impact from foreign currency. Our fourth quarter core sales growth was broad based, with growth in all five segments. Combined, our Win Bigger businesses grew core sales 11.3%.","Our full year results were strong as well. Core sales increased 5.5%, and excluding Venezuela, core sales grew 3.9%. Our Win Bigger businesses grew 9.4%, and our acquisitions when coupled with the core sales growth have offset the negative impact of currency and divestitures to yield 3.3% net sales growth. Despite currency pressure on cost, we expanded normalized gross margin 40 basis points to 39.2%.","Importantly, for the full year, we increased A&P investment by over 17% to 4.9% of sales. And while spending more behind our brands, we simultaneously increased normalized operating margin 50 basis points, enabled by our efforts to make Newell leaner and more efficient through Project Renewal. All this together yielded 9% normalized EPS growth despite having to absorb a negative $0.39 impact from foreign currency. Obviously, we're pleased with our results in 2015, and we have clear momentum in our business and our operating model is working.","Let me hand the call over to John to go through our results in more detail. John will also walk through the next steps in the Jarden transaction. I'll return to provide perspective on our latest view of 2016 and some thoughts on the creation of Newell Brands.","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Fourth quarter reported net sales were $1.56 billion, a 2.3% increase versus last year. The bubba, Baby Jogger and Elmer's acquisitions contributed 350 basis points to reported net sales. Core sales, which exclude the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and the 540 basis point negative impact of foreign currency, increased 6.2%, and all five of our segments grew in the quarter.","Reported gross margin was 38.3%, up 70 basis points to last year, and normalized gross margin was 38.5%, up 80 basis points. This improvement was driven by pricing, productivity and favorable commodities, which more than offset unfavorable currency. Normalized SG&A expense was $387.3 million or 24.8% of sales, up 50 basis points versus the prior year.","We continued our progress on overheads, but significantly increased our investment in advertising and promotion by 70 basis points as a percentage of sales. We invested in major campaigns for writing, including our Fine Writing business and Mr. Sketch, as well as Calphalon's SharpIN self-sharpening cutlery sets. We also invested in advertising for our food storage business and across a number of commercial products platforms. It's worth noting that for the full year, we reduced overheads by 70 basis points as a percentage of sales, plowing those savings into the 60 basis point increased investment in A&P.","Normalized operating margin was 13.7%, up 30 basis points, reflecting the benefits of Project Renewal and other cost savings initiatives, pricing and productivity, partially offset by a significant increase in strategic investment. Reported operating margin was 6.5%, down from 7.4% in the prior year due in part to higher restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration costs.","Interest expense increased $8.4 million year-over-year including expenses associated with the Elmer's and pending Jarden transactions. During the fourth quarter, we issued $600 million in medium-term notes, the proceeds of which were used to provide permanent financing for Elmer's.","Our normalized tax rate was 23.2% compared with 26.5% a year ago, and our full-year normalized 2015 tax rate landed at 23.4%, about 10 basis points down from prior year. Normalized EPS, which excludes restructuring, restructuring related and other project costs and certain other one-time items, was $0.56, a 14.3% increase to last year. On a reported basis, fourth quarter EPS was $0.05 compared with $0.19 last year, mostly driven by the gain on the sale of the Endicia business being more than offset by the noncash charge associated with deconsolidating Venezuela.","I'll now move on to our segment results, and starting with Writing, reported Q4 net sales were $466.3 million, up 11.5%, with Elmer's contributing about $37 million. Core sales were up 12.5%. Our North American Writing business delivered high single digit growth, again, fueled by strong innovation, marketing and merchandising. In Latin America, Writing core sales showed significant growth in part due to volume and pricing in Venezuela. For the full year, core sales grew 10.9% led by a great back to school pricing and new product launches.","Core sales growth in Drawing and Coloring, which includes Mr. Sketch, Prismacolor and Flair, were up over 40% in 2015. Q4 normalized operating margin in our Writing segment was 22.7%, a 200 basis point decline versus prior year as significant increased anti-investment and challenging foreign exchange more than offset productivity, pricing and cost management.","Net sales in our Home Solutions segment declined 3.7% to $441.8 million. Core sales increased 0.1% driven primarily by growth in our food storage and beverage ware business, offsetting our continued exodus in low-margin Rubbermaid consumer storage business, as well as transition of product lines in culinary. For the full year, Home Solutions core sales grew 0.8%. The segment's normalized operating margin was 12.9% for the quarter, a 30 basis point decrease, reflecting significantly increased advertising, funded in part by productivity and input cost deflation.","Our Tools segment delivered net sales of $207.7 million, an 8.6% decline. Core sales grew 1.4%. Tools delivered high single digit growth in EMEA with modest growth in North America, while Latin America declined mid-single-digits, reflecting challenges in Brazil macros and the impact on volumes as a result of pricing to cover foreign exchange. For the full year, core sales grew 2.2% in the Tools segment. Q4 normalized operating margin in this segment was 9.4%, a 10 basis point decline versus last year. The decline was driven by foreign exchange challenges in Europe and inflation in Brazil, more than offsetting productivity and disciplined overhead management.","Reported net sales in our Commercial Products segment declined 2.8% to $207.1 million driven by foreign exchange and the sale of our medical cards business earlier in the year. Core sales increased 5.8% driven by pricing and strong volume growth in North America, as well as growth in Latin America. For the full year, Commercial Products grew core sales 4.8%. Normalized operating margin in the fourth quarter was 13.3%, a 190 basis point increase to last year, thanks to pricing, productivity and input cost benefits, partially offset by higher investment in A&P.","Our Baby segment reported $237.9 million in net sales, a 13.9% increase compared to 2014. Core sales grew a very strong 10.2%. Double digit growth from Graco North America driven by strong innovation and previous advertising and promotional investments more than offset declines in EMEA and APAC. For the full year, the segment's core sales grew 6.4%. Baby's Q4 normalized operating margin was 11.7%, up 340 basis points to last year largely due to contributions from Baby Jogger and new product development, as well as the comparison against the A&P investment we made last year to stimulate growth.","Looking at Q4 sales by geography, North America core sales grew 5.7% with strong results from Writing, Commercial Products and Baby. EMEA declined 0.3% with growth from \u2013 in Tools offset by modest declines in our other EMEA businesses. In Latin America, core sales grew 29.7%, with pricing and volume gains in Writing and Commercial Products more than offsetting challenges in Tools related primarily to the Brazilian economy. And finally, Asia Pacific core sales grew 0.2% with growth from Writing and Tools offset by declines in Baby.","Operating cash flow for the full year 2015 came in at $565.8 million compared to $634.1 million prior year. Though recall in 2015, we made a $70 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. pension plan and we incurred higher restructuring and Project Renewal-related cash payments in 2015. Adjusting for these, our operating cash flow was up about 2% year-over-year.","You'll note also that we recognized a significant gain associated with the sale of Endicia in the fourth quarter, and we have about $60 million in taxes we'll need to pay on the gain, which we'll do in the first quarter and which will be reflected in our first quarter operating cash flow.","We returned $65 million to shareholders in Q4, including $50.9 million in dividends and $14.1 million to repurchase 337,000 shares. For the full year 2015, we distributed $206.3 million in dividends and $180.4 million to buy back 4.53 million shares. We suspended the repurchase of shares midway through the fourth quarter in light of the Jarden transaction.","With respect to the transaction, we continue to make great progress towards the closing of the combination. This week, we finalized our $1.5 billion three-year term loan, which will fund a portion of the purchase price. We also finalized the amendment of our revolving credit facility, including increasing the facility from $800 million to $1.25 billion to accommodate the increased seasonal working capital needs associated with adding Jarden to the family.","We continue to work in the mechanics for assuming two tranches of Jarden notes, the 3.75% coupon notes and the 5% coupon notes, which we plan to retain after the merger. We're well underway and the work seems to go to the public debt markets as we get closer to the anticipated closing in order to secure the balance of funds for the transaction, and we don't anticipate any challenges associated with the upcoming debt offer or with maintaining our committed investment grade rating. Over the past several weeks we've executed Treasury rate locks for a little over $2 billion of anticipated debt offering.","And in addition, recall that we have a fully committed bridge loan facility in place, which is available for us to utilize, if we encounter any unforeseen challenges with issuing debt at attractive rates.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, John. Let's now turn to a quick discussion of 2016, and then to some comments on the Jarden combination. This morning, we reaffirmed our 2016 full year guidance for core sales growth and normalized EPS, excluding our Venezuelan operations. Our 2016 full year guidance is for core sales growth of 4% to 5% and normalized EPS of $2.21 to $2.30. Our best estimate for delivery is at the midpoints of these ranges. Excluding Venezuela, for both 2016 and 2015 results, the midpoint of the normalized EPS range represents double-digit growth. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, the exclusion of Venezuela will negatively impact our Q1 2016 normalized EPS by about $0.03 to $0.04.","There are two key factors that will influence where we fall in the 2016 full year guidance ranges: the first being the performance of our Tools business; and the second, the impact of foreign currency. Our Tools segment had a challenging 2015, as the industrial products and services business slowed from high single-digit growth in 2014 to slight growth in the 2015. This contraction in our growth rate was most pronounced in Brazil and China. Our 2016 outlook assumes better performance driven by building IP&S momentum in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by continued sluggishness in Brazil. Our 2016 full year core sales guidance assumes low to mid single-digit growth in our Tools segment.","The second factor influencing our results will be foreign currency. Our 2016 full year guidance assumes a $0.26 to $0.28 negative impact of foreign exchange, $0.04 to $0.05 worse than our last estimate, driven by the late Q4 strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We've taken broad-based actions to deal with the expected negative forex impact with the most pricing actions already in the market. We expect that the combination of pricing, gross to net optimization, productivity, and Project Renewal-driven overhead reductions could cover the forex headwinds, while simultaneously enabling increased investment and capabilities in brand support.","In 2016, we're planning to increase A&P funding by about 20% to 5.5% of sales and continue to strengthen our Insights and eCommerce capabilities with further investments. These investments are yielding strong growth dividends. In the U.S., in 2015, we've increased value market share in 10 of the 13 product categories that IRI measures. In nine of those product categories, our IRI dollar sellout or POS grew by over 8%. These strong U.S. market share increases drove U.S. core sales growth of 4.1%, and when coupled with acquisitions, drove net sales growth of 8.8%.","The strategic choice to reposition the company from a holding company to an operating company, releasing costs through Project Renewal, such that we increase spending behind our brands and invest in an advanced set of capabilities, is clearly working. Our track record of delivery and the value-creation story derived from our accelerating growth and margin development sets the stage for the next very exciting period of transformation, as we combine our company with Jarden to create Newell Brands.","This combination will create a $16 billion consumer goods company of leading brands that compete in large, growing, unconsolidated global markets. The combination scales the company in key geographies, customers and channels, more than doubling the business in the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Japan and China. The combined portfolio is complementary and quite focused, with over 80% of revenue concentrated in just 30 brands. And there are a number of intuitive combinations of brands and categories like Graco and NUK, as well as Rubbermaid food storage and food saver that will yield greater consumer and customer impact for accelerated growth in category development.","The combined portfolio is quite profitable, with 80% of the combined revenue having a gross margin over 39% and operating margin over 15% before synergies. So, there is plenty of gross margin to work with, and with overheads focused, and in some cases, reoriented to the activities that drive growth, there will be significant potential for margin development and growth beyond what we expect to deliver through the synergies already identified.","Our ambition is to bring together and leverage the best talent and capabilities from both companies to drive strong growth, increase margins and increase cash flow through superior insights and product design, leading innovation and brand development, strategic category management and selling, delivery of the cost synergies to margin, achievement of savings beyond those assumed in the acquisition model to fund increased brand investment and enterprise-wide capabilities for growth, and after paying down debt to our target leverage ratio of 3 times to 3.5 times, active portfolio management that strengthens our positions in key categories.","We will deploy the best aspects of the playbooks from both companies to drive a highly competitive set of outcomes. We'll respect the differences in each category, channel and business model, yet simultaneously establish a set of enterprise-wide capabilities. We will scale and strengthen our selling capabilities to provide broadened access and reach for our categories and brands into new channels and customers.","We will quickly adapt both companies' rapidly developing eCommerce strengths to establish a leading capability in direct-to-consumer eCom, which is a differentiated Jarden capability, and-bricks-and-mortar and pure-play eCom, where both companies have excellent momentum. We will immediately play for procurement savings, as the combined companies buy over $9 billion in source finished goods, commodities and other services.","We will leverage our scale for distribution savings in areas like ocean freight, where combined we ship over 65,000 40-foot ocean containers a year from Asia. And of course we'll quickly convert the savings associated with bringing two public companies together, establishing a lean and agile corporate infrastructure very similar to what's in place today at Jarden.","So we'll deliver these outcomes in a structured way, extending the scope of the Newell transformation office, which is in place to ensure the delivery of Project Renewal savings to the total enterprise, including the work of integration. We're roughly 30 days into planning, and we expect to find far more opportunities once the two teams are able to fully engage with each other.","We've been conservative in our assumptions, but we'll pursue every opportunity we uncover. We have no revenue synergies, no working capital benefits, and no tax synergies in our deal economics and have a very clear line of sight to at a minimum $500 million of cost synergies.","The first $500 million of synergies is expected to create a company with EBITDA margins of over 20% and annual EBITDA of over $3 billion, giving us the firepower to reduce the leverage ratio to 3 time to 3.5 times within two years to three years and then, subsequently, to deploy capital to create further value beyond our organic agenda. As John stated in his comments, we've secured committed financing to enable deal closure and expect to maintain our investment grade rating.","We're in the process of seeking the necessary regulatory approvals and expect to secure permanent financing sometime after both companies file their 10-Ks. With the current assumptions and despite widened credit spreads, we expect the deal will deliver high single-digit accretion in year one, mid to high-teens accretion by year two, and strong double-digit accretion by year three.","So, let me close now by reiterating that we've had an outstanding 2015, delivering strong competitive results. Growth continues to accelerate and, despite unprecedented foreign currency pressure, we've increased margins and delivered very strong normalized EPS growth. Our building momentum is a function of the sharp choices we've made. We're investing to create advantaged brand development and innovation capabilities and, as a result, our innovation funnel has more than doubled since 2013, with project value up 160%.","These innovations leverage a new product design capability we've invested to create at our purpose-built design center, and we are backing our growth ideas with industry-leading marketing investment. This investment has been enabled by our determination to make Newell leaner and more efficient and to unlock the trapped capacity for growth. Coupled with the actions we've taken to strengthen our portfolio, these choices are yielding some of the strongest results Newell has ever experienced.","We're on a path to completely transform Newell Rubbermaid, delivering highly competitive and differentiated results. Our operating model is extendible to more categories, more brands, and more geographies. This is the core logic that underpins the Jarden combination. The creation of Newell Brands will now allow the best talent at both companies to apply the best of what is working at both companies across a broader, more compelling and more diversified landscape of opportunity and brands. We will build one of the most exciting companies in our industry, a destination for talent, while simultaneously unlocking an incredible amount of value for our shareholders. That is the Growth Game Plan into action. That is the future Newell Brands.","Let me now pass the line to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Mike, I guess on the top line, right, obviously, the 4.4% pace you guys did this quarter, excluding Venezuela is strong, right, and it's in a tough environment. Your guide \u2013 and you talked a little bit about it, but your guide is 4% to 5% for next year. But if the comps get a little bit tougher \u2013 obviously, we talked about Brazil and China a little bit, but can you just go through your confidence for maintaining that growth rate in a tougher environment on tougher comps? And I know part of it is the increase in A&P, but if you can go through that a little bit and express it, that would be great.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, it's the combination of the increase in spending, Chris, but also we've got the strongest innovation plan we've had since I've been here. If you remember, we changed our whole model back in the middle of 2013, and I've said that the gestation period on new ideas that were coming through our brand development organization was 18 months to 24 months. And the way these projects work is they sort of layer into the market. And so as we progress through 2016 and into 2017, we've got some of the strongest innovation ideas we've really ever had hitting the marketplace.","An example of that is in the first quarter, we'll launch new PaperMate InkJoy Gels with three times faster drying ink versus the leading gel pen for an advantaged performance. Less smearing. We'll launch Rubbermaid FRESHWORKS, which leverages our food storage business but applies a filtration, a membrane, to prevent oxidation from occurring on fresh fruits and vegetables, which should extend the produce life by \u2013 we expect to extend the produce life by nearly 80%. So you've got a whole series of innovations.","John mentioned the SharpIN knives where Calphalon's got these ceramic sharpeners in the butcher block. So every time you withdraw the knife, you have the perfectly honed blade. And so these are the examples of the kind of innovation that has started to filter into our business in late 2015 and really hits its stride in 2016. So you've got the combination of increased spending. We've really sequentially increased spending since we've been here. We've tripled the amount of advertising we're spending on these brands.","If you look at the number of GRPs we're delivering, we've actually increased it by five times since we started because we've gotten so much efficiency in buying by going to one buying agency. So we've got all of these things converging in the marketplace, which gives us the confidence that when coupled with what's a building selling system with respect to commercial execution and strengthened selling execution, those things all converge to give us confidence that 4% to 5% is deliverable, and Q4 is good evidence of that at 4.4% growth excluding Venezuela.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then just I guess two quick ones. Number one, does the Jarden acquisition at all affect the timing of the planned Writing launch in China? And then you talked about financing. Do you still think that 4% is a decent way to look at financing rates or has that crept up, you think?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me answer the first question. The answer simply is no. But we didn't have a lot built into our plans in 2016 for China. Remember, we'll launch late in Q4 to get to market in maybe one or two big cities. The team is presenting their final plans to me shortly. But one or two big cities for back to school 2017, which is in February-ish in China.","So we don't get a lot of benefit in the revenue line from China this year, but we will get some nice growth in Writing in 2017. But, no, it should not impact anything we're doing on Newell Rubbermaid. In fact, one of the most important things that both companies can do in the transition is to execute their 2016 plans flawlessly. And while there will be a lot of work going on in the center to organize the delivery of the synergies, it's really critical that each set of operating unit stays focused on the plans they've built for 2016.","So I wouldn't envision really anything materially changing for either company in terms of their core plans. On financing, yeah, credit spreads have widened since we announced the deal in December. But there's all kinds of levers we can pull to mitigate that issue. And quite frankly, the interest rate sensitivity in the overall deal is the least meaningful variable as we've looked at sensitivities. So we don't know where it will all end. I think it'll come down to the difference in tenure we could choose to place on the new debt.","And we'll make that decision based on the best economic choice for the company. And if we have to accept slightly higher interest rates for the sake of making the right economic choice, we'll do that. We'll cover it someplace else in the algorithm. And obviously, one of the big levers we have is the balance of fixed to floating rate debt we choose to deploy. But, look, we're relatively relaxed. Of course, we would have preferred to not see credit spreads widen, the widening of credit spreads for BBB- debt is \u2013 our spreads don't look any different than the market at this point.","So we're moving \u2013 while we may have moved a little earlier than the market, we're in line with the market today, and we'll just have to see how that plays out. We're not going to compromise the right long-term choice for the sake of managing to an interest rate assumption because we have so many other levers in the P&L to compensate for that in the very near term.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning. Just the first question on SG&A in the quarter. Just trying to understand how that came in versus expectations. And when I say that, I mean typically, in the past few years, you've kind of stepped up advertising promotion in the fourth quarter just to kind of get a head start on the next year. I didn't know if that happened again. And also if there were some kind of step-up of incentive comp since you look like you outperformed kind of your core projections.","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Bill. It's John. You're absolutely correct. We did step up A&P. We made also some step-ups in strategic SG&A investment as well. So, for example, e-commerce, which has been a fantastic result for us, we're plowing more resources into. And you're right on the incentive comp. That also drove up the SG&A number in light of the strengthened performance and the good finish to the year.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Also, John, just to build on that, we also placed a marker in Q4 on shopper insights. Well, we've made a lot of progress. We've doubled the amount of insight work we've done. And actually, the size of the team's up by 50% since we started in 2011. But where we haven't done as much research is in the area of shopper insights, and \u2013 because we wanted to get the fundamental consumer insight work done to support the innovation and brand agenda.","In Q4, we made the first in a series of investments we'll make in shopper insights to ensure that we're driving leading levels of category management. Joe Arcuri and his team are really focused on taking our selling capabilities sort of to the next level, bringing the best of what fast-moving consumer goods have in category management capabilities to the consumer durables space. And part of putting the fundamentals in place is establishing a good foundation of shopper insights.","So we made an investment in Q4 in that as well. We had the flexibility to do that. And as you know, with the \u2013 on the Q3 call, I mentioned that if we had the room to do more, we would invest more. And that's, in fact, what we did. It's strategic investment in A&P. It's strategic investment in structural cost and e-comm and insights, coupled with, as John said, we had a really terrific year from a performance standpoint in truing up a bonus.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's \u2013 no, thanks for the color. And then just second on the Jarden transaction, is there any way you could kind of give us an idea or a rough guess on \u2013 not a guess \u2013 on how fourth quarter numbers kind of came in for them? And there's a \u2013 seems to be a bit of consternation about their organic growth, I'm assuming it was the 2% to 3% rate just with the weather being warm, but maybe some color there. And then also, Mike, as you look forward, any kind of idea of how this works in terms of number of divisions? I mean, Jarden has three divisions but kind of 25 different key divisions, and you have five. I didn't know if you have that kind of architecture of how it would break out and how you see it splitting up.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me first comment on your question regarding Q4. Obviously, I \u2013 we don't own Jarden, and I actually don't have access to their performance data as they \u2013 they are the ones that have to communicate that. All I would say, though, is if you looked at their numbers through the middle \u2013 through the third quarter, their organic growth year to date was 5.9%. So they have terrific momentum in their business. They have an incredibly strong year ago performance in Q4 that they need to lap, and I know \u2013 I'm sure you all know this, but their organic growth in Q4 of 2014 was 11.4%. So a big hurdle to cross. No matter what way you cut it, with 5.9% banked through the end of Q3, they're going to have a very good year. And if you look at the combination of the two companies and look at their performance once you get their data, the combination's going to be pretty darn strong relative to anybody else in our industry. With them having 5.9% growth banked through Q3 and us having now 5.5% banked on the full year, that's a strong set of numbers.","And so I think our eyes are set on the future. As I've said before, I don't get kind of locked in on any kind of 90-day performance cycles. Our view is set on what's going to happen over the next three years and how to unlock the value in this combination. So, hopefully, I expressed that in a compelling way in my script. But obviously, we're very, very excited about leveraging what is terrific momentum in their business and terrific momentum in ours to bring the best of both companies together to build a set of assets and businesses that perform better than either of us would have been able to do on our own.","With respect to the design of the company, what I need our teams to do and what I know Jim Lillie at Jarden is encouraging his team to do is to just focus on delivery in 2016.","Our energy and our synergies will be focused on the things I spoke about previously and not on big sweeping org design changes. Really important to keep our eye on the ball with respect to the demand creation activities in both businesses to preserve the momentum that I was referring to earlier. We'll figure out as we get to know the business over time, we'll figure out what the right model is for the overall company. We'll do that quickly as we did when we joined Newell Rubbermaid. It's important to articulate a set of portfolio of priorities and resources, human capital, and money needs to flow to the businesses with the greatest opportunities.","And so we will do all of that work, but we're not going to walk in with a preconceived notion of that. We will do that work over time, and that will help shape our approach to how we organize. What is clear is that we will build a set of enterprise-wide capabilities that cut across both businesses, that in the areas of insight and design and innovation, that our businesses can tap into, and e-commerce, for example. So, those are really obvious opportunities, and we will obviously combine two public companies into one, and there will be changes associated with that reality. But in the operating units, we want to have everybody's head down, focused on execution of the plans that they've got in place. Both companies have a very compelling set of plans for 2016. It's really important that we execute those with excellence.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, John.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Mike. Can you talk a little bit about, aside from Brazil, maybe how some of your more economically sensitive categories are doing right now? Obviously, there are some concerns in terms of discretionary exposure particularly as we look at the combination of the two businesses. So any thoughts just in terms of economic sensitivity and how that's impacting things right now?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it's really interesting. I read a lot about it. I see \u2013 I hear a lot about it. I quoted some numbers on our U.S. POS as measured by IRI. Ten of 13 categories, increasing market share, sell-out up over 8% in nine of those 13 categories. So I've always had this point of view that ideas trump the macros, that it's our responsibility as a consumer brand company to bring ideas to market and leverage our brands with the right kind of support behind them to trump whatever environment we're in. And our growth of 4.1% in the U.S. and 8.8% in the U.S. including acquisitions should be good testimony to that.","I don't see any impact in \u2013 from a consumer perspective, in the growth of our categories, where we can measure that through IRI. I just don't see an impact at this point. The only business in our portfolio that had been sensitive to this has been the industrial products and services business, where, as I said, we went from high single digit growth in 2014 to essentially slight growth in 2015. And I previously commented that, that trend began in about October of 2014. And so we see, that's probably the only piece of our portfolio that is cyclical as our businesses evolved over the last number of years.","We are far less cyclical than we were when we started, and we're more consumer-driven than we were then. And we have way more brand support behind our brands such that they can absorb the macro cycles a lot better than they could in the past. But at the moment, I don't see the slowdown in markets or in the macros, and I don't see our customers really behaving in a particularly defensive way like they did in 2009 during the recession. So you don't hear us talking about the \u2013 a macro issue with the exception of Brazil where it's a combination of GDP slowdown and the currency impact on the business, and the need for us to price to protect margins, and cover the transaction forex effect and the intersection of that with a slower economy, creating pressure on volumes.","So that's most important to our Tools business. It's certainly a factor that's influenced our Tools performance in 2015, and the most sensitive portion of our Tools business to that type of environment is the industrial products and services segment of that business.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just a quick follow-up. You guys tweaked the language a little bit on synergies, but it doesn't appear that you're adding in, like you said, you're not adding in the revenue synergies, et cetera. So just any color in terms of the little tweak in language in terms of saying at least $500 million? And that's it for me. Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I mean, the way I'd answer that is when we look at Project Renewal and what's that \u2013 what that will generate by the end of 2017, we'll be somewhere around $700 million of annualized savings from Project Renewal. We've delivered those savings on a base revenue stream that started at $5.5 billion. So, do the math on $700 million divided by $5.5 billion, and then ask yourself whether $500 million on the base of $10 billion, which is the pro forma size of Jarden, is conservative or not conservative. So we've made a commitment to $500 million. We believe there probably is more. If we find more, which I expect we will likely do over time, as we did with Project Renewal.","Remember, it was a sequential series of unpacking of the cost structure at Newell Rubbermaid. But if we do find more, a portion of that money will be invested back into the business for accelerated performance either in capabilities or in brand support on the Jarden businesses, and some will flow to margin beyond the $500 million committed to as part of the deal. The first $500 million is going to flow to margin. What happens after that, we will leverage any cost savings beyond that, that we can find to put the work to set up a different strategic future for the company, while also passing some back to investors so that you come along for the ride.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. First, if I could just start with a housekeeping question. On the Project Renewal, the $350 million, can you give us an update where we are with that and then what's sort of the expectation for fiscal 2016 in terms of how much flexibility you have? That's the first part. And then the second part, on the Jarden transaction, Mike, it sounds like you see very little risk with respect to regulatory approval, shareholder approval, financing. I want to know if that was a fair sort of characterization. And then just the second part on the Jarden question. Have your conversations with retailers begun to change now given the added scale, particularly that's really a U.S. mass retailer sort of comment? Have those conversations already started to change? Do you feel like you're going to see some sort of benefit there from the added scale? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, on your first question regarding Project Renewal, cumulatively, so the annualized savings through the end of 2015 is $360 million. So that's banked, and that's in the bank. We have articulated a range of $625 million to $675 million in cumulative savings, but I just sort of shared with you my ambition and hope is that we get closer to $700 million when it's all said and done at the end of 2017 or into early 2018. 2016 is a big year of renewal savings delivery. We've got a lot of work that was initiated last year that flows into the P&L in 2016. We set up the transformation office in order to really establish a set of very disciplined project management capabilities. We've got teams organized along and across many different work streams. So we expect 2016 to be a banner year with respect to savings, and it's important to the overall algorithm. With respect to the Jarden transaction, I'll pass that over to John to answer.","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Hi, Kevin. The \u2013 with respect to Jarden, we don't anticipate any challenges from a regulatory standpoint or anything else. We made good progress. Obviously, both teams have been working hard together with their outside advisors. So we don't anticipate any challenges. We're still marching towards closing sometime in Q2, and no red flags. So we're in good shape.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","With respect to your question on customers, it's a little early. We're not engaging customers with one voice at this point because that would be inappropriate as two separate companies. But the general feedback on the day the deal was announced, and I know Martin got some of this feedback as well from customers from \u2013 on the announcement date, and we subsequently had them in our conversations with retailers, has been very, very positive. As you know, the combination significantly scales our presence in a number of retailers in the U.S. We put that into the web deck that we put together when we announced the deal. We'll have over $2 billion of revenue at Walmart, and I think we'll end up being probably a top \u2013 in the 8th or 9th position in terms of their overall suppliers.","And on the general merchandise side, we'll be at the top, if not near the top. I think that's very exciting. That'll lead to a really strategic set of conversations with all of our retailers where we scale. And the other thing about the combination of the companies is it opens up access to new channels for some categories. So Jarden has real strength in mass sporting goods with the Coleman brand and with some of their Action Sports businesses, that opens up opportunities for brands like Contigo and Avex where we probably never would have gotten to investing the SG&A and selling expense to access those markets, which we can now access.","And the reverse is true for Jarden. We have tremendous scale in home centers and in hardware, and in the distributive trade in the U.S. through Commercial Products and Tools, which can provide the Jarden businesses access to channels. And so it's going to be very exciting to unlock all those opportunities. I don't view scale at customer as being a leverage point with respect to negotiating. Some people think, oh, we're going to be able to yield a bigger stick at these customers. That's not how we think about engagement with our retail partners.","We think about building our business collaboratively. We have a responsibility as leaders in our categories to own the development of those categories at those retailers, and of course, we leverage our branded assets to do that. So we build share when we do that effectively. But we \u2013 share accountability with our retail partners for developing the size of the pie, the size of the categories. And that's how we approach our relationships, and we expect the combination to now be able to do that across a broader landscape of categories for our retail partners, and through that, become more of a strategic supplier to them. So unbelievable set of opportunities connected to the selling and the potential for strengthened strategic capabilities in that space.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","That's helpful color. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Bill.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you just first talk about January sell-in and sell-through trends? And then usually, you give us sort of like some color on the quarterly cadence of earnings. Is there anything funky to pay attention to this year? And then I have a follow-up on the deal.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I gave you some color on quarterly flow in Q1 and that I gave you the Venezuelan impact. If we had not deconsolidated Venezuela in 2016, would have been worth $0.03 to $0.04 in Q1. So that's some color on flow. I didn't give you the numbers for year ago, but that's slightly more than what Venezuela contributed in the year-ago period. So there's a little bit of color. We're pretty bullish on what the first half of the year has to offer because a lot of our new items ship in the first half of the year. So Rubbermaid FRESHWORKS goes, InkJoy Gels go in the first quarter. We had good performance last year; very, very good sellout performance. So we don't enter the year \u2013 you can see it in our receivables numbers. You didn't see tremendous movement in our receivables numbers year-over-year.","So that's a good sign that inventories have come down in the fourth quarter, retail inventories have come down in the fourth quarter. That's true in a number of places, I suspect. And the kind of POS and sellout that we've got going on is really encouraging. We should have very good \u2013 with good sell-through comes good sell-in, and that's set up well. We will spend more in Q1 than we did year-ago from an A&P perspective with stronger innovation, and so we're set up for a good first quarter, I think.","And obviously, the proof of the pudding is in the eating and it's not even really the end of January yet, but the green light's in the engine room. So there are always things that you've got challenges that you've got to overcome, and undoubtedly we will have those to deal with this year.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then just on the Jarden deal, can you just \u2013 just housekeeping items like what your assumption is on the interest rate on the debt. I think before you said it was plus or minus 3.5%. And then would you ever consider doing like an incremental equity deal to sort of accelerate the deleveraging? How long you think it's going to take to get to 3.5 turns of leverage? Maybe like the broader macro assumptions as you kind of did your deal math. And then lastly \u2013 I know there's a lot of questions here, but what the tax rate we should use for the pro forma company?","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Bill. It's John. So with respect to the debt, there's a couple of moving pieces, but overall, the term loan is locked. And that rate's roughly, for your modeling, 2% to 2.2%, it's a variable rate instrument. The public debt that Mike was talking about earlier, right now, we originally said yes where we modeled 4%. Credit spreads have moved, but there's still a lot of moving pieces. So we don't know where the tenor will be or how much will go with variable rate debt overall. So there's still a lot of work to do. But we're not too worried about the creep off of the 4% on the public portion of the debt. So that part is, again, work in process. And there is, as you know, a lot of market volatility between now and the time that we ultimately go to market.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then how about like the timing to get to the 3.5 leverage ratio and the macro assumptions underlying the deal, and then just the pro forma tax rate, if you have it?","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so we can \u2013 we get to that ratio, we're committed. So part of the reason why we structured the deal we did is a term loan's a three-year instrument that we have to pay down, the $1.5 billion that I mentioned earlier in my script. And so part of that is a commitment. So we get down to that 3 times to 3.5 times, two years to three years. Right now, we've modeled in a number of sensitivities. So we're very comfortable that 2.5 years from now, we'll be back in that range, give or take, absent some massive change in the underlying economic culture of the world overall. So we have good shape in terms of that.","With respect to tax right now, obviously, I think the easiest thing to do is model just the blended tax rate between the two companies, but there is opportunity. Now none of that's reflected, as Mike said, in the synergy numbers that he's talked about and so forth, and we're excited about bringing Jarden in together with us in terms of what we can do with some of our tax structures and so forth. So we definitely see upside on that. But it will take some time obviously to get the two companies together and into one tax system.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we're going to push to get to delever as quickly as we can. If you look at our numbers, and you probably haven't had time to kind of plow through them all, we've got EBITDA of around $900 million in for Newell and Jarden is \u2013 you can figure out what Jarden is. And with synergies coming perhaps a little bit quicker than what was modeled, we'll be very quickly approaching $3 billion of EBITDA. And so we're going to have lots of flexibility to pay down the debt quickly, and we will want to do that. That's the commitment we've made to get back into the range of 3 times to 3.5 times within two years to three years, but I'm hoping we can do that closer to the two years than to the three years.","With respect to the other issues on potential derailers that could undermine that, I really don't see them because we've been so conservative in the assumptions we've made on the timing of synergies, the growth rate that we built into the model. So the tax opportunities, the working capital opportunities, we should have some quick wins there that are not built into the deal economics. And it's just going to take a little bit of time to get our arms around that once we're able to more openly engage with each other, but not much time. We'll want to go for that type of stuff quite quickly.","The other thing to recognize is that the leverage ratios look high at the beginning, in part because of the timing of the year we're doing this deal. Right? So Q1 is probably the worst moment to try to convert a deal like this with \u2013 given the flow of cash flow for both companies. So the optics of our leverage ratios are pretty high, probably half a click high, at the end of the first quarter versus what they will quickly be over the next few quarters. So there's all those dynamics in place.","We've made a commitment to get down to 3 times to 3.5 times. We're going to do that in a focused way. We are prioritizing capital allocation to that outcome. And the only exception to that is the CapEx assumptions we've got in the business, which we have not compromised on CapEx investment on either business. We've blended the base plans and we won't pull back on that front. And you should expect on the Newell Rubbermaid side for us to be spending around $200 million in CapEx this year, maybe slightly above that.","And then on the dividend, we have assumed that we maintain Newell's current dividend of $0.76 per share, obviously across a higher share count, which means more cash out for that in the combination, but we believe that's an important element of our capital allocation strategy that will be and should be preserved.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just on the equity raise, would you maybe think about raising equity if it'd accelerate the deleveraging process?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's not in our line of sight right now. And doing an equity deal, not in our line of sight right now. We're going to be really focused on executing both companies' plans. Obviously, there's \u2013 if we get good momentum in the core of the business, we can think of different options as we come into 2017. But our focus right now will be on execution.","For the deal execution of the individual business plans, delivery of the EBITDA progression that's built into those two plans and it's in the deal economics and playing for more EBITDA if we can find it, either through acceleration of the synergies or through accelerated growth in the businesses, or through other means of influencing gross margin development which are also available to us.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions. One, just in the six weeks since you've announced the deal, Mike, maybe can you talk a little bit about what has surprised you more on the upside of this deal? Obviously, I know it came together over the fall kind of quickly. But \u2013 and within that, what should we anticipate when you guys talk at CAGNY? Will some of the \u2013 maybe the integration team members be with you just to get a better sense of the deal and investors getting more comfortable with it? That's the first question.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I don't think you should expect us to go deep into the integration at CAGNY because again, we will not be combined at that point, the two companies. We will lay out where we see the opportunities, and those opportunities will be articulated based on the thinking that went on in the fall and conversations that have happened with senior management since that time. But the planning stages are early on. It's a little premature for us to be doing a deep dive on exactly what we're going to do when in a couple of weeks. That said, I'll lay it out. I'll visually present what I just described to you in the earnings call in a little bit more detail to give you some evidence of where the opportunities are and talk about the ambition we have for the business.","But I would expect the more detailed discussion to happen after the shareholder votes and after the transaction is consummated. That's when we'll get into some far more detail. Our focus, though, will be on engaging both sides of the house in understanding where their business opportunities are, learning the Jarden businesses, and then after a period of work and thinking about those, bringing that back together into an integrated approach and strategy for the company.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Of course, we'd provide guidance for 2016, revised guidance for 2016, and we will provide perspective on the out years, once the transaction's completed.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's fair enough. And then, I guess, the other question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape maybe in the U.S. Yeah, especially as I think the economy is a little bit more skid-ish, you're seeing a little bit of commodity deflation coming through. I know it may not affect you directly as it does other staple companies, but I'm just wondering if you could talk about any categories where you might be seeing a little bit more pressure or competitors trying to this thwart the innovation that you're bringing out.","And within that point, I know you kind of gave us the outlook for Tools for 2016, but I was just wondering if maybe you can kind of give us a framework for core sales in the other segments too. Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we typically don't guide core sales by segment, but I think you should expect Writing to have another very good year albeit without the benefit of Venezuela. You should expect Baby to have a very good year as well. We've got terrific momentum there, with great innovation coming. Commercial products, I think you should expect another year of good progress. And you'll see probably the most change in Home Solutions, where Rubbermaid has a whole series of innovations that are coming to market like, FRESHWORKS, like Fasten+Go, which is effectively taking our LunchBlox concept and executing an adult version of a lunchbox for work. And so that'll come. And then in the back half of the year, we've got another exciting food storage innovation that I won't disclose now that, really, will be very, very cool and fun to see how consumers respond to.","So, we've got three big innovations in Rubbermaid coming this year. We've got a big year on beverages, as we continue to develop and build the Contigo, Avex, bubba and Rubbermaid brands in this space, so \u2013 and Calphalon is going \u2013 Calphalon and Goody will go through complete relaunches. We saw some weakness in Calphalon in the fourth quarter as we're transitioning out of product lines and into new product lines, which start flowing in here in the middle of Q1.","So, we've got a full facelift going on, on Calphalon, and we've got the Goody brand relaunch, which is set for the second quarter of this year. So, I think Home Solutions will probably be the place where you see the most change. We will continue in the \u2013 to continue to optimized Rubbermaid consumer business by continuing to pull back on consumer storage, the less profitable end of that business.","So, some of the positives that I was just referring to will be partially offset by continued contraction in that portion of the business, as we look to reposition the Rubbermaid brand to play in areas where the brand can be differentiated. And through differentiation comes higher gross margins. Through margins, comes higher affordability to invest and really create the renaissance in Rubbermaid that we hope to deliver over the next couple of years.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, guys.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. I guess, first, and, Mike, you sort of touched on this earlier. In terms of the need to invest behind the Jarden brand, it sounds like you don't see a big catch-up period here, given that the first $500 million of cost save will drop to the bottom line effectively. But how do you think about your need to invest behind the Jarden brands? And secondly, how does the acquisition impact your goal of getting to A&P spend of about 7% of sales?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, yeah, let me take the second part of the question first. The acquisition will not impact our drive to get the Newell Rubbermaid portfolio to 7% of sales. As I said in 2016, we'll get that ratio up to 5% \u2013 probably around 5.5%. And so, we continue on that journey to the 7% threshold. And we think that happens in 2018, maybe a little bit of a bleed over into 2019, depending on how the renewal cost savings flow through to the P&L. So we don't see any interruption in that drive.","On the Jarden businesses, we're just getting to know these businesses. I will tell you, all you have to do to understand the Jarden businesses and whether they have the algorithm right is look at 5.9% core sales growth through the nine-month period in 2015. That would suggest that there are a lot of things going right in these businesses.","Of course, we believe in brands. And if we can find the flexibility beyond the first $500 million to find savings, we're going to want to invest back into brands. We believe that our design capability, which is enabling the step-up in innovation on the Newell Rubbermaid side of the family, is applicable more broadly across more categories. In order to fund that, we'll have to invest some money to extend the shoulders of that capability, to be able to potentially help some of the Jarden businesses, but \u2013 and, of course, if we're going to \u2013 if we can strengthen innovation in these businesses through that design capability, we're going to want to put advertising and promotion money behind it to stimulate awareness and trial of the new ideas. But I think if there was a place where you could or should expect us to explore investing, it's in that area.","And we, of course, across the total landscape are going to continue to invest in eCommerce. For Newell Rubbermaid in the fourth \u2013 in the full year, our eCommerce contribution in the U.S. to our POS growth was something close to 14%, which if you go all the way back to our Analyst Day in May of 2012, you can look at what we quoted there as the contribution to revenue. And you see this big step up. That's, in part, a function of the investments we've made. We expect to make investments across the total enterprise in eCommerce. We'll fund that through any savings that comes beyond the $500 million.","Now, unlike what we did with Project Renewal, where the first couple of tranches of savings went fully back into the business, you should not expect us to do that with anything beyond the $500 million that we find. Some of this is going to flow back to investors for margin development beyond what we've committed to with the first $500 million, and some of it will flow back into the business. How that ratio breaks down, yet to be determined. We have a lot of work to do to understand the opportunities.","I had the opportunity to meet Hope Margala and her team up at Yankee last week just to say hello and get to know them. They've got all kinds of really interesting things going on there. And so, I suspect, as we get into these businesses, we will see and find all kinds of opportunities that, hopefully, by bringing the companies together, we'll be able to plus up, just like Jarden has historically done, as it has bought businesses and integrated into the company.","And look at the progress on Yankee. I used to be on the board there in 2005, 2006. They've got a big dynamic business in Europe that didn't exist when I was there. And that's happened since the Jarden acquisition. So, there's plenty of evidence that, that work is already underway, and the question is can you overlay more funds to really unlock the upside in any of those areas that are particularly attractive?","And, again, too early to say where you'd place those bets or whether you can find the money beyond the $500 million, although our judgment tells us there's more to be found there. And we should go get that money, so we can put it back into the business for growth acceleration.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Very helpful. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Wendy.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. So, could you talk a little bit about Writing and the operating margins there? I know you talked about both foreign exchange and a higher investment spending pressuring the op margin in the fourth quarter. But it's been a while since we've seen op margins go down to the tune of 200 bps, so, \u2013 and I know it's only one quarter and, still, for the year, they were up, but I'm just wondering kind of where we are with your commitment to higher spending going forward, with the China launch, and all that kind of good stuff. Just on that business, specifically, do you think 25% is kind of the right\/peak operating margin, or do you still think there's room for margin expansion ahead?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, in any given quarter, the margin will flow depending on how much investment we've put in. Yeah, we said we spent more money in A&P than we were planning on spending in the quarter, and Writing was the beneficiary of that which should almost always is. The \u2013 but we don't have a target margin for businesses. I mean, anything over 20%, in my experience, is a really exciting place to be, because if you grow, you really create a ton of value. So I don't \u2013 but I don't envision us drifting down to that level. But I also don't want to target and peg 25% operating income margin as a target margin for the Writing business, because I feel like we might constrain the opportunities for growth.","As we move Writing into new geographies, there's sort of an SG&A bubble you have to accept in front of the \u2013 ahead of the revenue stream. And our ambition is to deploy this portfolio as broadly as it is relevant to deploy it over the next five to ten years. So, there will be periods where there's a cost of growth associated with that choice that'll be covered by some other business, just like you saw some of the businesses cover Tools investment in 2014. You see other businesses covered Baby investment at the beginning of this year. We'll now see Baby margins come back to fund other investments in Home Solutions.","And so we manage this money very dynamically, and we don't let it get trapped in any particular segment. The leadership team allocates resource, and in any given period, operating \u2013 you should expect the operating income margins to flex up and down, depending on what investment plans we're making.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Got it. And to the point of sort of your ability to, I don't know, reallocate resources and manage it all, I think you've talked in the past how SAP has helped to a certain extent, and how you expect SAP will help more going forward. But, specifically, to the Jarden transaction, I think one of the concerns that I've heard from investors is just the complexity of that business and the scope, and the breadth, and all of that. So can you tell us, are they on SAP? How quickly do you think it will take to bring them onto your systems, so that you can preserve that great sense of management of the numbers and management of the business?","And then just the last thing on that transaction, specifically, obviously, investors have kind of shown that there's a fair amount of concern about the transaction and all of that. Can you address, internally, within Newell, what the response among the employees has been to the transaction? Obviously, Tarchetti's excited about it, but what about everybody else? Do they feel like you're going down a different path than they thought you were? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. That's a great question. Let me answer that one last, then maybe John can provide some perspectives, so that it's not biased by me, because I'm obviously very excited about it too. I think people are really energized by this, because they've seen what's happened here and they now, \u2013 most people are probably thinking, gosh, there's all kinds of opportunity for me personally to go work in different types of businesses over time.","And I get the sense there's a lot of excitement about this. The group's been through a ton of change, so they understand how to \u2013 and they're resilient as all heck to be able to absorb the rhythm of change that we've had over the last number of years. But there's a lot of excitement. There's pride in the fact that we're creating something big and special that could really be very, very exciting. But maybe, John, you should answer that last part rather than me.","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So, Wendy, I'll add some color in a second. With respect to the systems, so part of Jarden is on a version of SAP, but we're fairly comfortable that we'll be able to get them and get our arms around their systems relatively quickly. Obviously, they have a great business, and they've run their business extremely well, so they certainly understand their numbers. And we're encouraged coming in that we can kind of get to a common nomenclature and common vocabulary relatively quickly. Our IT guys are really excited to work with them. And, certainly, I think we can give them some perspective on things that have worked well for us.","As Mike said, it's really consistent with taking the best of both companies. So, we also have some things I'm sure we can learn about them and get a little more leverage out of our systems overall. So, comfortable to get our arms around the business fairly quickly, and certainly, in our meetings with them, they clearly have their arms around the business, so we're very comfortable with that.","In terms of the excitement, certainly, it's not something I think that many of the employees expected, but we're excited. We're excited about the progress that certainly Mike and the team has made over the past five years to put us in this position, to be able to rewrite the future for this company. And that's what people are mostly excited about now.","We look at the opportunity now with Jarden and things that we think we can do as we broadened our set of capabilities across a number of different new categories and new brands. And as Mike said, as well as the synergies, places where Jarden has been very successful, and we haven't been as successful in certain channels. So, there's a lot of excitement.","We know it's going to be a lot of work. It's been a lot of work for a number of people for the past three months to four months, but it's going to be a great combination, overall. So it's \u2013 we're a little bit disappointed. Maybe some people don't see it that way, but for us, we only see upside.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think the market's reaction, I'm not even going to focus on it, to be honest with you, because the opportunity is in front of us. It's not in the moment. And so, the opportunity is to bring this combination together and create the value release that will naturally occur, but more importantly, strategically, to create one of the leading consumer-branded companies in the world, and certainly, a leader in the durable space, where nobody's going to be able to have the capabilities we have. We'll have the affordability to invest in a really advantaged set of branded development capabilities that should enable us to trump the competition. We'll compete in category. Country sales against lesser competition is quite small.","So if we want \u2013 if we \u2013 as we set this company up to be managed the way we manage things today, where we \u2013 a senior group of people, leaders from each of the business has come together every year to allocate resource, as we allocate those against the businesses with the greatest right to win, we should see really tremendous release of value and growth. And that will create a very, very exciting story going forward.","We're on a risk-on scenario and a risk-off environment at the moment because of the leverage that we need to raise to bring these two companies together. And that is why we have the clarity, the security and the sense of what will happen next to give us the confidence that what we've said about maintaining investment grade, getting the deal financed, getting the deal \u2013 having the deal deliver a high single-digit accretion year one and mid-teens to high-teens in year two, and strong double-digit accretion in year three, we have the confidence and line of sight to all the moving parts in that algorithm to give us the security that the risk-on increase is appropriate for our company.","The market doesn't have access to everything that we've got access to if we don't have the opportunity to talk as explicitly as we'd like to, to the market until the transaction's consummated. So, we're in that period where there's uncertainty in a risk-off environment. And I'm sure that's creating pressure.","We will, over time, in a very deliberate way, articulate our vision for the company, what we believe is going to be possible through the combination. And I am certain we will find more opportunity the more time we have to engage with the partners, and we \u2013 on the Jarden side. And we intend to bring the best of both together to bear on this collection of categories that are really quite strategic. The opportunity is quite strategic. These are large growing categories with unconsolidated markets. And the brand portfolio is powerful, because we have leading positions in those categories. And so, there's so much roll-up potential, either organically or through a combination of organic and external development, that you just sort of feel like a kid in a candy store in terms of the potential opportunities ahead.","We're going to do this deliberately, we're going to do this with putting the best people on the field that we can to unlock the upside, and we couldn't be more excited by what's ahead. But our line of sight goes beyond the next 90 days or 30 days, it's the next three years. And it's putting in motion the set of choices that I think we will illuminate over time for the market, but we are certain, we'll unlock the value we have represented to you, if not more.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray.","Lauren M. Wolff - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. This is Lauren Wolff.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Steph.","Lauren M. Wolff - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. This is actually Lauren Wolff calling in for Steph. Switching gears a little bit, we've seen some significant momentum over the past year within the Baby business in particular.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yup.","Lauren M. Wolff - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Do you think this level of growth is sustainable into 2016 and beyond? And would you be able to provide any additional color about the innovations that you mentioned earlier?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I wouldn't count on the 10% type of growth levels as being something that's sustainable every quarter, but we've got a lot of innovation coming in Baby. We're excited about Baby. The combination actually potentially brings together some really exciting opportunities, particularly, with NUK and Baby Jogger. And there are a couple of European soothing businesses, as well, that Jarden has. So, we've got some tremendous opportunity here. We love our Baby business. It's a different business than the rest, in that, on our side of the family, we've outsourced the manufacturing to a strategic partner. So, our gross margins are dilutive to the total company performance. But because we don't own the assets, our return on invested capital is quite high. It's just next to Writing in terms of its value-creation potential if we grow.","So when you grow Writing \u2013 when you grow Baby, you create a ton of value for investors, to the ROIC and RONA, return on net assets, is so high, just shy of Writing's levels. And Writing's levels are margin-driven, Baby's levels are driven by the absence of fixed assets in a very short value chain, because most of our retail partners, many of them DI, direct import, from the point of departure in Asia. So, we have a very short value chain, inventory chain.","So, this is a great business. We expect to grow it. I think if I were building a model for the next number of years, I'd be building sort of mid-single digit growth. There will be a moment in time when China opens up as a huge market. There is now car seat legislation in place, not yet being enforced, but that will create a car seat market over time. And when that happens, we want to be right in the middle of the growth that will come with Baby gear.","Our business is sourced from China, so we've got great presence there. So that if and when that market opens, we will be in a position to participate in a more material way than we do today. But that will \u2013 when that moment comes, that will trigger a different level of growth for the company in that segment. So, I think the right planning stance is mid-singles.","Lauren M. Wolff - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks. That's helpful.","Operator","And your next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser with B. Riley.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Linda.","Linda B. Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Hi. Can you just comment? You named a few things about why operating cash flow was down year-over-year? Can you remind us, how did the $566 million do relative to your original guidance range? And then do you have some guidance on that for 2016, excluding Jarden? And to meet those leverage ratio targets, do you think you're going to have to step up initiatives like on working capital? Or do you think you can just get to those leverage ratios kind of status, just kind of operating cash flow without any special efforts in the working capital area?","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Good morning, Linda. So, we generally don't guide with respect to operating cash flow overall. So, we won't give you any guidance numbers for 2016 or 2015. I will give you an explanation where we landed for 2015 versus 2014. Essentially, we were up about 2% if you take out the $70 million pension payment that we made in 2015 to get our pension plan up to about a 93% funded status. And then we had a little more cash spend on Project Renewal and some other restructuring costs overall.","In terms of focus on cash going forward, the model was built without any working capital improvements, but there are plenty of working capital improvements for the transaction as well as on our side. As we've talked about before, our inventories, we can do a little better job on. Overall, we've built some inventories this year for growth and so forth, but we know we can do a better job managing inventories as well as managing the other pieces of working capital. So, that will be a focus. It'll be part of our incentive plan next year that we talked about because of the importance of delivering on cash.","Overall, for us, in terms of getting down our leverage ratio down, as Mike said, as quickly as we reasonably can to the 3 times to 3.5 times ratio. But again, good focus on cash. So, we made good progress in Q4 as well on inventory, so I'm relatively comfortable that we have line of sight to a another strong year for 2016.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just to punctuate the point John made, we've recommended to the board that our 2016 \u2013 the Newell Rubbermaid 2016 bonus program, the short-term incentive program, include a component on operating cash flow. And so, obviously, cash flow matters a lot, and operating cash flow matters a lot in the context of this deal. So, we will put some skin in the game for our employees with respect to really moving the needle on operating cash flow.","Like John said, we don't guide, but you can be assured it's going to be a focal point for us. There's a lot of opportunity in working capital, as I've said, over time, and this is the time to go get it. We have not assumed any benefit, we've just blended the programs that existed from both companies in our geoeconomic assumptions. So you can rest assured cash is king in the coming years and really ought to be all the time. And you should expect us to really move the needle on this over time.","And again, I think we've got a very clear line of sight to being able to get down into the leverage ratio range that we've committed to. And I'm hopeful that we can do that closer to the two-year horizon than the three-year horizon. But our commitment is to do that within two years to three years.","Linda B. Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Steve.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Great. Thanks. Maybe just carry on the cash theme. Can you talk a little bit about how the deconsolidation of Venezuela impacts the operating cash flow sources and uses outlook that you'd communicated back in September? I mean, obviously, FX has shifted as well, but you had said about $5 billion between 2016 and 2020, with about $2.4 billion sort of uncommitted after CapEx and dividends and base-level repurchases. I'm just curious, obviously, before considering Jarden, if the outlook is materially different now with Venezuela carved out?","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, with respect to the cash generation, the sources and uses, the cash flow write-off for us going forward, the difference will be about $50 million on an annual basis. So, it doesn't materially change the numbers that we've put together in terms of the sources and uses of cash overall.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the other thing I'd say is that all the modeling we did with the rating agencies, all the modeling we did on the geoeconomics assumed Venezuela out. So, everything that we've articulated externally excludes Venezuela.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","All right. That's great. Thank you very much. And then just, I guess, one clean-up on Writing, if I could. So, I think growth in the segment was about 6% this quarter ex Venezuela, you can correct me if that's wrong, and I think you said high single digits in North America, which implies that growth kind of internationally ex Venezuela was very modest. And just any commentary on that, and how you expect sort of North America versus international to trend in 2016, that'd be helpful.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so we have three different Writing businesses. We have a Fine Writing business, we have the DYMO business, which gets consolidated in our Writing segment, and then what we call Writing & Creative Expression. Writing & Creative Expression is growing very, very well. This is where Sharpie and Paper Mate and Expo and Prismacolor, they all live in that cluster. Fine Writing has been less positive, the growth rate. And your observation is accurate. Growth in Europe was not as strong as we believe it can be over time, in part, because WACE growth, or Writing & Creative Expression growth, was offset by Fine Writing declines.","And so we're in the midst of repositioning our Fine Writing portfolio in Europe, pulling back on some of the low-end portions of that portfolio, so that we focus brands like Parker and Waterman on the high-end portions of that portfolio. So, that is what contributed to Europe's sort of modest Writing results. Terrific growth on Writing & Creative Expression in markets like the UK and in France offset by Fine Writing contraction in the same geographies. Over time, you should expect our Writing business to become more dominant and present in the core, which is Writing & Creative Expression.","We've got a terrific plan in place for our Writing business in 2016. I think you should plan for like performance in your models for 2016 as we delivered in 2015, ex Venezuela. And while we haven't quoted a specific number for Writing ex Venezuela, and you shouldn't expect us to, you're in the general ballpark with your analysis.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Helpful.","Operator","And your final question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Rupesh.","Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. So, my first question, Mike, has to do with innovation. Throughout the call, you made a lot of commentary about all the innovation you expect this year. Is there any way to quantify the impact of innovation this year maybe versus a prior year? And a follow-up question, as consumers continue to migrate more online to buy their products, how does your delivery of innovation change with that dynamic of consumers buying more online?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, great questions. I'll give you some perspective on innovation. So, when we evaluate the impact that innovation's having in our business, we look at what we call the vitality rate or the innovation rate and we measure innovation rate as the percentage of our revenue that's been touched by innovation launched in the last three years. And when we started in 2013 with the new model, our innovation rates were quite low, in the low teens type of level. And as we enter 2016, we're getting very close to what we have as our long-term objective for the innovation rate, which is 30%.","And so this is a vitality rate or an innovation rate that the best consumer goods companies would consider the gold standard. And we're well on our way to getting there. We will get there in 2016 with the pipeline of ideas that are coming to market.","Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. And then maybe just one housekeeping question. Is it possible to get the 2015 gross margin rate and SG&A margin rate, excluding Venezuela?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't typically communicate that, but I'll let Nancy \u2013 and you guys try to triangulate around what that would be. But the way you should think about it, it's not that big of a deal, with respect to its impact on overall margins. It may be slightly \u2013 it may hurt us a bit on operating margin but not at gross margin. So, I think it actually may help us with VZ out of gross and hurt us with the operating income margin, because we don't spend a ton of money in A&P there. But just modestly, not as much as you might think.","Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Polk for closing remarks.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thanks very much, LeeAnn, and thank you to all on the call for your interest in our company. And most important thank \u2013 importantly, thank you to all the Newell people who work tirelessly to make these results happen. And to our future colleagues at Jarden, who have worked tirelessly as well over the last few months with our team to pull this transaction together, I think together we're going to make a great team.

And now, I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call.","I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to update you today on our work to transform Newell Brands into one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world. We've made great progress in 2016 and have very good momentum on a number of different fronts as we enter 2017. We achieved solid fourth quarter and strong full-year results. Full-year core sales growth of 3.7% was at the high end of our original 2016 full-year guidance range of 3% to 4% with excellent results on our Writing, Baby, food, beverages, appliances, and Waddington businesses.","We delivered nearly 4% core sales growth in both North America and EMEA and over 10% core sales growth in Latin America for the full year. Full-year normalized earnings per share was $2.89, also at the high end of our original 2016 full-year guidance range of $2.75 to $2.90; an increase of nearly 33% compared to prior year. We have aggressively deleveraged the balance sheet, paying down over $2 billion of debt in the nine months since the creation of Newell Brands.","Importantly, over the summer, we completed a comprehensive strategic assessment of the company and have driven into action a new corporate strategy that strengthens the portfolio through both acquisitions and divestitures; focuses resources on the categories with the greatest right to win; invest in broadened growth capabilities like insights, design, and innovation; and creates an enterprise-wide ecommerce division that will have responsibility for our ecomm growth across our total portfolio.","The flexibility to invest in these new capabilities and behind our brands is enabled by our commitment to drive down the cost structure of the company. In 2016, we delivered over $210 million of incremental cost savings through synergies and Project Renewal, driving procurement synergies through the scaling of the company, consolidating 32 business units to 16 divisions, reshaping our selling teams in the U.S. to enterprise-wide customer development teams at our top-20 U.S. retailers, and creating global functions in IT, legal, and the key corporate disciplines in finance and human resources.","We exit 2016 with tremendous momentum on our savings programs and with a clear line of sight to more than $300 million in incremental savings for 2017. Importantly, the speed with which we are identifying and actioning new projects is accelerating. Clearly, we're making very good progress and, as you know, we will not stop at $500 million. Delivering more than $500 million in cost synergies is the key to increasing spending behind our newly-acquired brands in 2018, as our broadened and strengthened innovation funnel begins to yield projects to market on brands like Yankee Candle, Coleman, Sunbeam, and Oster.","These are great brands with tremendous potential, and our 2016 research confirms our preconceived positive views with a number of product concepts evaluated yielding very strong concept test results. In the fourth quarter alone, we tested 71 new product concepts on legacy Jarden brands and the results were very strong. When coupled with the strength in commercial capabilities we're building, we expect this pipeline to yield an acceleration in core growth rates to the 3% to 5% in 2018 and beyond.","As you all know, the macro environment has not been the most favorable over the last few years with slow GDP growth compounded by foreign exchange headwinds. While we may soon reach an inflection point where we begin to see more favorable GDP growth, our plans do not count on that happening this year. We take confidence in the fact that we've always handled macro and other challenges in stride, and you can count on us to do our best to do the same this year.","We are fully engaged with our retail partners as they and we adapt to the changing shopping behaviors and the accelerating bricks-to-clicks migration. We're leaning in on ecommerce investment, and because we have scale advantage of an enterprise-wide capability, we are very well-positioned to win with consumers and customers.","As we exit 2016, our ecommerce business has revenue of over $1 billion, has grown over 30% compounded over the last three years, and we expect will more than double and grow by over $1 billion by 2020 as we extend our capabilities across our categories and around the world. 2016 has been the most transformative year in our history, and we're very pleased with the scope, speed, and impact of the transformation. In the context of unprecedented change, we believe our 2016 results were outstanding. And we have a proven track record of delivering the outcomes we commit to and fully expect to deliver transformative value creation and sequential growth acceleration through 2017 and into 2018 and beyond.","With that as a preview, let me hand the call over to Ralph to discuss Q4 results, and then I'll return to provide prospective on our view of 2017. Ralph, over to you.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone.","As Mike noted, we made significant progress throughout 2016 in transforming our organization. We achieved 3.7% core sales growth while delivering over $210 million in synergies and Project Renewal savings and progressed deleveraging the balance sheet. We also refined our portfolio with some strategic divestitures and acquisitions. Our fourth quarter results were solid and in line with guidance.","Fourth quarter reported net sales were $4.14 billion, a 165% increase versus last year, which was largely attributable to the Jarden transaction. Core sales increased 2.5%, driven by strong results from the Writing, Baby, Home Solutions, and Outdoor Solutions businesses. For the full year, core top line increased 3.7%.","The year-over-year improvement in operating results down the income statement was driven by a number of overarching themes: strong operating income growth on the legacy business, the profit contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions, and Project Renewal savings and synergies on the positive side. Partially offsetting those positives were the impact of increased advertising and promotion investment, negative foreign currency, increased amortization of intangibles, and higher interest expense, tax rate, and share count.","Reported gross margin was 36.8% compared with 38.3% last year. Normalized gross margin was 37.2% compared with 38.5% last year. The declines in reported and normalized gross margins were driven by the negative mix effect related to the Jarden transaction, the deconsolidation of Venezuela, and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency, which more than offset the benefits of synergies, productivity, and pricing.","We reported SG&A expense of $976 million, or 23.6% of sales, a 710-basis-point decline versus last year despite higher acquisition and integration costs. Normalized SG&A expense was $861 million, or 20.8% of sales, a 400-basis-point decline. The improvement in SG&A to sales ratios both on a reported and normalized basis is driven by the mix effect from the Jarden legacy businesses, which have historically carried a lower SG&A spend rate, as well as benefits from Project Renewal savings and transaction-related synergies, which more than offset the impact of incremental advertising and promotion investment in the quarter.","During the fourth quarter, we increased our A&P investment by $40 million from the third quarter levels. Reported operating margin was 12.4% of sales compared with 6.5% in the prior year. Normalized operating margin increased 260 basis points to 16.3% of sales when compared to the prior year. Interest expense of $124 million rose $99 million year-over-year reflecting higher borrowings used to finance the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions. We anticipate 2017 interest expense of around $475 million.","Our reported tax rate was 57.7% compared with last year's reported rate of 14.1%, reflecting a $164 million onetime deferred tax charge related to the planned Tools divestiture, partially offset by $40 million deferred tax benefit related to foreign statutory rate changes primarily affecting Jarden-acquired intangibles.","The normalized tax rate was 29.8% compared with 23.2% in the previous year, with the increase driven by the unfavorable mix impact of the Jarden acquisition and the absence of certain discrete tax benefits compared with the prior year. For the full year, our normalized tax rate was 27.3%, in line with our guidance. We now expect the 2017 tax rate to be about 23%, reflecting anticipated discrete tax benefits. We ended the quarter with 485.9 million diluted shares outstanding, up from 268.1 million shares in the prior year, with the year-over-year increase reflecting shares issued for the Jarden acquisition. For modeling purposes, we are now assuming weighted average diluted share count to be approximately 492 million shares in 2017.","Reported EPS was $0.34 compared with $0.05 last year which was affected by charges associated with our deconsolidation of Venezuela. Normalized EPS, which excludes the transaction-related expenses and certain other charges, was $0.80, a nearly 43% increase versus last year.","Now turning to our segment results, fourth quarter net sales in Writing declined 0.8% due to the negative impact of foreign currency and the deconsolidation of Venezuelan operations. Core sales in Writing increased 4.3%, reflecting strong results in the Writing & Creative Expressions, Dymo Office, and Elmer's businesses, partially offset by planned complexity reduction initiatives. Elmer's is included in core sales as of October 23. For the full year, core sales in Writing increased 8%.","Net sales in Home Solutions declined 11.5% for the quarter, due primarily to the divestiture of the Decor business. Core sales, which exclude the Rubbermaid consumer storage totes business that is held for sale, increased 5.7%, largely driven by results from the beverage business and the launch of Rubbermaid Brilliance food storage containers in Food. For the full year, core sales in Home Solutions grew 2.6%.","Net sales in Tools declined 4.6% due to the negative impact of foreign currency and ongoing macro-driven slowdown in Brazil. Core sales were less than $8 million since the vast majority of that business is held for sale.","Net sales in Commercial Products grew 0.9% and core sales increased 0.8%, reflecting stabilization in North American distributive trade channel despite ongoing planned complexity reduction activity. For the full year, core sales in Commercial Products declined 0.4%.","Net sales in Baby increased 1.6%, despite the impact of a planned transition from a distributor-led model to a direct selling model in Canada. Core sales, which exclude the Teutonia business that is held for sale, grew 3.6%, reflecting continued strong sales momentum in the U.S. from Graco and Baby Jogger. For the year, core sales in Baby increased 8.5%.","Now turning to legacy Jarden segments, I will refer to net and core sales as compared with pro forma results for the same period in 2015. Full-year comments refer to results from April 16 through the end of the year compared with pro forma performance for the same period in 2015.","Net sales in Branded Consumables declined 0.1% due to the negative impact from foreign currency. Core sales, which exclude the businesses that are held for sale, including Lehigh, Pine Mountain, and part of Diamond brands, increased 2.3%. Strong growth at Waddington, Yankee Candle International, and Yankee Candle eCommerce was partially offset by weaker performance in Yankee Candle's mall-based retail stores, related largely to lower holiday retail mall foot traffic. For the full year, core sales in Branded Consumables increased 2.9%.","Net sales in Consumer Solutions were essentially flat, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency. Core sales, which exclude the U.S. Heaters, Humidifiers and Fans business that is held for sale, grew 0.3%. as certain U.S. retailers adjusted their post-Black Friday replenishment orders despite high single-digit U.S. POS growth for our businesses. For the full year, core sales in Consumer Solutions grew 5.2%.","Net sales in Outdoor Solutions increased 3.8%. Core sales, which exclude the Winter Sports business that is held for sale, grew 2.9%, reflecting strong performance in the Fishing, Marmot, and Rawlings, partially offset by declines on Coleman related to early 2016 distribution losses. For the entire year, core sales in Outdoor Solutions were flat.","Net sales in Process Solutions decreased 0.6%. Core sales grew 0.8% compared with prior year due to increases in the plastics and zinc businesses. For the full year, core sales in Process Solutions increased 4.7%.","During the quarter, we generated $991.5 million in operating cash flow compared with $278 million in the prior year. The significant increase reflects the contribution from the Jarden acquisition and improved working capital results. For the full year, our operating cash flow came in at $1.8 billion, up from almost $566 million in 2015.","During the quarter, we distributed $92 million in dividends to shareholders, and for the entire year we returned $329 million. We ended the year with a gross debt balance of $11.89 billion, as we paid down over $800 million in debt during the quarter. We are right on track with our deleveraging plans. Since the Jarden transaction closed, we have repaid over $2 billion in debt and we continue to make steady progress towards our 3 to 3.5 times leverage goal ahead of the initial plan. We expect the Tools divestiture to be completed in the first quarter and we'll use the U.S.-based proceeds to delever further.","In summary, we are pleased with the continued progress we have made during the quarter and we delivered on our commitments during a time of significant transition.","At this point, I'll turn the call back to Mike.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Ralph.","Let's now turn to a discussion on 2017 guidance and the outlook for the year. This morning, we updated our 2017 full-year guidance for core sales growth and normalized EPS and provided guidance for the first time on full-year net sales. We've added a net sales guidance range in 2017 given the scope of mergers and acquisitions activity and the continued volatility of foreign exchange.","Our outlook for 2017 net sales is $14.52 billion to $14.72 billion, which represents 9.5% to 11% net sales growth compared to prior year. The guidance reflects our current expectations for the timing of acquisitions and divestitures, the latest view of foreign exchange which has worsened from our prior guidance, and our latest view of core sales growth.","The company has adjusted its 2017 full-year guidance range for core sales growth to 2.5% to 4%, lowering the bottom of the range from the original guidance of 3%. This revised outlook reflects our expectation of continued bricks-to-clicks shopper migration, causing some retailers to rebalance store count, reduce inventories, and reconfigure ordering patterns as some retailers did after Black Friday this past quarter.","The 25 basis point reduction in the midpoint of the core sales growth range is necessary to accommodate recently announced store count reductions and our new expectations for inventory rebalancing. We expect this rebalancing to be more pronounced in the first half of 2017 and to lessen in the second half of 2017 as we lap this past year's changes. In this context, we believe core sales growth will sequentially accelerate, with the core growth in the first half of the year in the lower half of the full-year guidance range. We expect first quarter growth rate to be roughly in line with the fourth quarter of 2016 as we start up our new organization.","We are raising our normalized EPS guidance range by $0.10 to a new full-year range of $2.95 to $3.15. This revised guidance reflects the positive impact of accretion related to Sistema and the WoodWick acquisitions, strong incremental cost reduction and margin development activity not related to restructuring or synergy programs, the impact of the new tax planning-driven benefits which we expect to realize in the third quarter of 2017 that are not synergy related, partially offset by further negative foreign exchange and increased A&P levels relative to those assumed in our original guidance. The timing shifts of held-for-sale divestitures announced prior to our original guidance has had a neutral impact on normalized EPS.","We now expect to deliver double-digit normalized EPS growth in each of the last three quarters of 2017, partially offset by dilution in the first quarter related to higher share count and interest expense associated with the Jarden transaction.","There are two key factors that could influence where we fall in the full-year guidance ranges. First is the delivery of the cost transformation agenda and over $300 million of incremental savings we've built in to our guidance. We have a clear line of sight to this outcome, having now actioned projects with cumulative cost synergies totaling over $400 million, some of which will not be fully reflected in the P&L until the first half of 2018.","We've implemented the vast majority of the organization changes to occur in the U.S. and are in the midst of the second wave of procurement savings. The Transformation Office is in full stride and more projects will be actioned through 2017, so the synergy savings will continue to build towards our first milestone of $500 million of savings. We now expect to cross the $500 million cumulative cost synergy threshold by Q3 2018, well ahead of the three- to four-year original commitment.","The second factor influencing our results will be how effectively we adapt to the changing U.S. retail landscape. The primary force reshaping the retailer landscape is the bricks-to-click shopper migration happening across many categories. These changes are creating pressure in certain retailer formats that are leading some to restructure their networks, reset their inventory algorithms, and rethink merchandising approaches. Anticipating these shifts and adapting our plans to the emerging buying patterns is often the key to consistent delivery and growth.","In 2017, we expect these retail trends to influence order timing, resulting in revenue shifts from June to July related to back to school, and September to October related to Black Friday. We've captured these timing shifts in our first half and back half core sales growth outlook. Winning companies adapt to changes like these and leverage them for competitive advantage, as we have in Writing where, over the last four years, we've grown high single-digits compounded and built our retail market share in the U.S. by nearly 400 basis points, despite the significant contraction of the office superstore channel.","This experience and outcome highlights the opportunity. Toward this end, we have redesigned our U.S. selling structures to disproportionately resource ecommerce and focus our traditional format teams on our top-20 U.S. customers, placing a real premium on those teams for customer intimacy, planning, analytics, and collaboration. The investments we're making in ecommerce talent, capabilities, and infrastructure will further strengthen our already-advantaged position. Once fully populated, our new global ecommerce division will be over 300 people strong. And as I said before, today we have over $1 billion in ecommerce revenue and expect to more than double that by 2020, delivering over $1 billion of growth over the next four years.","We're already leading and innovating with both our brick-and-mortar dot-com and pure-play dot-com retail partners. For example, two weeks ago, we became one of the first suppliers to ever do a corporate branded deal page takeover that featured over 500 Newell Brand products at the largest pure-play e-tailer. So, we're making good progress and we're well-positioned to deliver in the context of the changing retailer landscape.","So 2016, it's been the most transformative year in our history. We've more than doubled the size of the company. We've set in motion a new corporate strategy that makes sharp choices and strengthens our capabilities for accelerated growth. And we've delivered very strong results in the context of profound change in a challenging environment. We'll build on that progress in 2017, investing to broaden our core growth capabilities in insights, design, and innovation, opening new design hubs in Chicago and Hoboken, strengthening the pipeline of new products for 2018 launch while creating our new, scaled, industry-leading ecommerce division.","We'll do this while simultaneously increasing gross margins and reducing overheads, fundamentally changing the cost structure of the company through our work on synergies and Project Renewal. This will give us the flexibility to increase advertising and promotion for the fourth consecutive year in 2017 while also delivering strong, normalized operating margin expansion to well over 16% of revenue.","Growth coupled with margin development will generate strong cash flow, and we will use the operating cash and some of the proceeds from divestitures to pay down well over $1.5 billion of debt in 2017, exiting 2017 close to our 3 times to 3.5 times leverage ratio target of full-year earlier than planned. This is a powerful financial algorithm that only accelerates from here as we drive forward to transform Newell Brands.","We're well on our way to building one of the most transformative consumer goods companies in the world. When this chapter of Newell Brands story is written, it'll be one of strong competitive levels of growth and disruptive value creation. I'm proud of our people for driving delivery through unprecedented change, and I'm excited to be working for a company that makes life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day where they live, learn, work, and play. This is the power of the Growth Game Plan into action. This is the power of Newell Brands.","With that, let me now pass the line back for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Just first question, Mike, kind of looking at the commentary on the fourth quarter and the department store type businesses that were weak, I mean, that's been something that's been going on for several years. I guess, help us understand how this is different and then maybe how acute it is in terms of Yankee Candle and Calphalon versus how it could affect other parts of the business.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Sure, great question. There were two spaces where we saw pressure as a result of the bricks-to-clicks migration. One is in mall-based formats, and there's two different scenarios there, I'll explain in a second, the other is more broadly across the retailer landscape, and we saw different activities than we've experienced up until now in a broader sense.","First, in retail-based formats, there are two dynamics. We have a couple of businesses that have presence in retailers that are anchor retailers to your typical mall, Calphalon and Yankee, and some other businesses as well. And clearly, you saw the reporting that went on there in the fall \u2013 or in the holiday season, and that clearly had an impact.","The other thing that you may or may not see given your coverage universe is mall-based foot traffic was down high single-digits during the holiday season, and that was very different than prior holiday seasons. So for us, that has an impact on our Yankee retail footprint. The good news on Yankee is that we had really strong international growth, really strong eCommerce growth, and as we gear up our North American activity with respect to wholesale presence and as we enter Canada, we will be able to, kind of, offset some of these structural issues that are going on in mall formats.","But the issue that we dealt with was broader than that in that we saw a lot of changes going on, and particularly in the way people were managing inventories post Black Friday, and I suspect this has a lot to do with foot traffic and comp store dynamics in those retailers. And specifically on the appliance business, you would typically get a reorder after Black Friday, just like we do on the Writing business after the back to school sellout period in September, and they just weren't coming this year. And so, that was material.","Both the mall-based issue and the dynamics on reorder patterns post drive periods, combined it was about 200 basis points of core growth that we had to absorb. So, in that context, the outcome is pretty darn good. I think the inventory thing, we'll continue to feel some of those dynamics through the first half of the year, but I think that once we get through that window, this reset of the inventory algorithms that retailers have will be behind us.","And then on Yankee, our strategic plan on Yankee was always to pivot the brand to wholesale, reaching consumers through our traditional model. In fact, when we presented the strat plan to the board, we assumed a pretty profound downturn in the retail contribution to the overall Yankee franchise, but we didn't expect the foot traffic numbers to be as negative as they were this holiday. So that's sort of the unanticipated news. And I think we're in a better position than most to deal with this given the bet we made starting in 2012, and the bet Jarden made on direct-to-consumer back in the same timeframe. So we come into this moment really well prepared to deal with it. It's just that in any 90-day cycle when you don't anticipate that kind of foot traffic shift or the inventory behavior shift, there's no way to absorb it.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","So that's the context. That's the specifics around those dynamics.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","No, that helps a lot. And, Ralph, one question on the interest expense. So, what you'd said, I think $475 million for 2017, kind of implies a $20 million decline versus kind of the fourth quarter run rate. But if I'm looking post the Tools divestiture plus cash on hand, you've probably got close to $2 billion in cash, plus I would assume you get some from Winter Sports. So are you assuming that there's very little incremental debt paydown? I'm just trying to couple that. It would seem like that interest expense number is pretty high.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Bill, the run rate of interest expense going into the year is over $100 million. And then, we are planning to use the U.S.-based proceeds from the Tools divestiture to delever further. So, what you're seeing is basically the step-up from the full-year run rate because we pick up another three-and-a-half months of interest expense versus this year in terms of where we are in leverage, but then we'll be using the proceeds to delever during the year. So, you net out to the $475 million.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","And, Bill, don't forget, we're going to use the offshore component of the Tools proceeds to pay for Sistema.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. Okay.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Which is a New Zealand-based company.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","But the plan is to immediately kind of take the proceeds and pay down debt? The net proceeds after the...","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. The U.S. proceeds, that's correct.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Maybe just a follow-up on the question. As you look forward at your 2017 core sales growth guidance, obviously, you lowered the low-end of the full-year range to 2.5%. It sounds like that's where you expect Q1 to be, but you did talk about an acceleration in the balance of the year. So, it doesn't really seem like 2.5% at the low-end is what you're expecting, so I guess just can you parse through that? Could Q1 actually be worse than 2.5%? What's your level of visibility on Q1 given the retail environment? And then on the balance of the year, what gives you confidence in an acceleration, and are you expecting also a tangible benefit from putting heritage Newell practices to work on the Jarden side?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Great question, Dara. This year will be an execution-led year because the innovation impact from the investments we're making now and extending the capabilities will yield, innovation-led growth on the legacy Jarden businesses in 2018 and beyond.","And as we've have said previously, Q1 is the period where this new organization is going to start up. It's sort of like an SAP start-up. You go from crawling to walking to running, and that's the way I'm thinking about Q1, although we had a very brief and prodigious childhood, so we didn't have much of a crawl phase. But we're walking and we expect to be running by the end of the first quarter. So, that certainly is a factor in influencing how things play out.","I think what I said in the script was that Q4 was a good \u2013 was roughly a good number to kind of benchmark for Q1, and then you should expect acceleration from that forward. It's false precision to say that I can say it's going to be 2.5%, 2.6%, 2.7% or 2.4%, 2.3%, 2.5%. The first quarter every $3 million of revenue is a tenth of a point of core sales. So, we're doing now $35 million a day, so that's just a couple of trucks that don't show up and you're down a tenth or you're up a tenth. And we don't manage it that precisely.","But I think that's a good benchmark to use. And the month of January was pretty close to where we thought it was going to be. There's no big surprises there. Some of the inventory issues we had in December reversed as a positive, and some of the structural issues continue. So, I think the way I articulated it is the way I'd book your plan, that we see Q1 as Q4, and then we see acceleration sequentially from that point forward. And I think a good place to target is the middle of the range on the full year, which is why we guided that way.","I did make some comments in the script there about June to July shifts. I think that's going to happen, so that tempers the upside in Q2, but Q3 will get the benefit of that. And there will be \u2013 while it's a smaller spike, there will be a September to October shift, and it's the same dynamic; retailers just don't want to hold inventory as long as they used to. They've figured out ways to more efficiently move product through their supply chain to stores. And increasingly, for the big retailers, an increasing proportion of their revenue is dot-com based, which those order patterns and fulfillment patterns are really different than when you're staging merchandising for a retail store. So, that pushes the sell-in closer to the point of demand.","And so, those shifts are going to continue to unfold, but we've got good confidence. We feel great about the start-up of the new organization. We got to get into a rhythm of working together, and that's happening. And the change in the U.S. is largely behind us. There's a few more things to do, but nothing material. We came through an intense period of change in the fourth quarter. So we're excited about the year and about getting into it and seeing what we can do with it. Obviously, we're going to stretch ourselves to beat the midpoints of these ranges as we always do. But it's too early to declare at this point whether that's plausible or not.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was just curious. On the Yankee conversation. So it was in June when you said in your strategic plan you already assumed some of these retail shifts and the shift to wholesale. So to what degree have you built in maybe store closures to your 2017 plan for Yankee? And have you already assumed that \u2013 I'm splitting the difference on your comments on inventory issues and mall traffic, but did you sort of anticipate there being this kind of magnitude like 100 basis point drag to core sales growth for 2017, or is that materially worse? Because it sounds like the core sales growth ex-macro factors, if you will, that things are in a pretty good spot and that there was minimal disruption from sales force changes and organizational changes this quarter. Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","I feel terrific about executing through the change. That obviously \u2013 as I talked about the transformation, that was the big risk. And I don't feel like that issue is going to be a problem for us. So we've come through that period. There is a startup curve, like anything as big as what we've just done. Remember, we reorganized our entire sales force. We consolidated business units from 32 to 16. Those are big, big changes. But those changes are set. The teams are in place. We were just together last week with the top 100 in the company, and it was a really constructive, good, engaged dynamic. So I was really very pleased with that.","I think your comment about the 200 basis points of core that I referred to, I think there's one aspect of that that's right that's just a timing-related thing, which I don't think in all cases we'll get back, which is the inventory timing and order pattern shift. The more structural issue on bricks-to-clicks and the speed with which we can ramp our ecommerce capability, I think the marrying up of those two opposing trends is really the dynamic we're trying to manage where we want the e-commerce scale-up to more than compensate for the bricks-to-clicks issues for traditional formats. And that's particularly an issue in the retail mall sector or that format. And I think we'll get pretty close to getting ourselves in a position where the e-commerce scaling happens and quickly surpasses the contraction on the other side.","That said, our plans always had us taking a hard look at stores, store counts, restructuring that network. That's all baked into the strategic plan and the Growth Game Plan. The timing of our thinking through that was a little bit further out. We didn't expect high single-digit foot traffic issues in the holiday season.","I do think, Lauren, that you don't want to take the 100 basis point impact in Q4 and extrapolate that on a full-year basis because you have to understand the seasonality of that business. So the trends that were happening in Q4 on foot traffic are not the trends that are happening today in malls on foot traffic. So it's in that peak seasonality where there was real pressure as people went online to do their holiday shopping.","So I don't think that repeats at that level, and that's in part why we didn't adjust guidance any further. And we're doing things to try to invigorate our mall-based retail performance. We learned a lot in the fourth quarter. We spent about $5 million in advertising on personalization and on thematic campaigns for Yankee. We had three different pieces of copy that we tested and rotated in, and the personalization copy really worked. And we are in the midst of trying to bring that whole platform to the point of choice in store, which I think would be really exciting. Imagine if you could bring your PDF like you do to a CVS to do your pictures, bring it into a Yankee Candle store and get your customized candle right at the retail counter.","That's what we're \u2013 those types of innovations, I call them commercial innovations, offer tremendous opportunity, and we know that consumers responded very nicely to the communication around personalization but they have to go online to fulfill, and imagine if they could go every day to fulfill.","So those types of innovations can invigorate our retail formats, but I think the answer on retail, we're going to take a comprehensive look at the Yankee network. There likely will be stores that we exit because I've looked at the comp store sales numbers with Ralph and with Mark and with Bill store by store in the fourth quarter, and there's quite a different profile depending on quality of the mall, anchor tenant in the mall, all that type of stuff. So there's probably some combination of work to be done on the retail side that's a little bit more accelerated than we originally envisioned that gets us to a better place.","And of course, the whole plan was not contingent on retail contributing, but I think retail can contribute. Our focus is going to be about deploying this brand in every retailer we can in the U.S. and then extending the footprint to Canada and then extending the footprint with our Czech factory up and running into continental Europe more broadly and building a multi-brand strategy. Remember, we now have three brands. We have Yankee Candle. We have Millefiori at the top, and we have WoodWick.","So we're building out a portfolio of brands that will play in different spaces in home fragrance, and we're going to leverage that through our traditional retailer relationships, primarily to sustain what has been an incredible track record of growth for Yankee Candle. And so I'm not fazed in any dramatic way by what's happened here. It just catalyzes us to action a little bit earlier in the sequence of things we were going to choose to do than we otherwise would have been.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Mike. Good morning.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Bill.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Can you just tell us what the program to date, the 2016 and then the 2017 outlook, is for both Project Renewal and then the deal synergies? Because I think you just gave us an aggregate number of $300 million.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Let me break it down a little bit for you. First of all, neither the $210 million that I quoted for 2016 or the over $300 million that I quoted for 2017 include any of the tax synergies, just to be clear. So the $210 million excludes about $12 million of tax synergies that we delivered in 2016. And we expect to deliver around $20 million of tax synergies in 2017 on top of the over $300 million of cumulative \u2013 of incremental, I'm sorry, Renewal and cost synergy programs. So that's how you have to think about it. And we'll be more disciplined in providing you those two sets of numbers because obviously one is pre-tax and the other is after-tax impacts. As I said in the script, we have actioned over $400 million of cost synergies. So that excludes...","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Taxes.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes, it excludes taxes. And when we say actioned, that means there's a formal project underway with a clear line of sight to delivering a cost benefit into the P&L.","Now the reason that we haven't taken the synergy number up or the savings number up for 2017 is that some of that is baked in. Some of those $400 million in cumulative savings is baked into 2017, and some of that flows out of 2017 into 2018. But we did give you a bit of news today, which is $500 million \u2013 we clear $500 million banked in the P&L by Q3 2018, which is well ahead of where we said we were going to be, and it's just another bit of news regarding accelerations of savings delivery.","We have not raised 2017 guidance at this point with respect to synergy delivery because we don't expect now, for any of those 18 synergies, to flow back into 2017, although that is a possibility going forward. So how far over $300 million will it be, which I think is what your question is, it could be materially over $300 million. And right now, our plan assumes modestly over $300 million.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, guys. And what's the breakdown between the Renewal savings and the synergies from the deal, though, on that $300 million?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","The synergies from the deal start to become the vast majority of the savings in 2017. So you're talking $60 million \u2013 $70 million roughly of Renewal savings in 2017. And the balance will be cost synergies, and that lessens in 2018 further. So the thing on Renewal that we have to do is because we're selling the Tools business, there was a bunch of Renewal savings connected to things we've disposed, so you can't count on those anymore. So the number is going to be more and more cost synergy driven.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And then if I look at the Jarden two-year stacks and they're really rough numbers, so the data is not perfect, but I think it went from like 8% in the September quarter to 4% this quarter. And if you back in guidance, it looks like 2% in the March quarter. So do you think the entirety of that slowdown is the destocking in the appliance business and then the Yankee retail struggles?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","No, I think part of it is Yankee loss distribution, things like Yankee and Coleman loss distribution. So I think that's primarily what's going on here. I mean, if I look at the Q4 numbers, we had some really good numbers on legacy Jarden businesses. It was nice to see Outdoor Solutions start to respond. And within that, you saw high single-digit growth on Pure Fishing. You saw Technical Apparel rebound with double-digit growth. You saw Team Sports, after The World Series, up in high single-digit type of growth. Waddington delivered mid-level growth. Jostens grew nicely and was accretive to growth in the fourth quarter. The only issue out there was Coleman.","And then within Branded Consumables, Yankee International and Yankee eCommerce grew really nicely in the fourth quarter and had the challenge of North American retail as an issue, but still Branded Consumables grew. So I think in the appliance business, as I said \u2013 did I quote a specific number on appliances in terms of the loss? No. I mean, it was over $20 million; $25 million of orders that we would have expected from the middle of December through the end of the year that didn't come. So if you back that out and look at the appliance performance in 2016, appliances grew close \u2013 well, actually without even backing it out, taking the hit in Q4, appliances grew 5%, close to 5%. So that's a really good number.","So I think the issues that we've had on Jarden related to the bad winter last year or the first half of Marmot sales, that's now recovering nicely, it dealt with the loss distribution on Coleman which was a huge number, it dealt with the Yankee loss distribution in Target, and it dealt with having to lap and it shows up in our Asia numbers the \u2013 what was roughly in our core sales numbers $35 million related to Sprue, which is the U.K.-based first-alert business, where in 2015 there was a huge spike related to new legislation in France and Germany that never was actioned and enforced and therefore all this inventory was stuck at our distributor and we had to lap that this year and by Q1 2017 we're beyond that.","So I think those are the underlying issues. I don't think there's any structural issue here. The research that I was referencing, Bill, confirms that. These are great brands with great potential. The concept test results that we've gotten on the 71 concepts that we put into testing in Q4, a good number of those have come back very, very strongly. And in fact, the relevance is even higher than the cumulative results on Newell Rubbermaid legacy brands. The opportunity score is roughly the same but the relevance was actually higher on the Jarden legacy businesses which suggest that there's an opportunity out there for somebody in these categories to really go out and innovate.","So I've lost not even a wink of sleep on whether these brands have the potential we expected them to have. It's going to be really exciting. We just need to go through the same cycle we went through on Newell Rubbermaid where you have to go from concept to product to market, and it takes \u2013 the gestation period on new items is 18 to 24 months. So you're probably tired of hearing me say that. But that means these ideas don't come to market until 2018. And so 2017 will be an execution-led year. We've got tremendous innovation coming on legacy Newell businesses and good innovation \u2013 It's not the cupboard is bare \u2013 good innovation on some of the Jarden businesses, but we have the potential to deliver great innovations on the Jarden brands, and that happens just in sequence, the natural sequence, which will not be until 2018.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Mike. So I just wanted to kind of follow up on some of the commentary you had on Bill's question. If you benchmark Jarden today kind of from where you were with Newell when you came in to take over the company, can you just give us some analogies, compare\/contrast? What's going better, what's going the same, what's maybe not hitting your expectations? Because I think a lot of us that are supporting the story, kind of, go back to the analogy of Newell and what you did there and how that story progressed over several years. And so that would be helpful just to kind of provide some context on how you see the Jarden business within that landscape.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I think this is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. The reason we bought this and combined with this company is because we saw the potential of these products to benefit in the same way \u2013 in these categories to benefit in the same way that the Newell Rubbermaid portfolio did through the application of the brand development model that we deployed across the top of those legacy Newell businesses. And so what we're doing is taking that playbook and extending it to a broader cross-section of categories, as I've said before.","And what we're doing \u2013 what's different this time, expectations were quite low on Newell Rubbermaid. The company was not performing. Whereas as these two companies come together, expectations are higher because both companies were performing. We're moving with much greater speed to get the transformation work done. We did \u2013 in the fourth quarter, it took us about a year-and-a-half to do at Newell Rubbermaid, organizationally. So we consolidated the sales organization. We consolidated the business units. We installed the new brand development model. We centralized IT and legal. We created corporate disciplines around some of the centers of excellence in HR and finance. Those things took us multiple quarters to do at Newell Rubbermaid. We did it in the U.S. in the first quarter. And so that's behind us.","So what took us \u2013 we had a longer ramp period on core growth acceleration in 2011, 2012, 2013 than we expect to have in this chapter of the story. And so we've said we should see sequential acceleration in our core growth rate from the transition quarters of Q4 2016, Q1 2017 to acceleration starting in Q2, Q3, Q4 and then really ramping in 2018 as the ammunition arrives, the new product ideas and the money. Hopefully, we can get beyond the $500 million in synergies so that we have a big step-up in A&P that complements the arrival of these new ideas to market.","So that phasing of activity is broadly same as what we did on Newell Rubbermaid. What's different here is the speed with which we've changed the organization and the fact that we actually have a third to 40% of the organization that's very familiar with the model. At Newell Rubbermaid, it was a new construct, a new operating model for everybody. In this context, it's not. And so a Jarden leader can turn to a peer to get advice. Whereas, in the past, you had to count on a handful of people that had a point of view about the model, and you had to trust that those folks' view was credible.","Now, you've got a story supporting facts. You can go back and look at the track record and see the acceleration in growth and the simultaneous margin development, the complementary M&A to \u2013 that sits next to a strengthening organic agenda. You can go hold a mirror up to that and see a reflection of what we're trying to create going forward. And so it's not as dependent on me at the bully pulpit selling an operating model or Mark Tarchetti at the bully pulpit or Richard Davies telling a story about what brand development can do and why innovation can work this way. You've got a track record and you've got proof points, as do investors.","So I think we get there faster in this chapter but expectations are higher. So any little wobbles can create discontinuities that in the past, they wouldn't have. And we have to accept that as a leadership team. Obviously, try to drive to deliver exactly what we say we're going to do and hopefully put up a string of consistent delivery in the context of the strategic and management guidance we provide. And so that's how I'm thinking about the moment we're in.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And, Mike, just quickly, any areas where you're not happy with kind of market share progression? I mean, retail environment is put aside, just trying to get a sense if there's any issues and any businesses that kind of are surprising you or where you're losing share?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah, I'm never satisfied. I mean, that's a character flaw. So it's \u2013 we don't do a lot of celebrating. We have a lot of opportunity. I always bring \u2013 I look at our Writing business which has a market value shares in the U.S. now around 48%, 49%. That's huge progress from where we were, but I remind people that Frito-Lay in the 1990s went from a 40% to a 60%.","And we are driven by this algorithm of trying to get to a 40% share and relative market share advantage of 2-to-1. That's when in my experience in multiple categories over almost 34 years now when you get that algorithm right, you profit through scale. So I'm not happy that we really have that set anywhere other than a couple of key sells.","So the exciting thing about what we're trying to do is the opportunity is all in front of us. We can look at that 49% share, 48% share in the U.S. and look at the relative share to BIC, for example, and be very pleased with ourselves. But that's one country. So we need a string of eight countries that have that kind of relative relationship.","And you can only imagine how much growth comes if you're successful at creating a repeatable model in these categories that can deliver that outcome. So that's the framework for success for me. So I'm generally not happy with where we are. It's not acute to one particular \u2013 or specific to one particular category because I understand the upside that's possible.","And we're not up against very \u2013 we're up against easier competition than people I've competed against in the past. And that's not to be disrespectful, but I just don't think, given our scale, they have the potential to create the capability suite that we're creating, and therefore, we should win virtually any battle we engage in.","And so I can't get distracted by the here and now and the progress we've made. I only want us focused on the destination, and that's 40% share in every country that matters to us, a relative market share of 2-to-1 in every category that matters to us. And that won't happen in my lifetime, just to be clear, but that ought to be the destination.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Not to belabor the point, but I just wanted to go back to Yankee for a minute. Can you remind us what the distribution split is in the U.S. business right now, how much are the company-owned doors and how much are through Walmart and whatnot?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Are you talking \u2013 let me give you a sense of where we are and where we're not. We're not in distribution in Target. We're in distribution in Walmart with American Home, but not across the full network. We're not in distribution in Amazon, but we are today now with distribution in Amazon, and we're building our presence and assortment in that channel. We're in bits of the Kroger network, but not all the Kroger network. We're not in the Ahold network, but we could be in the Ahold network as we get to that.","We're not broadly distributed in drug, but we could be broadly distributed in drug. And we're not present at all in Canada. And when I say at all, there's probably some business that bleeds over. So we have tremendous opportunity there. We've got a $500 million-plus retail business in the U.S., so that's a big bit of the portfolio. We've got a very big European business that's growing double-digits, close to $300 million probably this year, and with the Prague factory, we'll be able to drive that harder and further. So in broad terms, that's how we're structured.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Because my question is trying to figure out \u2013 I know you've said in the past that you know that business, you served on the board, you like that business, and I hear, obviously, there are big opportunities to expand distribution, and it sounds like you've got ideas about how to innovate in that category.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","But I mean, just looking at the Nielsen numbers in the U.S., and maybe this is just transitional data, but the Nielsen numbers are terrible, even though the level of promotional spending went up year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So it's not just that I'm having a hard time sharing your enthusiasm for that business, but I'm wondering, the timing on when that business \u2013 I mean, clearly, there's the retail mall traffic stuff, but when do you think that we're going to see year-over-year growth in that business in those channels that Newell already sells, getting into Kroger, getting into drug, whatever it is but also making the core business better on a year-over-year basis that we can see in Neilson?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","You're not going to see it in Nielsen as broadly as you'd like to see it in Nielsen because in the very near term, you've got the effect of losing Target distribution, which is going to show up and disproportionately skew your read through Nielsen. We don't use Nielsen to track the business here. IRI is our partner and we've got a custom panel that covers the footprint. But you're right that in broad terms, because of the Target dynamic, you see a decline in the wholesale side of the business, and you don't pick up other types of formats in those numbers as I recall them. Nielsen was a Kraft and Unilever partner and we had to supplement Nielsen to get a full view of landscape.","But your fundamental question is when do you see the North American business flip positive. And I think it's dependent on how quickly we get the distribution broadened. We want to fill out the store count at Walmart. We'll think about what brands to leverage. We have the additional leverage of WoodWick now in our portfolio, which can play a role. We've got a footprint. We've got a big business at Bed Bath & Beyond. And so you're just missing a whole bunch of our universe. We can \u2013 offline, we'll try to get you what the coverage \u2013 what we think the Neilson coverage looks like on the U.S. footprint. That might be helpful for you.","Now that said, I don't think it happens in the first half of the year that we pivot the wholesale business. But from about mid-year onward, we should start to get some wins at big places. And I'm not just speculating there, I know we've got stuff going. So that will help. I think retail will take longer. We're taking a strategic look at that whole network starting the next couple of weeks. And we'll come to you as we make changes if we choose to make changes as a result of that work. I'm optimistic the U.S. retail business can make a contribution, but the future of our home fragrance business is not retail-based. It's leveraging our core route to market around the world. So don't expect us to be opening stores in Europe or anywhere else in the world that we don't have them today; we won't be. We'll be building out our ecommerce platform. We'll be building out our traditional retail relationships and scaling the category in that way.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And when you think about that business with the changing distribution mix, that business should be structurally higher operating margin than the fleet average. Is that fair to say?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","It is, except for the tail of the retail format.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, okay, thank you very much.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","It's very accretive. It's very accretive at both gross margin and operating margin.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Steve.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. So I've got two questions and I'll ask them together just in the interest of time, if I could. The first one relates to cash flow. And at least versus our expectations, the cash flow was really strong this quarter, as was debt reduction. I was just curious how the cash flow compared to your expectations coming into the quarter. And then looking ahead, if you're not in a position yet to call where you expect cash earnings to land in 2017, can you confirm that you still plan to devote some time to that in a few weeks at CAGNY?","And then second and separately, I guess could you help clarify why the tax benefit you've called out in Q3 2017 isn't being treated as a one-time item? I guess my thought is the implication that those benefits continue in some form in the future perhaps spread throughout the year in future periods. Thanks.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Steve, it's Ralph. Let me take your second question first. On the tax benefit, which is new information versus the last time we all communicated, that's from some work we've been doing on tax planning. and we've got a very good line of sight and confidence level in that. And just the nature of the tax planning that we're doing is it is one-time in nature, and we expect it to hit, as we look at it today, in the third quarter, as Mike said in his remarks. It is something, though, that is one-time in nature, but nonetheless a benefit. So we'll plan out the tax rate beyond 2017. I wouldn't expect us to be, though, in the rate of 23% ongoing. I think more back into the range that we had previously.","Then as it relates to cash flow, I feel very good about the cash flow in the fourth quarter. It came in pretty much right where we expected it to, and we deleveraged the balance sheet as we expected. I'll give more insight on 2017 at CAGNY as we progress through. And maybe just a couple of comments I'd say underneath the results on cash flow, one is on working capital. We made probably more progress on payables than we did on inventory and receivables. So more opportunity there over time, but we did make good progress on payables, particularly as it relates to some of the procurement initiatives that we've been driving for on the synergy program. We've been able to make progress on the payables side there, and that should continue in the future. The longer-term benefits on working capital will come as we begin to look closer at our distribution network and our systems implementations, which are really further out on the timeline, which we've talked about before.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, thanks. Good morning. I'll make these quick also. I guess the first question really on the A&P spending, so you talked about stepping up in the fourth quarter. But the sales obviously stepped back in December just on some of the structural stuff that you talked about, the inventory. So as you think about 2017 and another step-up coming through, can you talk about the ROI or the efficiency that you're getting on it, how maybe you're looking at it a little bit differently? And what's the right algorithm as some of the retail landscape shifts to alternative channels, how you should be deploying your cost savings towards that A&P spending to get the best return?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","So we increased A&P in 2016; we'll do it again in 2017. We adjust our spending as we go depending on whether the things we're doing work. So nobody ever gets to keep their A&P budgets, promotion a little bit different than advertising. But advertising budgets tend to go and are spent on new ideas, whether it's an innovation or whether it's a commercial innovation, spent on new ideas. And so we've learned that anthematic investment or general continuity spend in consumer durables isn't a great use of A&P.","We continue to believe we've got lots of opportunity to grow through building our brands, equity and household penetration and awareness. And so we will continue to invest, Jason. I think the thing to hold us accountable for is whether the POS growth responds to those investments. And where we spent and what we spent on, we measure everything. We're data junkies, so we measure everything. And we'll find a forum to show you what worked and what didn't and the relative responsiveness. So I think you can count on us to be really scrupulous with our money. We don't want to waste it, and we have incentive to let it flow through the margin if in fact it's not going to yield the growth we expect.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then the last question, if you think about the sales range you have for 2017 versus where Street numbers were probably above $15 billion, so now you're saying $14.5 billion to $14.7 billion, so you've got about $0.5 billion reduction. I think you've done a really good job talking about the core sales and some of the dynamics there. But unless I missed it, can you talk how we should be thinking about the timing of some of these divestitures now?","Before, I think you were saying January 1 to plate it. And, obviously, I know everything is very loose, but that and then currency as well, you're calling for a bigger impact coming through. And if I just look like three months ago, the euro, the British pound really hasn't changed all that much. You're not going to be in Brazil going forward, which I guess would be a benefit. But I'm just trying to think about what's changed on the FX side so those two underlying points secondary to the core sales changes.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Jason, on the FX side, what's really shifted in particular over the last several months has been the peso and the Canadian dollar in particular, and a little bit more so as we take the outlook on the pound on average. Those are the three big moves, but more on the peso and the Canadian dollar versus the last time we talked.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Which works against us on sourcing. So I think that's on ForEx.","Your question on M&A timing, obviously we haven't closed the Tools deal yet, but we're waiting to clear one more hurdle that's outside of the U.S. And hopefully over the next couple of weeks, into late February, we find our way over the finish line there. The ski auction is in full stride now, and we've said Q2 is the likely window for that to occur. So those two offset each other a little bit longer with Tools in our P&L as a positive; a little bit longer with skis in our P&L is actually a negative because skis loses money in the first half of the year. So the net effect of those things have effectively washed out, and everything else is just too small to make that material a difference.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I guess the first question on the Coleman repositioning, maybe get an update there. How should we think about Coleman in 2017 versus what you guys saw in 2016? And then I guess a related question to that is how much of getting back some of that loss distribution at Coleman as well as Yankee is baked in to the 2.5% to 4% core sales growth?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Coleman gets back to growth in 2017, so that's a nice recovery. It's not accretive to growth but it gets back to growth in 2017 as we broaden the distribution of the core items. And we regain some loss distribution at Walmart. So that's important and positive. Although Coleman \u2013 just to be clear, Coleman doesn't hit its stride until the brand work that we're doing brings bigger, better innovation to market in 2018. That won't happen this year. This year will be a year that's more commercially led, and it'll be the presence of some positives, which is broadened distribution footprint in the absence of negatives, which is the absence of the loss distribution impacting revenue streams.","So I think that's how I would characterize this year. We're optimistic about our outdoor and rec business. We've got tremendous momentum in beverages. Marmot seems to have turned the corner. We've got a leadership team there that seems to be really jazzed and energized about driving the agenda. And it's going to be interesting to see how we're able \u2013 when we're able to sustain the momentum on Team Sports. We've had a nice run since the Cubs-Indians World Series on Team Sports, and that looks like it's going to continue into 2017.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And how much of that is baked in to the core sales number for next year with Yankee?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","All baked in.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks","Operator","And your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys. Ralph, I wanted to pick up on some of the tax commentary. Can you revisit for us or touch on the risk of a potential border adjustment tax, discuss what the company's doing to plan for that potential; any conversations you've had with representatives or lobbyists down in Washington? Then, unrelated to that, Mike, perhaps you can touch on what the appetite is for M&A. Should we expect further tuck-in M&A? There's obviously a lot going on with the company at this point. Core sales is a bit softer, I guess, than folks had anticipated. So given sort of the risk around that, what's the company's appetite to continue to pursue M&A in this environment? Thanks for the questions.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. Kevin, maybe I'll just start on the M&A side of it. Our capital priorities haven't changed. We need to continue to deleverage the balance sheet as we promised and committed to and supporting the dividend and the payout ratios that we've talked about. Those are our capital priorities. We look at M&A in this window of time for things that are bolt-on in nature in our core categories. And that was Sistema and with WoodWick are good examples of that. So we're always looking at those kinds of opportunities and things, but the priorities are what I mentioned earlier.","As it relates to border adjustment tax reform and all those things, obviously, we are looking at our entire network and where there are different opportunities and risks and given the variety of different proposals, we're assessing that, but aren't taking any action because there's lack of clarity as to where all that will play out.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Like any other big change in landscape, when there are big changes, there's opportunity. Remember, we have 55 factories in the U.S., over 55 factories in the U.S., 55 held-for-sale. We have over 15,000 manufacturing jobs, supply chain jobs in the U.S. We have a very big manufacturing footprint in this country.","And look at our competitive landscape. Look at our Writing competitors. Look at some of our other competitors and ask yourself where their factories are? People think about these issues in too superficial a way and at too high a level. There's opportunity in some of the things that are being discussed for share consolidation on our part as a result of some of the competitive dynamics. And so it's never as simple as the headlines. And you should expect us, though, just like with any other major inflection like ecommerce, to be on the front foot when the time comes and to have a point of view and a plan on what we're going to do to deal with it.","And, again, don't get distracted by the press headlines. Think about \u2013 dive deeper like we have to into our networks and ask yourself the question whether there's more leverage or less leverage with the scope of manufacturing we have in the U.S. relative to our competitive set. And I think you'll conclude the same thing we conclude, which is make sure you look at it from both angles because there's as much opportunity as there is risk in some of these scenarios.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Michael Polk for closing remarks.","Michael B.

We delivered results that were well ahead of our plan, enabled by strong cost synergies and Project Renewal savings, initial tax synergies, and competitive levels of growth in the context of an intense period of organization and portfolio change.","Our momentum businesses of Writing, Baby, Food, and Appliances continue to deliver strong growth, which was partially offset by expected declines on outdoor solutions and commercial products.","Cash flow was quite strong, enabling us to pay down over $230 million of debt or about $1.3 billion since the completion of the Jarden transaction only 26 weeks ago. We delivered these results while also completing a comprehensive review of the business, aligning the organization around a new strategic framework called the Growth Game Plan.","The new Growth Game Plan establishes a new set of investment priorities, makes sharp portfolio choices, resets, and streamlines the organization from a holding company to an operating company, consolidating 32 business units to 16 divisions, while simultaneously scaling our innovation, design, insight, brand development, and e-commerce capabilities across much of our new portfolio with the intention to deliver steady growth acceleration with rapid earnings accretion, and strong cash flow generation over the next few years.","We've driven this new strategy into action in the third quarter, announcing a series of organization and portfolio changes. We've chosen to move decisively and with speed because we have the benefit of lessons learned from the Newell Rubbermaid transformation and confidence in our team's ability to perform while we simultaneously transform.","Our third quarter and year-to-date results are good evidence that we can deliver while changing. And in that context, this morning we've raised our 2016 guidance toward the high end of both guidance ranges.","So, with that as preamble, let me quickly review our performance highlights and then I'll pass the time to Ralph to dive deeper.","The Q3 headlines are as follows. Net sales have more than doubled as a result of the Jarden transaction to $3.95 billion. Core sales grew 3%, led by strong performances in Writing, Baby, Food, and Appliances.","Reported EPS was $0.38 per diluted share after absorbing the negative impact of about $0.19 of one-time costs associated with the Jarden inventory step-up and about $0.08 of other one-time transaction-related costs. Normalized EPS was $0.78, an increase of over 25% versus prior year and operating cash flow was over $511 million, an increase of over 50% versus prior year.","Year-to-date net sales have more than doubled to $9.13 billion as a result of the Jarden transaction. Core sales have grown 4.2% and that growth has been broad-based with seven of nine segments growing and North American core growth of 5%, Latin American core growth of 8%, and Europe, Middle East and Africa core growth of nearly 3%.","Reported EPS was $0.91 per diluted share after absorbing the negative impact of about $0.78 of one-time costs associated with the Jarden inventory step-up and about $0.20 of one-time transaction-related costs.","Normalized EPS was $2.08, up over 28% versus prior year and operating cash flow was $837 million, an increase of over 190% versus prior year. So, good set of outcomes and we continue to do what we say we're going to do.","With that, I will now hand the call over to Ralph and then I'll return to provide perspective on the balance of 2016 and our initial outlook for 2017.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As Mike noted, our Q3 financial results were solid and on-plan across all key metrics; core sales, gross and operating margin, and operating cash flow. We're also on track with capturing cost savings through synergies and Project Renewal and on track with our deleveraging plan.","Third quarter reported net sales were $3.95 billion, a 159% increase versus last year, which was largely attributable to the Jarden transaction. Core sales increased 3%.","Recorded gross margin -- reported gross margin was 32.2%, compared with 39.1% last year, largely due to the Jarden transaction-related inventory step-up charges in the amount of $146 million. This completes the turn of Jarden acquired inventory and the related step-up charges.","Normalized gross margin was 36% compared with 39.5% last year. The decline is due to the negative mix effect from the Jarden acquisition and the deconsolidation of Venezuela, which more than offset positive impacts from synergies, productivity, and pricing.","We reported SG&A expense of $938 million or 23.7% of net sales, a190 basis point improvement versus last year, despite the impacts of higher integration costs.","Normalized SG&A expense was $817 million or 20.6% of sales, a 360 basis point improvement. Both reported and normalized improvements were driven by the mix impact from the Jarden legacy businesses, which have historically carried a lower SG&A spend rate, as well as benefits from Project Renewal savings and transaction-related synergies.","Reported operating margin was 8.2% of sales compared with 12.2% in the prior year. This decrease was largely attributable to the inventory step-up, acquisition-related amortization costs, and certain other transaction-related expenses. Normalized operating margin improved 20 basis points to 15.4% of sales when compared to the prior year.","Interest expense of $125 million rose $107 million year-over-year, reflecting higher debt balance incurred in the financing of the Jarden and Elmer's transactions.","Our reported tax rate was 6.8% compared with last year's reported rate of 16.1%, reflecting the effect of discrete items in the quarter. The normalized tax rate was 22.5% compared with 20% in the prior year, driven by tax synergies and discrete items in the quarter, more than offset by the mix effect of the Jarden acquisition.","Reported EPS was $0.38, compared with $0.50 in the prior year due largely to the acquisition-related charges and expenses, as well as increased interest expense and a higher share count. These transaction-related expenses were partially offset by the operating profit contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions.","Normalized EPS, which excludes transaction-related expenses and certain other charges was $0.78, a 26% increase versus last year. The improvement was primarily driven by sales growth, the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions, and savings benefits from both synergies and Project Renewal. These benefits more than offset increased shares outstanding and higher interest expense.","Turning now to our segment results, Writing net sales increased 14.5%. Despite the acceleration of approximately $15 million of net sales from Q3 into Q2 to support back-to-school merchandising, Writing core sales increased 7.7%, reflecting a strong back-to-school season behind innovation such as Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens, and increased advertising and promotion support.","Net sales in Home Solutions declined 19.1% due primarily to the divestiture of the D\u00e9cor business.","Core sales which exclude the Rubbermaid consumer storage totes business that is held-for-sales declined 0.5%, primarily attributable to the timing impact of the transition of a key distribution center in the beverage business.","Tools net sales declined 5.7%, driven by continued challenges in Brazil and negative foreign currency, partially offset by growth in Europe. Commercial Products net sales declined 3.7%, primarily due to the divestiture of the Rubbermaid medical cart business, the negative impact of foreign currency, and softness in the North American distributer trade channel related to ongoing planned complexity reduction activity. Core sales decreased 1.8%.","Baby grew net sales 11.3% largely due to continued strong sales momentum in North America from Graco and Baby Jogger. Core sales which exclude the Teutonia business that is held-for-sale increased 10.6%.","Turning now to legacy Jarden segments, I will refer to net and core sales, as compared with pro forma results for the same period in 2015. Net sales in Branded Consumables increased 5%, and core sales increased 0.6%. Waddington, which is reflected in core sales as of August 1st, grew mid-single-digits. Yankee Candle grew more modestly, as we lapped last year's pipeline fill at Wal-Mart.","Core growth was partially offset by weak performance of the Safety and Security business outside the United States. Consumer Solutions net sales increased 7.9%. Core sales which exclude the U.S. Heaters, Humidifiers and Fans business that is held-for-sale increased 9.3%, driven by strong results in both North America and Latin America. We had good growth in Crock-Pot, Sunbeam and FoodSaver fueled by innovations such as the new FoodSaver Food Preservation System which launched in Q3.","Outdoor Solutions net sales increased 12.1%, largely attributable to the Jostens acquisition. Core sales which excludes the winter sports business that is held-for-sale, declined 3.2% compared with prior year, with growth in Pure Fishing more than offset by declines in Coleman.","Net sales in process solutions increased 11.4%. Core sales increased 12.4%, compared with prior year due to volume growth and commodity-based pricing.","Let's turn now to Q3 core sales by geography. North America, which represents about 80% of total sales, grew core growth by 3.1%, led by strong growth in Baby and Writing. In EMEA, core sales grew 2.7% reflecting continued strong growth in Yankee Candle, partially offset by weakness in commercial products.","Latin America delivered strong core growth sales growth of 15.2%, driven by robust sales in Consumer Solutions and Writing. Asia-Pacific core sales declined 8.4%, due primarily to softness in our Safety and Security business supplied from that region.","During Q3, we reported $511 million of operating cash flow compared with $340 million in the prior year. The improvement reflects contribution from Jarden, improved operating results across the portfolio, and favorable working capital movements.","We returned $92 million in dividends to shareholders. We also paid down debt by $231 million, which brings our quarter end gross debt balance down to $12.75 billion. With the benefit of the cash proceeds from the upcoming sale of tools, we're now projecting that we'll reach our three to three and a half times leverage goal ahead of plan. In summary, a good quarter with progress on many fronts.","At this point, I'll turn the call back to Mike.","Michael Polk","Thanks, Ralph. If you no doubt know, we've been hard at work, laying the ground work for accelerated performance and value creation. The creation of Newell Brands strengthens our presence in existing geographies and customers and enhances our reach through an extended international footprint, and access to new channels of distribution. This new scale gives us the opportunity to make life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day, where they live, learn, work, and play.","This new Growth Game Plan has at its core this bold ambition and vision, and a new set of investment priorities and portfolio choices that will shape our growth ambitions and resource allocation. The strategy is designed to unlock the unique opportunity that's inherent in the categories of both legacy companies.","Across the Newell Brands portfolio, we have leading brands that compete in large growing categories that are responsive to activity. These are categories that are unconsolidated and as a result, have a low cost of growth.","These unique conditions create a unique potential for the company prepared to make the investments necessary to capture the market share consolidation opportunity. Over the last five years, we've invested to build advantaged capabilities in insight, design; innovation, brand marketing, e-commerce, and collaborative selling that differentiate us versus our sub scaled competitive set.","We've reshaped the company from a holding company to an operating company; releasing costs that have been reinvested to both build these scaled competitive advantages in our core growth capabilities and to more than double the A&P investment on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid brands. This operating model has worked as is evident in the company's performance.","Capturing the transformative value creation opportunity inherent in the Newell Rubbermaid combination with Jarden will be a function of our success applying this model more broadly. The new Growth Game Plan is designed to do just that, apply this proven playbook across a broader set of categories and geographies. And we're moving fast now to drive this new strategy into action.","We've announced our intention to focus our portfolio on the categories with the greatest potential, divesting about $1.5 billion of business with the definitive agreement now reached to sell our more cyclical tools business to a strategic buyer at an attractive multiple.","We will also divest a number of other non-core businesses including winter sports, Rubbermaid consumer storage, U.S. Heaters, Humidifiers and Fans, Lehigh Rope and Cordage, and a number of smaller brands including Teutonia, Zoot, and Squadra. The work to sell these assets has begun and we hope to have buyers lined up for these businesses by the end of 2017.","We've also made a new set of investment priorities, clustering the balance of our businesses against three discrete portfolio roles, win bigger, develop for growth, and deliver entrepreneurially.","These three roles will shape resource allocation, with win bigger categories benefiting from higher advertising and promotion investment, and develop for growth categories receiving a meaningful increase in insight and design investment as we work to strengthen the funnel of future growth ideas.","Both our win bigger and develop for growth categories will leverage a delivery and development operating model like the one previously deployed on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses.","Our deliver entrepreneurially businesses will be led and resourced more autonomously, with very specific business targets that ladder up to the overall company performance.","We've also begun a comprehensive reset of the organization that flows from these priorities. We'll consolidate 32 business units to 16 global divisions, with these divisions becoming the key operating nodes of the company.","We will scale our U.S. selling organization, creating integrated selling teams at our top 20 retail partners that account for 50% of our U.S. revenue. We will create global centers of expertise in key HR and finance disciplines and establish new global functions in procurement, IT, and legal.","We will build two new design hubs in Chicago and New York, and increase investment in brand research, as we extend the reach of these advantaged capabilities to new Jarden brands.","We will create a new global e-commerce division that will assume accountability for delivering over $1 billion of incremental growth across the enterprise by 2020. We expect to have the U.S. organization reset by the end of the year, with the rest of the world to follow some time in 2017.","With this scope of change, we're making very good progress on costs, with tremendous opportunity still ahead. We've delivered over $100 million in incremental 2016 savings related to Project Renewal through the third quarter and we are well on our way to deliver between $130 million and $140 million of incremental savings for the full year.","The cost synergy teams are now in full flight, with excellent progress on procurement, corporate duplication and corporate functions, and now the operating divisions. The decisive action to reshape the portfolio, set new investment priorities, and reset the organization will release the accelerated savings and synergies we've committed to deliver, ensuring earnings development while simultaneously enabling investment for growth.","Let me now turn to our 2016 outlook and our initial outlook for 2017. This morning, we increased Newell Brands' 2016 full year guidance, raising the bottom of both guidance ranges. We now expect to deliver 2016 full year core sales growth of 3.5% to 4% and full year normalized EPS of $2.85 to $2.90.","We're tracking towards the high end of the new core sales guidance range and the midpoint of the new normalized EPS range. Our full year 2016 guidance assumes just over $210 million in incremental gross cost savings related to both Project Renewal and cost and tax synergies from the combination with Jarden.","And with the benefit of tax synergies and one-time tax benefits in the third quarter, we now expect the full year tax rate to be about 27.5%.","Our revised guidance assumes the assets held-for-sale are not divested until January 1st, 2017 and that the current share count of just over 486 million shares remains essentially unchanged through the end of 2016.","This morning, we've also provided our initial outlook for 2017. We expect full year core sales growth of 3% to 4% and normalized earnings per share of $2.85 to $3.05. Our 2017 guidance metrics assumes we complete the divestiture of all assets held-for-sale on January 1st, 2017, resulting in normalized earnings per share dilution net of interest expense benefit of about $0.20 per share.","Our 2017 guidance assumes just over $300 million in incremental gross cost savings related to Project Renewal and the incremental cost and tax synergies related to the combination with Jarden.","We'll spend some of these benefits back in the business as we extend our growth capabilities to the Jarden businesses and scale our e-commerce division. We expect the 2017 share count to be about 488 million shares and the tax rate to be between 26% and 27%.","We expect to deliver strong double-digit normalized operating income and normalized net income in 2017, despite the dilutive impact of divestitures and higher interest expense associated with the Jarden transaction.","While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to make sure you're taking the following dynamics into consideration as you think about the next two quarters. First, regarding the fourth quarter of 2016, we've taken the decision to invest significantly more A&P in Q4 than we did in Q3, with investment prioritized against new innovations like the launch of Rubbermaid Brilliance, one of our best-ever food storage line of products, that provides a seal that simply will not leak and on Yankee Candle, with a significant new investment in advertising during the holidays.","Given our current growth assumptions for the fourth quarter, this increased level of investment to over 6% of revenue in the legacy Newell Rubbermaid brands will likely yield fourth quarter normalized earnings per share of about $0.80, which would represent about a $0.24 increase in normalized earnings per share versus prior year or about a 43% increase.","To be clear, we have -- if we have earnings upside to the fourth quarter, we would likely take the opportunity to make further investments for growth, rather than let the benefits flow to furthering what is already very strong earnings performance.","With regard to the first quarter of 2017, as we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we expect normalized earnings per share dilution in the first quarter of 2017 versus 2016.","The first quarter is a seasonally low earnings quarter for both legacy Jarden and Newell Rubbermaid and earnings per share will be burdened by the significantly higher share count and interest expense related to the combination.","Since our last call, we've announced the sale of our tools business, and plans to divest a number of other businesses. We expect the full year dilution net of interest expense benefit to be about $0.20, with that dilution skewed more to the first half of the year, driven by the phasing of mitigating actions assumed in the net impact.","We expect the first quarter impact of dilution net of interest expense benefit to be about $0.06 to $0.07, assuming the transactions are completed by January 1st. So, I would encourage you to take this into account in your first quarter estimates.","So, in closing, we're moving now with speed and decisiveness to capture the transformative value creation opportunity inherent in the combination of Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden.","Year-to-date, we've grown core sales 4.2% and delivered normalized EPS growth of over 28%, despite the potential distraction that a transaction of this size could create.","We've reset our corporate strategy and launched the new Growth Game Plan, with a clear roadmap that sets new investment priorities, strengthens our portfolios, and reshapes the organization. These actions are in full flight, and we expect them to be largely completed before the first anniversary of the combination.","We're simultaneously making new investments in design, insights, and e-commerce and we'll decisively move resourcing to our highest priority, win bigger and develop for growth categories as part of the 2017 plan.","Our cost and savings programs are delivering on an accelerated timetable. We now expect to deliver over $210 million in combined gross savings in 2016 and have a line of sight to over $300 million in combined incremental gross savings and tax synergies in 2017.","We have raised guidance for 2016 and have an ambitious plan for 2017 that will deliver strong double-digit normalized operating income and normalized net income growth, despite the lost income and retained costs associated with divestitures.","We're generating a lot of cash through the operations and by the end of 2016, now expect to have paid down about $2 billion of debt since the completion of the Jarden transaction. And with the incremental U.S. based net proceeds from the divestitures available in early 2017, we should be in the position to accelerate debt repayment further.","Our principles for capital allocation are clear and firm. We will invest in value creating CapEx and restructuring. We will generate dividends in our 30% to 35% payout ratio range. We will drive our leverage ratio to the targeted three to three and a half times range through both gross debt reduction and EBITDA development. And over time, our cash generative business will create many options to complement our organic agenda with external development of our core categories.","With the choice to restructure our portfolio and the generation of substantial net proceeds from those divestitures, we can now envision paths to accelerate achievement of our leverage ratio targets, while simultaneously pursuing the external development of our anchor categories through bolt-on M&A in the core.","This is an exciting time to be part of Newell Brands. I want to thank our people for their hard work and unwavering focus on delivery. Execution is an everyday thing and I'm very proud of our team's determination and drive for results, particularly in the midst of tremendous change. Together, we're building a larger, stronger, fast-growing and more profitable company.","Our confidence is high, because our team has done this kind of work before. We're incredibly well-positioned to grow our brands, are energized by the opportunity to create a lot of value for our shareholders.","And are driven by the prospects of building one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world, a company that helps make life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day, where they live, learn, work, and play. That is both the promise and the potential of Newell Brands.","With that, I'd like to pass the call back to Hannah who will open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","And your first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Michael Polk","Hi Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Hi, good morning. I have so many questions; I don't know where to start. Let me first ask just a modeling question, Ralph. If we're assuming -- or you're assuming that all the divestitures close on January 1st, but that's probably not actually way it will play out, unless I'm missing something, how do we possibly model this? We don't really have those pieces, so is it best to plug for it, to get to the EPS you're talking about?","Ralph Nicoletti","Yes, Lauren I think your point is right because we can't predict the exact date of when these transactions will close. So, we thought it would be helpful to have an anchor point with an assumption. And that assumption would be that it all gets transacted at the beginning of the year.","And if that occurred, it would equate, on all of the divestitures it would equate to about $0.20 of dilution. So, from that, as the actual timetables unfold as we move through the year, now we'll share that with you, you'll see that, and we'll adjust accordingly.","I'd say also that which -- and Mike alluded to in his remarks, the slope of the curve of the dilution is something you also have to be mindful of because while the dilution is assumed to be the full year, starting on January 1st, some of the savings offsets that we're going to be pursuing will take a little bit more time to evolve throughout the year.","So, the curve is a little bit skewed to the first and second quarters of the year. Mike said $0.06 to $0.07 in the first quarter, that's who you should be factoring in. And if the timing of closings adjust, obviously that will get -- we'll give you some guidance on that as it materializes.","Michael Polk","Lauren it's an excellent question, and yes, we could have played it one of two ways. We could have held on guidance until we had more clarity or we could give you a starting point. We chose to give you a starting point.","Now, we have a couple of opportunities to communicate, at least one opportunity to communicate publicly between now and earnings at the end of January and we'll take the opportunity to provide clarity at that moment -- any incremental clarity that we can provide with those -- as those opportunities present themselves. We could have played it one of two ways. We chose to play it this way, so that you can start thinking about this.","There's probably very few companies that are as complex to model right now as us, given the assets going out, given the changes we're making in the business, and given some of the unique dynamics under way in some of our categories.","Obviously, some businesses that are performing well, other businesses that are dealing with consequences of things -- of outcomes that happened earlier in the year, or external events like weather. And we'll try to help provide as much visibility to all of that as possible, without getting stuck in sort of too many inside baseball type of discussions.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. I mean, the decision to share this much early is great. I just, my head is swirling a little on how to make it fit into Excel. Let me ask just more of a revenue question. The Safety and Security business, the international business that you talked about being weak, it's actually one I'm not familiar with, even in my coverage of Jarden, so if you could tell me a little bit about what that business is, what the outlook for it is? Is that possibly a piece that's [Indiscernible] in the slide deck, there's still going to be exits, the small number, but there's still exist in the divestitures? So, any color on both of those pieces would be great. Thanks.","Michael Polk","So, First Alert has the relationship with publicly-traded company in the U.K., called Sprue. And we source and provide one of the most important ingredients that they use, and we us together in the creation in First Alert finished products for Europe out of Asia.","And you've got -- if you look at the complexion of our results, you see good growth in North America, good growth in Latin America, good growth in Europe, and then you see a down elevator in Asia.","The down elevator in Asia relates largely to this business. And this has been an issue that the Jarden business has been dealing with all year long, related to an assumption that was made in 2015 about a regulatory shift that would require all households in -- all new households in France and Germany to have carbon monoxide protection and carbon -- and smoke alarms.","And that legislation has been not fully enforced in 2016, but there was a lot of growth in 2015 on that business related to the impending change. And so, the business -- the Branded Consumables business, the First Alert business has actually had a great year in the U.S., but it's been offset in many ways by significant year-over-year down elevators.","And if we don't, the First Alert business for the full year, the impact would have been about $50 million in the full year to core sales. So, this is not a surprise, this was a known issue and we've been dealing with it all along, but that's what that comment relates to. It relates to the fact we're working through this 2015 big bubble, positive event in 2016.","And both by the end of the year, we've lapped all of that noise and we're back to steady-state and we can get on with growing our business. If you want to read what Sprue has to say about this, you can read their public comments, given that they are publicly-traded company on the AIM Exchange. So, that's what that specifically relates to.","And we don't typically get know all of that level of detail, but I'm happy to if it's helpful to help explain some of the dynamics. Because to your point earlier, there is a lot going on in the moving parts of the business and we've made the choice to move with speed to resolve these issues or to take advantage of opportunities.","Our choice to see the complexity reduction work through on Rubbermaid Commercial Products and absorb the core sales hit associated with that is grounded in the belief that's the right thing to set up the future.","If you look at the operating income margin in Commercial Products in the third quarter, you'll see a 250 basis point improvement in margin. Well, guess what, it's connected to some of those choices. And so we're going to see these choices through, irrespective to the consequences to our headline numbers, because this is right thing to do to set up the future and set up 2017.","And we'll take the bumps; we'll deal with the potholes and bumps in the road with you guys and help explain it to you. But we're moving forward in a single-mindedly focused way to set up 2017 in the new context of the new Growth Game Plan.","And that's why I guided Q3 down to the low end of the range. That's why I said a month or so back, that Q4 would be in the middle of the range. We're going to take the choices we believe are right for the future of the business and see this through irrespective of potentially having more income-driven quarters like we had in Q3 and like we might have in Q4 versus your expectation of us to get the high end of our core growth sales ranges.","And so, a lot of that's happening, there's lot of moving parts underneath the surface. Again, happy to explain it, but not going to hesitate to move forward and set up the future.","Lauren Lieberman","That's great. The transparency you guys always provide is incredibly helpful. So, thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","Yes, good morning, everyone. Just two quick questions for me. Mike, maybe you can provide some kind of state of the union on category growth? It looks like generally speaking, looking at all of the other consumer companies out there and the retailers, things seemed to have slowed down sequentially. So, just want to get your thought on that?","And then just coupled with that, if you can give us some progress on market share development across some of the key businesses? And then I have a follow-up.","Michael Polk","Yes, so we don't see major shifts in category growth right now in the markets that we can measure. So, for example, in the third quarter Writing had -- as a category as a market had very good growth, we had tremendous growth from a PoS standpoint. And if you adjust our 7.6% growth for the $15 million, we end up near double-digit type of growth on a core sales basis as well.","We increased market share in the U.S., where we have good measurements, by over 100 basis points in the third quarter on our Writing business, connected to an excellent story around back-to-school.","And so, we've come through that period with the right replenishment orders and we actually come down into our lower seasonality period now in Writing, with the opportunity to reset and set up momentum for the future. And so, we felt great about that.","Baby, obviously, we're consolidating market share. We're growing unbelievably well in Baby Gear, largely U.S. driven related to innovation. You know that we launched the 4Ever Car Seat in 2015. That's now $100 million item for us within the Baby Gear business, which is by far our biggest innovation ever.","And we've now followed that up with the Extend2Fit Car Seat on Graco, which allows your child to sit rear-facing longer but comfortably, because of the extension that we built into the car seat, which is as you know the safest way to ride as a small child.","And so these innovations are driving really good growth. And in Baby Gear, we've consolidated share -- again as best we can measure it, but with over 10% growth and with the kind of PoS numbers we see, through our transactional database, very good progress.","On Yankee Candle, continue to see very good PoS momentum. I know there's some syndicated data out there that would suggests there's challenges in that category. That's just not the way see it. And while I can't disclose the specific numbers to you, because these are retailer -- this is retailer data that we get every week, we have very nice growth going on from PoS perspective on Yankee.","The numbers on Yankee were more modest growth in Q3, but that's related to lapping the pipeline on Wal-Mart last year and actually the subsequent loss distribution at Target that creates an apples and oranges comparison in Q3 as well.","And we're back-talking with all of our retailers about extending the presence of the Yankee brand, but Yankee's underlying performance was quite good. Great growth in Europe, double-digit growth in Europe. So again, one of these inside baseball underlying dynamics that we had to deal within Q3, but the good fundamental momentum.","Coleman continues to be a challenge. We're not winning share there. We're going to lose share this year related to distribution. Marmot, dealing with the macro issues associated with both apparel and the consequences of last year's warm weather.","Appliance is building share, these are -- I'd say of all of the Jarden businesses, the one to highlight is the tremendous momentum on JCS, Jarden Consumer Solutions. It's been a full year of great growth and that's going to -- that should continue into the fourth quarter with whole series of new appliance launches.","So, we're in general, in very good shape. We've got these dynamics like Sprue, which is the distributer issue we talked about in Europe, related to First Alert. You've got Yankee having to lap year ago dynamics and having the consequences of the subsequent loss distribution at Target.","You've got the complexity reduction choices that we've made on Rubbermaid Commercial Products that we're going to see through, because they're right things for the long-term. And you've got the loss distribution on Coleman.","So, these things, you've got a mixed picture. Food Storage, great growth, great market share growth over 100 basis points of market share growth in Food Storage, related to the early launch of -- early 2016 launch of FreshWorks, and now we're really excited about what happens with Brilliance.","So, at the beginning of the year, I told you guys that we're -- that this was the Renaissance year for Rubbermaid. It's really coming to life, obviously through Food Storage.","Beverages, fine growth on PoS, but as a result of the pull forward into June related to the distribution transformation -- distribution center transition in July, not as great topline in the quarter, but very good underlying momentum and we're going to have a really strong Q4. So, I think we're exactly where we thought we were going to be. We're going to see these things through.","The next business that's on the hit parade, from a complexity reduction standpoint is our Writing business. And so we've talked about this all along, about going after 50 SKUs -- 50% of the SKUs and about 50% of the product line. We're in the midst of that, and we're going to drive that all the way home through the first quarter and into -- through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter to set up next year's back-to-school with the benefits of margin development becoming available through that window.","So, we're going to see these things all the way through because they're critical to renewal delivery and Project Renewal savings delivery. And they are the right things to do for the business to give us the affordability in the P&L to drive growth aggressively going forward.","Nik Modi","Great. Mike and just on the Jarden innovation pipeline, I mean, obviously, a lot of the Newell growth acceleration over the last two years or so has really been from innovation that you guys started to fund several years ago.","Michael Polk","Right.","Nik Modi","If you were to rate the Jarden innovation pipeline today, on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the worst, 10 being the best, how would you benchmark it right now and what would you characterize the Newell pipeline just too kind of give a compare\/contrast?","Michael Polk","So, to all my Jarden friends on the phone listening, I'm not going to rate. I'm going to do the Russian Judge, give the U.S. a score of -- but I will tell you that I'm really pleased and impressed with the Appliance business and we've got good things going on there.","I do think we -- as we build out these new design hubs, that I just described in the prepared remarks that we can do some things to even make that funnel stronger, relating to fit, form and finish, the design aspects of the product. So, I think there's things we can do to strengthen the funnel, but I do think there's some interesting ideas coming through the funnel out of JCS.","I think there's good innovation in a lot of places. The thing that I would say, is that the innovation is not art, its science. And the discipline of innovation development is what we've built a capability in and this is where we can bring know-how to some of our Jarden businesses.","And that should increase the probability of success and the increase the size of some of these projects -- the incrementality of some of these projects. And so you're right, there's a lead\/lag kind of effect on when that work will yield.","As if you flip through the web deck that we put out there, you'll see how we categorize different categories with respect to portfolio roles. And for the businesses that are in the develop for growth category or in win bigger, we will be able to shape and sharpen some of the work that's going on there, with added resources that will be co-located with those teams.","But I don't think the impact of those actions really yields growth in 2017. I think that begins to yield growth in 2018. In 2017, we want to continue to bring the ideas that are in the funnel to market and we want to create broader commercial success.","An example of that, on Coleman, we've gone back into a number of customers and we've gotten the distribution that we lost back for 2017. That's a commercial success from my perspective.","We're pushing now on Yankee Candle to broaden the wholesale distribution footprint and I'd love to find a way back into some of the customers where we've lost a presence in 2015, as a result of some of the choices we've made and we're going to go get that done.","We're in the fourth quarter on Baby Gear. In Canada, we will restructure our selling systems. We're a distributed business in Canada; we're going to go to a direct selling business in Canada.","We'll take the hit on Baby growth rates in Q4, to take the inventory out of the distributer. But then we'll get this big benefit in 2017 connected to building out a direct selling capability on Baby Gear in Canada, which will give us tremendous growth opportunity.","So, as I've said, whether it's Writing complexity and accepting the fact that if our growth rates for the next couple of quarters will also contract, or whether it's Baby transition in Canada from a distributer to a direct selling salesforce or whether it's regaining the loss distribution on Coleman, or pressing for broader distribution on Yankee in the U.S. markets. These things are as valuable as innovation-led growth; it's just commercial-led growth.","And so, we're -- 2017 will be more commercially and execution-led for the Jarden businesses. And we'll continue the momentum on a balance of innovation commercial-led growth on the legacy Newell businesses. But as we talked about these our agenda going forward, you're going to hear less Newell Rubbermaid language, you're going to hear less Jarden language. You're going to hear about our brands and about the 16 divisions we've created.","And this commitment to really make life better to consumers, hundreds of millions of consumers every day where we live, learn, work and play. And that's a powerful framework for the new company going forward, and that's how we'll map our businesses, and that's how we will begin to talk about our businesses with you.","Nik Modi","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Michael Polk","Hey Bill.","William Chappell","Thanks. Good morning. First, just quickly on the M&A standpoint. Ralph, if all the deals are postponed past January 1, is it more or less dilutive than the $0.20 outlook?","Ralph Nicoletti","If they get diluted, I mean, depending on the mix of them, let's take tools and then I'll deal with everything else. Tools would be less dilutive if the closing goes past January 1st. I think the one that's a little more tricky to model was skis, because of the slope of the way the earnings flow. In the first half of the year on that business, we lose money and then the back half of the year is where the profits come in.","So, obviously, from an M&A standpoint, all that is equalized in the value, but in terms of the pacing and the dilution, we actually would get hurt a little bit ironically, if it went early in the year. And then obviously towards the end of the year, we'd be picking up the profit. So, that's the one that's a little tricky in this.","Michael Polk","Yes, I think I'll just jump in on skis. I think it will be tough for us to close that deal by the end of the year. So, we'll probably have to deal with the loss in Q1 that's baked into the Jarden base that happens every Q1 associated with the ski business, but I think it will be tough to get it done by the end of the year.","I'm sort of hopeful on Tools, although if Tools were to take longer that's actually a positive. But I think that it's best for the Tools business, for the Tools team, and for us to get the net proceeds in hand, so that we can work on the debt and the leverage ratio more aggressively.","Because if we do that, Bill, if we get the proceeds in hand early, pay down the debt more aggressively, we find ourselves in a position, having reset the organization to potentially get back into bolt-on M&A in the core, complementing our organic agenda.","And we think we'll have the capacity to do that -- organizational capacity to do that type of thing, because of the experience and leadership team and the speed with which we're moving through Q3 and Q4.","So, I do think Q3 and Q4 are set up quarters for 2017 and we're going to be uncompromising in finishing things we've started or getting the bad cholesterol out of the system in 2016, so that we have a clean comparator. But you're right; certain businesses lose money in certain quarters and make money in others.","Skis happens to be a one that the perfect scenario on skis, is to sell it by the end of the year, but we focused on getting Tools done first. We're in the midst of ramping on skis, and there's a lot of interest. So, I'm hopeful we get a good value and we get -- we set these businesses up for success in the context of their new owner.","But there are those dynamics again inside baseball dynamics of timing and impact on dilution and modeling, that we'll do our best to help you with as we get more clarity.","William Chappell","Okay. Thanks. And then one question on just kind of core sales outlook. I know there's a lot of moving parts, but just trying to look at -- you maintained the 3% to 4% next year, but you're taking out tools which is flat at best right now and winter sports which is probably the same. I've got to think that adds at least 100 basis points to your growth algorithm.","And so, it's certainly below what core Newell has been growing over the past three or four years or so. Do you still look at next year as a transition year as we take some of the slower growing businesses out or are you just trying to be conservative as we're still in 2016?","Michael Polk","So, there's a lot of uncertainty so we are being prudent, but there's also a reality probably to the first half of the year. Remember, we're going to go through -- we have already redesigned the organization, and we're repopulating the organization in the fourth quarter in the U.S.","We'll have touched over 10,000 jobs in the U.S. between Q3 and Q4. Obviously, now those people aren't leaving, but they are moving into different roles and different configuration.","And we're working as fast as I've ever worked in my career to get to the organization reset. That organization will come up to speed and get into a rhythm of working in the first quarter that has a natural sort of startup curve to it.","So, I do think that the first half of 2017 is a transition half. But I think you're right, I think we'll get through this very, very quickly and get know a rhythm of working, because the cultures are more similar than different, I think we'll get through that transition period really well.","But I do think that you have to accept that when you're making that kind of broad change, that there is some distraction potential in the business and there's always execution risk connected to that, which is why we've guided the way we've guided.","You're right; the businesses we're selling have lower aggregated growth rates than the total company, so we should get a positive mix effect in core on growth. And we will get a positive mix effect when this is all said and done on margin.","The issue for all of you, because of the new rules that don't allow us to disc ops treatment on these things, is that you're going to be comparing -- you won't see the margin development benefit until really 2018 after we've lapped and gotten a full year under our belt, because the history will still be in our base P&L next year. But we'll try to demonstrate that to you as best we can through active engagement. But I think that it's a fair challenge for us.","And I used the words in the script, that steadily accelerating growth rates and I pick my words really carefully. That's how you should think about the growth through 2017. And we said steadily increase, steadily accelerating growth and rapid accretion in strong cash -- rapid earnings accretion and strong cash delivery.","And that should tell you what we think the story is. And we've guided EPS which is complicated next year because of dilution, share count and interest expense, but I also in the script said, strong double-digit normalized operating income growth and net normalized net income growth, which should tell you what's going on in the underlying business.","And I think if you went all the way back and rewound the tape to April and said, what did Mike say in April? I said year one accretion high single-digits, year two accretion mid-teens to high teens, and then strong double-digit accretion year three and onward.","Well, unfortunately, the years don't correlate to the calendar year, so you'd have to kind of piece that altogether. But if you go back and look at that, it looks to me like we're well ahead of what we said we were going to do.","So, but there's so much noise in all of your models, because it's so difficult for you to do what Lauren was saying, you guys need to do with accuracy, given how much we disclose, that we're going to have to deal with the fact that -- and Nancy will work hard with you to narrow the error band around these things, we'll deal with the fact that 2017 is probably another year, where it isn't quite as precise as it will be once we get to apples-to-apples comparison for you.","William Chappell","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS.","Michael Polk","Hey Steve.","Steve Powers","Hey Mike. Good morning. So, first question, does running the two separate operating models that you've described today, limit the synergy upside to the $500 million that you've at least talked about as potentially residing in the business? Because it seems like the magnitude of synergies available on the entrepreneurial model businesses would be materially less than the development and delivery businesses if that makes sense?","Michael Polk","Yes, it's a great question. Did you have a second question too Steve?","Steve Powers","Well, as you're answering that, I do have a longer term question I want to follow-up. But as you're answering that, if you could just also help us, how much of the business in terms of sales and profits today is going to fall under each operating model?","Michael Polk","Yes, we didn't disclose. I thought about putting that into the web deck. I think I'll hold on that and let us get through 2017 planning, so I can provide a forward-looking view. We'll probably give you that at CAGNY, so you have a little bit more specificity.","We also have to get into the reporting segments, as we resolve that through the fourth quarter because we're not going to report 16 divisions obviously. So, but you should think about that in the context of this strategic ambition I laid out around live, learn, work, play. And there's probably maybe a fifth segment out there -- who knows, but we need to work through all that over time.","With respect to your question on synergies. The devil is in the details. So, for example, we're going to play for synergies everywhere we can get them. So, from a -- to deliver entrepreneurially positioned businesses, we're going to clearly go after synergies and corporate functions.","And we're going to go after synergies, where we said procurement, IT, legal, and eventually as we build out a shared services model on IT transactions, financial transactions, HR transactions, doesn't matter whether you're entrepreneurial or whether you're develop and deliver kind of model, you're going to leverage that system, so you really don't get a choice. That's not up for discussion, it's not a vote. It's not a democracy when it comes to capturing those synergies.","There's certain other synergies that are going to be available for certain businesses. So, a business like Pure Fishing which is a great example, where it has a big part of its business in a channel that specific to it.","You're not going to capture synergies there. You may be able to scale home and selling with Pure Fishing, but for the Pure Fishing part of the portfolio that sold through Wal-Mart, that sales synergy is going to be captured.","If you're looking at Safety and Security which is positioned as an entrepreneurial business, the home center portion of Safety and Security is going to be sold by The Home Depot team and the Lowe's team.","You'll get that bit of synergy and so it's not binary. And so it's not -- there's a level of granularity to this that enables you to play for some of those route-to-market synergies, and certainly the corporate and shared services synergies across the entire enterprise.","e-commerce as a division will cut across the whole enterprise, irrespective of whether you are an entrepreneurial-led business or part of the develop and delivery model. So, I don't think that it's going to limit it. We still believe that I gave you some very specific numbers with respect to gross synergies and savings for next year and for this year. And we're well on our way to delivering those numbers, and to the degree we can find more we'll offer those up.","I think that I'm almost certain there will be more, not necessarily next year perhaps -- but not necessarily next year, but as we look forward beyond 2017 to 2018 and 2019, I'm kind of hopeful there are. And I'm not at all fussed by this two operating model approach.","I think that it's actually a positive relative to what we had on the Newell Rubbermaid side. We've learned from that experience that some of those businesses would have been better managed as more autonomous businesses, with very specific targets that shape the margin development of them.","Steve Powers","Okay, that's helpful. And so my longer term question and maybe a bit too early, but you'd mentioned April. I think back in April you'd also described yourself kind of looking out aspirationally to 2018 with annual EBITDA of about $3.5 billion, EBITDA margins 20% plus and cumulative operating cash flow between 2016 and 2018 as somewhere between $5.5 billion to $6 billion.","I'm just curious as given all of the evolution and strategies that occurred since then, is there a way to revisit and reframe that, in terms of what your longer term objectives are, as you stand today?","Ralph Nicoletti","Steve, its Ralph. Those goals still are in place. I would say with the steps we've taken thus far particularly on the portfolio, the deleveraging will be ahead of plan within that. And that will give us as Mike mentioned in his remarks, some flexibility to achieve our leverage goals, and then also, have the capability to bring in some bolt-on M&A in our core categories. So, that will change the completion over that period of time. So, we'll get the benefit on the organic side from all of the things that Mike had alluded to.","But I would say this repositioning also strengthens us overall, because we're going to be moving categories out that frankly would have been more of a challenge in our minds to develop and grow within that model. And then have the opportunity to bring in some different businesses in our core capability -- in our core categories and capabilities, that we could leverage and create more.","So, I think now nothings in macro sense-changed with that, but if you sort of think about the pieces underlying it, the leverage program is enabled, and the M&A program is enabled to complement the organic agenda.","Michael Polk","Yes, I think we're going to get right back on the glide path, if not ahead of it, because think about this, you're divesting businesses that are non-core, that don't really play in the same space as the balance of your portfolio. They don't have route-to-market synergies, or they don't have -- they don't or can't leverage your core operating model. And so we're going to get margin development from that, we're going to get the net proceeds in from that, we'll pay down the debt, it'll give us access to M&A faster.","But the real story in the M&A is that we have the breadth of products and categories that we want now. The whole theory of the combination is grounded in this opportunity to consolidate unconsolidated categories. So, we complete in large growing unconsolidated categories with leading brands.","And so, we're going to apply the model for growth to build market share in those anchor categories. But then we're going to complement it with M&A in the core. And the M&A in the core is by far the most interesting value creation path we could take, because we will plug brands into existing operating units and best example of this is Elmer's.","Within six months, we had plugged that brand into the writing creative expressions group, and delivered $20 million plus of run rate synergies, think about the value creation connected to that.","So, as we get back into bolt-on activity in the core, we will be able to bridge back to the original glide path and I actually think ahead of the original glide path. It may not all work out, the timing may not all work out in 2017.","But once we get into 2018 and beyond, we should be really motoring, and hopefully ahead of some -- obviously the numbers I communicated in that $5.5 billion to $6 billion excluded any disposals, but also excluded any acquisitions.","And I think that we get right back to the glide path. It's just that we live through this transitional window. And I think we might actually get ahead of the glide path that we originally laid out driven by synergies connected to the acquisitions.","Steve Powers","Okay, cool. And you expect to be ready to be more proactive from a bolt-on acquisition point, sort to middle of next year, is that the right way to think about it?","Ralph Nicoletti","Yes, that's clearly in 2017, we'll be able to principally because of the divestitures. So, the timing not exact, but in 2017, you should expect us to be active.","Steve Powers","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Michael Polk","Steve, we just need to get the transition organizationally behind us. We need to get a quarter under our belts, operating as a new team. But of course you can't control timing on these things. So, I don't know whether it will be first half, second half, early, late. We don't know, but job one is to get the transition behind us, and start operating in the new context, and delivering in the new context and the M&A will present itself when it does.","Steve Powers","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Michael Polk","Hey Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good morning guys. Mike, I wanted to come back to the topic of core sales and I guess how it sort of informs our view with underlying trends. So, you reported 3% in the quarter and Bill Chappell touched on this sort of dynamic as well. You printed 3%, the guide was for the lower end of 3% to 4%, but that was prior to the decision to exclude the divestitures that you announced.","And the hurt from that is probably in, rough math probably in the ballpark of like 50 to100 basis points. So, my sense is market expectations and ours were closer to 4% for the quarter, given that dynamic.","And presumably I guess, even probably I suspect lower than your expectations also given this dynamic. So, is that accurate number one?","And I guess number two, if so, what sort of came in worse in the quarter than you anticipated than when you gave the guidance of lower end of 3% to 4%? And then I have a follow-up.","Michael Polk","Yes, I mean, it's a fair question, Kevin. So, the thing that I'm looking at is I'm looking at the net sales numbers, relative to what you had in your model and we were off by a bit. I think part of that is driven by underperformance in the held-for-sale business relative to what you'd expected. And to be fair, some of those businesses underperformed our expectations as well.","If you followed the Stanley discussion, when they were talking about the deal, they talked about distribution center transition issue in tool -- our Tools business that they were aware of and we disclosed. And so we had -- the held-for-sale businesses underperforming slightly.","The balance of the business came in pretty much where we thought it was going to be. I debated back with Q2 earnings, giving you guys some of these moving parts that I've now disclosed. Like I didn't think I would be ever talking about our Sprue relationship in the U.K., but I think that it's worth talking about.","So, you have a whole series -- and I didn't talk to you about the Beverage D.C. transition, because I didn't think it was worth talking about. But I was kind of hoping that maybe we would have gotten 20, 30, 40 basis points more, but that's $12 million in a quarter. So, it's not something that I spend a lot of time worrying about.","But Beverages, they're a whole series of one-time things that we just chose to motor right on through that the Beverages D.C., the Sprue event, continuing to see the Commercial Products transitional the way through. These are choices that are the right choices for the long haul, but they compromise yearned type of delivery and we just is accepted that risk associated with the guidance.","But your rough math is right, but there were just roughly the same amount of one-time negatives in the business that were working against that number you quoted.","So, all of that was within our line of sight, maybe we're hoping for a little bit better or less profound impacts there. But it's on the fringes when you think about what else we were worrying about in the quarter.","We were worried about disposing $1.5 billion worth of business. We were resetting the entire organization, including the salesforce which is not a small deal to do, when you're as U.S. centric as we are. So, our focus was on the longer timeframe and in a perfect world, we would have delivered 3.5% core.","But in the context of what we were doing, we wanted to see the other stuff threw that could have mitigated the risk, and we chose to take a longer than 90 day view on some of those choices, because you could easily have deferred that the transition on Beverages. You could have easily deferred some of the other choices we are making on complexity to flatter the core growth numbers.","But we just didn't in the context of the kind of profound change we're driving, just didn't want to create that complexity in the organization. So, we chose to ignore it and let the numbers play the way they were going to play.","Kevin Grundy","All right. I appreciate the transparency on that Mike. Thank you. And then one more follow-up for me, just as it pertains to underlying business trends. So, you edged up the organic sales guidance, like rough math now to 3.5% to 4%.You've done 4.2% if I'm not mistaking year-to-date for core sales. So the rough math suggests a high end, you do 3.5% core sales in 4Q, where the low end would be like a sub 2% kind of number.","Michael Polk","Yes.","Kevin Grundy","But given the comment you just made, like 3.5% probably would have been what you would have like what you've done. But you've made some longer term decisions for the business, which are sensible. Should we be thinking about higher end that feels like a reasonable place to be, correct me if I'm wrong?","Michael Polk","Well, here is in the script, what I said was, that within the core sales guidance range, we're trending toward the higher end. And so back at back-to-school, I guided Q3 to the low end and I even said in some of the Q&A that I'd be fine if we drifted below.","In Q4, I said midpoint of the range and at mid-point of the range you end up at 3.8% to 3.9% on the full year. There are things happening in the fourth quarter and I've tried to be transparent about it in some of the answers I gave earlier.","We will have softer Baby momentum in the fourth quarter connected to this distributer transition in Canada. We will have slower Writing growth, sort of the low end -- very low end of the range connected to the complexity reduction of manufacturing transition and the distribution transition in the fourth quarter.","And that's all driven by the choices we're making to get the complexity out of that business. This is the right time of year to do it, so that when we come up into Q1 and into Q2 ramping for back-to-school 2017, we're in full flight.","Ralph Nicoletti","With better margins.","Michael Polk","With better margins, like we saw on the Commercial Products numbers that we reported, 250 basis point improved margins. Now, in the case of Writing, we'll likely spend that money back. But in the case of Commercial Products, we banked that.","And so, we're going to have really strong Home Solutions growth in the fourth quarter connected to the recovery of Beverages, after the distribution center transition, related to the launch of Brilliance on Rubbermaid and related to a shift in timing on Cookware out of Q3 to Q4, which again we don't talk about -- shouldn't talk about because it's just too much inside baseball information.","But we're going to have a really strong topline quarter in the fourth quarter. So, we'll have very strong Home Solutions, weak Writing, low end of the range of what you'd be comfortable with, connected to the Writing complexity work.","We'll have the Baby transition that will cost us $5 million to $10 million of revenue in the fourth quarter, but set up great growth next year on Baby. We'll have strong performance in Appliances. We'll have -- should have very good Yankee performance in the fourth quarter, given that we're spending more. So, the complexion of our growth in the fourth quarter will change versus what has been driving us up until now.","But again, 2016 is a reset year to be able to set up -- or set up year this movement forward in 2017 and we're going to see all of that through. I think midpoint of the range is the right place to peg yourself and I've given very specific perspective on what I think the earnings per share will look like in the fourth quarter, because we're going to spend significantly more A&P behind the growth agenda in the fourth quarter.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. Thanks for the transparency, Mike. Good luck, guys.","Michael Polk","Thanks.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Polk","Hey Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey good morning. So, we're a few years into higher advertising spending on the heritage Newell business, and obviously seems to have worked in terms of driving sustainable higher organic sales growth, along with I guess, the innovation you discussed earlier in Q&A.","But any initial thoughts on how responsive the Jarden side of the portfolio might be to higher marketing spending, versus heritage Newell, maybe some early reads on businesses where you boosted marketing? Or if you haven't done that, you have on the Jarden side, at least some of the analytics, you've run through post deal to determine where to spend, that'd be helpful?","Michael Polk","Yes. So, we're going to learn there, really quickly here, because we're putting material money behind Yankee in the fourth quarter. We've got new advertising that the team has worked on together. And we're going to try to stimulate more demand around the customization promise that Yankee can make through broad based television advertising, as we come through the holidays.","Because of Yankee's retail footprint, we'll be able to measure that really quickly. So, I'm actually excited to be able to see -- pull a lever and get a response that is tangible hopefully.","We'll learn quickly, because as you know, we don't want to put money into businesses that aren't going to have that kind of responsiveness and we haven't done that up until now.","We've been quite commercial through Q2 and Q3 on Jarden investment, but the money is now being shifted over to Yankee as part of our portfolio and prioritization work. And we should learn very, very quickly, fourth quarter into Q1 as to whether that worked or didn't work. And we're kind of hopeful that it will.","So, time will tell. It's right around the corner. We've got all eyes on this, because obviously we would love to grow, without having to make big investments in A&P. But we believe actually that A&P is sort of an essential part of the algorithm for Newell Rubbermaid and the categories look very, very similar.","So, we think that one of the things that the scale and the combination affords us, is to be able to put this type of A&P behind some of the higher priority businesses, with the goal of trying to dwarf from a resourcing standpoint our sub scaled competition. And we'll learn in the fourth quarter, its right around the corner.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay. And then on the heritage Newell side, I guess, Writing instruments, very strong results. Are you seeing competitive response out there, in terms of advertising or promotional spending that as we look out to 2017 could slow the momentum?","Michael Polk","No, not right now, not really. We've seen mostly commercial responses, not big investments. It's going to be very hard for sub scale competition to be able to afford to put money into the brands the way we are. That's part of the -- this is why scale matters in these categories. So, we haven't seen material shifts in the investment profiles or material shifts in the quality of the innovations that are coming to market.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay. And then last, are there other pieces of the portfolio, either in the Jarden or Newell side which could be a candidate for divestiture post what you've already announced? Are they sizeable or are you pretty comfortable with the portfolio at this point, obviously assuming these divestitures occur?","Michael Polk","Yes, I never like to make it black and white, that we'll never do it. But we took a big swing here, with the choices we've made in August and we're going to see all those through.","There may be other assets over time that we'd swap for some other items in the core, but we're not active in that regard. We've got a lot on our plate right now, executing what we said we were going to go do. And I think I wouldn't envision anything material happening in --over the next two or three quarters and beyond that I'd hesitate to get too specific.","But we actively manage the portfolio, and we have on Newell Rubbermaid. We'll continue to on the combination. Our energy now is focused on disposals that is going to shift to bolt-on M&A in the core. There may be some other things we choose to do later on. But for now, we're really happy with what we've chosen to do and we think it will enable management and leadership to focus on the businesses with the greatest opportunity.","Dara Mohsenian","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Just a quick question on the tax rate. The 26% to 27% for fiscal 2017, thereafter, do you think the tax rate stays at that level, or does it jump back up? And then I have a question on e-commerce?","Ralph Nicoletti","Hi Wendy. On the tax rate for 26%, 27% for 2017, what that reflects is our -- some of the tax planning work that we started actually and started to realize some benefit from as early as this quarter in the balance of the year.","So that, we think is sustainable. Those are tax planning things that are structural, that we're taking advantage of, with the combined footprint of Jarden and Newell on a global basis, so sustainable.","There are things that we're going to be -- I'll call it, attacking in terms of more tax optimization over time. And I think as we evolve the company and the M&A agenda as well, that presents additional opportunities. So, I think that's the right range to model beyond. I don't see it lifting materially from 2017.","Michael Polk","Yes, I certainly don't think in 2018 it will, because there's going to be more tax synergies. Now, one of the beautiful things about this is. And there are discreet items obviously, because of the -- I mentioned discreet items in Q3. We've assumed that we're able to repeat some of these discrete items, that there will be different discrete items, but we'll be able to cover that in the base. But the going tax benefits will -- should as Ralph just said, increase over time.","That said, I mean, if you look out a few years beyond that, there's some potential that tax rate could drift up. But I've been saying that the whole time I've been at Newell Rubbermaid and it hasn't actually played out that way. So, I always worry about the discrete items, not being able to lap them, but there always seems to be more discrete items available.","Wendy Nicholson","Terrific, sounds good. And then, on the e-commerce thing, my question -- I guess, two things, sort of, conceptually the idea of pulling together an e-commerce division. They are going to focus on everything from e-commerce sales to digital marketing on -- all that kind of stuff I assume, correct me if I'm wrong.","But the $1 billion of sales through e-commerce channels, how much of that do you expect will be through your own website direct-to-consumer? Or is that all going to be through independent retail websites and is that going to be margin accretive or dilutive to the exiting margin? Thanks.","Michael Polk","So, let me be clear about that. This is a commercial organization, so this is a selling and demand conversion organization. So, they will not be spending the vast majority of their time on digital marketing. That will be the brand development organization, those are people that will be creating the digital assets and thinking about the digital media strategy.","So, the brand owners will own that work. This is a group of people that will be focused. And it will be a sizeable group of people who will be focused on taking the demand created by the brand teams and converting it to purchase in these channels. And their focus is going to be largely bricksandmortar.com and pureplay.com.","We do not envision a huge movement forward on direct-to-consumer, except in the Yankee business and in selected other businesses, like Marmot, and potentially Coleman and Baby.","But the reality is that the vast majority of that growth is going to come from bricksandmortar.com and pureplay.com. And so the selling aspects around Amazon as a Pure Play, or Alibaba as a Pure Play, or walmart.com as a Pure Play that will be led by this team, and they will be working in partnership with the bricks-and-mortar teams to drive conversion of demand, to purchase in the channel.","It's going to be really exciting. The $1 billion of growth I think is conservative, in terms of what's possible by 2020. But we're ramping that capability now and the hub of that organization will be one floor below the Executive team in Hoboken. So, we're going to keep that team right next to us, because of the importance of its delivery against our growth agenda.","Wendy Nicholson","And the margin profile of that $1 billion of sales?","Michael Polk","It's actually just depends on what happens going forward. Today dot com margins are generally better than brick-and-mortar margins, because you have lower selling expense connected to it.","If you think most companies have about 4% selling expense in consumer goods space to be able to reach bricks-and-mortar, you've got far less intensity, because you don't have retail selling expense either brokered or direct retail selling expense connected to it.","So, it can be -- it's about parity at gross, but it's more profitable through the below the line aspects of it.","Wendy Nicholson","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Hey, Mike good morning.","Michael Polk","Hey, Bill, you still with us?","Bill Schmitz","I am, listening to every single word. So, why is organic growth in the fourth quarter going to be better? Because if you look at the puts and takes, it sounds Ike AeroBed is going back into Wal-Mart. Yankee is not liking -- lapping the pipeline, and selling more advertising, the pen business is shipping to China.","And then you look at Jarden's comp, and it goes from a plus 6% this quarter to plus 2% and yours is roughly the same. So, am I missing something there? And I know you have a little bit of headwind on the SKU reduction on the Writing side, the Baby stuff but--","Michael Polk","Yes, I think that's the thing to look at Bill, in your model. So, first of all, Baby is real, but that will be a material down shift, because we have to take the inventory back in Canada and then we can turn it around and sell it back in, but that won't happen until Q1. So, it's a timing-related dynamic.","Although Baby has tremendous momentum right now, so maybe you're right. But Writing is going to go through this transition period, much like commercial products had. So I think the right thing to think about on Writing is low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter.","Now, that will be an event-based kind of transition, and then we're back in gear as we move through Q1. And certainly, Q1 should be strong, and then particularly after that and Q2 really ramps up to support back-to-school.","So, yes, there's some value in pipeline in China, but we're going to really pull the throttle back, as we go through this complexity reduction period in Writing. And then in aggregate, that gets you to 3.5%.","And to be clear, you know what, the confidence is there in the $0.80, but because we are stepping up A&P, so much we have a pressure release valve, that if in fact, that there's any risk on growth connected to what I've just shared with you.","So, 3.5% is probably the right place to be and it would be great if we delivered more, but I'd want to be transparent, that we won't press for more in the fourth quarter, because we want to get 2017 off to a fast start.","Bill Schmitz","Okay. I mean, but how about that Jarden comp, because it goes from 6% to 2%?","Michael Polk","Yes, it does. Jarden comps get a lot easier here on out. You're right, they're 2.2, even 2.2will be a little bit tougher, but Q1 and Q4 should be nice quarters for us. I think Appliances and Yankee that helps, Coleman continues as a negative. You don't get the AeroBed; you don't get the distribution back on Coleman until 2017, so we'll continue to suffer there.","And Marmot is dealing with what everybody else in apparel is dealing with right now, which I was glad to see it's been a cold, wet and white last week in the North East, so that's good. But everybody is dealing with the same dynamics in apparel. So that's not going to flip to a positive on us","But you may be right, it may be that we get better momentum in Appliances, and we get to a higher number than 3.5%. We think that's the right place to plant it for now, given what I shared with you on Baby and Writing.","Ralph Nicoletti","Plus we're at probably at the peak of some the transition on the organization in that period of time.","Michael Polk","I sometimes discount that, but we're changing everything basically. But I'm convinced that people need through change really well, when it's this profound a set of changes, but that's a possible governor to Ralph's point as well.","But we'll know it soon enough, whether it's better than 3.5 or not. I'd be disappointed if it was worse. But again, these are reset quarters, these are income-driven quarters as we get the organization remodeled and retooled for the future.","Bill Schmitz","Okay. And then what's driving the growth in the Appliance business? Because we get the Wal-Mart scanner data effectively, which I guess, picks up most of -- or should pick up most of the brands in Wal-Mart, so where is all that great growth coming from?","Michael Polk","Yes, we have phenomenal growth in Latin America right now on the Oster brand, and Sunbeam is growing in channels you may or may not be measuring. And sometimes when we launch new SKUs, the syndicated guys don't pick it up, because we're not using Nielsen, we're using IR.","But their growth is in slow cooking in the U.S., and in pain care which is heating pads in Sunbeam, and tremendous growth on Oster in Latin America. And so that's been a sustained story. Part of that's pricing driven in Latin America gets transaction ForEx issues, but good momentum.","And FoodSaver, of course, which has been double-digit growth since I've been looking at it, back in October of 2015. And with the launch of the new item on FoodSaver, which we call FoodSaver Flow within the company, which is a whole new system that should continue right through Q4.","Bill Schmitz","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Michael Polk","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to touch back on e-commerce, because how does the e-commerce division work with the two operating models, like where does the decision-making lie?","Does the e-commerce team look at the entirety of the portfolio in terms of the innovation and products, and decide what to market to various brickandmortar.com or online.com? Or is it more of a team effort between the both operating models and e-com division?","Michael Polk","Strategic intent will be driven by the brand, but choices about what to sell where and how to sell it will be led by the e-commerce division and they will be empowered to make that choice. They'll be fully resourced with a standalone P&L and will drive the growth agenda for the company, leveraging digital assets that are created by the brand teams.","The points of connection to the operating divisions will come through pricing strategy and pricing execution. So, obviously, you have channel conflict dynamics that can arise with this model.","So that's where the point to connectedness needs to happen. It's in what we would call trade marketing or business development, where those conversations really need to be very, very clear, such that we don't get into pricing dislocating dynamics between the bricksandmortar.com and the bricks-and-mortar, or the pureplay.com and the bricks-and-mortar. So, that's where the complexity is.","I don't believe in shared accountability on things like this, nothing ever gets done. It's like begging for resources. We're going to structure this team, which will be fully resourced, with cross-functional resources. They'll have their own P&L, they'll have their own budgets, they'll have their own set of targets to deliver. The sales relationships will be connected to the division associated with the dot-com work. And all of the directtoconsumer.com work will connect through that P&L.","Now, of course, we're going to have shadow P&Ls in the division, so the divisions get the benefit of e-commerce as well. And when we report externally, you won't see us reporting an e-commerce division, you'll see us reporting a category-based models that likely ladders up to something more strategic, than what I'm describing -- what we've described today. But that's how it will work. And the point of complexity will be around pricing and pricing strategy across all channels.","Olivia Tong","Got it. That's helpful. And I know this is a long ways away, but as you think longer term about further divestitures, is it fair to assume that potential exits could come from both the develop for growth and deliver entrepreneurially divisions?","Michael Polk","Yes, I'm agnostic on portfolio, but I think our strategy will drive those choices. So, as we continue to build our platforms out, we'll learn more. And -- but I don't think our focus will be -- after we get through this first $1.5 billion, I think we're going to be looking to rebuild our focus within the core, and grow and deliver, and get back to the glide path that we originally described. And I'm hopeful we get beyond that glide path, with some of the deals that we could potentially do in our core categories.","So, I won't be anxious to reset more, but that's not to say we won't. We might at some point in the future, if we think that a business might be better valued as part of somebody else's architecture.","The things we're keeping are the things we want to keep and we believe in. But we'll learn more as we go and our focus is growth after we get through this period of resetting the portfolio, both organic and externally developed and delivered growth.","Olivia Tong","Thanks Mike. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Michael Polk","Hey Joe.","Joseph Altobello","Hey guys, good morning. I'll be very brief here, in terms of one question. I think looking at next year and the drag from currencies and commodities. You look at currencies, getting a little bit worse -- or I'm sorry, a little better, commodities getting a little bit worse. So, how are you guys thinking about the combined drag on earnings next year, versus what you're seeing in 2016?","Michael Polk","Yes. We'll have more commodity inflation next year, resin costs will be higher, not -- it's nothing like what we've experienced in prior year periods. But we'll have to do a little bit more pricing and we'll have to watch that very carefully.","FX is actually -- we'll have more of a headwind next year potentially, slightly more. Nothing like what we saw in 2014, 2015. It really depends on relative moves in interest rates, but we've built a modest increase in FX impact.","If you look at the FX impact -- the translation impact in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, we had 105 basis points of headwind in the third quarter versus 75 year-to-date. So, it's gotten a little bit worse, but it's not a massive shift.","Ralph Nicoletti","Yes. Essentially, we've assumed the markets today as they are or what we're going to see into next year. And as Mike said, that's net -- a drag on the results for next year. Principally where we saw the sharpest move is in the pound recently and that's the biggest driver.","Michael Polk","But all that's reflected in the guidance we provided. And we'll see how it -- obviously, we don't know how this will play out, and we have to adapt to it. So, if we get more FX, and more transaction impacts, we're going to have to price to recover.","Joseph Altobello","They both get a little worse, but nothing to get overly concerned about at this point?","Michael Polk","Yes.","Joseph Altobello","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason Gere","Okay. Thanks and I'll be very brief as well. I guess my question is just, with what we've seen in the Consumer landscape over the last couple of quarters, both Consumer and on the Commercial side, we've seen some softness.","I was just -- I guess, Mike, I just wanted to get your outlook, maybe your state of the union, just on maybe more on the Commercial side? So think Consumer side, you have a lot of good innovation coming through, and there's a lot of investments going through. But I was wondering maybe about the Commercial side, and any concerns that you have, over maybe the next six to nine months in terms of a slowing down?","Michael Polk","Look, we've made a move, a series of moves with portfolio now that makes our company far more consumer-centric than we historically have been. And the Tools decision was the last in a series of choices, the decision to sell Lehigh Rope and Cordage and another aspect of the business that is more cyclically-oriented. So, we're not as vulnerable.","In the new portfolio, we'll not be at all as vulnerable. We'll look more like a consumer goods company than we've historically looked like as a blended company. So, far less cyclically exposed with the Decor business hardware business, tools business, Lehigh Rope and Cordage business out of the portfolio.","So, I'm not -- I'm actually more bullish, that we'll be able to ride the macro-driven waves that inevitably will be in front of us at some point in time. The other aspect of your question was what, Jason?","Jason Gere","Yes, just in terms of the investments that you're making. Now and I understand obviously with all of the portfolio changes, it was just really more focused on the Commercial side, the exposure there. But we've just seen I think the backdrop both on Consumer and Commercial it's been a little bit softer. And just kind of wanted to get your view, versus maybe where it was three, six months ago?","Michael Polk","Yes, it's -- look, I think consumer confidence, certainly sort of less positive. But again that's a measure of attitudes, and not necessarily behavior. So, I don't over react to that. I think a lot of that has to do with the negativity and headlines related to the election in the U.S.","So, hopefully, that's get -- well, we know it will get behind us by 8th of November, thank goodness. But -- so hopefully, consumer confidence whatever impact that's had on confidence certainly lessens, but we don't see it in the market data.","Like what I look to is whether we're seeing foot traffic down in key retailers, or whether you're seeing consumption patterns change in your PoS data. And I don't see a material shift. Usually, a move in confidence as low as it's gone, does eventually correlate to behavioral shifts, but we're not seeing that right now.","So, we don't know how things will evolve obviously. As the Fed moves on interest rates, which they will inevitably do, that could create further confidence issues. You never know or not and we'll watch this very, very carefully.","What I've said historically though, is that ideas trump the macros that you can't really wait for the macros to help you. And if they're going to hurt you, you better figure out how you're going to compensate for that. And that would be -- that's the way we tend to look at things.","Jason Gere","And in fairness, and then, just you brought up one question, so I have a counter question. In terms of pricing for next year, so if you think about the pricing that's come through in 2016 and I think you mentioned with just some of the commodities, I think that was on Joe's question, maybe there will be some pricing there too. Can you just talk about the magnitude of maybe pricing coming through next year, versus what you're seeing this year?","Ralph Nicoletti","Yes, Jason with the slight increase we probably see resins, coupled with what we talked about in FX, I would expect to see more pricing in next year, than what we have this year. We haven't articulated a specific number on that, but you'd expect to see more pricing coming into play next year than we had this year.","Jason Gere","Is that going to be related to -- is that going to be taken with new innovation, or is that going to be price increases on the existing SKUs?","Ralph Nicoletti","Well, I think it's on existing and with innovation you price to value, so we'll price right with our new innovation, which we think is -- modeled into what the expected -- the size of those businesses could be. So, it should be -- you'd see it more on the base business, for the reasons we said on cost change. And on innovation, we'll always look to price-to-value.","Jason Gere","Okay. Thanks.","Michael Polk","Jason, the pricing will be focused -- we have to recover transaction ForEx, so we have to price to recover. And I think, over time, we're going to figure out how to price more strategically to, as we get the reset done, as we get better information, visibility, we'll be able to really get into more explicit conversations, with the business units around strategic pricing.","And we need more price in the business, I'd like to see more pricing in our business. It's got to be a healthy part of any year's algorithm. Of course, we do the bare minimum which is to cover transaction and costs net of productivity benefit.","But there's a strategic lever available to us to pull, that I think -- Ralph and I spent a lot of time together at Kraft, and they did a good job through the 1990s. And we need to think about how to reapply some of those approaches and techniques to this business.","Jason Gere","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffrey.","Michael Polk","Hi Steph.","Stephanie Wissink","Hi good morning. Just a couple quick ones for us as well. Mike, I'm wondering if you can just size up the e-commerce business today and give us some sense of a rate of growth, versus what you've seen in bricks-and-mortar. And then maybe a little bit more context on the scope of that investment around that key initiative?","And then, I have a derivative question just related to that commitment to e-commerce. Is there a derivative benefit beyond commercialization, really around analytics and measurement, specifically as you think about simplifying your SKU assortments, really bringing to market what you think are going to be your strongest and best SKUs? Thank you.","Michael Polk","Yes, excellent question. So, about 11%, 12% of our revenue is e-com based, whether it's direct-to-consumer, whether that is bricksandmortar.com or pureplay.com. So, you can back into what roughly what that will be, post disposals and come up with a revenue base that this growth is off of.","We can't measure e-com growth everywhere in the world, but where we have transaction data and PoS data, we actually break down all of our retailer trends, brick-and-mortar and dot-com. So we look at every product family in the U.S., for example, by retailer, in bricks-and-mortar and then dot-com, so we're looking at trends separately, since we can get access to their data in that way.","Our -- just for reference, our U.S. businesses are growing double-digit, have nice double-digit growth and I won't quote a specific number in the channel. And this is after two or three years of that type of momentum. And so we continue to grow really, really nicely here with particularly big platforms existing in camping, and in baby gear, a rapidly growing writing instrument business.","And we expect to be able to build some big platforms around Yankee, beyond their direct-to-consumer work that they do themselves. So, we got a lot of interesting things happening here and obviously this is a global opportunity to the organization that we're building -- we'll have a -- we'll be a global organization, like all of our operating divisions.","I won't quote, Steph, an exact investment amount, but it's sizeable. The savings that we generate on the other work we're doing will fund the investment necessary to populate that organization.","The analytics question is actually an excellent question. And it's really, really important to both us and the retailers that we're doing business within the space, because nobody has quite figured out, whether it's the Pure Play players or the bricksandmortar.com players, or in my experience the suppliers, folks like us.","Nobody has quite figured out how to create moments that matter online that are linked to the underlying consumer moments that matter. So, food storage around holidays, food storage around any time that there's left overs, writing instruments at back-to-school.","Interestingly enough, the online channel loses to bricks-and-mortar at back-to-school in writing, ironically, and because the online players haven't figured -- in both brick-and-mortar and in dot-com and pureplay.com haven't yet -- and the manufacturers haven't figured out how to get their fair share of the channel in that moment that matters.","And so, analytics will be really, really critical to us, sharpening the way we activate our marketing programs in these channels. And there's a lot to be learned here. So, this is a big part of that organization.","If you look at that team, when we expose that team to you -- I'm sure we will at some point, you'll see a much high percentage of the overhead structured in this area. And there's some very specific skills and techniques that they are applying to glean the insights necessary to make sure we're getting a return on the investment. So, there's a lot to do here. I don't think anybody has got it right and both on the retailer side and on the supplier side","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks, guys. Best of luck.","Michael Polk","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser with B. Riley.","Michael Polk","Hi Linda.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Hi. Can you just briefly give some color on whether it received any -- whether Jostens received any consideration for divestiture and why that would be -- why that's logical to keep in the portfolio? Thanks.","Michael Polk","Nope, we actually really like our Jostens business. We like the Jostens -- the potential for Jostens to continue to develop. It's a very, very profitable business; spins off a lot of cash. Grown nicely year-to-date close to 3%. It's not in our core numbers at this point. We've got a whole bunch of innovation that kicks in towards the end of the fourth quarter.","No, we're really happy with the Jostens business. We don't envision taking Jostens around the world and that's why we think of it as an entrepreneurial-led business. But we think we can do a number of things to strengthen the value creation that's occurring there, by leveraging the scale of the company. But we've got a really focused team that loves what they do and we believe they do it well.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Polk","Hey Joe.","Joe Lachky","Hi. I feel like it's 10 o'clock at night, instead of 10 in the morning.","Michael Polk","Imagine how we feel.","Joe Lachky","Anyway, just real quick, on the cost synergies, I think you gave a total amount for 2017. Can you break that down maybe between the Project Renewal savings and then the synergies for Jarden?","And then also, along those lines the tax synergies, it sounds like some of those are starting to kick in. And is that now -- our tax synergies now included in the $500 million or have those gone up?","Ralph Nicoletti","We're still targeting $500 million overall. Tax synergies are included in that number. And we did -- as you point out, we did begin to get some of the benefits of that -- actually in the third quarter, and close to the balance of the year and into next year.","As far as overall synergies go, in Mike's remarks he had said just over $300 million is what we're -- reflected and assuming in next year's guidance. And roughly about two-thirds of that is synergies and one-third from renewal.","We're going to -- kind of moving forward, talk about this in a more combined way. Obviously, we're tracking it internally a little bit more discretely. But I think more as a combined way -- and just will facilitate overall communications. So think of it as -- we're right on track in both programs. In aggregate $300 million, a little over that is assumed in the guidance.","Joe Lachky","Okay.","Michael Polk","And remember, just to remember, when renewal ends, the costs associated with Project Renewal really winds down in 2017. But the benefits roll over into 2018. So, 2017 saw another big year, good year, a third of the $300 million and a little less than that maybe, and a similar amount in 2018. But no costs associated with that, because you're just getting the rollover benefit. And then we'll be talking about synergies only from that point forward.","Joe Lachky","Great. And then last one on the dilution from the divestitures, so any effort to really offset that? I think you mentioned some savings offset and I'm curious what that includes outside of interest expense. But any potential here to address the stranded overhead, especially on the tools business?","Ralph Nicoletti","Well, clearly, that's the challenge here. These businesses are run with shared services, and as we own them, they covered some of that overhead. That's all reflected in the value that we received for the business.","So, there are stranded overheads. We are working towards minimizing those. But clearly out of the gate, we have those overheads with us. That's part of why Mike had said that in the first quarter, we're looking at some of that dilution to be more in the 6% to 7% range, and we'll abate it over time, as we work against some of the savings that we could do to mitigate it.","And then as you pointed out we have the -- and once we have the proceeds in hand from the divestiture, then we could proceed to do some of the deleveraging as well.","Michael Polk","Yes, and just to be clear, within the -- we said over $300 million in gross synergies. That covers just some small things on routine costs we will do, but it does not include anything more material.","And you should feel comfortable that obviously, Ralph and I are very accepting of that. But that is what it is, and we think it's the prudent thing to do from a planning perspective. If we were to deliver less dilution, it would require us to deliver more gross synergies or savings from renewal.","And so if you were talking to Russ Torres, the Head of the Synergies Task team that's in the Transformation office, he would tell you, that we're all over him like a wet rag, to get more than $300 million, because we obviously don't want that dilution. But it's not prudent at this point to call it, and because of the scope of what we're driving already.","And but he's -- you can be confident that he's thinking about it, he's looking at whether there are other paths that we can mine. And we have some very specific ideas that we could go execute that eventually we will go execute.","It's just a question of the capacity of the organization to do more in 2017 than it already is. But we know how we will cover this over time. The question is just about sequencing in the context of everything else.","Joe Lachky","All right. That makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","Your final question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Michael Polk","Hey Rupesh.","Rupesh Parikh","Hi, Mike, how is it going? Thanks for fitting me in. I'm going to be really quick, since most of my questions have been answered. Just on the Stanley transaction, is there any initial thoughts in terms of the after-tax proceeds associated with that transaction?","Ralph Nicoletti","The after-tax proceeds will primarily be used for debt reduction. Principally, the proceeds that will fall in the U.S. especially, we'll act on that. We'll be a little bit more cautious on timing and how we think about the proceeds that will remain outside the U.S., because frankly, there we might have the ability to deploy some of that cash towards M&A outside the U.S., which is highly efficient to do that because then the monies get permanently reinvested.","So, priority one is to deleverage and using the proceeds. The majority of the money is -- will be in the U.S., so we'll have that opportunity. But it is something that obviously, we're trying to balance and optimize across the strategic agenda as well and hit the leverage goals.","Rupesh Parikh","And Ralph, I was hoping more maybe just to get the tax impact on the transaction? Just try to get a sense for the after-tax proceeds?","Ralph Nicoletti","The net which we've disclosed already is about after-tax is proceeds is about $1.5 billion. Just a little over $1.5 billion.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. Thank you.","Ralph Nicoletti","Okay.","Michael Polk","Well, thank you very much, Hannah for orchestrating that comprehensive call and set of questions. I'd love to leave with just a message to my team which is, I couldn't be prouder of my team's unwavering commitment to deliver through change.","This is a really important aspect of what we do. It's the thing that gives us permission to take on risk, is to consistently do what we say we're going to do. I feel like the third quarter was a second pearl on the chain, in the combination of Newell Brands.","And I'm confident based on the drive, determination, and intensity of focus that we're going to weave together a really exciting story over the next couple of years.","Thanks again for all of your support. To anybody that's still on the phone, thanks for all of the questions. Look forward to connecting to you at our next opportunity.","Operator","A replay of today's call will be available later today on our website, newellbrands.com. This concludes our conference.

Good morning. And welcome to Newell Rubbermaid\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After a brief discussion by management, we will open up the call for questions. As a reminder today\u2019s conference is being recorded. A live webcast of the call is available at newellrubbermaid.com on the Investor Relations homepage under Events and Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download. ","I will now turn the call over to Nancy O\u2019Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O\u2019Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I want to welcome you to Newell Rubbermaid\u2019s first quarter earnings call. With me here in Atlanta are Mike Polk, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stipancich, our Chief Financial Officer.","I\u2019ll remind you that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk.","Actual results may differ materially. Newell encourages you to review the explanation of the latest risks and uncertainties provided in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-K filing.","In addition, certain information presented and discussed today constitutes non-GAAP financial measures, we have provided in our press release and 8-K filing reconciliations on a GAAP basis for these measures.","With that, I will turn it over to Mike.","Mike Polk","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Before we discuss our Q1 results, I'd like to briefly address two new strategic initiatives approved by the Newell Rubbermaid Board of Directors.","First, this morning, we announced our decision to expand the third phase of Project Renewal beyond our current supply chain focused initiatives to include the next level of cost out work in our corporate overhead and business partnering functions.","This new authorization would utilize $150 million in incremental restructuring and project-related costs to generate $150 million an incremental annualized savings by the end 2017.","We\u2019ve made good progress increasing our brand spending through 2014 and we will continue to increase investment this year and beyond. In this context, a significant amount of incremental savings generated from the expansion of Project Renewal will be reinvested in new capabilities and brand support, but with an increasingly higher proportionate of the incremental savings flow to margin and earnings than in the earlier phases of Project Renewal.","Secondly, this morning we announced our intention to sell our Rubbermaid medical cart business. This business is not core for Newell. The medical carts business had net sales of roughly $65 million in 2014. In 2015, the Rubbermaid medical cart business will be treated as planned divestiture and therefore excluded from core sales.","So with this preambles done, let's get into our results. We have had a very good start to the year. Core sales grew 4.7%, net sales grew 4.1%, with 550 basis point negative impact from foreign currency, largely offset by a net contribution of 490 basis points from acquisitions and planned divestitures.","Normalized gross margin increased 50 basis points, driven by input cost deflation, productivity and pricing, partially offset by negative foreign exchange and the mix effect from acquisitions. This improvement funded a 50 basis point increase in advertising and promotion as a percentage of sales, with advertising up nearly 40% versus prior year.","Despite the significant increase in brand support, normalized operating income margin improved 90 basis points as a result of our progress on overheads. Normalized EPS was $0.36, $0.02 ahead of consensus and 5.9% ahead to prior year.","We achieved this normalized EPS growth, despite having to overcome the negative impacts of about $0.08 due to foreign currency and $0.04 due to the absence of prior year discrete benefits in our tax rate.","Our first quarter growth was broad based with core sales growth in all five segments. We delivered $0.05 core sales growth in North America and over 25% core growth in Latin America, which more than offset weakness in Europe and currency-related challenges in Russia.","We continued to deliver very strong growth on our Win Bigger businesses. Combined our three Win Bigger businesses grew core sales 7.4%. Writing grew core sales 9% driven by increased market share in those geographies as a result of strong innovation and increased marketing investment and pricing.","Commercial Products also grew core sales 9%, as a result of new innovation and strong sales execution in the U.S. and China. Tools grew core sales over 3%, driven by solid mid single-digit growth in North America and Latin America.","Positive momentum in Writing, Commercial Products and Tools has helped us absorb the continued impact of our strategic choice to reposition the Rubbermaid Consumer business for profitable growth.","In Q1, Home Solutions core sales grew 0.9%, with double-digit Rubbermaid Food Storage growth, offsetting plan to declines on the low margin Rubbermaid Consumer Storage business.","Our newly acquired Contigo and bubba brands delivered outstanding results and enabled Home Solutions net sales growth of 15.2%. Our Baby business grew core sales 0.8%, with strong growth in North America of nearly 80% and stabilization of the business in Asia offsetting weakness in Europe. Our newly acquired Baby Jogger business delivered strong results and enabled Baby net sales growth of 7.1%.","We are pleased with our start to the year. We have had a strong start to global core sales. We have sustained excellent growth in our Win Bigger businesses. We've got Baby momentum building in key markets outside of Europe. We have had a strong contribution from acquisitions offsetting the net impact of currency to yield over 4% net sales growth. We have got expanding gross margins, despite unprecedented currency pressure. We've got increased normalized operating income margin, despite another large step up in brand investment.","All yielding nearly 6% normalized EPS growth and strong double-digit EPS growth in a currency neutral basis. We have building momentum in our business and our strong start to the year is evidence of the progress we are making.","Let me hand the call over to John to go through our results in a little bit more detail then I\u2019ll return to provide perspective on the balance of 2015.","John Stipancich","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. First quarter reported net sales were $1.26 billion, a 4.1% increase versus last year. Core sales, which exclude acquisitions, foreign currency and the planned disposal of our Rubbermaid medical cart business increased 4.7%. The net impact of acquisitions and planned divestitures contributed 490 basis points to reported net sales.","Foreign currency had a negative impact of 550 basis points. The strong core sales performance was led by Writing, Commercial Products and Tools, our Win Bigger businesses aided by improvements in Baby and Home Solutions.","Reported gross margin was 38.6%, with normalized gross margin at 38.8%, up 50 basis points over last year. This improvement was driven by productivity, lower input costs, pricing and favorable business mix, which more than offset unfavorable currency and the negative mix impact from the gross margin structure of our recent acquisitions.","Normalized SG&A expense was $337.9 million or 26.7% of sales, down 50 basis points versus prior year. Our 110 basis point reduction of overheads fueled a 50 basis point increase in advertising and promotion with the balance of the overhead savings flowing the offset FX headwinds.","We invested incremental A&P across all five segments with the largest year-over-year increases in Baby, Writing and Commercial Products. In Baby, we supported advertising campaign for our Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat.","Our Writing segment benefited from advertising for Sharpie Clearview Highlighters and investments in e-commerce and incremental in-store merchandising activity. In the Rubbermaid Commercial, we ran numerous concurrent campaigns in North America, China and Brazil, to support BRUTE Containers, HYGEN Microfiber Cleaning, WaveBreak Mop Buckets and our new Maximizer Mops.","Normalized operating margin was 12.1%, up 90 basis points, reflecting the benefit of project renewal and other cost-savings initiatives, partially offset by an increase in strategic investment and significant FX headwinds. Reported operating margin was 7.8% compared with 8.6% in the prior year.","Interest expense of $19.2 million increased $4.8 million year-over-year reflecting the impact of our late 2014 debt refinancing and higher overall borrowings related to our acquisitions in the back half of last year. Our normalized tax rate was 27.2% compared with 18.3% a year ago due to the absence of prior year discrete benefits.","We still expect our full year normalized 2015 tax rate to be around 24%. Normalized EPS which excludes restructuring and other project costs was $0.36, a 5.9% increase to last year despite about $0.08 of FX headwinds. And on a reported basis, first quarter EPS was $0.20 compared with $0.19 last year.","I\u2019ll now move on to our segment results, starting with Writing. Reported first quarter net sales declined 1.8% to $341.8 million. Core sales increased 9% with continued high single-digit growth in North America.","We\u2019re driving strong POS in the U.S. thanks to the combined impact of increased A&P and more robust merchandising efforts. And our Writing businesses in emerging markets are performing well with pricing and strong sellout, fueling good Latin America results and a healthy start to the year for fine writing in Asia.","Q1 normalized operating margin in the Writing segment was 24.3%, a 240 basis point increase over the prior year due to strong productivity, pricing, favorable mix and cost management which more than offset foreign currency impacts and increased advertising and promotion spend.","Net sales in our Home Solutions segment grew 15.2% to $364.5 million with acquisitions contributing $48.4 million. Core sales increased 90 basis points due to solid result at our Decor business and growth in Rubbermaid Food Storage, which more than offset our continued exit of portions of the low-margin Consumer Storage business and a comparison against last year's Calphalon pipeline fill at a major new customer.","We continue to see strong growth in Rubbermaid Food Storage fueled by increased advertising and promotion. Home Solutions normalized operating margin was 10.6%, up 210 basis points, reflecting the accretive impacts of acquisitions and lower input costs.","Our Tools segment delivered net sales of $180.4 million, a 3.9% decrease, all of which and then some was driven by FX. Core sales grew 3.2%. Tools delivered another good quarter in Latin America, reflecting the continuing success of our Irwin offerings in Brazil.","Our Lenox Industrial Tools business also grew nicely in North America and in EMEA thanks to distribution gains and pricing offsetting softening in the market in APAC. Normalized operating margin in the Tools segment was 12.3%, a 90 basis point improvement versus last year. This increase was driven by disciplined overhead cost management, partially offset by increased advertising and promotion and negative FX.","Reported net sales in our Commercial Products segment increased 1.4% to $185.2 million. Core sales increased 9% driven by pricing and strong volume growth in North America due to increased marketing support as well as strategic investments and expanded distribution in Asia Pacific.","Commercial Products normalized operating margin was 9.5%, 190 basis point increase to last year due to pricing, productivity and input cost benefits, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion spend and negative FX.","Our baby segment reported $192.1 million in net sales, a 7.1% increase compared to last year. The Baby Jogger acquisition contributed $18.2 million in net sales during the quarter.","Core sales grew 80 basis points though Graco North America grew high single digits as we saw very good POS growth, fueled by new innovative products and increased advertising and promotion. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in EMEA, driven largely by macro related challenges in Russia and continued softness in the balance of Europe and exits.","Our baby business in Asia Pacific was essentially flat, which is a great step forward compared to last year. Baby\u2019s normalized operating margin was 6.4%, down 270 basis points from last year, largely due to increased advertising and promotion spend to reignite growth, pricing actions on the value end of our product line and key retailers to defend our core and negative FX.","Looking at Q1 core sales by geography, North America core sales grew 5% with strong results from Writing, baby and Commercial Products, with all five segments contributing to growth. In EMEA, core sales declined 5.2%, due largely to weakness in Russian baby. However, our normalized operating margin in EMEA continues to significantly improve exceeding last quarter's all-time high, as a result of our extensive transformation initiatives in the region.","In Latin America, core sales grew 25.5%, reflecting pricing in the region and volume gains in Writing and Tools. And finally, Asia Pacific core sales declined 40 basis points as growth in our Writing and Commercial Products businesses was offset by softness in industrial bandsaw sales.","Moving on to cash in our balance sheet. In Q1, we used $154.3 million in operating cash compared with the use of $92.1 million in the prior year. This increase in use reflects our $70 million voluntary U.S. pension contribution we made in the first quarter of 2015. We returned $126.8 million to shareholders in Q1, including $53.2 million in dividends and $73.6 million to repurchase 1.9 million of our shares.","As of the end of Q1, we have $363 million available under our authorized open-market repurchase plan. And finally our balance sheet remains healthy with significant cash on hand and about $423 million in liquidity. Our balance sheet metrics continued to be strong giving us continued financial flexibility to support our expansion of project renewal and for further acquisitions, should we choose to pursue them.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Polk","Thanks John. Let\u2019s now turn to the balance of 2015. This morning, we reaffirmed our 2015 full year guidance of 3.5% to 4.5% core sales growth and normalized EPS of $2.10 to $2.18. We\u2019ve had a strong start to the year and I believe we are continuing to track towards the midpoint of both full year guidance ranges.","Our latest view of the full year negative foreign currency impact to operating income is $0.35 to $0.37, about $0.04 worse than the impact previously communicated in the full year guidance. We've taken action to cover as much of the new currency impact as possible, with line of sight today to at least half of the incremental currency exposure.","We expect to close the balance of the gap over the next few quarters. The expansion of project renewal should help. Our conviction to steadily increase brand support remains strong, given the core growth acceleration we are experiencing. Our plans to increase brand investment remains unchanged despite the incremental currency pressure. We expect to increased A&P investment in 2015 by about 20%.","Our 2015 full year guidance assumes we sustain mid single-digit core growth in our Win Bigger businesses of Writing, Tools and Commercial Products, that we recover growth momentum on our baby business with acceleration from Q2 through the balance of the year, that we deliver strong growth on Rubbermaid food storage, offsetting planned declines on the low margin Rubbermaid Consumer Storage business, that we deliver strong year-over-year growth on our newly acquired brands of Contigo, Bubba and Baby Jogger.","And that we offset the negative impact of transaction Forex with positive pricing, productivity and input cost deflation. And we continue to reduced overheads, which when is coupled with growth enables us to increase brand support. There are two factors that can influence where we fall in our 2015 full year guidance ranges.","The first factor is the planned acceleration of growth in our baby business. We expect baby core growth to accelerate through the balance of 2015 and deliver solid single-digit core growth for the full year. We are well staged to deliver very good growth in North America and Japan behind strong innovation, great customer partnering, and increased marketing support.","We expect strength in North America and Japan to more than cover continued pressure in Europe. We are investing significant marketing support behind baby innovation in 2015 in order to reignite growth while accepting the related operating income margin compression.","The second factor that could influence where we land in the full year is foreign exchange. In 2014, our team did an excellent job overcoming $0.17 per share of negative currency impact to deliver underlying core sales growth acceleration and an all-time record normalized EPS results.","Our guidance assumes we do the same in 2015 overcoming an incremental negative $0.35 to $0.37 foreign currency impact while accelerating growth and delivering a third consecutive all-time high normalized EPS outcome for new Rubbermaid. We are on track to achieve this outcome.","Our guidance assumes the major currencies are at current market rates and we continue to transact and translate at the SICAD rate in Venezuela. While the valuation of Venezuelan bolivar seems likely at some point in the future, we had access to the SICAD-I rate through options in the fourth quarter of 2014 and have raw material and inventory on hand to support the business well into the second half of 2015 without having to access anther option.","The company remeasures its financial statements in Venezuela at the end of each month at the exchange rate at which it expects to remit future dividends, which for us is the SICAD rate. In this context, we will hold our current position on currency in Venezuela and to market conditions, the currency framework over the laws change. Obviously the environment remains dynamic and we will continue to adapt our plans and outlook to changing conditions.","While we do not provide quarterly guidance, let me make a few comments regarding the phasing of this year\u2019s sales and earnings. While we had a terrific momentum on our Writing business having delivered core sales growth of 9% in Q1 2015, on top of year ago Q1 core sales growth of 7.9. As we previously communicated, our Q2 core growth rate should step back from these levels related to the shift of some back to school shipments on Writing from Q2 to Q3.","As a consequence and as previously shared, we expect our Q2 total company core growth rate to be towards the bottom of our full year guidance range in Q2 and our Q3 core growth rate to be at or slightly above the higher end of our full year growth guidance range.","That said, as a result of the building momentum in the business and the strong start to the year, we now expect first half core sales growth to be at or near the middle of the full year guidance range of 4%, above our prior expectations. Normalized EPS growth will likely skewed towards the back half of the year driven by two factors. First, the Q2 negative foreign currency impact is now expected to increase to $0.11 to $0.12 per share versus the $0.08 impact experienced in Q1. Q3 should experience the similar headwinds to Q2 with the negative impact begin to temper in Q4 assuming current market rates.","Second, the majority of the incremental advertising and promotion investment planned for the balance of the year is tied to innovation launch and merchandising windows, which are set to occur in May, June, July, and August. In this context, we expect the first half normalized EPS growth rate to be just below the bottom of our full year growth guidance range of 5% and the second half normalized EPS growth rate to be just above the top of our full year growth guidance range of 9%.","So let me close by saying it had a very good start to the year delivering strong competitive results. The growth game plan is accelerating. We are investing to create advantage brand development and innovation capabilities and are backing them up with category leading marketing investment.","These investments have been enabled by our determination to make Newell leaner and more efficient and when coupled with actions to strengthen our portfolio are yielding both growth acceleration and margin expansion. There is more opportunity ahead of us than behind. And today, we announced a new commitment to deliver incremental annualized overhead savings of $150 million by the end of 2017.","A significant amount of these new savings will be invested back into the business for further growth acceleration. But as we scale our brand investment levels, an increasingly higher proportion of the savings will flow through to margin in earnings. About half of the project renewal Phase 3 annualized savings of $350 million will flow through to brand investment and half to the P&L in earnings.","We\u2019re well in our way to transforming Newell Rubbermaid into a growth leader in our industry. With the kind of growth acceleration we experienced in Q1 and a continued aggressive posture on cost, we will simultaneously transform the margin structure of the company, delivering what I think can be a competitively differentiated story of both category leading growth acceleration and margin development. That is the growth game plan into action. That is the new Newell Rubbermaid. Let me now pass a line to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Mike Polk","Hi, Dara.","Operator","And Dara, your line is open.","Dara Mohsenian","Sorry about that, I was on mute. So your guidance this year implies mid-20%s FX neutral EPS growth. Obviously, you\u2019ve got a commodity benefit and you\u2019re pushing hard to offset FX, but that level would still be much higher than your peers and your long-term guidance despite ad spend being up. And you\u2019ve now announced incremental cost savings that will help drive 2016 with half of the Phase 3 savings dropping to the bottom line.","So I guess the question is, can you give us some insight on if the strong underlying EPS growth in 2015 is giving you more confidence for 2016 and 2017? Or why we shouldn\u2019t believe that some of the strength from this year is sustainable as you look out longer term and could allow you to beat the previously outlined EPS goals?","Mike Polk","Thanks, Dara. Good question. Obviously, we\u2019re pleased with the start to the year. It strengthens our conviction on multiple dimensions. It\u2019s good evidence that the framework that we laid out in the growth game plan is really beginning to work. We certainly will through the new tranche of savings captured in this mornings announcement have more flexibility than we did when we guided the acceleration phase of the growth game plan to greater than 4% core and greater than 10% EPS growth.","So I think your challenge on the future upside potential is real. The thing that I would say is that the proof of the puddings in the eating, so we\u2019re one quarter into '15. And we want to make sure we demonstrate consistency in the -- through the acceleration phase before we articulate a different point of view forward.","Of course, we will always have the option to think about a more aggressive deployment of our selective portions of our portfolio into, what I would describe is white space markets. We\u2019ve talked about China on Writing for '16, but there's plenty of other white space out there. And any decision to let the savings flow to greater than 10%, EPS delivery would have to be measured against the opportunity to set up a different future by a more aggressive deployment of the portfolio, particularly Writing than what we committed to do at this point.","Part of that will be governed by our organizational capacity to be able to handle that. But that will be sort of the -- that will be the opportunity cost of letting it flow to EPS. But we will face -- come to that fork in the road probably sometime in \u201816 second half or \u201917.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay. And then on the Writing instruments front, obviously, you continue to post exceptional results there. How sustainable is the market share gains behind that business in your mind, as you look out over the next couple of years? What's the competitive response you're seeing and are there learnings from the success in that business you can apply to other businesses?","Mike Polk","Well, we are -- the reason Writing is performing so well is because of these capabilities that we\u2019ve built, both on the development side of our agenda the brand development side of our agenda, with a strengthened pipeline of innovation, strengthened advertising, sharpened packaging, really some creative marketing programs, coupled with real focus on getting the right assortment to retail to get the right merchandising frequency at retails.","So it\u2019s a combination of the first two pillars of the growth game plan, that its focus on making our brands really matter and that its focused on creating commercial value from the ideas we are driving throughout our selling and our delivery organization more broadly.","And so that's working -- beginning to work really well, I\u2019d characterize. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s perfect. I\u2019d say there\u2019s more opportunity to strengthen the algorithm there and we have a stronger pipeline of ideas coming in 2016 than we even have in 15. So I am encouraged.","I don\u2019t think we've seen the four competitive response yet, Dara, and we\u2019ll see that in Q3 when we come to that critical merchandising window. We are very, very well staged for that moment in time. But I think we will start to see more competitiveness from the folks we are up against.","The thing that they will have a hard time competing against is the capability investments we\u2019ve made. So we\u2019ve gone from a holding company to an operating company, released all these costs that built us at a capabilities to crossover the top of these five segments. That puts us in a position it is competitively advantaged capabilities relative to the folks we are up against. I think that puts us in a sustained advantaged position versus the others.","That coupled with the cost out that's enabling us to put money behind the brands sets up a pretty good algorithm that should enable sustained share growth in our home markets and then the more, perhaps, more importantly long-term the deployment of our portfolio around the world.","That algorithm, that model is as relevant to Writing as it is to Tools as it is to the core of our Commercial Products portfolio and increasingly to elements within Home Solutions and geographies within Baby.","And so when we think about the portion of our Home Solutions portfolio that could benefit from the same principles and same approach Food Storage, our recently acquired Beverages businesses, these offer similar types of opportunities long-term. The challenge to us is to create the P&L capacity to be able to play for all those opportunities.","So I think the capabilities are transferable, even though the categories are quite different, that's the model we are building. I think the evidence is building that in fact the theory beyond the model can work and the time will tell how effective we are at driving towards the upside","Dara Mohsenian","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Polk","Hey, Bill.","Bill Schmitz","Hi, Mike. Good morning. Hey. Can you just breakdown the contribution of sales volume versus price and then kind of how you think about that going forward, because it looks like, I know you're much less resin exposed than you used to be, but resin's clearly fallen off a cliff? So maybe the puts and takes on the resin deflation versus some of the trucking inflation, and probably, some SG&A inflation as well? Then I have a follow-up if you don't mind?","Mike Polk","Yeah. Sure. Bill, unlike other business, I\u2019ve worked in and other people you cover. The ability to tease apart volume from pricing is a little bit modeled here given our systems and the algorithms we\u2019ve got behind those systems. So I\u2019ll give you directional answers, but not as pr\u00e9cising answers perhaps one of my peers could provide.","Further we have a lot of pricing in the algorithm this year as a result of our need to cover the transaction Forex issues around the world. That's true in Europe. That's true in Latin America. We've even taken pricing on Writing in North America. It\u2019s true in Canada where we\u2019ve got Canadian dollar, U.S. dollar issues, and across parts of Asia Pacific. So","we are taking, we are doing the tough slog of pricing to cover transaction for Forex. And that comes with some risk, some volume, although quite frankly, we haven\u2019t see the volume risks materialize at the rate some folks might have expect them too.","But I\u2019d say more than 50% of our growth this year is going to be the pricing related. That\u2019s not too dissimilar to where we\u2019ve been in the prior year. So it may skew a little bit further in that direction and we\u2019ll have to watch the volumes, particularly as resin and other input cost fall, our ability to hold the pricing we\u2019ve taken in response to the transaction Forex impacts we\u2019ve had maybe challenged.","And that\u2019s one of those things we\u2019ve to watch and we were very vigilant on because we\u2019re in the business of selling more stuff to consumers, not just at a higher price. But we\u2019ve got a rise on that one and I think we\u2019ve got the right balance on what we\u2019ve done to date but we watch it very closely.","Bill Schmitz","And out of the sort of mesh with the massive resin deflation we've seen. I know it's an international situation on the transaction offset, but do you think you can hold pricing in the U.S., given how dramatically resin's declined recently?","Mike Polk","Well, the part of our portfolio where that would be the biggest issue is the part of the portfolio we are pulling back from. So while we don\u2019t have to differentiate the propositions, it\u2019s very difficult to hold price, when resin -- when your input costs are falling. And so the Consumer Storage business that we are really pulling back hard on the throttle on is the place where we\u2019re most vulnerable. And in part that's why we\u2019re moving away from that portion of our business. And searching into the place, we can create a point of difference which is food storage. ","We've said that there are three food storage platforms that we want to develop over time. One is food on the go. One is -- and portion control. One is a better approach to storage in-home and in-fridge and in-pantry and the third is food preservation. All under this umbrella we called food storage. The work we\u2019re doing to build our propositions in our products in this area will allow us to command the premium price, because they will have a product based point of difference and the brand promise will provide the kind of -- the right emotional connection to consumers.","That mix of activities is what allows you to hold price. And retailers want us to bring that kind of value proposition to their shelves so they can hold price. It\u2019s in the areas where you can create those points of difference where we will have to be very careful and watch the volume. And we may not be able to hold price in every area where we don't have a differentiated set of propositions. But that\u2019s in fact is why we\u2019re contracting that portion of our portfolio and taking the same manufacturing capacity that supports that business and transferring it to support the differentiated platform and storage that we -- and beverages that we believe it.","Bill Schmitz","Got you. Great. And then just a follow-up is, is there any disconnect between sell-in and sell-through in some of these international markets, because obviously distributors in a lot of other categories have been destocking as they adjust to kind of the macro environment and the currency moves. And then, what would the impact be if you guys had to go to the SIMADI rate in terms of EPS? I'm sure it's in the 10-Q. I just haven't had a chance to read it yet.","Mike Polk","Yeah. Those are different questions, Bill. So let me handle the sell-in and sell-out question then I will pass to John on Venezuela. But there is always balancing issues that are going on, either in your developed world of retail partners and in the distributive trade. We had -- we\u2019ve experienced that. We don't intend to call it out because I think it is the normal course of doing business.","It's rebalancing that retailers are always doing and trying to drive inventories out, which does constrain your ability to drive sell-in. But that\u2019s for us to deal with. I must say, there is a huge event. I wouldn\u2019t call that out as the reason why we're dealing with revenue growth issues.","So, I don\u2019t see that as materially changed, even though there are lot of people focused on inventories right now. And I\u2019m pleased that our results in North America were strong as they were in the context of that.","In the distributed trade, this balance issue is a real topic that you have to stay on top of. As you know, we had our own issues in China on fine Writing probably two years ago. And we lived through that transition and rebalancing in that timeframe.","And they're always individual distributor issues that you have to wrestle with. We do not see a macro issue that cuts across geographies. There is always individual issues you have to be dealing with specific distributors.","We have had some challenges with our distributor base in Russia. Not related to inventory positions, but with related to their ability to accessing enough roubles to buy our dollar-denominated Baby gear. But again that's not inventor related that\u2019s currency related. So John on Simadi?","John Stipancich","So, Bill, if we look for example to Simadi. So if you assume we transact and translated Simadi, for example, on today made that switch that that cost to us on EPS basis, would probably be about $0.05 give or take.","The big question for us would be whether the government would even let us transact at Simadi, because obviously, the impact in the marketplace for schools supplies goes up dramatically in terms of the pricing. But right now with the partial year behind us is probably about $0.05.","Bill Schmitz","Great. Thank you, guys.","Mike Polk","Yeah.","Operator","And your next question will come from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher","Thank you. Good morning. Two questions here, first off, heading into this year it seemed as though there was some optimism on the consumer coming back and from what we've seen, it doesn't appear that that's happened. So organic core sales growth seems be a little bit better? Can you talk about how much you're seeing, maybe the underlying consumer come through versus where you feel like you're executing? How much of that improvement you're seeing is self-generated versus macro?","And then, if we look at the medical cart business, if we excluded in both -- if we included it in both periods, the core sales growth was a little bit lower, but there was a big year-over-year decline there on that medical cart business? Is that the type of decline you were expecting or should we see that moderate, if we try to map that out over the balance of the year? Thanks.","Mike Polk","Thanks, John. I would have expected to have seen more consumer momentum in the U.S. than we have to-date. I would have thought that the reduction in energy prices, reduction in gasoline prices would have driven change in trajectory purchasing behavior.","We obviously see positive trends in attitude through the consumer confidence data in the U.S. But has that translated to or converted to a difference in actual behavior. I don\u2019t see it yet.","So our -- but I am optimistic that overtime that should come into play. We have not assumed in our guidance a macro recovery in the U.S. beyond the conditions we are leaving with today. So if that would occur that would be a positive and we would have to think about the implications for our business and how we manage things.","What I have said from the time I have joined is that I think that the -- that ideas trump the macros, that we are in control of our own debt, whether it\u2019s a choice to deploy our portfolio into a new market or whether it\u2019s the opportunity connected to building our share position in these categories.","We also have though the obligation as the leaders in most of our categories, if not all, maybe one exception. We have the responsibility to actually lead category development, not just drive share shifting.","And so our ideas are designed to expand the size of the pie for us and for our retail partner. And I think we are increasingly doing that well and in some cases doing that better than others and in some cases better than I would have expected us to be able to do at this point in the transformation. So I am encouraged by what we are seeing. I would say, John, our balance is largely, our progress is largely driven by actions we are taking as apposed to some macro tailwinds.","So that\u2019s one part of the question. The other question was on the medical carts business. This business declined probably about -- just about 12% in 2014 and we saw further decline in the first quarter with more amplified. This is a spiky business. This isn\u2019t a business where you get continuous replenishment. And if you got an order that -- a new order that comes in and it, sort of a -- it's a lumpy profile for revenue flow.","And so we were up against the very strong quarter in the first quarter but then the trends in the business have been with us for a while. And I think, I guess, that\u2019s all I would say because we are in a midst of a sale process, John, at this point.","John Faucher","Okay. So but just to clarify it, it sounds like we should expect excluding that to benefit core sales over the balance of the year but probably not as much as we saw in the first quarter?","Mike Polk","Definitely not as much as the first quarter but you should expect that the core sales will be -- will benefit by a bit. It's not a big business. So it\u2019s not a big business. So it\u2019s not -- as I disclosed it was $65 million last year but we should see some benefit.","John Faucher","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next question from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Thanks. Good morning. Just digging into on the Baby side, I'm not sure I fully understood in the first quarter, I think you talked about North America being up high single digits. Is that including or excluding the recall from last year and I guess, it\u2019s including kind of -- can you maybe help us understand how it accelerates from here. I mean in terms of what do we see that really gets it off of where you won't have the benefit from recall for the next two, three quarters?","Mike Polk","Yeah. So let me take North America and then I\u2019ll pass to John to talk to you about what's going on in Russia, in Europe on the Baby business because that\u2019s sort of the down elevator we\u2019re facing into at the moment. But we're pleased with both the POS growth in North America and the net sales growth in North America on Baby. We expect that growth rate to accelerate through the balance of the year.","We\u2019ve got a stronger innovation platform and we have -- we obviously had pretty easy comps in Q1. We\u2019ll have easy comps at probably April, May as well because if you remember the recall timeframe, it was really for mid-March through mid-May that we were really on our heels.","And so we\u2019re going to have some pretty each comps in Baby for that period of time. And we see that -- you may not see that but we see that in our POS daily year-over-year, very strong, stronger than the growth rate that we communicated which is selling based. And so we think that things are setting up for a very good year in North America on Baby.","We\u2019re being quite aggressive to defend our flank on the low cost side of the portfolio, but we've got tremendous pipeline of innovation. And we are spending money on the brand through television advertising and we\u2019re getting great partnering with our key customers. So I'm quite optimistic about what Baby will be able to do in North America.","In Japan, we\u2019ve turned the corner and we have a good pipeline of innovation and we\u2019ve lapped the -- if you remember the consumption tax issue in Q1 of \u201814. We\u2019ve lapped that tax increase which created our official spike in the first quarter of \u201814 that we have now passed. And so we have again easier comps, but more importantly a stronger program in Japan for the balance of the year than we did last year at this time. We can we can see that all sort of unfolding. Europe is more challenging and let me just -- and there is two pieces to Europe. There is sort of the underlying issues in Western Europe but then there is some challenges in Russia. So John?","John Stipancich","So Bill, Russia, as Mike said really did with the decline of the Rouble and the challenges our distributors have in terms of paying us for our goods which are sold in dollars. It\u2019s been unfortunately a drag on the overall segment. So it shouldn\u2019t sour your interest on the overall recovery of the Baby business because as Mike said North America is doing extremely well.","The balance of Europe has been soft for us as well. We\u2019ve got a little bit -- we got the last piece of our exits that\u2019s flowing through as well in the quarter of our planned exits. And then some overall softness but we do have new products that should be hitting in Q2. That should give us hopefully a slight bounce back and then help mitigate the further challenges that we expect to see in Russia over the balance of the year.","Bill Chappell","Got it. And John, while I have you, just on the housekeeping, on the tax rate, as we look forward is there a catch-up in any specific quarter that gets you down to 24% or it should just be slightly below that level for the next three quarters?","John Stipancich","Yeah. Right now, I would assume it\u2019s just going to be relatively flat to get us back to 24. We still have bits and pieces that move in and out but nothing necessarily line of sight to overall.","Mike Polk","I'd also remind you on the net income mix by quarter, Q1 serves our smallest quarter in absolute terms. So you are getting a mix effect on tax rate that will happen as the topline and bottom line in absolute terms grows to 2Q, 3Q, 4.","Bill Chappell","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Mike Polk","Hey, Chris.","Chris Ferrara","Good morning. So, Mike, obviously you guys have increasing advertising pretty substantially. Sales are reacting in different places and I think you started to get into this at the last Analyst Day, but I was wondering if you can I guess kind of step back and explain what you're seeing on the sustainability of POS, following periods where you do advertising. In other words, how sticky is the business? Have you been able to raise the base of business with the advertising, which has been kind of episodic by business? So, is it another way of getting at the returns on that investment question but if you can explain some of that would be really helpful?","Mike Polk","This is the big question also, Chris. [Audio Gap] because and we are just beginning to be able to lapse periods where we spent real money. And encouragingly in Writing in particular, we're seeing year-on-year growth. I won't quote POS data but just look at the revenue data. So, 9% net sales growth or core sales growth in Q1 of \u201815, up against 7.9% core sales growth in Q1 of \u201914. So you are beginning to get growth on growth and we're seeing really strong POS growth in Writing in the U.S. and so that encourages us to continue to spend.","However, the one thing I would say is that Richard and his team, Richard, Martin and the team, Maria are looking at this really, really closely, because we have to decide how much money layer in there, and whether the next dollars spend is wise to be spend in our home markets or whether we ought to be using that money to support the point, the more aggressive deployment of our portfolio into wide space geographies.","And so this question is really quite pivotal and we are asking it across every one of our businesses. It\u2019s a little early for us to declare whether we got the balance right or not. Encouragingly, we have very, very strong POS in the business and we are spending in Q1 and we are spending significantly more in Q2 than we did in the year ago period and we'll start to get that REIT.","But it is one of the big questions we have to reconcile for ourselves, which is how do you balance where to deploy the money. And then we have questions that we are asking ourselves across categories. So, are we getting the same kind of growth yield for a dollar invested in commercial or dollar invested behind innovation and Tools or dollar invested in Internet advertising on goodie?","So the return on the growth yield, not the return. I don\u2019t want a confusion. We are not looking at the financial return. The growth yield for these dollars is something we are looking at very, very closely. The challenge we\u2019ve gotten in our business relative to others that I have worked in is we don\u2019t have as broad a set of syndicated data to be able to marry GRPs right-up to sell out data. But we are building some close proxies for that and we will learn more through the year.","Chris Ferrara","That\u2019s helpful. And I guess this is a follow-up. I mean, if you unpack where the growth is coming from because obviously those Win Bigger businesses are doing really well. If I told you a year and a half ago, you will be putting up these kinds of growth rates and growth on growth in Win Bigger, would you have thought that core would've been pacing even better than it is today? In other words, other than -- the other businesses maybe lagging little more than you thought and I guess if you could explore a little, it would be great?","Mike Polk","So what it supported us the ability to do is to pull back harder on the throttle on the portions of the portfolio, we are going to have to come to grips with some other way over time. So there's no way, I thought we would have been enable to pullback on Consumer Storage as aggressively as we did last year. And we've done it again this year as we pivot that injection molding capacity to food storage. It\u2019s the same injection molding process, just different molds.","So we are able to shift the capacity within our manufacturing network to the more value accretive portions of the portfolio where we can create differentiation. I know if I look back, I never would've thought we would have been able to pull back as hard as we have. I also wouldn\u2019t have thought that we would have been able to pull back as hard as we have on the less attractive portions of our European business.","And so there are two things that we\u2019ve done that have constrained core sales growth today I think are really important strategically for the future and set up perhaps the potential to grow even faster than we originally envisioned on a long-term basis that we have been able to do as a result of the Win Bigger businesses being more responsive to both the new capabilities that we\u2019ve deployed and the investments we put in the business.","Chris Ferrara","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Mike Polk","Hi, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks. Hi, good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about I guess two things. One was a follow-up on baby, I think there was a comment about adjusting some price points at the low end in the U.S. I was hoping you could just further follow up on that.","And then secondly was on the Tools business. Just curious your view on kind of market growth in the U.S. and where the soft spots were like was Asia -- was China significantly worse or kind of keeping pace with what we've seen and any kind of slowdown you've seen in Latin America there? Thanks.","John Stipancich","Hey, Lauren, it\u2019s John. So with respect to baby, as we talked about before, we see some competitive pressure with some of our guys vertically integrating within the space right now and that obviously put something constraints overall on our core. Thankfully with our brand, with a good supply partner we are able to defend that core. And as Mike mentioned before, we will fight to preserve that volume at some of our key retailers and that\u2019s our plan and that\u2019s in our long-term interest.","With respect to Tools, so right now our Tools business does seem to get a nice tie to industrial output certainly on the band saw business. So we are getting some benefit in North America right now, as industrial production seems to be still going fairly well, even though consumer confidence may not be up with respect to Asia. So we are definitely seeing a slowing in China and a little bit in Japan on our band saw business, which overall was a little bit of a drag on the Tools business.","And then we are still doing well in Latin America, but certainly starting to see signs of that slowing a little bit. But of course, we are expanding our offerings in Brazil. So we definitely have that benefit, but Latin America we are starting to see a little bit of the signs of weakness, but maybe not as much as some of our competitors there.","Lauren Lieberman","So do you think that for this year Tools ends up among the Win Bigger businesses being at the lower end of the growth rate range macro-related?","Mike Polk","Yes. No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s macro-related. I think we are lapping some initiatives from prior year in the first quarter of the launch of the Brazil restage of the business. You had all that pipeline that we had to lap. But second tranches of the Brazil new items, we lapped in the first quarter. But I think Tools is going to be a mid-single-digit type of grower this year, maybe a little stronger. We are taking the portfolio from Brazil and we are in the midst of deploying it into the Philippines.","There are other opportunities across Southeast Asia to do the same. So I am more optimistic on Tools to be honest with you. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s -- our issue is not macro-related. So I don\u2019t think. Our issue is really -- we are not macro-dependent right now. It\u2019s more with the exception of industrial product, as John said. This is more about what we are doing versus what we did year ago and the timing with which we are going to do things we got in the plan for '15, but I do think Tools is the mid-single digits grower for us.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. great. Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up, first on the Writing business. I think last year when you put up such strong organic growth in Writing, some of it came from distribution expansion. But I didn't hear you call that out today in terms of contributing to the 9% growth.","So do you feel like at least in North America kind of you're distributed where you need or are there still pockets of opportunity? And then second sort of as a follow-up, also on Writing. Can you tell us roughly how that's split between North America and Latin America, if you did, I apologize, I missed it?","Mike Polk","Yes. So let me -- I can have Nancy follow up with you on the split of the Writing growth rate.","Wendy Nicholson","Okay.","Mike Polk","But I don\u2019t have it at my fingertips. Both businesses, we grew Writing strongly in both North America and Latin America and we grew our Writing in Asia as well. So we\u2019ve had a good run on Writing in Europe. We had a choppier first quarter, but in broad terms we had strong growth.","More pricing driven growth in Latin America, more volume driven growth in North America and market share driven growth in North America. Your question is a great question. And if I had Joe Cavaliere, who is our head of customer development in the room with me right now and he was sitting across the table, I\u2019d we winking at him.","I think, we still have the ton of opportunity left in our home markets to get our brands more broadly distributed with the right assortment in the right channels. And I think, in fact, I think there is more commercial innovation opportunity on our Writing business at the moment than anything else. And so we\u2019ve made very good progress. We see what we call total distribution point, TDPs up and we see our share of TDPs up in the U.S. but I still believe we are nowhere near where we could be.","With respect to depth of availability and having the right assortment in different channels, we\u2019re not yet maximizing the revenue per linear inch of the store shelf. So we have a ton of opportunity to get that right. It\u2019s not easy work, it\u2019s collaborative work. It\u2019s work that\u2019s needs to be validated through analytics in partnership with the customer to demonstrate why resetting shelving to the perfect assortment creates value for them and conversely for us.","And so it sort of painstaking work. We\u2019ve made good progress but we have a lot more opportunity to get what we described as the perfect store in place with perfect assortment. And it\u2019s true in the U.S., its true in Canada, certainly true in Europe and U.K. and France and in parts of Mexico within our mass channels. So there's a lot of opportunity still in front of us. We\u2019re making good progress that are mean to be too negative about it for our own people but we got more, more we can do.","Wendy Nicholson","Terrific. I had a second unrelated question, which is the $150 million of incremental cost savings.","John Stipancich","Yeah.","Wendy Nicholson","Sounds like that's SG&A and you said overhead-related. But how much of that is related to either stranded overhead for some of the brands that you're selling or incremental synergy opportunities for the brands that you've bought? And how much of it, if you can tease it out, is just kind of the core business? I mean, it surprises me that you've done so much restructuring. I mean, Newell did even before you got there. And it's amazing that you kind of keep peeling back the layers of the onion and finding more opportunity?","John Stipancich","Yeah. Hey, Wendy, it\u2019s John. The vast majority of it is basically the core underlying business. There\u2019s not a whole lot that\u2019s left from the stranded dispositions. And your recognition is fair. Although I think the previous projects have been more focused on manufacturing distribution footprint and so forth. Actually, we\u2019ve taken a hard enough look ever at the SG&A structure on the overhead\u2019s piece. And certainly, a lot of our peers are starting to do that. So we recognize that we still have plenty of opportunity overall.","Mike Polk","Our overhead ratios are just below 20 right now. So good benchmark that against anybody in our industry and you'll see that that\u2019s quite high. The exception might be a couple of the Tools and Commercial Products industry players. So we have a lot of opportunity. We have to do this in a disciplined way, Wendy, and part of this is a legacy of having operated in a disaggregated structure.","We are disciplined because we have to change the way we work to enable the cost to come out. We do a lot of the macro structural work already. But now we need to get into the way we transact our business in order to release these overheads. And then we got to high real estate footprint cost. We\u2019ve got lots of -- we\u2019ve got pretty much every line item that you can look down, you could challenge.","And so one of the reason, we\u2019re so happy that John was interested in doing this as he's proven through the European experience, how to go about doing this. And he is the perfect player that kind of lead this charge on behalf of the company, given his experience to date. And we\u2019re going to get this sorted. This is one of the things that will give us the degrees of freedom within the P&L to make some of the choices that Dara was challenging us on earlier.","Wendy Nicholson","Terrific. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Mike Polk","Hi, Joe.","Joe Altobello","Not to harp too much on Baby, but I just did want to go back and see where the first quarter came in relative to your expectations, number one? Number two, do you think it could accelerate fast enough to get into that 3.5% to 4.5% range for the full year?","Mike Polk","Yes.","Joe Altobello","Okay. And in terms of expectation was it in line or...?","Mike Polk","It\u2019s a listen hard for the team to listen. I am sure. Hopefully -- they tell me what they think. But I hope we can get to solid single-digit growth on Baby globally despite the headwinds in Russia, despite the challenges that will persist in Europe through the balance of the year. I would not get too optimistic about what we are going to be able to do in Europe, but we\u2019ve got a great setup planned in North America and in Asia.","And then we\u2019ve had all the conversations we need to have about strengthening Europe as we move out of \u201815 into \u201816. We got a better innovation plan coming back. In fact, there were meetings in London this week with our two biggest customers in Europe that went very, very well, designed to setup \u201816 for success. So -- but \u201815 will be muted growth, maybe a slight decline in Europe that we\u2019ll cover through progress in North America and Asia.","Joe Altobello","Got it. Okay. I was just trying to put the 80 basis points into some context there?","Mike Polk","Yes.","Joe Altobello","And then secondly in terms of the acquisitions, it looked like you are looking for a bigger contribution from than you were previously. Maybe an update on where those stand, Contigo, bubba and Baby Jogger obviously. Are you seeing more growth opportunities or distribution expansion opportunities from them?","Mike Polk","We couldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t be happier with these acquisitions. They are just beautiful brands. And we've got great people that we brought into the business with the brands. And so we couldn't be happier, Baby Jogger -- again we are talking 2016 innovation of Baby Jogger now and we\u2019ve got some really interesting things that we are going to be doing then. Contigo and bubba awesome brands with huge distribution opportunities not still in the U.S. and the world to play for with these brands.","Again the constraining factor on these will be our P&L capacity to be able to place all these bets. But we\u2019re really pleased with these categories. And they are quite importantly all growth accretive and with new investment that we are going to be able to put behind them, we would expect that to be able to sustain, if not accelerate the growth momentum in these businesses and we are right where we hoped we would be with them at this point in time.","Joe Altobello","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Thanks. Good morning. Want to ask you about gross margin. I know there's lots of puts and takes there. But you obviously had a strong start to the year. Commodities do get better as the year progresses. And I know with the baby commentary, there's probably a little bit of a mix drag as the year progresses. But can you continue to accelerate gross margin from here, to continue fueling even more incremental spending?","Mike Polk","Well, we were pleased with the start on gross margin. It was actually a little bit better than we anticipated it being. Part of that was mix related. But a lot of it had to do with how aggressively we dealt with our transaction Forex issues and some progress that we are making on supply chain. The first part -- the first half of project renewal, the $200 million that we had reported previously authorized us to spend is very much focused on gross margin. In fact, most of its in gross margin, a small piece of it is in overhead.","And so we should -- if input costs continue to fall and slow at this level and we are able to capture the benefit of the strategic pricing work we are doing through our new go-to market programs, we should be able to deliver in \u201816 and \u201817 gross margin progression, quite nice gross margin progression. \u201815 will be challenged by the mix effect of baby recovery and home solutions recovery. Again, remind you our acquisitions are dilutive with gross margin.","And so the growth there will work against us, although we are making great progress within each of those acquisitions on gross margin improvements. So \u201815 will not be as impressive a year in terms of gross margin delivery for all the reasons, including the transaction Forex pressure we have.","But as we -- assuming things hold together from a currency perspective and that we deliver the first $200 million of savings in the third phase of renewal, which are almost all gross margin related, we should be able to see some nice movement forward on gross margin in '16 and '17.","Olivia Tong","Got it. Appreciate that. And then in terms of the U.S. and sort of capturing a little bit of a lift from lower gas prices, lower commodity prices, why do you think you\u2019re not seeing more of a lift, particularly in the U.S.?","Mike Polk","I think the industry is not single lift. I\u2019m making that judgment based on the retail comps, I\u2019m seeing not based on our movement, we\u2019re seeing good momentum. I\u2019m just-- I\u2019m reluctant to describe any of that to the macros based on the retail comps I am hearing.","There is some exceptions to that. The home centers retailers are doing quite well. But if I look at the mass channel, I don\u2019t see this massive shift that I would have expected from Q3 to Q4 or to Q1 yet. And we don\u2019t see it in the GDP growth either. So I think -- I\u2019m reluctant to call upside in the macros. That said doesn\u2019t seem to be impacting our ability to drive a sequential improvement in our growth rates.","Olivia Tong","Fair enough. Thanks, Mike.","Mike Polk","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason Gere","Good morning. I got to be honest. I think every question and topic has been exhausted. So the only thing I guess I will ask is if you could talk maybe a little about the cash flow for the year, just cash flow from operations, how we should see that kind of playing out? Obviously the first quarter was a use of cash. So just wondering if you could kind of talk about the priorities, how you're thinking about the next 12 months?","Mike Polk","Sure, Jason. So we anticipated using we always use cash in the first quarter, so nothing new there. And you saw we -- it was a good opportunity for us to put money into our U.S. pension plan, a wise investment for us. So once we back that our, we are almost flat year-over-year on cash in Q1. We will consume cash as well in Q2 and then eventually turn positive in the back half overall.","So typical for our business overall. That said, net-net we should land cash, we\u2019re not going to guide to it, but fairly consistent with where we have in the past. But we do know that we have a lot of opportunity still on working capital.","So that\u2019s one of the things that, in addition to some of the other projects Mike\u2019s tasked me with that we need to tackle this year is to improve our working capital position. And we\u2019re starting to sketch out the framework for doing that in a comprehensive yet collaboratively way with all the stakeholders including our suppliers.","Jason Gere","Okay. And then just in terms of the new cost savings, the update there, is there any change to that five year target on cash flow from operations you guys laid out at one of the of past analyst meetings? I think it was like $4 billion. I know obviously acquisitions have kind of stepped up a little bit earlier than anticipated, but I was just wondering if there was any update to the longer-term cash flow outlook.","Mike Polk","We haven\u2019t updated that since, gosh, I think probably back-to-school. I think highlighting at the CAGNY. It\u2019s a good challenge. We should update that -- we will update that for the next big conference that is Deutsche Bank. So we will make sure we provide an update that reflects all the M&A that we\u2019ve done both in and the outs and -- I don\u2019t think it will a make materially huge difference in the overall framework.","Our capital allocation strategy is going to remain the same. We will hold our dividend payout ratio in the 30% to 35% range. We\u2019re trying to take it towards the high end of that, so that we\u2019re competitive with the fast moving consumer goods, guys. We\u2019re obviously buying back our stock because we think we\u2019re undervalued. We continue to believe we\u2019re undervalued, given agenda that we\u2019re deploying and the results we\u2019re beginning to put up and the fact that they are competitive with some of the best that are out there.","And then obviously, we have an appetite to continue to strengthen each of our five pillars through bolt-on M&A and we will continue to do that. We have lots of opportunity there. So we\u2019ve got -- we should set that up a little bit more clearly than we have in the last couple of big conferences that we\u2019ve done and we will take that on.","Jason Gere","Sounds get. Thanks guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray.","Steph Wissink","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Mike Polk","Hi.","Steph Wissink","Just a really quick question from us on the A&P increased spend, can you talk a little about the strategies? And are you testing new strategies that you're finding are working better than your expectations?","And then Mike, if you could just talk about how widespread those A&P increases are across the globe, or is it concentrated by region?","Mike Polk","Good question, Steph. So we\u2019re comfortable putting the money in because we\u2019re validating what we're spending behind in advance of putting money behind it. So every piece of advertising that airs, that we invest behind goes through a battery of tests. And we\u2019ve had very, very strong advertising testing results. And we use the same methodology that all the, sort of the academy consumer goods companies would use, same supplier, same methodology.","And we test our advertising against all industry at. So we know how they are performing versus the best. And they\u2019ve done extremely well in pre-testing before we take them to market. So, we have quantitatively validated the ads we\u2019re spending behind. That\u2019s the first threshold before we\u2019ll put any money behind the piece of advertising.","The second is driven by portfolio strategy and the where-to-play choices we\u2019re making in the business. And Writing has gotten a disproportionate amounts of investment relative to the rest of the portfolio because of its Win Bigger status and because it is proving to be very, very responsive to the investment. We are increasingly broadening the geographic footprint to that investment.","We started that in 2014. We will increase the amount of that money that's being deployed into markets like Mexico, Columbia, Brazil, U.K., France, Italy and our footprint, geographic footprint will continue to broaden within the Writing portfolio. On Tools, we\u2019ve seen good responsiveness when we spend behind advertising that\u2019s new product focused.","When we do anthem, what\u2019s called anthematic advertising just on the big brands, we don't see responsiveness. So we pull the money off of the anthematic campaigns on Tools and put it behind new items, both in the U.S. and in Brazil where the biggest investments have been made up until now. We will evaluate whether to continue to broaden that advertising. But again, it will has to be measured against the upside potential of deploying the money against the Writing opportunity.","We're spending more heavily than we ever have before on baby to reignite growth and we will continue to do that. That advertising is largely new item focused and it seems to be really yielding a good sell-through impact. So, we\u2019re going to continue to play that story out. And at the end of \u201915, we\u2019ll evaluate how much more we should be deploying behind that brand.","The Graco brand in particular is one of our strongest brands from an equity standpoint. So there's great resonance when we spend money behind it and we\u2019re seeing, when Graco advertising that is new item focused is coupled with great merchandising, we get this synergistic effect on sell-through. So we\u2019re going to continue to play that out. We just begin advertising Calphalon in the fourth quarter of 2014 and we\u2019re in the midst of evaluating that that looked to have been a positive experience for us.","And then we have opportunities in many other places that we\u2019ll have to govern to the deployment of the money against having -- until we\u2019ve fulfilled all the opportunities on our higher priority brands. So that\u2019s a logic behind which we\u2019re making choices. I think over the next few years you should expect us to be able to tell you that an increasingly higher proportion of our total media spend is outside of North America.","Steph Wissink","Great. Appreciate the response. Best of luck, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And your final question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Mike Polk","Good morning, Rupesh.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I just wanted to touch on, I guess go a little further into your core sales growth. So clearly you mentioned in your press release a number of times benefits from the strong innovation. Is there any way to quantify how much more -- maybe how much more growth you're seeing right now from new innovation maybe versus last year?","Mike Polk","We don\u2019t quote that number externally but it\u2019s considerably stronger. The number that we talk about is the innovation rate in the business and we\u2019re pressing towards an ambition that to compete with the best in our industry, which typically is measured by this metric, some people call it by tally rate. Other people call it innovation rates.","What we\u2019re looking to try to get our innovation rate to having about 30% of our revenue touched by -- or generated by innovations launched in the last three years, that sort of the goal standards that most consumer goods company would point to. And we\u2019re getting close. By \u201816, we\u2019ll be there. We are getting close. We are not quite there yet. But we\u2019re certainly way stronger than we were a year ago. And that will continue to progress as ideas come through the funnel.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. Thank you.","Mike Polk","I\u2019m sorry.","Operator","This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Polk for closing remarks.","Mike Polk","Well, thank you. I think it\u2019s probably us talking to ourselves because I don\u2019t know if there is anybody left on the line. But I wanted to thank everybody for what were a great set of questions. We\u2019re very proud of the start to the year we\u2019ve had. We think it provides good evidence of the progress we\u2019re making as a company. And we\u2019re excited to be able to continue to play forward for the upside in the business. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

Polk","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Building on a very good first quarter set of results we\u2019ve reported another strong performance in the second quarter against our toughest competitor from last year. As a result, this morning, we announced that we have increased our core sales and normalized EPS guidance for the full year. So let\u2019s get into our second quarter performance.","In Q2, core sales grew 5.1% and net sales grew 3.9%. Acquisitions and plan divestures contributed 480 basis points to net sales growth, which was more than offset by a 600 basis point negative impact due to foreign currency.","Normalized gross margin increased 10 basis points to 40%, driven by productivity and pricing partially offset by negative impact of foreign currency and the mix effect from acquisitions which carry amortization charges. This improvement when coupled with 140 basis point reduction in overheads funded 150 basis point increase in advertising and promotion, with advertising spending up over 70% versus prior year.","Normalized EPS was $0.64, $0.02 ahead of consensus and 8.5% ahead prior year. We achieved this EPS growth despite investing $0.07 in incremental advertising and promotion and having to overcome an $0.11 negative impact from foreign currency. Our second quarter core sales growth was broadbased with growth in all five segments and in all four regions. Combined our win bigger businesses grew core sales 6.5%. Writing core sales grew 10.8% driven by strengthened innovation, increased marketing support and pricing.","These results were achieved despite having to comp a year ago period when the U.S. back-to-school selling skewed earlier than it did this year. Commercial products grew core sales 1.6%, successfully lapping nearly 10% growth in the prior year period with good underlying sell out trends in the U.S. and Europe as a result of strong innovation and excellent sales execution.","Tools grew core sales 1.3% successfully lapping nearly 13% growth in the prior year period associated with last year\u2019s expansion of our Brazilian business. We delivered strong results in Europe and Asia-Pacific and solid performance in the U.S. U.S. tool sell out in Q2 was very strong and we\u2019re pleased with the momentum we are building in the business into the second half of the year.","Importantly Baby core sales grew 6% in Q2 with very strong Japan and UK results complementing solid U.S. performance to more than offset Western Europe and Russia weakness. Home solutions grew core sales 1.2% with continued double-digit Rubbermaid food storage growth offsetting planned declines on our lower margin Rubbermaid consumer storage business. In Q2, our recently acquired Contigo, Bubba, and Baby Jogger brands delivered outstanding results growing double-digits compared to last year which was prior to your ownership.","As you know we do not include acquisition growth in core sales until their first anniversary with the company. Have we included this growth our new brands would have contributed an incremental 30 basis points to our core sales growth in Q2.","Our first half results are strong as well. Core sales grew 4.9% with all five segments in all four regions contributing. Our Win Bigger businesses lapped top comparators to grow core sales 6.9% with standout growth on writings of over 10%. We have returned our baby business to growth delivering 3.4% growth in the first half.","We have had very good contribution from acquisitions which when combined with our strong core growth has offset the negative impact of currency to yield 4% net sales growth. Despite unprecedented currency pressure on our cost due to the strong U.S. dollar we have expanded normalized gross margins 30 basis points and we have increased advertising and promotion investment by 100 basis points while simultaneously increasing normalized operating margin 40 basis points as a result of making Newell leaner and more efficient through Project Renewal, all of this yielding 7.5% normalized EPS growth and very strong double-digit normalized EPS growth in a currency neutral basis.","We are obviously very pleased with the first six months of the year. We built momentum in our business and view our results as further evidence of the progress we are making transforming Newel into a differentiated, highly competitive performer in our industry. ","Let me hand the call over to John to go through our results in more detail and then I\u2019ll return to provide perspective on the balance of 2015.","John K. Stipancich","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Second quarter reported net sales were $1.56 billion a 3.9% increase versus last year. Core sales which exclude acquisitions, planned disposals and foreign currency increased 5.1%. The net impact of acquisitions and disposals contributed 480 basis points to reported net sales. Foreign currency had a negative impact of 600 basis points, as Mike mentioned all five of our segments delivered core sales growth in the quarter with writing and baby leading the pack.","You may recall, we're comping against last year\u2019s second quarter that benefited from a pull forward of about $15 million of sell-in orders for last year\u2019s back-to-school season which results in about 100 basis points drag on core sales growth this quarter. On the other hand, Venezuela\u2019s contribution of core growth this quarter is seasonally the highest of the year so netting these two offsetting factors so adjusting for the pull forward and excluding Venezuela, our underlying core sales growth in the quarter was about 4.2%.","Reported gross margin was 39.8% an increase of 20 basis points from prior year. Normalized gross margin was 40% up 10 basis points over last year. Our improvement was driven by productivity, resin deflation, pricing and favorable mix which more than offset unfavorable currency, sourced labor inflation and the negative mix impacts from the gross margin structure of our recent acquisitions.","Normalized SG&A expense was $374.9 million or 24% of sales which as a percentage of sales were flat to last year. A 140 basis point reduction of overhead fueled 150 basis point increase in advertising and promotion investments with all five segments benefiting from year-over-year increases in A&P spend.","Notable investments included advertising support for Paper Mate, InkJoy pens, Irwin Vice-Grip hand tools and the Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 car seat, and we run numerous campaigns of Rubbermaid commercial to support our core business and new product launches. Normalized operating margin was 16% flat to last year reflecting the benefit of Project Renewal and other cost savings initiatives offset by increased investment in A&P and significant FX headwinds.","Reported operating margin was 13.8% compared with 14.2% in the prior year. Interest expense of $18.1 million increased $3.1 million year-over-year reflecting the impact of our late 2014 debt refinancing and higher overall borrowings related to our acquisitions in the back half of last year. Our normalized tax rate was 24.5% compared with 27.2% a year ago due to the geographic mix of earnings.","We still expect our full year normalized 2015 tax rate to be around 24%. Normalized EPS which excludes restructuring and other project costs was $0.64, an 8.5% increase to last year despite about $0.07 of incremental A&P investment and $0.11 of FX headwinds. On a reported basis second quarter EPS was $0.55 compared with $0.54 last year.","And now I\u2019ll move on to our segment results and starting with Writing, reported second quarter net sales increased 1.3% to $496 million. Core sales increased 10.8% led by strong volume growth EMEA and Latin America as well as pricing.","In North America back to school selling droved solid growth as we comp against the timing related benefit in last year\u2019s second quarter. Writing\u2019s core sales growth for the first half was 10.1%. Q2 normalized operating margin in the Writing segment was 26.8%, 40 basis point decrease over the prior year as the benefit of increased sales and productivity was more than offset by negative foreign currency impacts and increased advertising and promotion spend.","Net sales in our Home Solutions segment grew 14.4% to $438.5 million with acquisitions contributing $55.4 million. Core sales increased 1.2% due to the continued positive momentum in Rubbermaid food and beverage. This more than offset our continued exit of portion of the lower margin consumer storage business and a comparison against last year\u2019s Calphalon pipeline fill at a major new customer.","The first half of the year, the segment grew core sales by 1.1%. Home solutions normalized operating margin was 15.9% up 320 basis points reflecting the accretive impacts of acquisitions recent deflation and productivity. Our tool segment delivered net sales of $205.2 million, a 7.7% decrease driven by FX.","Core sales grew 1.3% as we comp against double digit core growth in the prior year. Core growth in North America, EMEA and APAC was partially offset by a modest decline in Latin America where we had significant pipeline till last year related to our expanded product offerings in Brazil.","Core growth for the first half of 15 was 2.2% normalized operating margin in the tool segment was 11.4% a 210 basis point decline driven by increased advertising and promotion and negative FX. Reported net sales in our commercial product segment decreased 5.8% to $210.6 million. Core sales which exclude the Rubbermaid medical business increased 1.6% driven by pricing and volume growth despite about a 10% core sales growth comp in the prior year.","The core growth for the first half of the year was 5%, commercial products and normalized operating margin was 13.8% a 240 basis point decline due to higher advertising and promotion spend and negative FX. Our baby segment reported $210.7 million in net sales, up 14.7% increase compared to last year. The Baby Jogger acquisition contributed $26.7 million in sales during the quarter.","Core sales grew 6% in the quarter reflecting good growth in North America and double digit growth in APAC, fueled by new product launches, and increased advertising and promotion. Core growth for the first half was 3.4%, Baby\u2019s normalized operating margin was 8%, an increase of 110 basis points to last year despite a significant increased investment and advertising and promotion, thanks in part to the Baby Jogger acquisition.","Looking now Q2 core sales by geography, North America core sales grew 1.4% lead by Baby and writing despite the 150 basis point impact from the back-to-school early sell on last year. In EMEA, core sales grew 6.5%, due to strong growth in writing tools and commercial products partially offset by continued weakness in Baby. In Latin America, core sales grew 40.2% reflecting good underlying core growth in writing and commercial products and pricing. Partially offset by slowing economy in Brazil, as well as comping our large new product launch in Brazil last year.","Note our core sales growth in the first half for the region was 33.5% but that rate will tapper off in the back half of this year, as volume growth in Venezuela will tamper and as we see increasing softness in Brazil. This will be more produced in the third quarter as we lapped the SAP pull four from Q4 to Q3 last year. And finally Asia Pacific core sales increased 5.9% fueled by the strong double-digit growth in Baby Japan as that business has now returned to grow","Moving on to cash in our balance sheet. In Q2, we generated $102.5 million in operating cash compared with $96.2 million in the prior year. The increase reflects improved payables, partially offset by higher inventories. We return $101.6 million to shareholders in Q2 including $51.2 million in dividends and $50.4 million to repurchase $1.3 million of our shares. As of the end of Q2 we have $312 million available under our authorized open market repurchase plan. And finally, our balance sheet metric continue to be strong giving us flexibility to support project renewal and for further acquisition should we chose to pursue them.","Now, with that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk","Thanks, John. Let\u2019s now turn to the balance of 2015. This morning, we increased our 2015 full year guidance to 4% to 5% core sales growth and $2.14 to $2.20 normalized EPS, which represents 7% to 10% growth compared to prior year. Our best estimate for delivery is at the mid-points of each component of this new full year guidance. We are increasing guidance despite our expectation that for the full year negative foreign currency impact will now be $0.36 to $0.39 slight worse than previously communicated as a result of the further weakening of currencies particularly in Brazil and Canada.","We\u2019ve take broad based actions to deal with the currency impact and are making good progress covering the exposure. The expansion of project renewal has helped and we will need to take further pricing to cover the full impact. Despite the unprecedented ForEx challenge our conviction to steadily increase brand support remained strong given the core growth acceleration and market share increases we are experiencing.","In 2015, our guidance assumes we increase A&P investment by nearly 20% and end the year with A&Pas a percentage of sales around 5%. Our strategic objective is to increaseA&Pinvestment to about 7 percentage points of sales over the next few years. We are unweavering in this ambition because we believe it is key to enabling both the deployment of our portfolio to new wide space geographies while also investing per share growth in our home markets.","We expect to achieve both growth goals plus simultaneously delivering highly competitive earnings results and margin development. In 2015, on a currency neutral basis, the $2.17 mid-point of the new normalized EPS guidance range represents very strong double-digit EPS growth of over 25% versus prior year given our current assumptions on currency.","If circumstances develop that give us flexibilities to deliver beyond the mid-point of the full-year normalized EPS guidance range we would likely prioritize investing back into the business to accelerate early 2016 results if we could do so productively rather than further strengthen already highly competitive earnings growth in 2015.","Our 2015 full year guidance assumes that we sustain mid single digit core growth on our Win Bigger businesses with tools acceleration in the second half and writing deceleration in Q4 as we rebalance retailer inventories in advance of the potential consolidation in the U.S. office superstore channel. Our guidance also assumes the Baby sustains mid single digit growth for the balance of the year and then strong growth on Rubbermaid food storage offsets planned declines on the lower margin Rubbermaid consumer storage business resulting in low single digit Home Solutions growth for the full year.","We expect to offset the negative impact transaction Forex with positive pricing in productivity and that we continue to reduce overheads which when coupled with growth enables us to increase advertising and promotion support. There are two factors that could influence where we fall in our full-year guidance ranges.","The first factor is the planned positive momentum shift on our Baby business, we expect Baby to deliver solid single digit core growth for the full-year, we are well staged to achieve this outcome in North America and Japan behind strong innovation, great customer partnering in increased marketing support. We will continue to invest significant marketing support behind Baby innovation in 2015 in order to reignite growth while accepting the related operating margin contraction.","Second factor that could influence the full-year outcome is foreign exchange and in particular the impact of Venezuela on our overall results. Our guidance assumes we overcome the $0.36 to $0.39 of negative foreign currency impact to deliver EPS growth in the range of 7% to 10%. We are on track to achieve this outcome despite the slight worsening of the Forex outlook since our last earnings call.","We assume the major currencies hold at current market rates and in Venezuela we continue to transact and translate at the SICAD rate given that our last option was at the SICAD rate given that we expect to access another SICAD in the next few months and given that we expect to remix dividends at the SICAD rate.","Last month\u2019s SICAD option for the transformation industry set the SICAD rate at 12.8 bolivars per U.S. dollar, we have to reflect that this devaluation from 12 bolivars per dollar to 12.8 bolivars per dollar in our revised guidance. Importantly, we are executing well in Venezuela and in the seasonally high Q2 back-to-school period our growth was about evenly split between volume and price.","We expect Venezuela to contribute roughly 90 basis points so the total company full year core growth rate in 2015, 20 basis points above the 2014 rate of contribution. As previously shared, we are on track towards the mid-point of our revised full year core growth guidance range of 4.5%, our expected full-year core sales growth contribution from Venezuela of 90 basis points implies that we are tracking towards 3.6% core sales growth excluding Venezuela. We believe either mid-point is highly competitive given we have observed the negative impact of our European exits and the planned contraction of the Rubbermaid consumer storage business in core sales.","So let me close now by saying we had a very good first half of the year delivering strong competitive results, growth continues to accelerate and despite unprecedented foreign currency pressure, we are delivering very strong normalized EPS growth. We have increased our 2015 full year guidance to reflect the building momentum in the business and are tracking towards our long-term guidance of consistent 4% core sales growth and 10% normalized EPS growth as we enter the accelerations stage of the growth game plan in 2016.","Our building momentum is a function of the short choices we\u2019ve made. We are investing to create advantage in brand development and innovation capabilities and are backing them up with category leading marketing investment. We have tested nearly 750 new product concepts over the last 5 quarters and our concept test results are consistently well a head our research suppliers industry benchmarks.","As a result our innovation funneled value as nearly doubled since 2013 with value per project up over 150%. The projects in the funnel has been steadily moving from concept to product leveraging strength and execution within our R&D and the new product design capability we have invested to cerate in our purpose built design center in Kalamazoo Michigan.","These new ideas for growth and the near doubling of our advertising and promotion investment happen and enabled by our determination to make no linear and more efficient and to unlock the craft capacity for growth for project Newell.","Coupled with the actions we have take it to strengthen our portfolio, these choices are yielding accelerate growth and margin expansion also beginning to scale the company. We are on about to completely transform Newell delivering a highly competitive differentiated story about category leading growth in margin development.","That\u2019s the growth gain plan into action and that\u2019s the Newell Rubbermaid. Let me now pass the line to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will go first to Chris Ferrara of Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara","Hi, good morning guys.","Michael B. Polk","Hi Chris.","John K. Stipancich","Good morning.","Christopher Ferrara","I hate to lead with the Venezuelan question, but it was such contributor to this quarter, so let me get out of the way. So, I guess first half if you guys had to move - I guess what triggered move to [indiscernible] for you guys and if you did have to move to samadhi for 2016. How does that affect you view of getting to that acceleration phase and those delivering 4% plus core sales growth even without the contribution from Venezuelan that you even seeing.","Michael B. Polk","Chris, let me answer to the second part of your question and then I will pass the samadhi question over to John. But, you know the things that I - the reason we are unpacking the growth so that you have more visibility into Venezuela contribution is to set up some visibility to the underline performance in the company. So, John talked about Q2 if you adjusted for the writing timing and excluded Venezuela from our core sales growth numbers you would have 4.2% core sales growth in the quarter which is good indication of the underline performance in the company. I gave you another data point which is we expect on the full year Venezuela contribute 90 basis points, which against the mid point revised guidance range is equipped with 3.6% core growth on the full year.","I think that\u2019s 20 basis a head year ago so if you adjusted last years numbers you can see the sequential improvement in our growth rates underlining expend as well. So I think we are right on track to getting to 4%, 4 plus percent a core growth next year underline so excluding Venezuela just I think that\u2019s within our reach now especially with the strengthening innovation funnel that I referenced in continuing work on cost which is enabling us to invest at higher A&P rates back into the business. So I think we are right on track to the acceleration phase with or without Venezuela in the numbers for 2016.","John K. Stipancich","Yes Chris, with respect to samadhi we are still very comfortable based up on our ability to access the SICAD options and the information that we have coming up for the next round of auctions. As you know there was a auction last month in the grow transportation industry that out SICAD 12 way which cost us to revalue and move from 12 to 12 8. So we are still comfortable that SICAD is the right number for us, but we are obviously watching closely. If we did and have to move to sumari in Q3 , the impact on us would probably be about $0.2 before any mitigating action on 2015, so we would scramble and try to cover it obliviously if that when the case but you know that\u2019s gets for us right now is certainly SICAD is the near-term future.","Michael B. Polk","There is a key sort of event in SICAD later this year with the parliamentary elections and I think things stay in the current space that we\u2019re in certainly through that moment in time and then we\u2019ll see what happens after that. Look the facts and circumstances for every company are different, we accessed SICAD in 2014, we haven\u2019t needed because went long, we\u2019re able to access enough dollars to go long on raw materials and we\u2019ve been able to price within the law to manage the margin impact of all that.","We expect access another SICAD auction shortly and we\u2019ll see how much, how many dollars we can access and how long position we can take, but right now, the circumstances for us are such that we feel very comfortable and the advice were being given would suggest that we continue to translate and transacted SICAD.","Christopher Ferrara","Got it. I guess a couple quick follow-ups, John, when you said $0.02 is that would be for the back half the year if you had to move there for Q3?","John K. Stipancich","Correct.","Christopher Ferrara","Okay, and just on different notes, what is the outlook for commodities? Last quarter is a commodities were going to be I guess flat for the year and then just on the China writing launch that supposed to come up in the middle of 2016, can you is or any sort of data or analysis or color you can give us on what you are thinking in terms of share of potential incremental sales contribution from that early on? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So on commodities as you know we\u2019ve seen the benefits certainly present pricing; John referenced that in his comments. I think if I looked at inflation in total across all elements that influence our cost of goods, inflation this year is going to be pretty much flat year-over-year which is the first time we\u2019ve seen that in a long time. Benefiting from resin deflation but we continue to see labor rate increases in some other raw material increases. They net against each other to effectively hot inflation flat. In that, it certainly is contributing to our ability to move gross margin up given the pricing and productivity activities we\u2019ve been executing.","We did see resin - from the middle of Q2 through the most recent period we have seen a little bit of a bump in resin prices and we don\u2019t know how that will play out through the balance of the year pretty every industry outlook says those prices holds at that level, at that higher levels for the balance of the year but it\u2019s really going to be dependent on the supply and input cost relationship with oil, now drifting back down you would think that would put down work pressure on resin prices.","However, there are supply chain constraints in some of the components that go into resin manufacturing and there are supply constraints on the facilities themselves that is causing pricing to hold up a little bit more strongly than we would normally expect. And so it\u2019s unclear how that\u2019s going to breakdown for the balance of the year, our assumptions are that the current rates holds for the balance of the year and we actually see some inflation in resin going into 2016.","China launch, Bill and Mark, and Chirsty were in Shanghai this week with a team working through route to market assumptions, we haven\u2019t, Chirsh, we haven\u2019t kind of put any data out there yet, I need to speak with them when they get back over the next couple of weeks to talk about how broadly we think we can go and what timing we think we can launch, is it first half or is it early second half and some of the route for market assumptions are really in our ability to skill those who really drive whether it\u2019s first half or second half.","We haven\u2019t decided yet, we\u2019ve got the brand, we\u2019ve got the product, we got the packaging, we know where we would source the product from, which is within our own network. So we\u2019re lined out on the hard stuff, we need to make sure we like the route for market assumptions we\u2019ve built in and I need to understand the breath of cities that the team is going to recommend to go within until we resolve just exactly how broadly we\u2019ll go. I can\u2019t really quote what type of share and revenue impact we would expect. But over the next couple of months maybe by the end of Q3, we\u2019ll start to talk about that little bit more openly.","Christopher Ferrara","Got it. Thank you.","Michael B. Polk","Yup.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello of Raymond James.","Joseph Altobello","First on baby. Obviously this was a nice on. Quarter after the first quarter. Margins also were up nicely this quarter. When do you guys expect to get baby operating margin back in double digits? Is that something that is 2017 or 2018?","John K. Stipancich","Yes hi Joe, it is John. With respect to Baby right now obviously we\u2019re pleased to trend that business back to growth after the difficult year last year and I think as you heard there are two things that are going to challenge the margin on it little bit, one is we\u2019re going to continue to advertise and promote the business right now because we are seeing a nice return on that in terms of the top line and the second piece we are getting to get some compression on as well as some pricing actions that we have to do to continue to defend the core in the North American market right now. So we\u2019re going to do that is going to be the first priority for us overall over the next year or so.","But eventually we will return to focusing more on the margin but for the short term it is more about making sure the business is continuing to grow, we protect obviously the price point levels that we are taking the pricing actions on.","Michael B. Polk","Yes one of our competitive battles, Joe is with the Chinese company that has made some in roads into Wal-Mart on Baby, a company called Goodbaby and they are the owners of the Chinese company owns Evenflo, they also own a brand called [indiscernible] here and they also have a brand called [Erbenee] which is at Wal-Mart, I think it maybe exclusive to Wal-Mart, I\u2019m not sure about that actually I think it may now be broader than simply Wal-Mart and so we are fighting that fight, we are going to defend the core as John said and we are doing that constructively and we are going to layer in the right innovations to Wal-Mart to the other retailers that currently are leaning into the relationship with Goodbaby.","We view them as our core competitor in the U.S. and we believe we can now innovate them and we\u2019re going to play for the market share, we are going to protect and grow our market share in the U.S., point-of-sale growth in the U.S. is strong despite the competitiveness of the marketplace and high single digit type of growth which is great, the 4Ever Car Seat will become available to all customers in the third quarter which will be really terrific addition to our retailers portfolios and I think this is one of the exciting things about the categories and the competitiveness of it with the other exciting things about the category for us is the high return on net assets that this category generates or we create a lot of value, so I\u2019m moving to take the margin squeezed in order to sustain the growth because it does in the end create a ton of value given the very high return on net assets.","Joseph Altobello","Got it. Thank you. Then in terms of advertising, obviously you guys have been investing heavily so far this year. Are you happy with the auto line that you are seeing an incremental investment and why is 7% the right number in terms of a to us? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk","Yes I think 7% may seem like a random number that we plan our business categories country sell. We look out over the horizon, the strategic plan horizon to do that in the 7% is really an outcome based on the initiatives we believe we need to fund over the next 3 years to 5 years. We think we've reached the 7% A&P ratio hopefully by 2018 full year, maybe 2019. It will take us that long to get the A&P ratios up. In part because we need to be disciplined in how we deploy the portfolio into whitespace geographies. What we are not going to do is compromise our investment in our home markets for the sake of the point portfolio around the world. There is one big consumer goods Company's that made that mistake a few years back and it is still costing them and we are not going to make that mistake.","We will govern the rate which we deploy based on our ability to preserve our investment in our home markets because we're so much opportunity consolidate market share home. 7% is an outcome. It's a function of our country\/category sell planning and we believe that puts us in a very competitive position relative to our peer group of industry peers and that will likely result in A&P ratios that are near double-digit on riding and A&P ratios of businesses like tools and commercial products that are in the 3% to 5% range and that will all blend down to that 7% number that we talked about externally.","Joseph Altobello","Got it, okay thanks guys.","Operator","We will next Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Thanks good morning.","Michael B. Polk","Hi, Olivia.","Olivia Tong","Hi, how are you.","Michael B. Polk","Good, how are you.","Olivia Tong","Good, thank you. Just first on the organic revenue growth outlook, you've had a great first half and as we think about the second half it doesn't sound like from your prepared remarks that you expect any major slowdowns in Q4 you obviously have the benefit of some of the acquisitions folded into the quarter. If the first half is at the high end of your physical guidance range perhaps can you provide a bit of flavor for other factors we should be thinking about for the second half to complete his results back from that current run rate?","Michael B. Polk","Sure. Good question. We made the assumption in Q4 and I have built it into the script so that people are aware that we will decelerate on writing in Q4 relative to the run rate we've had up until now. That is the deliberate choice we are making to plan that business for success going into 16 in the context of what we think will be the office superstore channel consolidation pending the regulatory approval of that transaction. You shouldn't expect writing to decelerate in Q4. That will be partially offset by tools acceleration in the back half of the year. But the other thing you should expect is that home solutions sustains its low single digits and the net effect of that I believe will be something below the 4.5%, the 4.5% midpoint range to do something right in the middle. It's really tough to be precise.","Remember $6 million of core sales is one tenth of the basis points of core sales results and we shipped - we shipped probably around 20, we invoice probably around $20 million a day. You know 10 basis points of court basis points on the full year is probably one third of the date of invoicing. You have to be in direct understand the sensitivity around that number. I don't want to give you guidance that is falsely precise but if you think we will end up roughly around the midpoint of that range given the writing deceleration we've planned in Q4. The other thing to understand is that Venezuela slowdown in the second half of the year.","We have just come through that back to school window sell in window which was executed really well by the team second half and the easy will ramp down quite substantially. And we don't know in this upcoming auction that we hopefully access over the next few weeks to months, we are not sure how many dollars will be available so it is unclear how much inventory we will be able to bring in connected to that auction and how hard we will be able to push our Venezuelan business without that clarity. These are all the variables that contribute to the outcome we've called.","Olivia Tong","Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. On advertising can help give us a sense of order magnitude or spend across the visions and the reason I ask you as I look like the margins in tools and commercial products and you call that higher A&P spending in both of those and I know those have greater FX pressure but just wondering if what the levels of spend there were relative to other divisions and if it\u2019s higher than other areas when using that can start materializing sales uplift, I know the comp were difficult but just kind of try to understand those dynamics.","Michael B. Polk","Yes, so one of the things that is maybe a little bit different about this company because we are smaller and than some of the big folks that you follow is that, we manage our resources very dynamically and the money flows to where the ideas are in the business. The top team really allocates the A&P around initiatives and so we don\u2019t focus too much on segment margins when it comes to the A&P impact in them.","We focus on gross margins within the segments and we focus on the direct cost in over heads in those segments, but if we got big initiative that we are launching in the segment we will take or a competitive issue we have got, we will accept the margin contraction for the investment and in the subsequent quarter we\u2019ll dynamically move resources around. And that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019ve done over the last number of years and I expect we will continue to do that.","On balance the economics are working up really quite well. The 150 basis point increase given flat normalized operating margins in the growth acceleration tells me the algorithms working. We\u2019re spending, the moment behind the Vise-Grips innovations within tools and the continued success of innovations within commercial products; we expect tools to accelerate the top line and the back half of the year.","In our first half growth on commercial products is around 5%, which if you - in any given quarter, you\u2019ll have timing related issues that you have to kind of lapse, I think commercial products would probably in the year right about word is in at the mid-point. And so I think the primary answer I would give you is about how we manage resourcing which is small group of people in the center deciding where the A&Pought to be allocated, segment president\u2019s are part of that discussion and it\u2019s my leadership team that really are making those decisions. And on balance we\u2019re looking to deliver an outcome at the corporate level.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thank you, Mike.","Michael B. Polk","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jason Gere with KeyBanc.","Jason Gere","Okay. Good morning.","Michael B. Polk","Hi, Jason.","Jason Gere","Two questions, the first one if you could talk a little bit about Brazil? We've heard some of the more industrial Company's talking about the slowdown in the impact there are given that some of your businesses as consumers they are there is a little bit of a twinge of industrial in them. I guess maybe if you could talk a little bit about the macro and how you see that building out versus the micro and how much more distribution opportunities do you still see for your categories in that market. I guess a little bit of context around Brazil there.","John K. Stipancich","Hey, Jason. It\u2019s John. In Brazil right now, we are definitely seeing little bit of softness in Brazil\u2019s mostly for us tools business in commercial products business overall, a little bit hard because we did have such as big push in the tools business last year with our product launch as we expanded the offerings in Brazil and we are getting ready to introduce the second wave of that coming up right now. So Brazil still presents a great opportunity for us but certainly the economics are as compelling as they were before hand.","Jason Gere","Okay, great. That provides great color. Just a second question I guess really on I guess within the last week Camelback was acquired that's a competitor to Contigo and Bubba, and I was just wondering if that's an area where you guys see a lot of growth opportunities and I'm just wondering about the role that maybe Camelback with their buyer out there that provides them I think more opportunity to some of the sports channels. That was an area that think you guys were talking about with Contigo and Bubba as well or can you maybe provide a little bit of context about the growth opportunity that you see with a stronger other player out there as well. Does that help the category? Do you anticipate more competitive pressures? Just a little bit of context around that news. Thanks.","John K. Stipancich","Thanks, Jason. Yes. We\u2019re really aware of that news and we know the brand very, very well, we admire this brand, it\u2019s been built and this morning the channel and it\u2019s an excellent competitor. Vista outdoor that bought the business obviously has tremendous channel synergies in the space they\u2019ve got a big sporting goods business they do ammunition they do some other things that also gives them synergies in the military channel which is a big chunk of Camelback\u2019s business. So this is a company that we need to watch in the space. And it\u2019s a brand that has very good prospects. So I think this will be one of the interesting competitive battles to watch over the coming years.","That said, we are $6 billion Company, we can deploy resources in a way that can flood any individual country category, our product family sell, like this one and so I think we\u2019ll have way more resourcing to deploy against this opportunity than anybody else in this space and you should expect us to do that. This is the fastest durable water bottle and category is the fastest growing general merchandise category in the United States across all of the categories that we track, we look at everything from types to refuse to obviously durable water bottles and it\u2019s the fastest growing category.","So it\u2019s an exciting space, there is plenty of room for competition, we are growing very, very strongly, strong double-digit growth in the comp basis and that is extremely encouraging, we believe we have a ton of opportunity still to fill out the distribution and the Ignite team there is no better innovation capability in the industry than the team we\u2019ve got that we bought effectively in Chicago. So we are excited about the prospects. We welcome the competition and we have a lot of information for Camelback as a competitor.","Jason Gere","Okay. Great. Thank you and thank you for taking the questions.","Michael B. Polk","Sure.","Operator","We will go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks, good morning. Could you talk a little bit about working capital? Inventory was up a bunch. It looks like and you covered it with payables and receivables, so things were a little choppy. If you could talk about those dynamics that those would be great. Thanks.","John K. Stipancich","Hey Lauren, the working capital for us inventory right now so you have to be a little bit cautious because we have the inventory coming in from acquisitions, it is a big piece of it and as Mike mentioned we had a lot of inventory where we went long in Venezuela that added as well and then you add the timing shift that we have in writing, so those are all some of the pieces of the inventory. That being said we have some fairly aggressive plans to get inventory out in the back half and as you know working capital is becoming a much higher area of focus for us right now as the balance of the business really starts to come online and perform very well. So you should see us if we are doing our jobs taking inventory back out in the back half overall and gradually doing a much better job in terms of managing the inventory piece.","Michael B. Polk","One comment on payables, Lauren, if you benchmark our payables days relative to some of the biggest players in the consumer goods industry and some of our near end peers, our payables days are really not as long as they should be and so well I don\u2019t view the progress on payables as opportunistic, I view it as strategic as we look to manage working capital, and so that is - you should expect us to continue to push those days out over time to the degree it makes economic sense to do that.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Great, because my follow-up to that was just going to be if you had any update to cash flow targets. I think we are waiting for updates of five-year target. I was curious if you had any thoughts on that yet?","Michael B. Polk","Actually we are sitting down to review the financial model this afternoon. The five-year forward-looking 2016 through 2020 financial model this afternoon, we're going to look at that. There is a conference coming up in about a month and maybe we will unveil it there. But we have no comment right now. We just have to take it forward through this; we got our Board meeting coming up in a couple of weeks and we\u2019re going to walk them through the forward-looking view given the momentum that is building the business and then we will be prepared to talk about that.","Lauren Lieberman","Great, and then it is a great conference I have heard, so, I look forward to it.","Michael B. Polk","I look forward to that too.","Lauren Lieberman","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz","Hi Mike good morning.","Michael B. Polk","Hi Bill.","William Schmitz","Hey what was the U.S. growth excluding the pipeline still in writing for the quarter, and I don\u2019t know does that that $50 million come back in the third quarter?","Michael B. Polk","Right now if you looked at North American growth numbers I believe they were 1.4, is that right reported core? I think it's about 150. The impact of the writing timing issue is about 150 basis points on North American results. So the underlying North American - 100? 100 okay. It's around 2.5% sort of in line with GDP growth in North America.","William Schmitz","I was talking about writings specifically.","Michael B. Polk","For writing, 150. So another 150 bps on writing for North America.","William Schmitz","Okay. That is helpful. And then does that $50 million pipeline, does that come back in the third quarter?","Michael B. Polk","It reverses but - it does - we get the benefit of writing in the first part of Q3 certainly, we are going to have stronger back-to-school performance this year than we did last year, so we will get back and then some, and but you got to remember that the SAP pull forward in Venezuela and Mexico from last year at the end of Q3 was a blend of writing and tools business. So, some of that backs out as a result of having lapped that spike, and then in Q4 you get a writing benefit at the beginning of Q4 related to the flip on SAP, but then we\u2019re going to pullback hard on retailer inventories towards the end of the year on writing in advance of the likely, although pending regulatory approval, Superstore consolidation. So, that\u2019s the inside-baseball view on writing pacing.","William Schmitz","Okay. That's great. You guys in the last - do you think you're taking market share in tools and commercial? I know it's hard to find the data [indiscernible] I can't find it anywhere.","Michael B. Polk","If you look at the market share data, you have to be real - in both categories you have to be really careful not to use it, because the coverage is not like what you would experience in other places. What we do to kind of get a sense for how we\u2019re doing is we have point-of-sales sell out data that we get transactional data that we get from most of our retailers and we can cover probably 60% of the tools universe in the U.S. and that gives us an indication of how our business is progressing which is the number I quoted to you, high-single digits, nearly double-digit tools for example sell out in the second quarter, and then we have to benchmark that against what other people report because we don\u2019t have category transaction data from that POS, from our retailers typically.","So, I look at what Stanley Black & Decker reports or what some of the others report to get a sense as to whether our share is moving in the right direction or not. We believe that our market share in Latin America is growing in tools based on that type of analysis growing in tools; we believe our market share in Europe is growing in tools. We believe our market share in North America is holding at the moment as we pivot our focus to strategic partnership with Lowe\u2019s.","William Schmitz","Okay. Great. How about on the commercial side and then I will let you go. Thanks.","Michael B. Polk","Commercial, it\u2019s really sketchy. We end up getting sell out data from our distributors and we can benchmark these sell out data relative to sell out data in prior year periods. We also get some home center transaction data through our POS database. We think 5% growth in commercial products, which is largely in North American numbers they share build number in North America. So, the headline response would be tools holding in North America, growing in the rest of the world. Commercial products growing in North America and we really don\u2019t have a big business outside of North America.","We have those two pilots going on in Brazil and in China where we are definitely growing share but they are small and in Europe, the composition of our European commercial products business is really different there, it\u2019s more of a washroom solutions business than what you will see everywhere else in the world, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good proxy for our overall progress. But the numbers are essentially holding in Europe.","William Schmitz","Great. Perfect. Thanks so much.","Michael B. Polk","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William Chappell","Thanks, good morning.","Michael B. Polk","Hi Bill.","William Chappell","Just to follow-up and I might have missed this, on Venezuela, can you break out what Venezuela will be in terms of core growth for the full year, and maybe what it was last year?","John K. Stipancich","Right now, Bill, I think for us full year we are looking at about 90 basis points of contribution as a company for Venezuela overall for the full-year and that's about 20 basis points ahead of prior year. That is right now basically our best guess in terms of where Venezuela lands.","William Chappell","And just as I\u2019m looking at your kind of raise of full-year guidance by 50 basis points, was that largely Venezuela changes or it was just core strength?","Michael B. Polk","No, it\u2019s core underlying strength, the Baby recovery was sharper than we thought it would be and our prospects for Baby are stronger in the back half of the year, but the Rubbermaid food storage is extremely strong right now, perhaps a little bit stronger than we anticipated it being.","And underlying writing momentum is quite good, so remember that, because of the timing related issues on writing, we\u2019re really under representing the core sales growth there and a part of that is Venezuela but very, very good underlying momentum, sell out growth just as a data point, Bill, sell out growth on writing in the first part of the year and this would exclude the commercial products portion of the writing market, because we can\u2019t track that as easily, but sell out growth is measured through POS, the POS data we get from our retailers was double-digit in the second quarter. And so that\u2019s really encouraging and that\u2019s above what we expected it to be.","So we\u2019re coming into the big consumption window now and time will tell whether that sustains or not; we anticipated it\u2019s sustaining because we\u2019ve got higher display levels in Back-to-School we did year ago, we got better innovation, we were spending a very high level of advertising on writing as a percentage of sales in the third quarter. So all of those things should conspire to give us a very good sell out experience and that, if we continue to sell out at rates above our prior expectations then I think we could get beyond the mid-point of that core sales guidance range we\u2019ve said, we expect to be in the middle. But if sells out works at Back-to-School we may be able to get beyond that.","So but I don\u2019t think Venezuela will contribute more in the back half of the year because I think access to dollars will be less than they were a year-ago same timeframe. And therefore we won\u2019t access as much raw materials and we won\u2019t have the freedom to push volume into the market at [her] [ph] pricing in the way we did in the prior year window. So I think Venezuela\u2019s contribution, I don\u2019t expect it to get beyond 90 basis points and it may actually slip a little bit depending on what happens with the next auction.","William Chappell","Got it. Maybe just to tie into that if I look at the kind of the excitement of back-to-school of 3070% innovation market share gains and 30% just it's a better Back-to-School season, is that the best way to look at it?","John K. Stipancich","The biggest driver is news in advertising. But in terms of the consumer involvement with the brand. But sell out is driven by the effectiveness of our sales execution and number of displays we have, the amount of phasings we have at retail, the placement on shelf of that inventory whether it\u2019s right at the end of the isle, near the and it\u2019s the first impression a consumer has walking down the isle.","So there is a lot of executional things that have to work get back to in that six, seven, eight week back-to-school period, it\u2019s unbelievably enhanced our ability to get those displays are enhanced by the fact that we are really in the industry. The only one that spending at this level, which is why we are driving disproportionate sell-out performance. So the advertising support we have on there is really significantly ahead of the competitive set and it\u2019s the combination of all those activities that drive the sell out performance. I hesitate to put a percentage on anyone component, they all work sort of synergistically to drive the outcome.","Now we\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see how it plays out, I\u2019m very encouraged, I know the displays are going to be up, I know the quality of the displays are better. Last year we tried to do displays that were multi-brand displays, this year we\u2019ve gone to dedicated brand displays on Sharpie and on Expo and then Paper Mate. So I expect we will get more placement as a result of having done that. Then we have got widely successful new launch on this Mr. Sketch as we launch washable scented markers which will make moms decades worth of moms. We will be pleased and wonder why it\u2019s taking us so long. But these things are doing really well in the period prior to back-to-school. We\u2019ve got washable Mr. Sketch; we\u2019ve got two-in-one Paper Mate choice with the stylus on one end and a pen on the other.","We\u2019ve got new colors on Sharpie, we\u2019re launching Sharpie Extreme, we\u2019ve got new colors on Expo, we\u2019ve got InkJoy Minis. We\u2019ve got a chock-full innovation funnel. But in the end, it\u2019s the synergistic effect of all that advertising and great sales execution and we\u2019re very well positioned on all those fronts. So we\u2019ll see and as you remember we got to have a good replenishment ordering at the back half of the quarter in order to have all the numbers hold together. So that\u2019s the cycle at back-to-school and we\u2019re very pleased with how it\u2019s set up at this point.","William Chappell","Perfect. I\u2019ll debrief my wife on the Mr. Sketch news.","John K. Stipancich","Exactly.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Stephanie Wissink of Piper Jaffray.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just a caution for you, Mike on the 4% topline growth, can you characterize that for us the respective price versus units particularly with respect to price, is some of the game you are seeing like for like or your point innovation driven, are you seeing the customer actually trading up into a higher price point range within your core brand. Thank you.","John K. Stipancich","Steph, it\u2019s a very good question. Our pricing is largely happening where we have transaction Forex issues. We did for the first time this year take price and writing in North America, first time in five years. And that seems to be holding the real value though that I think over time will play out in price, probably won\u2019t show up as a, if we were to do price volume analysis this wouldn\u2019t show up in price but drop in volume. But as we innovate, I talked about the 750 concepts factored to moving from concept of product, the fact that our innovation funnel values doubled, the fact that project size is up by 150 basis points. Every one of those projects has a gross margin that\u2019s accretive almost every one of those projects has a gross margin that\u2019s accretive to its core line.","That\u2019s one of the filters that we apply in the gate keeping process. The reason their gross margin accretive is because the concepts have more value and therefore they can carry a higher price and so that won\u2019t show up in our price volume metrics. That will show up as volume as we innovate in that space, price really only reflects pricing related to either invoice price increases or reductions in gross to net spending. So that type of premiumization will show up in vol mix and not in price. We expect over time to get more price realization if you want to call it that through innovation. And that\u2019s part of the logic behind the criteria we place on gate moves through the innovation funnel. We also expect to get more strategic fewer pricing on these businesses. As we become more disciplined and being able to account for the cost to serve our customers and charging for that cost to serve.","We started that in 2015 by establishing bracket pricing in the U.S. establishing three to four different tiers of customers based on order quantity and size of a customer relationship, and that will continue to be refined over time as we get better understanding the cost to serve tier-by-tier. And our spending and pricing will be proportionate to size of those customers and the efficiency of dealing with those customers. As it needs by within the rule set by Robbins and patent. But we can capture more value through strategic pricing as a result of having a clear understanding of our cost to serve, customer-by-customer. And we plan on doing that.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you very helpful. Best of luck in the back half.","John K. Stipancich","Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on home solutions segment profitability. Maybe you could talk about some of the dynamics driving the increase in the margins there and whether you expect these kinds of margins gains to sustain themselves for the remainder of the year?","John K. Stipancich","Hi, Rupesh. The biggest benefit that we have at home solutions right now and we've talked about it for a couple of quarters is the continued momentum on the food and beverage business for us which is the Tibetan section margin accretive so we mix up in that business is doing very well. We continue to deprioritized the consumer bulk storage business which has a much lower margin profile. As you may have heard my talk about before we're converting more and more of our production capacity to support that food and about the growth overall so that gives up definitely to benefit overall.","Resin deflation has helped us a little bit this year as well as Mike mentioned we're seeing a little bit of potential uptick in resin pricing going into next year overall that if we can continue to continue to push on our food and have is this as well as acquisitions which you know we talk about our acquisitions above and can TCO. Gross margin accretive to the Company but to the segment their gross margin accretive purpose of bringing those business into the segment has helped as we'll in terms of the overall profitability of the business. You will see us continue to make some progress against subject to resin cost inputs which will be kind of a major factor in that business.","Rupesh Parikh","Great. I resin prices, if you look at that segment have you fully see the benefits at lower resin prices or should we still see favorability forward?","John K. Stipancich","As we see we sit here and hope that with the lower input cost we would see that flow through in resin with the lower energy costs over to the bigger dynamics in the constraint might talked about earlier was the resin capacity right now as well as the market for some of the other components that you used to conferred the feedstocks into resin pixel right now we watch this very closely overall and you know it looks like it's going to be a little bit of pressure going into next year. Hopefully we will be happily surprised and it will go down the other way but right now it would not be counting on resin deflation being a good guy for us next year.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, thank you for all the color.","John K.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellrubbermaid.com, on the Investor Relations home page, under Events and Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download. I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Newell Rubbermaid Second Quarter Earnings Call. With me today is Mike Polk, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Juan Figuereo, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. A discussion of these factors may be found in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and in today's earnings release.","Also, our press release and this call contains non-GAAP financial measures that include, but are not limited to, normalized operating income, operating margin and normalized earnings per share.","We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations, and they're provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons.","A reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC.","With that, let me turn it over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. This morning, we reported a solid set of Q2 results with good underlying growth trends across most of our portfolio, a 40 basis point increase in normalized operating margin, driven by a 50 basis point gross margin increase, an 11% increase in operating cash flow and $0.47 normalized EPS, $0.02 ahead of consensus and 4.4% ahead of year ago.","Through the first 6 months, core sales increased 2.5%, right in the middle of our 2% to 3% full year guidance range. Normalized operating margins expanded 20 basis points, which is at the high end of our full year guidance range of up to 20 basis points.","Normalized EPS was $0.80, up 8.1% versus prior year and above the high end of our full year guidance range of 3% to 6%. And operating cash flow increased over $70 million versus prior year and is on track to deliver in our full year guidance range of $550 million to $600 million. So a pretty good set of numbers at the halfway point in the year.","Importantly, at the same time that we're driving delivery, we're driving change. During the first half of 2012, we deployed a new simplified group in GBU structure, launched our new customer development organization, executed the European SAP EPC transition, closed a significant Rubbermaid Consumer factory, initiated a new indirect procurement partnership with IBM and gained traction around on our working capital reduction program.","I'm proud of the team's effort. We're driving the business towards more consistent performance, and we delivered in a very tough environment.","Perhaps as importantly, they believe in our new vision and strategy and are resolved to strengthen our company and accelerate performance as we move into 2013 and beyond.","There's still much to do, but we're on track to where I hoped we would be 1 year into my time at Newell Rubbermaid.","As you know from our press release, we've reaffirmed our full year guidance. Before exploring the factors that could influence full year delivery, let me walk through the highlight reel for Q2 in the first half.","As you know, Q2 was a complicated quarter as a result of SAP implementation in EMEA. There were no big surprises in the SAP transition, and in fact, I was very pleased with the execution of the program.","To protect shipments through the Q2 startup window, we pulled about $28 million in net sales from Q2 into Q1. This pre-buy in Q1 and then the deliberate startup of our order management systems in Q2 limited our merchandising activity in the quarter, resulting in less sales than would otherwise have been delivered in a normal quarter.","Adjusting for the impact of the SAP pre-buy, but reflecting the absence of the merchandising in EMEA, Q2 core sales were up 2.3%.","In Q2, our Professional segment had another very good quarter with core sales growth of 4.6% excluding the impact of the SAP shift.","For the first half, core sales in the Professional segment rose 5.3%, with all 4 global business units contributing to the increase.","The 5.3% core growth in Professional was achieved against a full year core growth rate in 2011 of nearly 6%, so strong momentum and good growth on growth as we invest project renewal savings into the professional segment selling systems in the fast-growing emerging markets.","Our Consumer segment has had a tougher start to the year. In Q2, core sales excluding the SAP timing shift were nearly flat, declined 3\/10 of a percent. This is an improvement versus Q1.","Despite good results in our writing and creative expression GBU, we continued to have challenges in our D\u00e9cor business and an increasingly difficult macro environment impacted our European Fine Writing brands.","While our D\u00e9cor operational issues are largely resolved as we exit Q2, the recovery has been tempered by a change in corporate strategy at our third largest customer in this category, JCPenney.","JCP's new everyday low price approach has adversely impacted our highly merchandising sensitive D\u00e9cor business, and we now expect this impact to persist until our partner's new strategic vision is fully implemented in our categories.","These 2 factors, European macro impact on Fine Writing and the JCP challenge, drove the Consumer segment decline in the first half and will put pressure on our Consumer results through the second half of 2012.","These impacts are reflected in our full year guidance at current but not worsening levels.","Our Baby & Parenting segment delivered another strong quarter in Q2, with core sales growth of 7.3%, excluding the SAP timing shift. First half core sales grew 13%. We continue to make progress on Baby & Parenting with improved POS in Graco in North America and sustained stronger momentum on Aprica in Japan.","While we still have work to do, we're encouraged by these first half outcomes and are increasingly confident in our ability to deliver a good set of results in 2012.","In total, our first half core sales growth was 2.5% and is slightly ahead of where we expected to be at this point in the year.","Core sales grew in 6 of our 9 global business units, 3 of those 6 over 5% and 2 of those 3 over 10%.","Our top 14 brands, which represent about 85% of our revenue, grew core sales nearly 5%, with standout performance on Aprica, Paper Mate, Lenox, Graco, IRWIN and Sharpie.","We continued to deliver strong emerging market core growth of about 14%, with 13% core growth in Latin America and nearly 18% core growth in Asia Pacific in the first half.","Core sales in the developed world grew about 1%, with North American core growth of 2%, partially offset by an EMEA core sales decline of a little less than 6% in the first half.","We estimate EMEA's underlying decline to be about 4% when adjusting for the SAP transition related to the absence of merchandising in the February through May period.","Our Win Bigger categories grew core sales nearly 4%. Our Incubate for Growth categories grew over 13%. While our Win Where We Are categories declined about 4%, driven entirely by D\u00e9cor.","Underpinning our performance are some notable achievements. Our Industrial Products & Services business continued to drive strong core sales growth both domestically and abroad. After adjusting for SAP, Industrial Products & Services delivered their 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth.","Year-to-date, our Lenox brand core growth was well over 10%.","The IRWIN brand delivered its 7th consecutive quarter of greater than 5% core sales growth. We're seeing strong results from our IRWINization marketing and merchandising initiatives. Year-to-date, IRWIN core growth was nearly 10%.","In the U.S., new innovations on Graco are resonating with consumers. The Graco FastAction and Ready2Grow travel systems are driving significant market share gains. Graco's first half growth was over 10%.","In Japan, Aprica's success story continues. We're investing to sustain the momentum in the business as we anniversary the strong year ago growth and competitors respond to Aprica's significant share gains. Aprica has been our fastest growing brand in the first half, delivering strong double-digit core growth.","In Asia, our Fine Writing business continues to perform strongly. In Q2, we launched Parker Ingenuity with Parker 5th Technology in China while sustaining terrific growth across the balance of Asia. Parker delivered strong double-digit core growth in the first half in Asia.","Our Writing and Creative Expression brands are driving category growth in the U.S., outpacing the total category growth rates by more than 2 to 1.","Paper Mate has now taken the #2 share position in the total writing category in the U.S. as a result of the terrific success of Paper Mate InkJoy. Globally, both Sharpie and Paper Mate delivered over 5% core growth in the first half.","As I mentioned earlier, we're also making good progress on our change agenda.","In Q2, we successfully went live on SAP in Europe and are operating in an EPC model as of early April.","Our team submitted to the transition extremely well, and we expect to be back to normal merchandising levels in the back half of the year.","In the U.S., we continued to build out our new customer development organization. We've seen some early wins, most notably an Office Depot Rubbermaid partnership under which Rubbermaid storage products will be sold nationwide at Office Depot retail stores and online.","On the cost side, our Project Renewal efforts are on track to deliver $90 million to $100 million of savings by the first half of 2013.","In Q2, we rationalized capacity by closing a significant Rubbermaid Consumer facility. We're also executing distribution-centric consolidations in Rubbermaid Consumer and Rubbermaid Commercial. The benefits from these efforts will start flowing through the P&L in Q3.","Beyond Project Renewal, we're starting to see the early read-through of savings from our initiative to reduce indirect procurement spend. Our goal is to reduce indirect procurement cost by $50 million in the U.S. by the end of 2013, and we have made significant progress against that goal in the first half.","We've also identified $100 million in working capital savings over the next 3 years. SAP is a key enabler to better working capital management. And with over 80% of our business now on SAP, I feel confident that we have the tools to work more efficiently and free up trapped cash for more productive uses.","On balance, we have good visibility and made progress on costs. And we began to reinvest some of these benefits into our selling systems on our Win Bigger categories in Latin America in Q2. We expect the pace of reinvestment to pick up in the second half of the year as we develop new e-brand building digital assets on a number of key businesses.","So we delivered good first half results, and I hope you feel as good as we do that we're getting the business into a more consistent and predictable cadence of delivery.","Let me now make a few comments on the balance of the year. As a reminder, we've guided full year core sales to increase between 2% to 3%, normalized operating margin to increase up to 20 basis points, normalized EPS to increase 3% to 6% or in the $1.63 to $1.69 range, and operating cash flow between $550 million and $600 million.","As I've said, given our first half results, we are reaffirming our full year guidance. There are 4 key factors that could influence where we fall in our guidance range.","The first factor is our performance on our Writing & Creative Expression brands through the back-to-school season. We are very well positioned for an excellent back-to-school season with a stronger Q2 sell-in than last year, better merchandising placements and good U.S. market share momentum on Paper Mate, Sharpie and Expo.","The customer development teams and our retail partners have put together a good set of plans. Of course, we need the consumer to convert our merchandising placements to purchase, and then we need our customers to place replenishment orders for our business to see the revenue benefit in the P&L. Remember, the back-to-school formula for success is strong sell-in, plus great sell-through, plus strong replenishment, that equals great Q2 and great Q3 in Writing & Creative Expression. If any of those variables are off, the season is off.","Sell-in Q2 was stronger than prior year, and the merchandising placements are stronger as well. So far, 1.5 boxes checked out of 3. We need to see sell-through and replenishment. Our guidance assumes we checked all 3 boxes. The merchandising season is just kicking into high gear, so we'll find out soon enough.","The second factor influencing full year delivery is the continued recovery of our direct core business and the speed with which JCP migrates gear sets to their new merchandising vision. Our full year guidance assumes positive resolution of our operational issues in Q3, and we are largely there with all of our service metrics back to standard as we speak. We have assumed in our guidance that the adverse impact of the changes at JCP persist until they activate their new strategy in our categories next year.","The third factor is the macroeconomic environment in Europe. Conditions have worsened through Q2, and were a little more difficult than we anticipated when we most recently spoke in May at the Analyst Day.","The most significant impact is in our European Fine Writing business, where traditional stationary stores, which make up nearly 40% of our Fine Writing business, are under real pressure. We expect the European pressure on Fine Writing to continue into the second half of the year, but to not worsen.","The fourth factor that could influence where we fall in the guidance range is foreign exchange. Through mid-year, we've experienced about $0.01 of adverse EPS impact from ForEx, about $0.02 better than what we originally anticipated. Our guidance assumes the last few days' rates hold for the balance of the year. If they do, EPS will be adversely impacted by about $0.02 more in the second half of the year than what we were anticipating when we previously guided.","So rather than flowing about $0.03 negative in the first half and about $0.02 negative in the second half, the ForEx impact was about $0.01 negative in the first half and will be about $0.04 negative in the second half with the skew to Q3.","Importantly, when the ForEx pressure just mentioned is coupled with the reversal of our Q3 2011 management incentive plan true-up of about $0.04, which I've mentioned in our previous earnings calls, our ability to deliver Q3 2012 EPS growth versus prior year becomes really difficult.","All that said, we have a number of positive things happening in the business and despite the challenges and uncertainties articulated, we continue to have good visibility to cost and earnings and continue to suggest that the middle of all 4 of our full year guidance ranges reflect our balanced view of what we can achieve in 2011.","With that, let me hand over to Juan for a more detailed look at the numbers.","Juan R. Figuereo","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Net sales for the quarter were $1.5 billion, a 1.9% decrease versus the prior year.","Core sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, increased 0.4% or a 2.3% increase after adjusting for the EMEA SAP pre-buy.","In North America, net sales grew 2.2%, and core sales grew 2.5%, led by very strong growth in our Professional and Baby & Parenting segments.","The Consumer segment's North American core sales were essentially flat in the quarter as challenges in the D\u00e9cor business were offset by stronger back-to-school sell-in.","Outside North America, net sales decreased 13.1% or 5.4% excluding ForEx.","Both Latin America and APAC, which as you know are priority growth markets for us, delivered another quarter of double-digit core sales growth, with Latin America increasing 14.9% and APAC increasing 12%.","In EMEA, core sales declined 20.9% mainly due to the SAP implementation, including the previously mentioned pre-buy, plus the temporary halt in merchandising efforts related to the cutover period, all exacerbated by the impact of the worsening tough macro environment in Western Europe.","Gross margin was 38.3%, representing 50 basis point improvement over the prior year ago quarter. Pricing and productivity more than offset a 90 basis point negative impact from input costs inflation.","Normalized SG&A expense decreased $4 million compared with the prior year and on a percentage of sales basis, increased 20 basis points to 24.7%. A stronger dollar drove $10 million of the expense decrease.","On a constant currency basis, SG&A spending was up $6 million, all driven by strategic spend which rose 40 basis points as a percentage of sales. The increased spending focused on demand creation activities in focused growth areas.","Sales force expansion in the Newell Professional segment, where we are showing continued strong growth trends was one of those focus areas. And in our Consumer segment, support for the launch of InkJoy and geographic expansion in the Writing business was another.","Reported operating margin of 12.2% compares to 12.7% in the prior year. The decline is due to increased restructuring and related costs arising from Project Renewal, which started flowing through the P&L in Q4 of 2011. Operating margin for the quarter on a normalized basis increased 40 basis points to 13.7%, driven by gross margin expansion.","Interest expense for the quarter was $20.5 million, compared with $21.3 million in the previous year, which was slightly higher than anticipated due to the timing of debt issuance related to the redemption of $437 million in outstanding junior convertible subordinated debentures related to our 5.25% quarterly income preferred securities, most often referred to as QUIPS.","","During the quarter, we issued $500 million of medium-term notes in 2 tranches: $250 million of 2% 3-year notes and another $250 million of 4% 10-year notes.","We also initiated the redemption of the QUIPS in Q2 and completed this transaction in early Q3. This refinancing will improve our cost of borrowing over the term of the notes and eliminate any potential earnings dilution associated with the convertible feature of these securities. We anticipate annualized interest savings of approximately $0.02 per diluted share as a result of this transaction.","Due to the negative carried costs during the notice period, the benefit in 2012 is expected to be less than $0.01 per share.","The reported tax rate for the quarter of 32% represents a 17-percentage-point increase over the prior year. The increase primarily relates to discrete items recorded in each period. In the current quarter, we recorded $11 million in tax charges for the impact of the European transformation plant had on our tax reserves and valuation allowances. We expect to recognize approximately $7 million in additional related tax charges during the back half of the year.","As you may recall, the last year rate includes a $0.07 per diluted share tax benefit related to the reversal of tax contingencies due to the expiration of various worldwide statutes of limitation. Our normalized tax rate in the second quarter was 25.8%, compared with 26% in the prior year quarter.","Operating cash flow in the quarter was $103.1 million or a $10.3 million improvement over the prior year quarter, mainly due to lower non-operating working capital.","We are making good progress on our working capital initiatives with a notable 3 days reduction in inventory versus the prior year.","Our progress against payables will begin to show in our DPO in the second half as there are some temporary items that are impacting progress in Q2.","We returned $54 million to shareholders in the form of $29.1 million in dividends and $24.9 million paid for the repurchase of 1.4 million shares.","We have repurchased 5.7 million shares at an aggregate cost of $87.4 million since inception of the program in the third quarter of 2011.","Turning now to our 2012 Outlook. As Mike covered earlier, we are reaffirming our full year guidance. We expect full year core sales growth of 2% to 3%. With the dollar strengthening against currencies, we're now increasing the expected foreign currency translation impact on sales for the year to an estimated negative 2%.","This assumes average exchange rates for the balance of the year remain around recent spot rates.","We anticipate normalized operating margin to expand by up to 20 basis points. This guidance reflects our expectation that we will generate gross margin improvement as productivity, improved product mix and pricing more than offset inflation and that we increase strategic SG&A spend to support our growth game plan.","We expect interest expense to come in slightly below $80 million, with debt reduction to occur in the second half of the year.","Our normalized full year effective tax rate for 2012 is projected to be around 26%.","We expect 2012 normalized earnings per diluted share between $1.63 and $1.69, or about 3% to 6% growth.","This EPS guidance excludes between $110 million and $130 million, or $0.27 to $0.32 per diluted share, of planned restructuring and restructuring related costs associated with the European transformation plan and Project Renewal, as well as $18 million or $0.06 per diluted share, related to the 2012 cash tax charges expected to be recorded for the European transformation plan.","Although we still expect about $0.05 per share of unfavorable foreign exchange, we now believe the timing of that impact will be largely realized in the back half of the year.","Operating cash flow is expected to be between $550 million and $600 million for the full year, including $110 million to $120 million in restructuring and restructuring related cash payment.","Capital expenditures are projected at $200 million to $225 million.","In summary, with Q2 behind us, in spite of tougher macros in Western Europe, our financial outlook on the year remains essentially unchanged.","As is always the case in business, we've had some puts and takes. We're more challenged in certain areas than we initially expected, namely in foreign exchange, in Europe due to the macro issues and in our D\u00e9cor business.","But we also have good momentum in other parts of the portfolio, including Baby, and in the majority of our Professional business.","So at this point, we believe the risks and opportunities are relatively even balanced. And if things play out the way we see them today, that should put us somewhere in the middle of our guidance metrics for the full year.","So in conclusion with our strategy in the early days but gaining momentum, our first half results give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk","Thanks, Juan. It's hard for me to really believe that a year has passed since I started in this role. Time has just really flown by. We packed a lot in, and I think there's a lot of be proud of.","Despite a very tough environment, operational issues on Baby and D\u00e9cor, SAP implementation in Europe and the change associated with Project Renewal, over the past 12 months, we've delivered 3% core sales growth, expanded normalized operating margin by 50 basis points and increased normalized EPS by 10.7%.","In the same time frame, we've strengthened the balance sheet by paying down $0.5 billion of bond maturities, increased our access to credit at attractive terms through a new $800 million revolving credit facility, improved the capital structure of the company by refinancing our QUIPS at more favorable rates and deployed a more tax-efficient business model into Europe.","We also increased the dividend payout by nearly 53% versus the prior 12 months and returned an additional $87 million to shareholders through our new $300 million, 3-year share repurchase authorization.","These outcomes are a credit to the team and demonstrate that we're capable of delivering results, driving change and creating value for our shareholders.","All that said, my focus is on the future. I am clear today that the possibilities for Newell Rubbermaid are greater than I imagined when I first took the role last July. My confidence in our ability to play for the upside strengthens with every hurdle we clear.","I don't expect an easy ride given the state of the global economy. And as a result, we'll continue to assume and build plans that contemplate tough macroeconomic times ahead.","Of course, the big picture for Newell stretches well beyond macro pressures with the quarter-to-quarter issues in the business. The strategic opportunity, which is captured in the growth gain plan, is significant. And the ambition to build a larger faster-growing, more global, more profitable Newell Rubbermaid is there for the taking.","There's no doubt we're on our way, but there's much more to do. We've only just begun to build out our geographic footprint to the faster-growing emerging markets. We're only getting started on the exciting possibilities of e-commerce and e-brand building. We've only had our new customer development teams in place for a few months, and they're just beginning to make an impact.","And our brands and innovations are hungry for support. When we get the support on our businesses at the right level and in the right way, we see great results. So a good start for sure, but much more opportunity ahead of us than behind us.","The growth game plan has been cascaded deep into our organization and will shape our agenda over the next number of years. It's about activating a clear set of portfolio of choices, reigniting the entrepreneurialism that's in the heart of every one of our brands and building 2 towering capabilities of equal stature -- one focused on the development of our growth ideas and the other focused on execution and creating commercial value from those ideas in the marketplace.","To activate this growth agenda, we need to continue to release the trapped capacity for growth. We've taken the first step to simplifying our organization with Project Renewal, but we need to continue to drive out costs that do not create demand. There is a significant opportunity here, and where we have attractive cost reduction ideas that yield a good return and enable more of our resources to be invest invested in growth and strengthened capabilities, we are going to take them.","You've seen in our near in plans many of those ideas over the last 12 months and there will be more to share. Releasing the traffic capacity for growth is inextricably linked to our opportunity to accelerate results and drive shareholder returns to higher levels.","As I hope you can tell, I'm excited about playing for the upside at Newell. We've laid out a clear and aggressive strategy. Now it's all about decisive leadership, strengthened execution and the deployment of the right resources to drive the growth game plan into action.","With that, let me open it up to questions.","Nancy O'Donnell","[Operator Instructions] So operator, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My first question. Can you give us just some color on what you think the SG&A ratio for the year is as a percentage of sales?","Michael B. Polk","We've said we're going to -- we may end up anywhere between 25.5% and 26%. I think 26% is what we've said the last time we talked. We're sort of right in line with that through the first half. I think our SG&A ratio in the first half is about 25.9%.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up, kind of unrelated. But is there any change -- have you seen any change in either sell-in or sell-through patterns towards the end of the quarter, early into July?","Michael B. Polk","We had a little bit of stronger sell-in to back-to-school on Writing & Creative Expression than we did last year. One of our customers made the choice to take their back-to-school -- a portion of their back-to-school inventories earlier than we did last year.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then no change in the sell-through?","Michael B. Polk","It's too early to know in back-to-school. I mean, we're just really kicking in now. I'm -- look, I think the headlines here are, we've got better sell-in than we had last year. We've got better share momentum on the 3 big brands that will get merchandised heavily in back-to-school season, which is Sharpie, Paper Mate and Expo. In fact, our writing shares as a percent of the total writing market are up nearly 150 basis points in the first half of the year. And Paper Mate went from being the #3 brand in the total writing category to the #2 brand in that total writing category in the first half. And we have that momentum sustained right through, right through the month of June the last share numbers I saw. So we're coming into back-to-school, and we have better merchandising placements, better -- higher displays, et cetera. So we're better positioned. But as you know, it's about converting all that stuff that you do upfront to purchase from the consumer, and then it's about our retailers' point of view on their inventory positions as to whether we get replenishment orders after the back-to-school season. So there's a lot to unfold over the next 3 or 4 weeks, 5 weeks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Mike, I think you said that the impact of the lower merchandising on the European business was 2%, right? So it was down 4. It would have been sort of down 2 without the extra merchandising. Can you talk a little bit about sort of how you're layering the normal level of merchandising back in? And sort of following up on Bill's question, are you seeing any difference in the cadence over time in terms of European demand either on an underlying basis sort of either decelerating or accelerating from that standpoint?","Michael B. Polk","It's a good question. Remember, what I -- I think I've said this a couple of times along the way. We're not going to try to make up for lost merchandising from the first half of the year in the second half of the year. I don't want to do that because I worry about the competitive response to increased frequency of merchandising or greater depth of price points in the second half-year. So rather than have that money flip into the merchandising when we flip into the back half of the year to increase frequency, we're just going to get back into our normal rhythm. And we are -- I think we'll be fine in terms of being back in that rhythm we are right now than we will through the third quarter and into the fourth year.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then sort of any sort of the change in cadence over the course of the quarter or into the third quarter in Europe or is it just all pretty much...","Michael B. Polk","The only underlying -- look, there's a lot of pressure in Europe. And as you recall, our sort of underlying declines are around 3% to 3.5% as we exited last year and into the first quarter. Part of it -- part of the issue in the optics of our numbers in Q2 have to do with the SAP pull forward. So you don't have to -- I wouldn't overreact to the double-digit decline in EMEA that you see. So if you adjust out for that, it's about an 8% decline in the quarter. A portion of that has to do with the lack of merchandising. It's not a small amount, so roughly in line with what you said, about 2 percentage points. We have some timing things that happened at the end of the quarter. We didn't shift the last 3 days of Q2 in Europe as part of our SAP transition in the first hard close in an EPC environment. So part of that is artificially -- has artificially pressured our results in Q2, as well as in EMEA. But the fact is that we have some underlying issues in Europe related to the macros, and they are most acute in our Fine Writing business. And what's interesting about it is it's the smaller stores, so that represents probably about 40% of our revenue in Europe, and it's actually the price points that are less than $100, where we're having the issues. And it makes intuitive sense if you think about it. If you're a wealthy person in Europe, you have money to spend. So if you want to buy a $250 or $300 pen, you can. And our business looks fine in that segment. Our under $100 offerings are sort of tweeners. It's the best way to describe it between everyday writing instruments and prestige writing instruments. And that's where the pressure is. And those tend to get sold at some of the smaller stationary stores, which represents about 40% of our business. That piece of our business is really feeling the heat. And that accelerated in the first half of the year. And we've in our guidance range, contemplated that for the back half. But that's something we need to figure out because at the moment, despite really strong double-digit growth in Asia on our prestige Fine Writing business, we're losing it all, giving it all back in Europe on this sort of mid-tier segment that's under pressure. And that's a real issue. That's going to cost our roughly 3.5% underlying performance to be worse as it was towards the second half of Q2. And we have made the assumption that, that carries forward with us into the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I wanted to move to the U.S. And very recently, we've heard a lot of discretionary -- semi-discretionary companies talk about this cadence that Bill and John were referencing except more in the U.S., right, falling off and you've seen demand destruction. And I noticed kind of in the 4 things you named for what would affect where you landed in your guidance, the U.S. wasn't one of them or U.S. macro wasn't one of them. And frankly, your U.S. macro or your U.S. growth accelerated this quarter, right? So exclusive of back-to-school, like, I get back-to-school sell-in was good, but generally, your categories, your businesses outside of back-to-school, I mean, what are you seeing in the U.S.?","Michael B. Polk","Look, part of our professional momentum is driven out of excellent execution on industrial products and services in the Irwin brand, so Lenox and Irwin, in the U.S. And so we've seen strengthened momentum there. Some -- and we have continued momentum on Rubbermaid Medical, good double-digit growth. I really didn't call that out. And then of course, I think the positive data in the second quarter -- the most positive data in the U.S. in the second quarter has got to be our Baby performance, where we're seeing very good consumption gains and share gains despite all the headlines you read. I don't know if you saw the report this morning on birth rates, some negative report on birth rates in the U.S. suggesting they're at the lowest levels in 25 years. So despite that, and I honestly -- some of these macro issues I tend to -- European things are really acute. But things like the birth rate data, that's just sort of the cost of doing business. So your brand has got to carry the day. You have to have better innovations. And we are starting to see that. So I think the U.S. -- I'm pleased with the U.S. results. We need the U.S. to perform well, and we're getting that from Baby and from Professional. We've got some challenges in the Consumer segment aside from our Writing & Creative businesses -- Creative Expression businesses, and that's largely in D\u00e9cor. But I can't say that I'm disappointed. I'm actually pleased, and I think part of this is a reflection of the strength of our brands, and part of it is the impact -- the early impact of the CDO.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And again, I guess, as an unrelated follow-up, I get -- like, it's obviously currency, you're offsetting that drag. Can you talk about commodities. How was your outlook on commodities changed from last quarter to this quarter? And I'm sorry if you've said it already.","Michael B. Polk","No, I mean we've got a slight improvement in our resin outlook for the back half of the year, but we still believe we're going to experience about 100 basis points of inflation in the back half, an adverse impact in gross margin. And while resins more favorable, we continue to have pressure in metals and source goods and in the other commodities that we're dealing with, like paper in the packaging. But yes, moderated because remember, we talked about at the beginning of the year about 150 basis points of negative impact in gross margin related to inflation. Back half of the year, we'll be closer to 100 as resin inflation has moderated. The thing about our resin -- the resin impact for us is we think we see some benefit in Q3, but we don't see much benefit in Q4, at least in our outlook. And the other thing to note is we lose the pricing leverage in gross margin as we move through Q3 into Q4 because remember, most of our pricing benefit in gross margin relates to 2011 pricing actions and the carryforward of that. So I think our comparisons get a little easier on gross margin in the back half of the year. I think our gross margin is about where we would hope it would be. I'm pleased with it, the progress. And we're going to need to count on productivity mix and strategic pricing where we can get it to compensate for what will still be about 100 basis points of inflation in the second half in gross margin, albeit less than what we have originally anticipated. On your ForEx point, Chris, I mean, the thing to note on ForEx is that we're in the range that we suggested we would be on the full year. We said there would be about $0.04 to $0.05 of impact when we guided back in -- when we first guided back in January. We actually did better on the ForEx line in the first half year, so some of our EPS overdelivery in the first half is related to -- to relative to our forecast -- is related to a more favorable or a less -- the best way to say it, it's a less negative impact in the first half than we've originally anticipated. So it's about $0.01 of adverse ForEx impact in the first half. The dollar has strengthened since late April, pretty substantially. And I know it's bouncing around quite a bit; it bounces around every day. But part of that favorability reverses out -- part of that first half favorability versus the guidance reverses out in the second half. And that's why I've said the flow sort of shifts. We anticipated $0.03 adverse in the first half, $0.02 adverse in the second half in EPS. And it's really -- it's likely to end up if things hold as they are today, $0.01, $0.04.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I would actually just follow up on Chris's question. As you look at commodities for next year, I mean, is there a tailwind? Are you looking into kind of locking in some of the costs now? Or are you just going to wait as the year progresses?","Michael B. Polk","We've got a pretty -- and I mentioned this, Bill. You and I have talked about this a little bit, and I mentioned this on prior calls. We've got a pretty sophisticated resin buying office here, given the amount of resin that we buy. And so we'll leverage all the options at our disposal, that are financially prudent for us to leverage. We're not going to -- I don't want to be in the trading business or take the risks associated being in the trading business. But I'm quite happy with the way our resin commodities are bought. The thing that -- it's more of a drag on us at the moment, it's our source goods inflation. And if you recall from earlier conversations we've had, we had a bunch of contracts that expired, that were long-term contracts, at the beginning of the year, and we had to lock in at higher labor rates. And so as a result, you end up with an inflation impact on our source goods that flows through the full year. And I think at some point, you may want to lay out a little more detail how significant our source goods are in cost of goods because it's a pretty important variable for us. And when we have inflation there, we end up with a pretty significant impact on the total company.","Juan R. Figuereo","So the source goods will be about half of the inflationary pressure on the second half. It's quite significant. And on the -- so on the buy forward, Bill, just to be clear, we do go out -- we typically don't go out more than once a year. We usually go longer on the metals because that's where you have the exchange trade of metals. You can go longer. The resin tend to be shorter, but this year, we have done some into next year.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Great. And just a following-up. We're still kind of new to the 3 categories of Incubate, Win Where We Are, and I guess, Win Everywhere. I'm just trying to understand...","Michael B. Polk","All the time. It's where we wanted to be, Bill. It's Win Where We Are, it's Incubate, and it's Win Bigger.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I mean, how should we look at the fact that Incubate was the fastest growing this quarter? I mean, in particular, at some point there's infant -- Baby and Infant kind of get out of the Incubate category. Are they out of the woods? And should I worry that one is growing faster than the other in a given quarter?","Michael B. Polk","No, I mean there are couple of -- there's a bunch of businesses in there. I mean, Baby is by far the biggest piece of our Incubate categorization. And as you recall, we put Baby in there for a different reason than we put the other ones in there. We put the Endicia and Mimio and Rubbermaid Medical in there because they really are ventures and we don't want them subsumed into the operations of their bigger parents. So we want them insulated so that they can build their repeatable growth models. And they're doing well. Double-digit growth on Rubbermaid Medical. Very, very strong growth on Endicia, which is a competitor to Stamps.com. Great business. We were just out there in Palo Alto. And then Mimio's dealing with all the headwinds associated with the pullback in municipal investment associated with budget management, et cetera, in the education space. So we've got 3 different businesses that are insulated as incubators. And then we've got Baby there. And we put Baby there because it needed an intervention. And we made that intervention both at the management team level and then in the reporting structure. So we brought it directly into me, and I've gotten closer to that business than I am in other businesses as a result of the problems we had in the first half of last year. Strategically, I expect us to leave it there for the foreseeable future because despite our efforts to get it back into recovery, which we are going to be able to do, we have a challenge in our portfolio which is because of the margin structure in this business, you would not make a big investment behind it if it caused you to mortgage other Win Bigger categories, like our Professional portfolio and our Writing portfolio, for the sake of developing the business outside of the markets that it's in. So obviously, I'd love to play for China on Baby -- 18 million births versus a 3 million here. But until we get that structurally shifted, it needs to stay where it is and we need to figure out how to unlock that opportunity because otherwise, we won't play for that Chinese opportunity in as big a way as we could. So that's why it sits in Incubate because it requires a strategic intervention. It required both an operational intervention, which Kristie and her team are well on their way on. But for the long haul, it requires a strategic intervention because even with double-digit OI margins, which we are beginning to get towards, big step changes in operating income margins, which I'm pleased with and Kristie and the team deserve terrific credit, so does our partner for enabling and helping us to get there. But for us to get and play for China, we need probably another 300, 400, 500 basis points of margin in this business. And so that's going to require a big shift and a real rethink. And that's what we -- that's why need to leave it in Incubate for the foreseeable future because we've got to get the recovery bedded down. And we can grow this business without doing what I just described. But if we really want to play it as the third leg of our Win Bigger strategic agenda, we have to find the different mechanism to change the dynamics there. And so that's why it is where it is and that's why I envision it staying in that categorization for the foreseeable future because it's going to take lot more work to get that piece of the puzzle figured out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the Baby conversation. So one, was just a surprise at it's still being so strong not just because you've sort of been fairly cautious after the last quarter. But we had thought there probably have been some effective pull forward just by virtue of how big the Walmart promotion was in Q1. So can you just talk a little bit about where the surprises were in North America this quarter? I know you're saying the birth rate -- you've got to grow regardless of what the birth rate is. But this is a dramatic change and not just -- you've got easy comps, but you also -- it is a really difficult sequential situation.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. We've got -- there's 2 things that have happened that were pleasing in the second quarter. Number 1, and I'll talk outside the U.S. for a second. In Q2 of 2011, we saw our first step-up in Aprica performance in Japan. And probably the most pleasing thing that occurred in Q2 to me as we lapped what was double-digit growth in the prior Q2 period, we delivered double-digit growth in the current period. So Aprica is on a roll. I mean, I think that's one headline I will give to you. I think it gets tougher as we move through Q3 into Q4 because we're beginning -- I was surprised that our competition hasn't responded very aggressively in Japan yet. And we know, through the normal ways you do competitive intelligence, that they're coming with some stuff in Q4. So we're going to have a tougher comp, not just driven by the year-ago comparisons, but as a result of in the back half of the year, stronger competition. All that said, I love what's going on in our Japanese Baby business. It's got a great leader there in Mayada-san [ph] working for a great leader in Kristie, and these guys are all over it. So I do think it gets a little bit tougher in the back half of the year, but I'm pleasantly surprised by the Q2 results on Aprica. I mean, there's other good news in Baby, which is the FastAction innovation and some of the other innovations we've got executing in and flowing into the marketplace in Q2 are having a good impact. Our POS is up in the U.S. pretty nicely in the second quarter. So yes, you're right, the Baby Days event was a Q1 event, which was earlier, but we've got -- and so Walmart had a very strong Q1, and hence the comp a less strong Q2. But we've got momentum in other places in the U.S. as a result of a really good effort on the part of the customer development organization and strong engagement from the leadership with their retail partners. And we have better innovation. So it's the fundamentals that are starting to kick in. Does competition respond more quickly in the U.S. than it did in Asia? Probably. It's a more dynamic market but on balance, we're feeling a little bit better about the first half. Now the only thing I would say about our first half performance is you should recall that the first half of 2011 is by far the easiest comp we're going to have. So we delivered 13% core sales growth in the first half of 2012, up against 12% declines in the first half of 2011. So it obviously gets harder from here. Q3 '11 was a down quarter, but not nearly as down as the first half of '11. And Q4 was an up quarter in 2011. And so, it gets tougher, but that's why we pay Kristie the big bucks.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just following up, the profitability there that you were speaking about on the last question, so how much of that do you think is really, like, operational improvement versus better volume leverage?","Michael B. Polk","It's combination of both. I mean, we've done a lot of things on the cost side and structural SG&A really quickly. We're not -- we haven't made a big bet on Baby. Whether we can hold double-digit operating income margin or not in the second half year on that business, actually don't worry about it because I want to make sure we invest to sustain the growth momentum there and get the fixed cost leverage. So we'll see what happens in the second half year, but we're going to start to spend a little bit more behind this business because we have better innovation coming. We actually have better innovation coming at the end of this year into Europe as well. So if you look at our business, 3 geographies really matter. It's North America, it's Asia, but that's really Japan, and it's Europe. 2 of the 3 are beginning to do really well. One is doing extremely well. One is beginning to get its sea legs, that's North America. Europe is still a drag on the business, and that's going to continue until we get to the end of the year when we get the innovation out. But I want to make sure we're spending enough to make that innovation land with impact and so we may give a little bit it back on operating income margin on that business in the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions, actually. First, just wanted to go back to the U.S. for second. And I know you guys have touched on this a little bit earlier in the call. But in terms of what you saw on the part of your retailers and their willingness to carry inventory either late in 2Q, early 3Q, have you noticed an increased cautiousness there at all?","Michael B. Polk","Look, I mean, we -- as you know, Joe, the thing that impacts revenue is the change in the change in inventory behavior, not just the inventory pressure. There's always inventory pressure on businesses because retailers are -- their key metric is return on the invested capital, so it's obviously an important thing for them to leverage. There, the drum beats out there. I think the negative headlines on the macros tend to cause retailers to be more cautious. And there we've seen at points in time where our -- because we have visibility to this. We have POS data. We know what our retail sales are by customer. We know what our inventory positions are by customer. When we get out of balance, we see retailers adjusting to get us back in balance so that the rate of inventory growth relative to the rate of sales growth is in sync. So there's -- in any given moment, you've got those normal fluctuations going on. There are some retailers that are pressing harder in Q2 on inventories, but I don't like to talk about it unless it's a huge deal. We felt that a bit in our D\u00e9cor business, and we felt that a bit in our Cookware business. And I suspect in both of those categories in the second half of the year, we'll see and feel that kind of pressure continue. But it will be a question mark on Writing & Creative Expression, and it will be reflected in the replenishment orders we get post back-to-school as to whether the office superstores and the mass guys who have taken strong positions upfront, whether they are as confident in the category sustaining its growth rate going beyond back-to-school. And that will influence the choices they make. So we have to be prepared for that risk at the end of Q3 and into Q4 in Writing & Creative Expression. And we can't control it, so we just try to manage the sell-in against what we think the sell-through is going to be, so that we get the consumption to play out and we get that balance, such that we get the replenishment orders. But it's not science; it's art. And we can get that wrong, and we won't know how that story is going to play out until the consumption, the sell-through, occurs in the month of August into the middle of September.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then on the SG&A line, the strategic investment this quarter, I think it was up 40 bps. It was up 90 bps in the first quarter. What are you expecting for the second half and what's baked into your guidance?","Michael B. Polk","We don't guide on -- and I haven't really commented, Joe, on the forward-looking numbers. That said, we've begun to invest renewal savings in the second quarter behind selling systems in Latin America, largely on the Professional business, but also on Writing in Brazil. And we will begin to broaden that investment to include the investment behind the creation of new digital assets for our e-brand building and e-commerce initiatives in the Consumer segment. But I'm cautious about going hog wild on that investment until I see how the macros play out. I'm more conservative here than maybe you guys think I am. I'm not going to throw the money out there until I'm really sure. Now that said, I would expect strategic SG&A to be up in the second half of the year versus prior year. The one thing I would say in some of those numbers is you have to remember that part of that will reflect the true-up dynamics on our management incentive programs versus prior year. So it's not all working money because remember, our product marketing folks and our selling resources are in strategic SG&A. So last year, we paid out our bonuses very low. We've got the true-up that's in our back half numbers in the third quarter, and that a part of that, not all of it, but a part of that is sitting in strategic SG&A. So some of the increases that you might see will be sort of artifacts of that dynamic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I just would like to go through looking at the Professional and Baby & Parenting. You had revenue increases in Professional from quarter to quarter, from first quarter to second quarter, and flat in Baby & Parenting. And yet the operating income in each declined, so the contribution pull-through didn't look like it was there. Can you kind of maybe give us a little bit of drill-down as to where that was and what caused the operating income to decline in each of those?","Michael B. Polk","Yes, I think the thing to remember, Budd, is that on the reported numbers, you have the SAP effect, so you have the revenue that has been shifted. And the gross profit, obviously, that was connected to that revenue shifted from Q2 to Q1. But to be -- so that's a big chunk of it and probably the most significant chunk of it on Baby. On Tools, though, we are investing in selling systems -- on Professional, sorry, we're investing in selling systems, largely in Latin America -- Brazil on our Tools business, across Latin America on IP&S, in China on IP&S in Latin America on Commercial. And we are also putting some money behind Rubbermaid Medical in terms of selling resources in the U.S. So the drag on operating income margin, once you net out the SAP effect on the Professional portfolio, is related to those investments. And that's part of that Renewal money that's going into that.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So just to be clear, if I parse those out of the expenses into gross profit or cost of goods sold and SG&A, you're saying in Professional, it's basically the strategic SG&A investment that's building it? In Baby & Parenting, it was a reduction in gross margin due to the SAP shift? Is that the way to look at it?","Michael B. Polk","Yes -- no, gross margin didn't go down. It's absolute -- it's about the absolute -- it's about the fixed cost leverage of not having the revenue and gross profit dollars in Q2 on Baby. On Professional, it's a combination of that and what I described as the incremental SG&A that we put -- strategic SG&A that we put behind the business.","So it's 2 things on the Professional portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mike, I guess, I just want to first talk about -- I know the layout of the year was the first and fourth quarters are going to be strongest. So from a sales perspective and the kind of the buckets that you've laid out for some of the incremental pressures, it feels like the third quarter sales will probably come in a little bit lighter than expectations just because of the D\u00e9cor business and the turnaround there. So as you think to the fourth quarter on the Consumer side, are there any incremental merchandising plans that you have in place? And I guess, what gives you that confidence that the sales can really accelerate, especially when you have the toughest comp? And then I just have a couple of follow-ups.",":p id=\"79344716\" name=\"Michael Polk\" type=\"E\" \/>","Yes, I mean we've got a good underlying share momentum in our businesses for the most part. So if I look -- I think that's one of the big contributors on the Consumer side as to why you'd expect the momentum to continue. Remember, InkJoy just began to sell in the second half of the year. So we've got some dynamics like that, that are positive. We've got a dynamic on Calphalon, where we have to lap the inventory pipeline on JCPenney. And we've got the JCPenney issues on D\u00e9cor that will be offsets to that. We've got good merchandising plans set on Rubbermaid Consumer. Remember, we were shutting down one of the big Rubbermaid Consumer factories and moving machinery from Texas to Kansas and Ohio in the second quarter. So we weren't really pressing that business very hard because you disrupt availability. And we've created capacity dynamic. And the service issue we wouldn't want to do. So we've got that transition, which in the factory landscape that we've executed in Q2 that's behind us so we have a little bit more flexibly on Rubbermaid Consumer in the second half of the year. And I would expect us to be able to deliver some more progress. So I mean, there's a lot of different moving parts in our numbers. And then we've got Baby momentum. So Baby is certainly stronger than a year ago in Q3, and we'll have to see about Q4 how that plays out.","We don't buy by quarter, Jason, as you know, but I think that we should -- you should think about what we said with respect to our full year guidance along those 4 -- along the 4 different metrics that we guide on. And hopefully, we can do a little bit better on some of them. But at this point, I think that's a good reference point.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. And then I'm wondering if you could provide some update on One Newell. I know that's probably a couple of months under your belt, but maybe just some of the wins, some of the learnings along the way that have come in maybe better than expected?","Michael B. Polk","Yes, so with Project Renewal is the first step in simplifying our structures, and we're seeing the benefits of that beginning to flow through. We did some important things that were tough for the organization in Q4 and into Q1 of 2013 on the GBU architecture and group design. And those are largely done and behind us. We then shifted our focus in Q2 to the manufacturing and distribution center component of Project Renewal. And we've done the factory closure, which obviously, was quite traumatic in Texas for people. And we've moved the equipment now and are starting up that equipment in Kansas and in Ohio, in those factories. And that's been exciting and disruptive but positive. And so we're focused on the manufacturing distribution center side of things. And then we've got some more to do to close off Renewal in the back half of the year and into next year to put a punctuation point on that. That's Project Renewal. When we talk to you about One Newell initiatives, that's above and beyond Project Renewal. And what that's about is about improving the indirect procurement costs in our business and getting on with the working capital opportunities. And that is nothing to do with restructuring. That has to do with really tightening down on how we spend our money. One piece of that is the indirect procurement partnership that we formed with IBM to access their $50 billion buying pool, and that's focused on U.S. indirect procurement, which if you recall, is $1.2 billion of spend. And that's where we said we would expect to get $50 million of savings by 2013. We're making great progress there. I'm really happy with the work and the team that's leading it and the energy that it's created within the total organization. And the working capital opportunity that Juan talked about at Analyst Day, we're just beginning to get into. I'm pleased with our inventory management in the first half of the year. It's down $70 million versus prior year, and that's because we're focused on it, and part of our incentive schemes are focused on quarterly delivery of improvements. And so we're really kind of wiring that one down, and we're making some good progress on payables. As we exit Q2 into Q3, Q4, we'll make some good progress on payables as we put some new programs in place there. And so all those things are playing out. And we have a lot more work to do in both areas, so I don't want to -- I think it's premature to suggest that we're anywhere near. Just kind of making it down, in a 100-yard sprint, we're sort of in the 20-yard line on indirect procurement, probably on the 10-yard line on the working capital. But that's fallen out and it's -- I think the organization sees the opportunity and smells it. We're all on the same incentive schemes, so that we have skin in the game on the outcome, everyone of us. And so we're all pulling the oars in the same direction to make it happen.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My follow-up is already answered.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer period.

After a brief discussion by management, we will open up the call for questions. In order to stay within the time schedule for the call, please limit yourself to one question during the Q&A session.","As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellbrands.com on the Investor Relations home page under Events & Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download.","I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, SVP of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Newell Brands third quarter conference call. On our call today are Mike Polk, Newell's CEO and Ralph Nicoletti, our Chief Financial Officer.","During the call, we will make statements about our expectations for future financial and operating performance. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties.","I point you to our press release issued today and our most recent SEC filings for a list of some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update these statements.","I'd also like to point out that we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures to the extent available. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is shown in the press release and is available on our website.","Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thank you. Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. This is my 25th quarterly earnings call as Newell's CEO and we clearly have not had a quarter like this before.","The third quarter was chock-full of contradictions. On the positive side, we had broad-based market share growth in our most important U.S. market with share growth on writing instruments, glue, labeling, outdoor and recreation equipment, beverages, fragrance, baby gear, food storage, fresh preserving, vacuum sealing, fishing and team sports. We also had strong double-digit e-commerce growth across the entire portfolio and another quarter of strong cost synergies and savings with a new organization that's coming together and growing as a team.","On the opposite side, we had force majeure in our largest supply network, driving inflation with no time to price to recover margin. We had a top customer bankruptcy, forcing a future re-plan on one of our best performing businesses. We had unrelenting retailer inventory destocking, creating a headwind for revenue as our retail partners adjust to slowing market growth and changes in shopping patterns. You name it, we experienced it this quarter.","From a selling perspective, what started out as one of our best quarters in a long while in July, took a sharp downward turn in September, resulting in just over $100 million revenue miss versus our expectations, with the big drivers being our U.S. Writing and Appliance businesses. Obviously, this is a disappointing outcome, and as CEO, I take full responsibility for these results.","To be clear, there's nothing in our Q3 experience that changes our perspective on our ability to realize the value creation opportunity inherent in Newell Brands, and we are focused and undeterred in our commitment and drive to do just that. That said, we need to accept the retail environment for what it is, recognizing the (4:04) this will create on growth going forward and adjust our work plans to accommodate that marketplace reality.","We will commit to consistently grow ahead of our markets, continuing to build market share in our key geographies, customers and channels. We will further heighten our work on cost and pricing to accelerate margin development, and we will aggressively reduce working capital in order to strengthen the delivery of cash. We will do this without compromising on our investment in innovation, brand building, e-commerce and design.","In the U.S., we've had a good market share performance. We delivered sell-out growth well above our markets with POS up 3.5%, yielding market share growth of 65 basis points. So our marketing activity and our work on brands, innovation and e-commerce appears to be working in our largest market.","The disconnect is obviously that sell-out is far above sell-in, with core sales in the U.S. down 70 basis points despite 3.5% sell-out growth, as retailers pullback on order rates and rebalanced inventories late in the quarter. This was particularly true in those retail channels where business models have been disrupted by shifting shopping patterns between brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. The impact was most significant in categories with relatively low e-commerce channel development.","The sales read-through to earnings compounded with the negative mix associated with Writing's contribution to the miss, drove the normalized EPS shortfall versus expectations.","Writing had the most significant impact on the quarter. We planned our writing instrument business to experience market growth equal to last year's Back-to-School of over 5% with an added benefit from share growth. Unlike other stationery categories such as paper, writing instrument e-commerce penetration in the U.S. is relatively underdeveloped, at only about 8% of the total category. As a consequence, the gross mix benefit of e-commerce was insufficient to offset brick-and-mortar market declines, resulting in flat writing instrument market growth in the quarter.","Despite continuing to build market share by just over 40 basis points, the effect of flat markets compromised sell-out performance versus our expectations. In this context, a number of retailers canceled late September Back-to-School replenishment orders and we will not get most of those orders back in the fourth quarter, as the channel continues to reset inventory levels.","As always, there is wide divergence in retailer performance in Back-to-School. Our revised outlook for the Writing contemplates continuing challenges, particularly in the office superstore channel. We will work together with our retail partners to ensure our spending is in line with their capacity to grow, and our funding is reaching the end consumer in the form of consumption-based programming.","Beyond Writing, our Appliance and Cookware business struggled in the quarter with market share declines and market weakness in a number of core product categories. Despite this emerging hotspot, we're confident we can create sequential improvement in this business. Through 2017, we've been investing to build a bigger, better Appliance and Cookware innovation funnel. The brands are very strong and the ideas look quite promising.","We've accelerated two big launches into the fourth quarter of 2017, and have a significant activation program in place on Crock-Pot. We also have a significant opportunity to strengthen our e-commerce presence on Appliances as we are underdeveloped versus our potential. Strengthened innovation and broadened e-commerce impact are what the business needs and these are core strengths of the Newell model.","On balance, the rest of our businesses performed pretty well in a difficult environment. Four of five segments and 10 of 15 divisions grew core sales. Our Latin American business grew over 11% and our Asia-Pacific business over 6%. Our top five customers, which represents about 30% of our global business, grew over 8% in the third quarter. E-commerce, which now represents 11% of our global business, grew strong double digits once again. And many of our divisions have excellent momentum. Baby grew over 10% in the third quarter, Waddington, Fishing, Food and Team Sports all grew mid-single digits with Food and Fishing making nice recoveries from the first half of the year.","Importantly, the Yankee Candle transition continued to progress well and we're confident it will lead to accelerated performance with broadened distribution in North American wholesale and continued renovation of our retail platform, with new personalization ideas for the holidays, the opening next week of the new pop-up concept store in Soho in Manhattan and the related launch of a direct to consumer micro-site that brings all of our brands together in an innovative new format for the holidays.","On the savings front, we continued to realize cost synergies with an incremental $86 million saved in the quarter. While those benefits, coupled with the lower than normal tax rate, were partially offset by the read through on the sales miss, commodity inflation, higher A&P and the absence of about $50 million of pre-tax earnings associated with divestitures, we still delivered double-digit earnings per share growth.","So in a tough environment, our third quarter results missed the mark. We take accountability for this. We did deliver, however, sell-out growth ahead of our markets, resulting in a U.S. market share increase of 65 basis points and we delivered 3.5% point-of-sale growth. Sell-in continued to be disconnected from sell-out, as market growth decelerated and retailers adjusted their inventories and order patterns. Many of our businesses performed well through that turbulence with our challenges largely focused in U.S. Writing and Appliances.","While our start to the fourth quarter looks very much like our start to the third quarter, with solid growth in the first month of October, we have reset guidance for the balance of 2017 to reflect an assumed negative impact associated with the Toys\"R\"Us restructuring on Baby, and continued Writing headwinds in select customers.","Our revised 2017 full year guidance is for net sales growth of over 11%, core sales growth of 1.5% to 2% and normalized EPS of $2.80 to $2.85. While we expect to continue to build share and consistently grow ahead of our markets, we now believe modest market growth and retailer headwinds will persist into the foreseeable future. We will more sharply align resources to winning customers and channels in this context in order to generate the greatest growth yield on our investment.","We have delivered the cost synergies and Renewal savings we committed to deliver, having achieved over $280 million of incremental savings year-to-date and continue to expect to deliver over $300 million next year. We're mobilizing to challenge our cost structure even further given more modest growth expectations, while simultaneously creating a new work stream to drive down working capital over the next 15 months, with the objective to strengthen earnings and cash delivery, effectively increasing the prioritization of margin development and cash delivery over that timeframe.","We will continue to invest to build our brands, to bring strong innovations to market and to strengthen our e-commerce operations, recognizing the strategic leverage in these advantaged capabilities. And we will continue to allocate capital, primarily to debt repayment as we drive to reach our target leverage ratio range by the end of 2018.","Despite our challenges in the moment, we're confident that Newell Brands' investment thesis is intact and our transformative value creation opportunity is all still to play for. The board shares this confidence and has approved $1 billion share repurchase authorization through 2020.","Let me pass the line over to Ralph for a quick run through the numbers and then we'll open the call to questions.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone.","Starting with the key highlights, our core sales grew 0.4% and normalized EPS grew 10.3% to $0.86 per share. We captured about $86 million in synergies and Project Renewal savings during the quarter, which only partially offset the impact of input cost pressure particularly resin, unfavorable product mix, higher spending behind A&P and e-commerce as well as the lost income from the businesses that we have divested. We are lowering our earnings outlook for this year to a new range of $2.80 to $2.85 per share.","Regarding operating cash flow, we expect the effect of lower sales and earnings and the related temporary effect on elevated inventory levels will result in cash flow from operations to be in the $700 million to $800 million range. Importantly, as we focus on margin development and working capital improvement, we expect to achieve our target leverage ratio by the end of 2018.","Turning to the details, third quarter reported net sales were $3.7 billion, a 7% decline versus last year, primarily due to the divestiture of the Tools, Winter Sports, Totes, Teutonia, Fire Building and Cordage businesses. Foreign exchange was a modest tailwind. Core sales grew 0.4% as strong results in Baby, Food, Waddington, Fishing and Team Sports were largely offset by much softer than anticipated Back-to-School season, which impacted our Writing division as well as soft performance in our Appliance and Cookware division in the U.S.","Reported gross margin was 34.5% compared with 32.2% in the prior year, with a year-over-year improvement largely reflecting the absence of last year's $146 million charge for the inventory step-up from the Jarden acquisition. Normalized gross margin was 35% compared with 36% last year as the benefits of cost synergies and Renewal savings were more than offset by input cost inflation and unfavorable mix.","We were unable to take immediate pricing to mitigate the impact of elevated resin and logistics cost in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. However, we have now taken pricing actions, which should help offset margin pressure from commodity increases as we move into 2018.","Reported SG&A expense of $906 million represented 24.6% of sales as compared to last year's ratio of 23.7% with the year-over-year increase driven by higher integration and acquisition amortization costs, as well as incremental spending behind e-commerce, advertising and promotions. We also recorded a $15 million bad debt provision during the quarter as a result of the Toys\"R\"Us bankruptcy filing.","Normalized SG&A expense was $737 million, or 20% of sales versus 20.6% of sales in the year-ago quarter. The 60-basis-point year-over-year improvement in the SG&A to sales ratio reflects the benefit of cost synergies and Renewal savings, which helped offset the impact of incremental investments in advertising and promotion and e-commerce.","Reported operating margin was 8.8% of sales compared with 8.2% in the prior year. Normalized operating margin was 15% compared to 15.4% in the prior year. Interest expense of $116 million was below last year's level of $125 million, reflecting the lower debt balance. We continue to forecast 2017 normalized interest expense of approximately $470 million.","The reported tax rate for the quarter was a benefit of 41.5% compared with the 6.8% rate in the prior year, principally due to the recognition of expected discrete tax benefits within the quarter along with the effect of geographic mix of earnings. The normalized tax rate was 4.1% compared with 22.5% in the previous year. We now forecast the full year normalized tax rate to be about 21%.","In the third quarter we had a weighted average of 492 million diluted shares outstanding, up from 486 million in the prior year due to the shares issued in early July as part of the settlement of four dissenter lawsuits. We expect the full year share count to be at or around 489 million shares with a fourth quarter share count of 492 million. Reported earnings per share were $0.48 compared with $0.38 last year. Normalized earnings per share were $0.86 compared with $0.78 last year.","Moving onto our segment results, net sales in our Live segment reached $1.5 billion, an increase of 2.3% versus last year. Core sales rose 0.6%, a strong performance in Baby driven by the continued momentum in U.S. baby gear, Food, with solid growth in food storage, and Home Fragrance wholesale and e-commerce businesses was partially offset by soft results in Appliance and Cookware. The Learn segment generated net revenues of $642 million, which represents a 0.7% year-over-year increase. Core sales grew 0.5% with growth in all three businesses, but a significant shortfall versus expectations in Writing, as Mike discussed.","Net sales in the Work segment were $738 million, rising 1.6% versus the year-ago quarter. Core sales increased 1.9% with both Waddington and Consumer and Commercial divisions driving this outcome. The Play segment contributed net sales of $611 million, which represents a 2.4% increase versus the prior year. Core sales improved 2.3%, reflecting growth across all three divisions; Outdoor and Recreation, Fishing and Team Sports.","Net sales for the Other segment were $204 million, declining 62% versus the prior year, reflecting the divestitures of Winter Sports, Tools, Teutonia, Lehigh and the Fire Building businesses, which were completed earlier this year. Core sales declined 10.6% with both Home & Family and Process Solutions divisions down year-over-year.","In the third quarter, we generated $183 million of operating cash flow. The year-over-year decline in cash flow reflects absence of profits from the divested businesses, higher cash tax payments, primarily related to gains on disposals and costs related to the delivery of synergies, as well as higher working capital levels, particularly on inventories. While we plan for inventory-building categories with new product launches and where we were capacity constrained, the top line shortfall relative to our expectations resulted in significantly higher inventory days.","Accounts receivable was also adversely affected by the Toys\"R\"Us bankruptcy. While we expect to recover a significant portion of our exposure, this impacted our Q3 cash flow. We are taking steps to reduce inventories and expect to make progress in the fourth quarter and over the next year. We returned $113 million to shareholders during the quarter through dividends.","In September, we reinstated our stock repurchase program, which has $256 million remaining under the current authorization. We are also pleased to announce that our board of directors has approved a new, three-year stock repurchase authorization, which enables the company to buy back up to $1 billion of its shares plus any rollover of unused authorization from 2017. Although this repurchase authorization provides us with additional flexibility for capital deployment, we remain committed to deleveraging our balance sheet and are on track to achieve the leverage target of 3 times to 3.5 times by the end of 2018.","I'll now turn the call back to Mike.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Ralph. While we take our responsibility to do what we say very seriously and are disappointed in our third quarter outcome, we are equally undeterred in our drive to achieve the full potential of the company.","Our confidence is grounded in the knowledge that we have a leading portfolio of brands, advantaged capabilities in innovation and design with the best still to come; a peer group leading e-commerce organization that's only getting stronger, a long list of opportunities for core distribution and broad-based international deployment and a world-class team working on realizing world-class levels of savings.","This is a proven model and playbook and is being run by a seasoned team that has successfully executed it before. We could not be more committed and driven to deliver the transformative value creation story that's inherent in Newell Brands.","Let me pass the line back to Wendy to help facilitate questions now. Wendy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks; good morning. I think this quarter clearly is evidence, not that we needed it, that traditional retail is going away and online is what's going to drive your growth going forward. So could you give us kind of a higher-level view of where you are on e-commerce? I know you said 11% of sales that's growing double digits, but is double digits 20% or 50% growth? Where is that growth coming from? Is it the dotcom pure plays or is it retailer websites?","And can you update us on the cost to compete? I've seen some of the merchandising you've done on Amazon, it looks great, but can you remind us or update us on how profitable that business is and how much more expensive is it to merchandise online versus in store? Thanks so much.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","So, Wendy, thanks for the question. Our point of view about the retail landscape is there are going to be winners in brick-and-mortar. So, we don't think brick-and-mortar is going away by any way, shape or means. There will be some customers that perform really well in that format, but obviously every one of those brick-and-mortar customers will have a multichannel platform for fulfillment to include e-commerce. And you see the likes of Walmart and Target doing really well, Staples doing really well in the space in the commercial side. So, we expect a multichannel landscape in the future, with obviously, shoppers increasingly taking the easier path to fulfill the demand.","So, our energy and our focus is not simply on e-commerce, it's on winning share in every channel where we compete and also on making sure that our resourcing, both our people and our money, are properly allocated to the marketplace. The risk in this environment is that you over-subsidize declining customers and don't have enough money focused on where the growth is. So, it's a very dynamic moment for the industry and for us as well and we're going to be in this constant state of asking that question, are our resources in the right place?","Now obviously, both legacy companies made a big bet on e-commerce back in 2012 and the combination strengthens the potential. We made a choice to create a different organization structure to support the development of our e-commerce business at the beginning of 2017, by creating an enterprise wide e-commerce division, cross-functional team with full P&L responsibility for the delivery of our global growth and profit in this emerging channel. They've got responsibility for all three components of e-commerce: pure play, that's the Amazons of this world; retailer dotcom, that's Walmart.coms, Target.coms, Staples Advantage of this world; and then our own direct-to-consumer business.","We've had strong double-digit growth and that doesn't mean 50%, but it doesn't mean 20%. It's somewhere in between. And there are certain customers within that landscape that are growing closer to 50%. And so we have really good momentum in that space, but it is still very, very early days. The vast majority of our progress is U.S. based at this time although part of the big investment we're making in 2017 is to strengthen our prospects outside of the U.S. in 2018 and beyond.","There's a ton of opportunity in the U.S. still, as both our partners and we are learning how to merchandise through these platforms. While there is great momentum in retailer-driven events that are part of their merchandising history, I think most of these platforms tend to lose share during the consumer-driven moments that matter. And our challenge, together with our retail partners, is to figure how to capitalize on the platform in those consumer moments, that's the opportunity for us to bring insights and perspective to our retail partners in windows like Back-to-School and windows like the holidays.","And so, we're making very, very good progress. We believe we're growing ahead of the market in this channel, otherwise, we wouldn't be delivering market share growth in the way that we are, although in many retail formats and retailers, in the dotcom space, difficult to measure.","With respect to profitability, this is a mix positive for us today in both dotcom and in pure play. In D2C, it's not, although gross margins look better, you've got operating costs below the line that caused us to get some of that margin back. One of the really important priorities for the e-commerce division is to figure that bit of the algorithm out. How do you fulfill efficiently? How do you operate an eBay supply chain to do D2C profitably? That's going to take us some time to figure out. It's part of the financial model that we continue to work on and that team has responsibility for.","So, I think we're very well-positioned, although in certain categories as we experienced in Q3 where e-commerce penetration is not yet as developed as in others, we see market deceleration as the growth mix benefit associated with e-commerce growth does not offset some of the contraction we experienced in some of the underperforming brick-and-mortar formats. Does that answer your question, Wendy?","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hi, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. First, just more of a detail question. Any thoughts, Mike, around the level of incremental risk from retailer inventory reductions as we look out to 2018? Could you see more pronounced cuts? Or do you think at least at the back half of this year inventory cuts helped mitigate this issue? Obviously, a very volatile environment, but any conceptual thoughts would be helpful. And then you also mentioned a heightened focus on cost cutting and working capital going forward given the weak top line environment. Can you give more detail there? Is that more sort of doubling down on actions already in progress and the typical belt-tightening, or could there be more bigger new programs on that front? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Right. Yeah, so on cost and on working capital, we don't envision more cash cost going out the door in order to deliver more savings. We're going to really tighten things up here with respect to discretionary spend and those types of choices don't require restructuring or restructuring-related costs. We have, in our funding algorithm, plenty of cash in the geo and in restructuring projects like Project Renewal to deal with those types of cost reduction efforts. But there are other opportunities available to us and while we've been pursuing them, we're going to go even harder on this until we get greater clarity into the revenue progression of the company.","On your question regarding retail inventories, one of the biggest drawdowns we've had this year has been in our leading partner and our best estimate is we've taken about two weeks of inventory out of the system, a little bit over that, from the beginning of the year to this point in time and we lap the start of that experience in the fourth quarter. So some of the headwinds associated with that particular partner, I think, diminishes going forward even though they will continue to apply effort in that space. The bigger issue we have to come to grips with and accept is that there are certain retail channels that are struggling in the environment we're in where foot traffic is down and their business models are not well-positioned yet to deal with the shift to e-commerce.","In those cases, we should expect, and will probably see, further inventory reduction. We have some specific events that we need to wrestle with as our negotiations get resolved in Baby, which I referenced and I think an example of the type of channel dynamic that I think will present a headwind in the Writing business is in the office superstore channel. But there are others beyond that that I think are going to become sort of a steady and ongoing headwind for us. The big one, which we experienced this year, is behind us as of the fourth quarter, but it doesn't mean this stream of resistance fully dissipates. Ralph, I don't know if you'd like to comment on working capital and the program we're going to put in place.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Sure. Dara, our focus is across the total cash conversion cycle. We've already made good progress on days payable outstanding, as you can see in the days we exited last year just below 60 days and we're on track, this quarter we're about 65, and we think there's room to go further. That's been largely from our procurement synergy effort. We put a big focus there and again we think we have some more programs to help drive that.","Clearly a lot of opportunity on inventory as you can see from our inventory days being well above a year ago. Some things we're doing very much in the moment here are pulling back significantly on our internal production and with our suppliers, but importantly to sustain this and to keep continued improvement, we've got some focused improvement teams within some of the divisions where the most opportunity exists. And we're doing things on demand planning and tools related to that to help drive our inventories down to more efficient levels.","And then kind of lastly maybe I'll just comment on accounts receivable. We see our DSO fairly stable, frankly with maybe some modest increases over time, but where there is increases we'll look to get value for that whether that's in the supply chain offsets or programming or other things. So net, clearly a lot of activity going on, on cash conversion.","So just to build on that, in the moment as September started to unfold, obviously with a long value chain of sourced finished goods, it's very, very difficult to adjust your inventory days in a very narrow window of time when you've got that kind of value chain. However, as we've gone into the fourth quarter we've been, where we can, pulling as many days out of our self-manufacturing network as possible and at the same time really cutting back on our ordering patterns to rebalance our inventories.","There is a margin impact and you see it and it's reflected in our guidance of pulling weeks out of production facilities in that you have an unabsorbed fixed cost structure in the factory footprint that flows to gross margin. So in our guidance for the balance of the year, we've accepted on cost that will pressure gross margin as a result of that choice. Some of that will carry forward into 2018, although we'll get into an equilibrium, I think, pretty quickly with respect to the manufacturing footprint.","One of the questions we asked in the Writing business, and we've asked it, and the teams are working on it, is in the context of this shifting retail landscape, do we need to start to build inventories for Back-to-School 2018 as early in 2018 as we typically would? Those types of fundamental questions about how we've historically run businesses are being asked now. Or can we level load this business in a different way in the context of a more concentrated Writing business with the big mass customers in the e-commerce channels. And so, that's the type of question that's being asked.","And strategically going forward, because we need to get our working capital metrics in line if we have an appetite to generate as much cash as we possibly can for M&A into the future, we have to attack the complexity in this business. And we're going to get serious about that over the next couple of years. We have over 400,000 SKUs in our portfolio. That complexity needs to come out. And we're going to tackle that issue head on, starting probably in the back half of 2018 into 2019 and 2020.","And so we're going to build out a full-on program on working capital to get these metrics aligned with what we think is an appropriate level of working capital. We've been kicking this can down the road of the missing Q3 highlights, the consequences of having done that, and we're going to deal with it now because we want to use the cash.","As I said on the call and in the script, nothing of what we've experienced in Q3 changes our point of view on the potential of this company. But we want to have all the resources we possibly can at our fingertips to be able to play for the industry consolidation that is available to us, and the market share consolidation that's available to us in these categories. So, this is a really important topic that you'll hear much more about from us going forward. It's not simply about adjusting our algorithm in the moment, but it's about finally getting on with tackling this working capital opportunity.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And given some of that commentary, any thoughts on the prior goal of $1.5 billion in operating cash flow in 2018? Can you still get close to that or any thoughts in general around that number?","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","We chose specifically not to guide 2018 today, Dara, because we have the uncertainty of how the TRU discussion is going to play out and we want to see how Q4 presents itself. As I said, October is off to a solid start, but July was our best start to a quarter that we've had in a long, long time. So, we're very cautious about how this is all going to unfold.","There are a lot of moving parts to include the working capital discussion, but you can be assured that we're focused on cash. We have two very near-end reasons to be. Number one, we've made commitments to deleverage the balance sheet which we are clear and firm and committed to do, and we obviously with the miss and our prior softness on top line, obviously, we're trading at a ridiculously low multiple for the potential of this company. I understand why, but we want to be in the market buying ourselves to the degree that we can and still deliver the leverage ratio outcome we've committed to deliver.","This is the best M&A opportunity we've got. We know exactly what we're going to do in this company over the next number of years, and we're betting on ourselves, which obviously we think is a good bet. So, we're balancing those two things, and so there's plenty of incentive to get cash from operations to as high a level as we possibly can. And then the future, it gets a heck of a lot easier. Once we clear some of these thresholds, this business is very cash generative. If we make material progress on working capital as I think we will and we continue to deliver the synergies, we get very good margin development.","Growth will be what growth will be, it will be market driven. We're going to grow ahead of our markets, continue to drive share, and so we are revisiting the algorithm and trying to find the right balance between margin, cash, and growth. But we're not going to presume that the environment gets better going forward, so we're going to live within that constraint. And that will shape the outcome on cash in 2018 and 2019, and then from 2019 onwards we're sort of in a very, very good place with lots of \u2013 certainly even in 2019 lots of optionality for application of cash beyond simply financing the business.","So we have an eye on that future, and we understand there are stepping stones and there's a need to rebuild confidence in the team's ability to deliver the outcomes we commit to, but we're going to defer on making any comments about 2018 until we get further along into the fourth quarter and have a greater visibility into next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. It's actually Joe Lachky for Bonnie.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. So I understand your hesitation on giving any 2018 guidance. Obviously visibility is pretty low, but I was wondering if maybe you had any like high-level thoughts, specifically regarding core sales growth and really in the context of your comments of a more modest top line going forward. And in the past you've talked about the fact that you're in this strengthening phase and sort of approaching some sort of a scale or accelerate phase. And I wonder if you still believe that that progression for the top line will still take place? And whether or not the long-term 3% to 5% range that you've laid out in your previous presentations is realistic in the current environment? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Right. So, Joe, obviously we're living in the here and now right in the moment, and I pick my words very carefully. We are clearly focused on growing ahead of the market. We're going to have some market dynamics because of TRU and because of the continued challenges in writing certainly into next year that will kind of serve as a compromise. I think I take heart in the underlying performance in the business. The 3.5% POS growth is a very strong growth number for the U.S. And that is the true measure of the underlying performance in the business. And that disconnect between sell-out and sell-in that I described, that 70 basis points down in core sales in the U.S. relative to that 3.5% POS growth, that's the scale of the issue we're facing into.","I'm reluctant to guide core sales into 2018 until I get clarity on the TRU-Baby dynamic because I think there will be some dynamics connected to that with respect to both inventory liquidation and then whatever choices they're going to make from a network perspective, which we do not have their point of view on into 2018. So we're going to have to accept that as a reality that isn't in our existing performance. That said, our programming, our ideas strengthen as we move through 2018. And I was very clear, we're not going to back off on continuing to build our innovation funnel to strengthen these brands, to build the capability and design, and invest that capability back into our product performance. Those are the capabilities that will create the strategic leverage for the company going forward, that coupled with ecommerce.","So we will continue to benefit from the investments that started in 2017. They start to yield growth and impact in the marketplace. They already have, but they will continue to progress, and there will be sequential improvement. But given the market dynamics, it's very, very difficult to \u2013 and I don't think it's prudent for us to declare what the number and the range looks like next year.","Will we grow in 2018? I sure as heck believe we will, so I know there's some theories out there that suggest we can't and won't grow. That's nonsense. We will likely grow. There could be any given moment, a 30-day moment, a 60-day moment, a 90-day moment where our retailer dynamic could compromise that, and we just have to accept that. Like, we've been, in some ways, a little bit resistant. And this is in part me, because I've always overcome those types of headwinds in my experience. But this landscape change that's going on is as profound as I've experienced in my 35 years.","So I think it's in everybody's interest for us to slow down, pause, watch, reflect, bottom out the TRU dynamic, and understand exactly how our negotiations in the Writing business are going to work out before we provide any guidance for next year. What you can count on is that we're going to build share, we will get sequential improvement through the quality of our ideas and innovation. And in the meantime, what we're going to do is we're going to work harder on costs, we're going to get better pricing reflection to offset commodity inflation, which has certainly eaten up a good portion of our gross margin-based synergies in 2017, and we're going to tackle the working capital issue.","And in that combination, I guess you could argue that we're going to, in the very near term, prioritize margin and cash at a higher level than we have up until now, so that we compensate for the risk associated with the top line through this transitional period. And we believe that's the right choice to do. It doesn't in any way compromise our belief in the future, our belief in the brands, and our potential to grow ahead of the markets into the future. So if markets are growing at 3%, we should grow ahead of 3%. If markets are growing at 4%, we should grow ahead of 4%.If markets are flat, we're going to grow ahead of flat. And we need to adapt and adjust our earnings algorithm and cash flow principals- cash flow delivery to that reality. And we need to be prepared to flex and adapt to that environment as the landscape goes through the transitions that are in many ways connected to the shift that's going \u2013 a fundamental shift that's going on in shopping patterns, particularly in the U.S.","So that may not be satisfactory in terms of an answer, and I know you're looking for something specific from me, but we'll give that when we're in a position to give that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Okay. Thanks. Good morning. So I appreciate it makes perfect sense you're not in a position to have a lot of visibility into next year, but I was curious on two fronts. One, on the visibility conversation. So retail inventory levels, when you had the big destock at Walmart last year's fourth quarter, particularly in appliances, I don't feel like there was a great sense that that was the beginning of something, right. It felt like it was specific to after Black Friday, some seasonal adjustment, but not that there was going to be a continued working down. So whether it's in that category, in that retailer, or just more broadly, is there anything you can do to sort of investigate, like where inventories stand at some of your bigger customers, so that you can think about how to manage that moving forward, not just adjusting the current working capital situation, but what might still be on the come as you move into next year? That was one.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","It's an excellent question.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","We have perfect visibility into our largest retailers' inventory position. We know what our \u2013 through Retail Link, you have that visibility. You see exactly how many weeks on hand you've got at retail and how many weeks on hand you have in the warehouse. So we know exactly what has gone on there and we can see that by SKU, quite frankly, every day. So we have perfect visibility at that customers and they share that with us because it's in their interest for us to know and to work with them to manage those inventories down. It's not true with every retailer. We model our inventory position by retailer or by product family. Every month we're looking at this, so there's a standard report that we're looking at, which is how I can tell you what I told you earlier on the retail landscape.","I think at the heart of your question, Lauren, is this hope that we will anticipate the future better than we have through the third quarter, both the retailer landscape and then the consequences of that through the whole business model, and that we are pivoting our resourcing and thinking about our future production requirements in the context of that next state of that retail landscape. The confession to make is we didn't do that well enough in the third quarter for sure. The reality of our business model is it's impossible to adjust in 30-day windows or 60-day windows or 45-day windows because of the fact that we're only 50% self-manufactured, and we have a long value chain of sourced finished goods that are on the water that's tied to kind of a forward-looking forecast.","It's really important for us to accept the retail landscape dynamics for what they are such that we're not setting ambitions in the company that drive behaviors that carry too much risk. So, for example, if we put too big a number out there to chase for top line, the divisions will build inventories to support that outcome because we won't do that without them having given us some confidence in that. And if you miss, then you're hung out with those inventories. And so we have to make sure that we're doing a better job going forward of calibrating the upside in the business against the risk profile associated with working capital position. What makes that easier over time is getting the complexity out of the portfolio of each one of these categories and not trying to do that across too many SKUs because it becomes very, very difficult to model and get accurate at that level of fragmentation.","And so there's plenty of work to do to get better at this, but I think I'm interpreting your comments in the right way, which is you've got to do a better job of forecasting the future and planning for that versus leveraging your historical view of how the business is going to perform and building your operating rhythm around the history. And that's clearly something we've concluded for ourselves and have taken to heart and that we're all thinking quite seriously about how to adapt our processes to embrace that. But to be honest, there's a fair amount of work to do to be really strong at that capability.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. The first question, quick housekeeping item. TRU was there an impact on core sales in this quarter and what would you expect the impact to be in the fourth quarter?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes, so there was no impact, no material impact, in this quarter. We went through a couple days where we needed to see how things were going to sort out in the end of September, but as it turns out, it may be $1 million or $2 million but no material impact in the quarter. That's how Baby had 10% core growth. We expect to have an impact in the fourth quarter that I think will largely be related to inventory liquidation in advance of whatever restructuring program Toys\"R\"Us does with respect to its fleet of stores. So that's built into our guidance and assumptions around that on Baby. Baby has been growing unbelievably well, but I think in the fourth quarter you guys should consider the fact that it could be flat to down in the face of that kind of headwind, and that's built into our guidance. If that happens in the fourth quarter, that will be consistent with our view. If it doesn't for timing reasons, then it will shift into Q4, and that's one of those uncertainties that's still to be resolved.","The more important conversation around TRU\/BRU is what does the future look like? And this our leading Baby retail partner, baby care retail partner globally. We have a very good relationship with BRU\/TRU. We've built our businesses in a collaborative way over time, and we expect to come through those discussions with the same strategic partnership in place, albeit with a shift in the profile of their business connected to whatever they choose to do with respect to their store configuration. But in terms of the development of the brand, the commitment to do it, our partnership, the constructive nature of the conversations, those are all positive and ongoing, and we'll get closure on that I suppose over the \u2013 probably the next couple of weeks and then we'll have the clarity we need to look forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, good morning. It's Christina Brathwaite on for Andrea.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hi, Andrea.","Christina Brathwaite - JPMorgan Securities LLC","We just wanted to dive into the inventory in a little more detail. So up 18% (54:27) year-over-year. Can you talk about a little bit more about the composition? It sounds like a lot of that was driven by the Writing business, but are there any other kind of pockets that you'd call out there? And then looking ahead, how are you thinking about getting to more normalized inventory levels? How much longer do you think it will take? And are you embedding any kind of gross margin headwind in your guidance related to just selling that down?","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yes. So two things. Our issues in the quarter were all U.S. based. It was writing instruments and it was \u2013 our miss was writing instruments related and appliance related for different reasons. Obviously, as I've said, market growth was below our forecast in the quarter. However, share progression in writing instruments was right about where we expected it to be. But the net effect was a lower sellout than we had built into the model. And because market growth was effectively flat across the landscape with some retailers down and other retailers up slightly, I think everybody anticipated a stronger back-to-school and therefore the whole marketplace had to adjust to the shorter market growth, and so that's unfolding.","On appliances, the issue is a more familiar one to us, and it's one that we're experienced addressing, but it does have retailer inventory consequences, and that is that with the exception of the cookers' market, which is where this pressure cooker phenomenon is, market growth was down sequentially in the quarter. Pressure cooker is really, really strong. That's why we're launching Express Crock pressure cooker that does multi-cooking and we are broadening the footprint into that space. But more broadly speaking, market growth in appliances came down excluding the cooker segment and our share importantly was down across many of our formats. And what's missing there is the kind of innovation we need to be able to be competitive in that space and we need to do things that allow us over time, to premiumize that category \u2013 our footprint in the category. And so we're working on that. That's where we started at the beginning of the year, and it starts to play out in the fourth quarter and into next year.","Retailers in that environment also hold back on inventories because market growth, ex the cooker segment, was flat to down. And so we've had some inventory dynamics there. We have on our own inventories pulled manufacturing days out of the fourth quarter. So in our guidance we reflect in the gross margin forecast, which we look at, that informs the EPS outlook, we've assumed fixed cost absorption to gross margin that is beyond what you would normally expect as we pull weeks of production out of our own manufacturing network, and that's certainly a headwind. I think that carries forward into part of 2018 because we're going to continue to want to ratchet down our working capital and production times across many of our self-manufactured businesses.","And so I do think there is margin pressure, particularly in the beginning of the year that we'll experience at gross margin that'll be reflected in our point of view forward when we get to the point of providing that. That said, in 2018 we'll do a better job on pricing because we will have \u2013 we've announced pricing on all of our resin-based products, and we're in the midst of negotiating price acceptance customer by customer. That starts to flow into the P&L by the end of the fourth quarter and into 2018.So we'll have more positive price to offset the inflation. So we get some other benefits that start coming our way that will help gross margin next year. And we get the continued impact of synergies to gross margin as well. But that's still to all play out. We'll walk you through that when we provide 2018 guidance, but there are things that can help us and we'll work to offset some of those pressures.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. My question for you broadly on the portfolio and then I wanted to come back to the POS data that you cited in the release. So first one, and we talked about some \u2013 I was hoping you could dimension the magnitude of the deterioration in the outlook that we've seen, particularly since September. And maybe even going further back, Mike, some of the biggest surprises to the downside, and I guess the context here, the financial delivery when you were running Newell Rubbermaid was fantastic, and at the risk of being cheeky, maybe Staples-like and that really drove the multiple for the stock over time. But clearly the delivery has been less consistent here post the close of the Jarden deal, which I guess plausibly one would think this relates to the integration or maybe something that was missed with that portfolio. So any comments there, Mike, now with the benefit of hindsight looking back over the past year-and-a-half or so since the deal closed in terms of magnitude driving some of the downside here versus initial expectations?","And we talked about some of the U.S. retail dynamics and of course that hasn't helped and we've seen the Nielsen data which hasn't been great for a while, so maybe it's specifically in U.S. brick-and-mortar. But to the extent you can dimensionalize some of this, Mike, would be helpful.","And then I also wanted to come back to the POS sales data, so the 3.5%. What exactly does that capture? Because the Nielsen data that we have even making adjustments is closer to flat and I would even say 3.5% kind of growth is obviously not what's discounted in your share price at this point, and also, sort of tying that in, Mike, with your comment that will likely grow next year. So just sort of help us understand that. On the one hand, the category is doing 3.5% in the U.S., which is sort of what's syndicated in the data, then with the comment understanding some of the destocking and some of the Toys\"R\"Us drag that you sort of couched that you \"likely grow\" when the category is doing 3.5%, at least that's what's syndicated. So sorry for being verbose, but thank you for all that.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","No problem. Let me start with the last part of your question first. So the way we track, we track four things every week that the data becomes available. Some of it becomes available daily, some of it becomes available in four-week increments. And we don't track Nielsen data in the traditional sense. We're looking at Nielsen panel diary data, which includes the e-commerce effect across all of our businesses, and in some cases that's not available, so we take what is available which is an IRI platform, and then there are some specific databases in Team Sports that are neither IRI or panel diary and then we aggregate that into a scorecard that all of us get that looks at the market growth data sellout in 4-week, 12-week, 52-week increments on market share, share change.","And then we get POS data weekly, which is transaction data from our retailers, including Amazon and we get the ability to split both E from bricks-and-mortar by product family. We could go lower, but we've got all that data that comes in and gets aggregated. So you're not going to see the POS data that we see. We see that every week and it's the equivalent of retail link from all of our retailers and then of course, we have our invoicing that we compare all that to. We look at it across 75 product families and we do this in the U.S. And so we have a very, very granular view of our business and it's a unique combination of these different data sources that gives us the perspective and that's the number we quote.","Now what I said, Kevin, was our sellout was 3.5%, not the category sellout. Category sellout decelerated in the quarter and was effectively flat. There are examples in certain product families where markets were down and there are examples where markets were up. So they're not all flat, but in aggregate they're flat and that represents a deceleration from the first half of the year to the third quarter in terms of market growth. And that's not what we assumed when we built our plan and our guidance.","So we do think it's right to be more prudent going forward given this experience with respect to market growth recovery. And our theory is what I espoused on the call, which is because we see patterns in the business where we've got \u2013 and the category has higher e-commerce development, we see better and more insulated market growth dynamics.","Where the category has less e-commerce development, we see less insulated market growth dynamics as retail landscapes shift and adapt to foot traffic challenges, generally, that they've got as a result of changing shopping behavior.","And so we're living in a world that, when we can't control that aspect of how retailers will behave, as they look to preserve their value creation algorithms, and so we have to just accept that and live with that.","So our point of view going forward is we need to be a little bit more tepid in our outlook on market growth. We will continue to forecast market share growth as demonstrated in the third quarter. We had pretty broad-based, I told you the list of categories where we had share growth. That's measured, that's not us making up any data, that's data from the suppliers that I was mentioning to you. And so that's important news.","In the syndicated data that I worry you guys look at, you're missing all that e-commerce contribution. And knowing what I know about those syndicated providers, they probably don't have the breadth of coverage that we arranged with \u2013 from a channel perspective, that we've arranged through our supply relationships.","So the coverage landscape in our categories in those more traditional syndicated providers is going to be much more narrow than what we have visibility to and it's much less reflective of what's going on in our business.","So yes, that would be the fundamental answer to your question. Was there a bit that I missed, Kevin?","Operator","And I apologize, Kevin has dropped from the Q&A.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Okay, great.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","All right, thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Jason.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, Mike. I guess I know you're talking about taking some of the pricing on the resin-based and seeing how that's kind of playing through. As you look at the quarter and some of the changing dynamics, and I know you've done this with a few categories, but how do you think about pricing adjustments to the downside? And some of the categories that you play in that maybe these are categories where the price might need to be a little bit lower just to be more competitive for the consumer out there, especially as we live in this Amazon world where everything seems to have a private label element to it. So I was just wondering how you think about the pricing on the downside to kind of counteract some of the pricing that you need to take for the commodity-based impacts? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah, well, we've experienced negative price this year, that's part of the challenge in a more inflationary environment. We put more programming in, as I described to you guys in a recent conference. So we're looking forward to try and land these price increases in the context of more inflation. It's easier to sell pricing when you've got that dynamic going on and everybody, including private label, has to deal with the resin inflation. I noticed last couple of days some other folks talking about this as well. And so we'll do our best to land those pricing actions, and so far, so good.","But your point about relative price is a really important point and the primary objective we have as a company is to build market share. And to build market share you've got to have great innovation, you've got to have great communication, you have to have great packaging, you have to have great product performance. But you have to live within a set of price principles relative to the value offering in your categories and relative to the premium offerings in your categories. And while we always are pushing to premiumize these categories through innovation, we will occasionally price down to make sure we maintain those price gaps. Now, in an inflationary environment, which we have been in, in the back half of 2017, there's less pressure on that.","The good news for us is that private label's not a big variable. Unlike consumer staples and food, where private label is a real issue, in general private label is relatively underdeveloped in these categories, and I don't think it becomes more developed unless we don't do our jobs as brand leaders. And if we do our job with innovation, if we do our job with brand positioning, if we do our job with product design and product performance, then there's really no reason for private label to exist. And I've read all the stories and I've listened to all the narratives about how that's going to change in an e-commerce world. I just don't subscribe to that theory.","I think if we do our work well, we won't have private label issues and we won't have that downward pressure that you're describing. All that said, where we haven't done our work well, we do have that pressure and I've described the experience that both Jarden and Newell have had with Coleman at one of our leading retailers at Walmart, where because of the prior owner to Jarden's acquisition of that brand not doing their job, Ozark Trail emerged as a private label offering at Walmart and once it's there, you're in that vortex that you describe.","So that's an important reference point for us as a company to not lose sight of because that is the consequence when you don't do your job right. So it's great. It creates all kinds of challenges for that particular team to work around that dynamic, but it also serves as an important bellwether for us on what happens if you don't do your work well. Then you live in the world you described, Jason, and we don't want to live in that world. That said, if we need to price down to maintain our price principles, we are unhesitant to do that because that's part of building the brand.","Operator","Our last question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Bill.","Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Actually, this is Stephanie on for Bill. I just have a question on Yankee Candle, just kind of as you transition into that large retailer you announced last quarter. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that and maybe anything negative you got from some of your other retail partners. Just some color on that would be helpful. Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Look, first of all, I'm really proud of the Yankee Candle team. Hope Margala, who runs that business, is doing an outstanding job, as are the whole group up in Deerfield. And they're dealing with a very difficult challenge in their retail platform, and they've done it unbelievably well this year and we're coming to this point where we're starting to get the fruits of our labor benefiting them in the marketplace. So we've put a lot of work in the second quarter cleaning up the brand architecture, not just in the U.S. but also in Europe.","And so that work is largely behind us now. We've established a true brand architecture within Yankee with Yankee Candle as the premium offering and Home Inspirations from Yankee as the value offering. It's not an opening price point position, but it's a value offering relative to Yankee. We want to put a Yankee Candle within arm's reach of every consumer in the United States. And so the primary focus on Yankee is putting Yankee Candle out there so that our consumers have the opportunity to experience this brand, and we're pushing to do that very broadly across mass channels, across specialty channels, through e-commerce, both within our own D2C site and through pure-play options as well.","Our largest retailer, Walmart, took Yankee Candle in over the summer and it's doing really well. And so I think it's early days because we're coming into the peak consumption window, so that'll be the true test of how it's doing, but that move is the first step in a series of steps that we've taken. Obviously we've also bought two brands this year. We bought WoodWick; it's a multi-sensory platform of sound and fragrance, and then we've just bought Chesapeake, which is a completely different positioning from Yankee in more of a spa, sort of, sensory positioning.","And those three brands together, along with Millefiori in Europe will create a brand portfolio that allows us to tackle what is a very big opportunity in Home Fragrance around the world.","And so we're really excited about it. We believe that we can continue to renovate retail such that we outperformed in that segment. We're trying new things including this concept store and pop-up store in Soho that opens next week, this micro site that presents the new brand architecture and portfolio in a holistic way that is not specifically Yankee focused, but a total portfolio focused platform. And we're doing personalization in a way that's bigger and better in the fourth quarter than we've done previously.","So I think there's lots of opportunity here ahead, and we'll work through all the challenges of operationalizing that as we move forward. But I think the team's done an excellent job of working through the reset this year and has the brand positioned to perform as we go into next. And we'll see how that all plays out.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Polk.","Michael B.

I'll turn the call over to Ravi. ","Ravi Saligram","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the call. I'm pleased to be with you today to discuss our strong fourth quarter results and to share my observations on the encouraging progress the company has made in 2019. ","I recently have completed my first 100 days with Newell Brands, and I understand the challenges we face in our turnaround, as well as the strengths of the organization. ","I will first discuss the progress we made in 2019, give you a sense for our priorities in 2020 and then turn the call over to Chris to discuss fourth quarter and 2020 outlook.","2019 was an important year of inflection for Newell. We made significant strides against the five pillars of the turnaround plan, which include returning the company to sustainable and profitable core sales growth, expanding operating margins through productivity and overhead savings, accelerating cash conversion cycle through working capital transformation, strengthening the portfolio of brands and businesses in which we compete, and build out a winning team. ","I'll start with the last pillar of winning team because I firmly believe that the most important foundation for a successful turnaround and for enabling a company to return to its full potential is to build the right leadership team.","Newell has dedicated and passionate employees who want to win. With the right leadership in place, we can maximize their potential and drive better outcomes through clarity of direction, removing barriers and focusing the right people on the right things. ","We're also optimizing our organizational structure. We believe that, given the diverse nature of our products and categories, it is important to have dedicated, front-facing, go-to-market business units with the requisite domain expertise, headed by business unit CEOs for strong drivers of sustainable profitable revenue growth and experts at leveraging consumer insights and customer relationships to drive meaningful innovation. ","At the same time, we expect them to be superb collaborators to support the enterprise in attaining back-end synergies and efficiencies by leveraging Newell's scale. ","We do not want to be an overly centralized organization, nor do we want to be a commonwealth of independent states. We will differentiate our brands through a business unit structure and synergize through enterprise efficiencies.","To that end, we're announcing two new senior leaders today. First, Mike McDermott, who joined us recently to lead our commercial business as business unit CEO, including Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Mapa\/Spontex.","Mike has had a stellar career most recently at Bass Pro Shops where he was President, Omnichannel Retail, and before that as Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer at Lowe's. He was also head of sales for GE Appliances and led product innovation. ","Mike is an inspirational leader with great people skills and impressive category expertise. He has spent the last few weeks meeting with his new team and immersing himself in that business. We're thrilled to have him on board. ","We also announced the imminent arrival of Kris Malkoski, who will be joining Newell Brands next week as Business Unit CEO of our Food business, which includes the Rubbermaid Food, Sistema, Ball Jar and FoodSaver brands. Kris joins us with extensive experience in the food and housewares category, having served as CEO of Americas for Arc International, a French glassware company, and before that at World Kitchen, where she was President, Global Business and Chief Commercial Officer with responsibility of their global housewares business, including brands such as Pyrex, CorningWare and Corelle. Kris cut her teeth at Procter & Gamble where she had an illustrious career for 14 years. ","She's a strong P&L leader with relevant experience and a terrific track record of driving innovation. Very excited to have her join us and build on the recent momentum in this important business.","We're in the late stages of a search for a CEO for our outdoor business and naming a chief customer officer. We have also brought in strong leaders in several key positions at the business unit level and in the functions. ","In fact, since joining Newell about a year ago, Chris has totally revamped the finance function, having brought in a new chief accounting officer, a new head of tax accounting, a new head of supply chain finance and a new head of global business services in 2019. ","You can see that, with all these changes, it really is a new Newell. ","The first pillar of our turnaround, returning the company to sustainable profitable core sales growth remains a top priority. Our 2019 core sales trajectory showed steady improvement this year with four of our eight business units delivering positive growth in 2019. Those businesses are Connected Home & Security, Writing, Home Fragrance and Baby. ","We're also excited that the Food business grew high-single digits in Q4, reversing two quarters of declines. And we're optimistic about its prospects in 2020. Kudos to these teams for their hard work. ","We generated double-digit growth in e-commerce and we delivered a return to growth in our international markets where core sales grew low-single digits versus a low-single digit decline in 2018. ","We have begun to revamp the company's innovation process, with insights from the newly developed multi-year product roadmaps, helping to repopulate and strengthen the innovation pipeline. ","This process takes time, and there's clearly much work to be done, particularly in our more challenged businesses, including Outdoor & Recreation and Appliances & Cookware. ","We also overhauled our marketing approach to introduce omnichannel focus and a digital first mindset across the organization, with the goal of ensuring a seamless interaction between our brands and consumers across all channels where they shop. ","Although still nascent, we're starting to build out our social and digital marketing capability and we're beginning to leverage machine learning and AI tools in parts of the organization. ","Moving on to the second strategic priority of expanding operating margins for productivity and overhead cost savings, during 2019, we expanded our normalized operating margins by 50 basis points through productivity and disciplined pricing actions to overcome inflation and tariffs. ","We also made good progress on complexity reduction initiatives, including reducing SKUs by 27%, also making four SAP conversions, and consolidating seven distribution centers and two manufacturing plants, with more to come on that front in 2020. ","In relation to the third pillar, strengthening the portfolio. At the end of 2019, we completed the sale of US Playing Card, which brought the company's two-year divestiture program to a close.","I'd like to thank Brad Turner, our General Counsel, and Jason Mullins, SVP of mergers and acquisitions, and their teams for their exemplary work on this initiative. ","During 2019, we also made the decisive choice to retain the Rubbermaid commercial products, Mapa\/Spontex and Quickie businesses, which we expect to be additive to the value creation formula as part of our ongoing portfolio. ","The fourth pillar of our turnaround plan centers around improving the company's cash conversion cycle through more efficient working capital management. The team under Chris' leadership did a tremendous job on that function in 2019, reducing our cash conversion cycle by more than 10 days on a like-for-like basis. ","Our operating cash flow improved 54% during 2019 to more than $1 billion. Let me repeat that. More than $1 billion, with free cash flow productivity over 100%, a significant achievement for the organization. ","And importantly, this enabled us to continue to pay down our debt, achieving a 4.0 leverage ratio as we close the year and making progress in de-risking our balance sheet. ","In 2019, we pivoted from transformation to turnaround and made good progress on many fronts. I want to thank our business unit heads, functional heads, their teams and all 30,000 employees for their resilience and notable results. ","2020 is a true foundational year for the turnaround. We have the right management team in place, a more stable organization, clarity of direction and a clear set of priorities. ","We have two critical goals. First, continue to accelerate cash generation and reduce debt. And two, stop revenue declines and lay the foundation to restore long-term profitable growth. ","We will achieve these goals by focusing on five critical priorities. First, put in place a consumer\/customer focused collaborative leadership team with domain expertise to galvanize the organization and create a culture of winning in the marketplace.","Second, obsessively focus on cash flow through working capital improvements and debt reduction to achieve our long-term target of 3 times net debt to continuing operations normalized EBITDA. ","Third, stop revenue declines by scaling existing and new innovations, closing distribution gaps, optimizing marketing mix, turbocharging online channels and reenergizing tail categories.","Four, improve operating margins by reducing complexity, including SKU reduction, addressing E&O, standardizing IT systems and controlling overheads.","And fifth, launching a major new productivity program to capture the gross margin opportunity we've laid out, which we're calling Project FUEL. FUEL stands for finding untapped efficiencies and leverage.","This major initiative will focus on product value engineering, automation, improving plant operational efficiency, et cetera, across all business units and the enterprise.","The new leadership team at Newell is committed to achieving these goals and being laser focused on executing against the five priorities.","However, in all candor, getting to revenue growth will take some time and will be challenging because four or five businesses are still in decline. ","I'm confident that the new business unit CEOs in place and recent momentum in Food and Commercial will get back on track. Our two big challenges are Appliances and Outdoor. ","Revving up the innovation pipeline and instilling customer confidence will not happen overnight. Hence 2020 will be more of a foundational year for these businesses and they'll still be a downward drag for the enterprise. ","I am more optimistic about our ability to improve operating margins in the near term due to our head start in 2019. And I'm enthusiastic about cash flow becoming a true hallmark of Newell. ","And to heighten our chances of success on both cash flow and margins, let me now unveil my secret weapon. I'm excited to announce a significant expansion of responsibilities for Chris Peterson. ","I'm appointing him as President, Business Operations in addition to his current role as Chief Financial Officer. Chris has done a great job in 2019, laying out a turnaround framework and galvanizing the organization to reduce complexity. ","I also fondly refer to him as our cash flow guru. He and I are partnering very well in the turnaround of the company, and both of us are cash flow junkies. ","Given the critical importance of Project FUEL and improving operating margins, I have requested Chris to take on oversight of both supply chain and procurement. Dennis Senovich, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, and Steve Nikolopoulos, our Chief Procurement Officer, will both report to Chris. ","In addition, he'll be responsible for investor relations as well as IT. In his role as President, Business Operations, Chris will work on eliminating all aspects of complexity in Newell and position the company as an efficient enterprise by taking advantage of our almost $10 billion in scale.","I have absolute conviction that the new Newell will drive shareholder value. I'm fixated on returning this company to one that fulfills our promises to our employees, our customers, our consumers and our shareholders. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.","I'll now turn it over to Chris.","Christopher Peterson ","Thanks, Ravi. And good morning, everyone. I'm really excited about the new role and continuing to work with all of our employees to drive our turnaround plans, including the simplification and cost agenda. ","The fourth quarter capped off a strong year of progress on the turnaround plan with results ahead of plan across all key metrics. The decisive and strategic choices we took over the past 12 months to turn Newell Brands around and drive shareholder value are clearly working and we are focused on building on this momentum. ","Before discussing the Q4 results and outlook, I want to recap the company's full-year 2019 results. ","For 2019, core sales growth increased by 330 basis points from a 5.2% decline in 2018 to a 1.9% decline in 2019. Both productivity improvement and overhead reductions more than offset higher advertising spending, inflation, foreign exchange and tariffs, driving a 50 basis point year-over-year expansion in normalized operating margin. ","Operating cash flow improved more than 50% to over $1 billion, with free cash flow more than doubling versus year ago to $779 million. ","We made significant progress on complexity reduction as we took out more than 27% of our SKUs or approximately 28,000 SKUs during the year. We implemented four successful SAP conversions. We significantly simplified the IT infrastructure by rationalizing more than 2,700 applications and integrating 24 help desks into a single platform. We shut down more than 60 unprofitable direct to consumer websites. We eliminated 46 consumer service locations. We consolidated the company's real estate footprint by closing or reducing space in 21 office sites. We relocated the corporate headquarters back to Atlanta. We streamlined the supply chain by closing seven distribution centers and two manufacturing plants and we completed the divestiture program.","Now, let's move on to Q4 results. Net sales decreased 3.1% versus last year to $2.6 billion due to unfavorable foreign exchange and a 1.5% decline in core sales. ","Core sales growth was better than expected, driven by stronger-than-expected growth in Food and Writing. Four business units \u2013 Writing, Baby, Home Fragrance and Food \u2013 delivered positive core sales growth, with e-commerce continuing its double-digit growth trajectory. ","Normalized operating margin remained flat year-over-year at 11.3%, which was in line with the company's expectations with the outcome driven by disciplined spending controls, productivity initiatives and pricing actions. ","Normalized gross margin contracted 70 basis points year-over-year to 33.5% as productivity and pricing were offset by unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, tariffs and inflation. ","Overhead cost reduction offset the gross margin pressure in Q4. ","Net interest expense came down by more than $33 million year-over-year, reflecting the company's deleveraging progress. ","The normalized tax rate was 23.2%, about in line with expectations.","Normalized net income from discontinued operations was $8 million as compared to nearly $164 million a year ago, with the year-over-year decline driven by the absence of Pure Fishing, Jostens, Process Solutions and Rexair.","Normalized diluted earnings per share from continuing operations improved 33% year-over-year to $0.40. Total company normalized diluted earnings per share came in at $0.42 and exceeded our outlook due to better core sales results. ","Now, let's move to the segment performance. Core sales for the Learning & Development segment increased 0.9% in Q4, reflecting core sales growth in both Baby and Writing. ","Within Baby, the Forever franchise and toddler car seats, along with new innovation in the swingers category, continues to drive POS growth for Graco. Growth in the core Writing business more than offset the headwind from weakness in the slime category. ","Core sales for the Food & Commercial segment also increased 0.9%. The Food business grew nicely in Q4, reflecting the benefit from the previously disclosed shift in selling for Black Friday orders as well as strength in the fresh preserving franchise. ","The Commercial division, while still under pressure, improved sequentially relative to Q3 as the team is making progress and rebuilding the momentum. ","Note that starting in Q4 the Commercial business now includes the Rubbermaid commercial products, Mapa\/Spontex and Quickie businesses.","In Q4, core sales for the Home & Outdoor Living segment declined 2.8%. The Home Fragrance business built on the momentum from the prior quarter during the important holiday period, reflecting strength in e-commerce, EMEA and the wholesale channel. The team opened a new state-of-the-art research and development facility in South Deerfield, Massachusetts, which enhances capability and capacity to develop, prototype and test new innovations across the entire range of products within the home fragrance portfolio. ","As anticipated, the Connected Home & Security business declined as a result of sell-in timing for the fire safety month promotions, which helped Q3. ","Core sales for the Outdoor & Recreation business remained in the negative territory. ","Lastly, core sales for the Appliances & Cookware segment remained soft, declining 4.6%. Similar to what we've experienced in recent quarters, softness in North America more than offset strong results in Latin America.","Let's switch gears to cash flow, which came in ahead of our expectations due to diligent efforts across the organization to reduce the company's working capital needs. ","Operating cash flow improved more than 24% year-over-year to $620 million during the seasonally most significant quarter of the year. This was a remarkable achievement, particularly considering the lost contribution from businesses that have been sold. ","During the fourth quarter, we used the proceeds from the US Playing Cards transaction, as well as operating cash flow to reduce the company's debt by over $600 million, with plans in place to continue to strengthen the balance sheet in 2020. ","We exited 2019 with a net debt to continuing operations normalized EBITDA leverage ratio of 4.0 times, a meaningful improvement versus last year. ","Turning the 2020, I want to start by providing some context for our plan. In 2020, we are planning another year of sequential progress on top line growth and improvement in operating margin, driven by growth productivity improvements and overhead reduction, which more than offset the impact of higher advertising and promotion spending, commodity and wage inflation, tariffs and foreign exchange. ","And we expect to deliver another strong year of cash flow as we continue to drive improvement in our cash conversion cycle. ","The unfortunate outbreak of the coronavirus has taken over recent headlines and we are closely monitoring the situation to, first and foremost, ensure the safety of our employees as well as plan for business continuity. ","Based on what we know today, we are pleased that there are no suspected or confirmed coronavirus cases for any direct Newell staff. While we do not have any significant third-party suppliers in the Wuhan area, our suppliers are experiencing some disruption from slower startup in the factories after the Chinese New Year break and more restricted travel in the country. ","Our current outlook for the first quarter assumes about a 1% headwind on top line from these issues, mostly impacting the Appliances & Cookware and Outdoor & Recreation businesses. ","Our guidance assumes the impact is temporary and contained to the first quarter. Our cross functional team will continue to stay close to the situation and implement mitigating actions as necessary. ","Specifically, our initial outlook for 2020 is the following. Net sales of $9.4 billion to $9.55 billion, with core sales flat to down 2% and a more than 100 basis point headwind from foreign currency, closure of underperforming Yankee Candle retail stores as well as the exit by Newell from the North America distribution of Uni-ball writing products.","Normalized operating margin improvement of 10 basis points to 40 basis points to 10.9% to 11.2% as carryover pricing, meaningful productivity gains and tight overhead spending fund increases in A&P and capability investments, and offset approximately $165 million in inflationary tariff and currency related pressure.","Normalized effective tax rate is expected to be in the mid-teens range.","We expect to normalize diluted earnings per share in a range of $1.46 to $1.56, with the diluted share count around 426 million. ","We expect 2020 to be another strong cash flow year and are forecasting cash flow from operations in the $1.0 billion to $1.15 billion range, with free cash flow productivity in excess of 100% for the second consecutive year. ","In fact, based on Newell's strong cash flow generation capability, the free cash flow yield based on the current stock price is over 9%. ","Looking at Q1 specifically, we currently expect net sales in the $1.9 billion to $1.95 billion range as core sales are forecast to be down 3% to 5%, largely reflecting timing impacts of order shipments in FOOD related to SAP implementation in the prior year and Home Fragrance pipeline build related the WoodWick wholesale expansion in the prior year, as well as the potential incremental headwinds from the coronavirus. ","We currently anticipate normalized operating margins to decline 50 basis points to 90 basis points to 5.2% to 5.6% due to an increase in advertising spending versus the prior year. ","Given the seasonality of the business, Q1 is the smallest quarter of the year for Newell Brands, which means that comparisons can be easily skewed. ","The normalized effective tax rate is estimated in the low-single digits. ","Normalized diluted earnings per share for the company are projected within $0.05 to $0.08 range with a diluted share count around 425 million. ","In closing, we are very excited about the progress we have made on the turnaround strategy in 2019 and we expect to deliver another year of sequential progress in 2020. ","The leadership team that we are building gives us confidence that we will continue to improve the operating performance of the company and build shareholder value. ","Operator, let's now begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren Lieberman","Morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you are thinking about the innovation process and filling up that pipeline. If there's things you could talk about in terms of sourcing ideas, things you're doing to better understand the consumer landscape. I think there's been, in the last five years, probably an enormous amount of activity in some of your categories, from smaller kind of more upstart brands where you might not have thought \u2013 I wouldn't have necessarily thought that was going to happen in the categories in which Newell competes. So, if you start with the lens through which you're looking to upgrade and evolve the innovation process would be great. Thanks.","Ravi Saligram","Thank you so much, Lauren, for the question. First of all, you've hit on something really critical because the super majority of our businesses, in fact, probably all of them, are very responsive to innovation. And, yes, in some categories, we've taken our eye off the ball and let some people come up and come out with the innovation. ","Now, the whole point about this, I think the first point is we've got to create a consumer first mindset in the company where the DNA fundamentally shifts to say, you've got to understand the consumer journey from beginning to understand. And it also is about being on trend, understanding what are the trends, anticipating them, and really being on top of them. And part of that is about colors, it's about design, it's about form, but also about real insights where you say, 'Hey, can you do meaningful innovation?'","The second part of it is, we have even \u2013 so, take Appliances & Cookware, we have 36 categories. There are a lot of categories which are small and were ignored for almost a decade. And that's where someone will come up and say, let's do something. So, you want to renovate even your smaller categories. They don't have to be magical, but you've got to bring news because news is pretty important. ","And then, the third part is, once you get that, have you scaled these innovations in the marketplace through really focusing on the right marketing mix and saying which ones do you really go after? ","So, when you think about it today, this year, we've got the year of the pen. And I think that team's done a brilliant job because they got in front of it. They realized that the pen category is a large category. We have a terrific brand in Sharpie that has amazing consumer equity, but was not in pens. And from that, they really drove innovation and it was a cross-functional collaboration team. They also did it with speed. So, I really believe it can be done, and hence bringing in really consumer-driven people who have both packaged goods experience, durables experience, who understand the gamut of consumer, people like Mike, people like Kris coming in, and I think we'll populate the businesses with people who really have done innovation all their lives. ","So, I'm quite confident. It's just a matter of when, not if.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, thank you.","Christopher Peterson","Lauren, the only other one point I would add is that we did over the past 12 months put an innovation review process in place, which we've now gone through with each of the divisions. And not surprisingly, you can see the divisions that we've returned to core sales growth are the divisions that have the strongest innovation pipeline. ","And I think if you look broadly at the company today, our innovation pipeline, as we sit here today, for the next couple of years is stronger today than where we were 12 months ago. ","We're not where we need to be fully yet. I think we've got four divisions that we've talked about that we've returned to core sales growth this year, and we feel very good about their innovation pipelines. I think we've got \u2013 we're making very good progress on Food & Commercial, as Ravi had mentioned. And I think the two places where we have gaps in the innovation pipeline are Appliances and Outdoor, and those are going to take a little longer for us to fully repopulate.","Ravi Saligram","One other thing I'd add is, you asked about, are we going to look outside. First, to me, because we, with the business unit structure, had become a little bit of a commonwealth of independent states, the collaboration between our R&D groups has not been a sight. So, we're going to be creating centers of excellence. So, for instance, our Connected Home is really good on Internet of Things. And yet, we also need that for something like Dymo in Writing. How do we connect these two groups to exchange best practices? ","Secondly, we are going to start partnering with firms outside which are doing a lot of innovation work and to get to breakthrough ideas and breakthrough innovations because we can't just say everything is going to come from inside. There's a lot of people who are doing things outside. And so, we're going to look at that. ","When you look at \u2013 the other thing is strategic shifts. Brilliant one has been Home Fragrance where they've gone from a candle company to a home fragrance company and that shift has allowed us to come out with car air fresheners, outdoor candles. And so, they are really \u2013 and the collaboration between marketing and R&D there is superb.","Nancy O'Donnell","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. ","Olivia Tong","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to start on core sales. Clearly, Q1, you explained a little bit of the step down relative to Q4, but your plan assumes core sales growth potentially by year-end. So, can you talk a little bit about the steps to getting there and what your view is on price versus volume? And also, how much more SKU rationalization are you anticipating after a 25% reduction this year?","Christopher Peterson","Yeah. So, if you look at the core sales guidance and the plan that we have, as I mentioned, we feel more confident in our innovation pipeline heading into this year than we did at this time last year. ","Our core sales guidance for the year of flat to down 2%, if you look at it on a two-year stack basis, is actually a 400 basis point improvement in 2020 versus what the two-year stack number would be for 2019. We do get off to a little bit of a slower start in the first quarter, which is our seasonally smallest quarter because of the three timing issues that I mentioned, which is the SAP conversion that we did in the Food business, April 1 last year that we mentioned on the first quarter call last year; the pipeline shipment on WoodWick as we expanded that into wholesale; and the coronavirus impact that I mentioned. But we're confident in the year because we can see the stronger pipeline of innovation that we've got coming for the full year.","Olivia Tong","Are you looking for incremental acceleration in the businesses that are growing or for more of a turnaround in the brands that aren't currently growing? ","And then, Ravi, as you look further into this portfolio, does your outlook assume any potential for any exits of either product lines, brands, what have you?","Ravi Saligram","Yeah. So, I think \u2013 look, you're always going to leverage your strengths. And clearly, the businesses that have strength, we're going to continue to drive them and they're going to be two plus the four that have already been mentioned, but we are also optimistic about Food, which did well into Q4, as I mentioned. ","I think now \u2013 with Kris coming on board, I think it's really \u2013 I'm very bullish about the Food business. And our RCP, the Rubbermaid Commercial and Mapa\/Spontex were really making \u2013 the core business of \u2013 the contractual business is in good shape with good innovation. It's the consumer business of that business that we need to address and we're already doing a lot of stuff there now. ","So, with Mike coming onboard, I feel pretty good. So, that means four plus two. So, the Appliance and Outdoor, we really need to do some work there. So, I think we've got to rely on the first four plus the two.","Now, recognize in Writing, we've got a terrific thing with year of the pen, but we have some issues with slime that is continuing to be a little bit of a drag. But I'm so confident of all the great things that the Writing business is doing, that's going to be a very positive thing for us. ","So, now let me get to the other issue in terms of how do we \u2013 we've got to look at this \u2013 this is not a one-year deal. This is not a sprint. It's a marathon. And I'm still confident the Appliances & Cookware business is a good business. It is growing. We're just losing share and we need to just fix it. And I still think the Outdoor business is a good business. We've made progress now on beverage, which actually had some growth. And the Marmot brand actually had some growth. So, it's just some of the other ones that have been under a little bit of a down-drag. ","So, overall, I feel that we are making good progress, and that's why longer term, I really \u2013 and the reason I joined is really because I feel we've great brands and we can improve the trajectory.","Olivia Tong","Thanks, Ravi. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. So, I want to go back to the two problem children, I suppose, Appliances and Outdoor. You guys talked about this morning, replenishing the innovation pipeline, potentially seeing growth in some of those business down the road here. Is it purely an innovation issue or are there other issues in the retail channel, for example, are competitively that are hampering those businesses as well?","Ravi Saligram","So, let me take a shot at it and Chris can add some thoughts. So, let's take each one. The Outdoor & Recreation, we've really got three businesses there. You've got Marmot and ExOfficio, which is the technical apparel business. You've got Coleman and then you've got the beverage business. So, with Contigo and Bubba and so on. ","One thing we've done now, once the organizational changes are made, is really looking at them as three verticals rather than mush them altogether because they are three businesses. And we've created a business champion against each of those businesses, so that they can really have domain expertise and drive it. And we're also getting close to hiring a CEO for the entire business, so I feel pretty good. ","And we are now making goods strides. Yes, it's taken us time. But even on Coleman, on tents \u2013 so, we've got two new tents that have been accepted at a major retailer and we're now beginning to do refreshes of coolers, et cetera. And beverages, we're bringing some innovation looking for distribution gaps.","So, innovation is one part of it, but when you have innovation, it is scaling those. And also, looking at distribution and making sure that you're getting into the right distribution. ","And third, we've got to make sure that channel management is very critical. Like a Marmot brand, you've got to make sure that you manage the channels properly because, if it's an upscale brand, you want to make sure that its identity is kept intact. ","So, I think it goes beyond innovation, but innovation is the starting point. So, it's also your marketing and your sales and you do have private label competitors. For instance, in the tent business, we've got a major retailer who is a big competitor. So, you've got to look at, and given some of these are outsourced from the same places, how do you compete, how do you build the brands.","So, Appliances & Cookware, slightly different. We have a lot of categories there and we've had some companies come in and really take a march on us on innovations. So, we've got to fix that. But there's also that business going a lot online. So, we've got to figure out how do we become digital first. So, those would be couple of the points that I'd make to your point. ","Anything you want to add, Chris, or\u2026?","Chris Peterson ","No, I think that those are the two problem child and I think we know what needs to be done. The only thing I would add is that the categories themselves, we believe, are attractive because the Appliances & Cookware category is growing and it's clearly responsive to innovation. And so, we just have to do a better job of providing that innovation that it is connected to from consumer insights with products that represent a superior value equation and do that in a way that's in strong partnership with our retail partners.","Ravi Saligram","So, one optimistic note I do want to bring in. Just recently, Chris and I toured Japan. And we met with our Japanese outdoor team and it's a sizeable business in Japan. And it's incredible what they've done. It's a premium brand. This I'm talking about the outdoor business. Coleman is a wonderful brand. And that brand there has been growing for the last decade. And even this year, it grew. And they're comfortable \u2013 in Japan, mind you. So, it can be done. It will be done. It's just a matter of when, not if.","Joe Altobello","That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","William Chappell","Thanks. Good morning. ","Ravi Saligram","Good morning, Bill.","Olivia Tong","One housekeeping. Chris, maybe you could talk a little bit about the tax rate in the first quarter and in the full year and then kind of how that's sustainable or where they will go eventually? ","And then, on the question on Home Fragrance, on the core growth this year, the expectations, are there any further doors to close or is that largely done? And where do you see the distribution gains coming to kind of offset that?","Ravi Saligram","You take the first one.","Chris Peterson","I'll start with the tax rate. So, the tax rate guidance that we gave for both the quarter and for the full year is impacted by discrete tax items. So, the company has a number of discrete tax items that are opportunities that we are aggressively pursuing. You saw that in the results this year and that is factored into our guidance for both the first quarter and for the full year next year. ","If you look at the ultimate going tax rate of the company as we sit here today, the tax rate in the US for the company is about in the mid-20s and our international tax rate is about in the teens. And so, on a consolidated basis, a going tax rate excluding discrete items would be somewhere around 20%. But in any given year, it could be less or more than that based on the discrete item. So, that's the current situation with the tax rate.","Ravi Saligram","So, on the Home Fragrance side, Bill, look, first of all, that team's doing a terrific job and went and did the innovation review with them and they are really firing on all cylinders. And they've been very thoughtful about the retail business. In fact, I have one of my former colleagues, who's an expert at retail, go take a look at the retail business and I think they've been quite thoughtful about it. ","The retail business does serve for us as good brand building and awareness building, but they're all located in malls and you know what's happening in malls, and the traffic is coming down. And so, for us, I think it's just being pragmatic and making sure we look at each store to say, is it profitable or not. And if it's not over time and the lease comes up for renewal, either we'll renegotiate the lease or terminate it. ","But the good news is there is a real shift occurring. First, we're making tremendous inroads with the mass merchants on this and the team has done a super job; second, our own direct-to-consumer business is doing superbly well as well. So, it's a matter of transferring the volume. So, we'll systematically shut down stores if they're not profitable and if we can't get the lower lease rates. But there will be a glide path. But as we do that, we're going to keep transferring the volume to other channels.","Chris Peterson","Yeah. Specifically, we closed 75 stores in 2019. And I would expect in 2020, it'll be probably a similar number of stores that we'll close. We don't know exactly the number because what's happening as we go to close stores is, in many cases, the landlords come back to us and say, well, if we cut your rent, would you stay. And so, in some cases, if the reduction in rent that we're able to achieve turns the store profitable, we're agreeing to stay for a short period of time. Typically, not agreeing to leases any longer than 12 months out, though.","William Chappell","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Quick housekeeping question from me as well and then a larger question on margin investment level. So, the housekeeping one relates to the coronavirus. Can you just remind us how much of Newell's total business as a percent of sales is currently sourced from China? ","And then, the bigger question for both of you is the longer-term opportunity for margins and adequacy of investment level. So, the guidance is 10 basis points to 40 basis points of margin improvement this year. Chris, you look forward, of course, to CAGNY. You talked about 200 basis points to 300 basis points of opportunity in gross margin, there is 400 basis points to 500 basis points in overheads, so there's 600 basis points to 800 basis points opportunity, of which I think loosely the expectation was half of that could potentially flow through to earnings. So, that's all a big wind up for how should investors be thinking about the long-term margin opportunity and cadence of that margin improvement for Newell?","Ravi, are you comfortable with current investment levels? And then, as you know, it's not terribly uncommon for a new CEO to take an earnings reset. Did you give any thought to that? You seem pretty bullish on the portfolio and the opportunity to return to growth. Could you potentially accelerate that pass by leaning in here a bit more heavily on investment levels this year? Thanks for all that.","Ravi Saligram","Chris, why don't you start?","Chris Peterson","So, I'll start. Let me handle coronavirus first. So, the company has about 40% to 50% of its total business that is sourced. I don't know that we've disclosed specifically how much of that 40% to 50% percent is from China, but it's a significant part of that that comes from China. Not a 100%, but a significant portion. I would say Chin is our largest sourcing country out of that 40% to 50%. ","That being said, what we're seeing on coronavirus, just to be clear, is our suppliers factories have all started up. The issue is that the workers in those factories are returning to work a little bit slower than what they typically would have because of travel restrictions and then the movement of goods in the country is a little bit slower because of checkpoints and travel restrictions\\. And so, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're staying close to it. Our guidance assumes about a 1% negative impact to core sales in Q1, but we don't at the moment contemplate that this will have a material impact to the year because of the timing of when it's occurring, assuming that the situation continues to resolve. Obviously, we're not predicting what's happening to the situation, but that's our current view.","On the margin point, at CAGNY last year, our reported margins in 2018 were 9.1%. This year, we ended at 10.8%. So, our operating margin in 2019 is up 170 basis points from the reported operating margin in 2018, which was the number that I was starting from at CAGNY.","Of that 170 basis points, 50 basis points was like-for-like operating margin improvement and 120 basis points was because of the mix impact of keeping the Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Mapa and Quickie business. So, we've already taken a big step forward on operating margins. ","If you look at the margin guidance for this year of up 10 basis points to 40 basis points, I think it reflects broadly what we're talking about, which is the contribution from growth productivity and from overhead reduction is significantly higher than the 10 basis points to 40 basis points, but we are reinvesting a good portion of those savings back into higher advertising and promotion spend and into capability building investments that we think will set us up to continue to drive momentum going forward.","Ravi Saligram","Okay. So, let me address, Kevin, your question. So, fair point on typically new CEOs want to reset. But, look, this is your \u2013 I'm a third time CEO. So, not here to prove things. Sole focus here is to drive shareholder value and get employees and gear it up, make Newell strong for the future. So, I think that's really my MO and agenda here. ","So, having said that, when I look at our portfolio and looking at our challenge ahead, I'm very pragmatic that we're in a turnaround. This is \u2013 I think I was very clear. This is not a transformation and I think Chris recognized that, and hence it was easy for me to build on that.","Second, this is like a big jumbo jet. And say, it's got eight engines, maybe two are out and two we are sort of repairing, but you've got to fly to the destination. You can't just say we'll take a break; you're at mid-air. So, you recognize there are certain challenges that \u2013 you've got to walk and chew gum at the same time.","So, is the level of investments in certain areas what I'd like it to be? No. The most telling one on that is A&P. I just feel, for a consumer company, our A&P is pretty low. And we really need to increase it and we're marginally trying to do that. But in the meanwhile, with whatever we have, we just have to be very smart about how we spend it, so that we're optimizing those dollars for the maximum impact behind the biggest innovations we have. But, over time, you'll see us, as we start getting efficiencies, that we will start reinvesting more in A&P, so that that'll help us grow. But I think it is a pay-as-you-go, as opposed to saying let's do an investment now and, hey, new CEO, I'll give you the hockey stick later. I don't think we can do that. We've got to be clear. Hence, the importance of Project FUEL, which for me is one of the biggest bets I have personally made as a CEO and which is why my secret weapon is Chris to oversee it because that is going to be one of our biggest things which will flow dollars to operating income, but also help us reinvest for the future.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. Thank you both. Look forward to seeing you at CAGNY next week.","Ravi Saligram","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.","Wendy Nicholson","My first is just a follow-up sort of clarification. Chris, on the gross margin, is there a specific gross margin goal for 2020? If you could just circle back on that, that'll be great. ","And then, my second question, sort of bigger picture, is just in terms of the outlook for core sales growth. Obviously, it's shifted out on the first quarter, which is totally fine, but I'm just trying to get a sense for how much of the improvement in core sales growth do you think comes from regaining some lost distribution that you've had over the last couple of years? Is it that you have specific line of sight to new products that you know you will be launching? It still sounds like the innovation process is still [indiscernible]. So, I'm trying to get more confident in that core sales growth outlook. Thanks.","Chris Peterson","Thanks, Wendy. On the gross margin point, we're not going to guide gross margins specifically. We guide operating margin. That being said, I will say that our plan is for gross margin to move up meaningfully in 2020 versus 2019 based on the Project FUEL initiative that Ravi talked about and that we've kicked off. We've put a pretty good program in place over the last 18 to 24 months, beginning to build capability to go after both procurement savings, manufacturing efficiency savings, improvements and planning, the SKU count reduction as I mentioned in the prepared remarks where we've taken out 28,000 SKUs this year. Our starting point when you include Rubbermaid Commercial, Mapa and Quickie now was 101,000 at the beginning of 2019. We're down to about 73,000 at the end. And I think that we've got a plan to get below 50,000 over the next 12 to 18 months. So, we'll continue that journey. And that drives significant efficiency. ","On the core sales side, maybe a way to think about it is if we delivered of minus 1.9% core sales growth in 2019 and we're guiding for sequential improvement flat to minus 2%. If the four businesses that we grew in 2019 continue at the current rate and the Food & Commercial business improves based on what we've seen already in the fourth quarter and what we know of the innovation pipeline, even if Appliances & Cookware and Outdoor & Rec stay about the same rate of decline in 2020 as 2019, that gets you to the sequential rate of improvement that we're talking about.","Ravi Saligram","And let me add something there. If you think about some of the key tactical actions that we're taking with \u2013 and these are not necessarily in order of priority, but, yes, there is definitely a thrust to improve our distribution, particularly in some channels which we're relatively not as strong in terms of grocery, drug and dollar stores. And I mentioned the chief customer officer and we're bringing that person in. We're also going to create a VP level for the enterprise as a whole. The BUs will sell their own. But I think for this, because we have got opportunities across different categories, different businesses, so I think that'll certainly be an area we're going to look at. ","Online will continue to be an important growth area for us and we were double digits in 2019 and that will continue to be a thrust for us. ","International, which turned positive, we'll continue to drive that. And then, clearly, we've got some innovations for 2020 that are in the works in each of the businesses that we hope will give us some traction.","Wendy Nicholson","Terrific. That's helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers ","Good morning, guys. Ravi, when we last talked, you seemed very focused on two things in addition to filling some key positions, which seems to be progressing well. Number one was eradicating complexity across the business. And number two was landing on the right operating model for Newell, balancing the desire for scale and unification against the individual needs of your different businesses. You started to address this in your prepared remarks and perhaps we'll hear more next week, but could you give us an update on how far developed you consider you're thinking to be on both those two things? Specifically, your confidence that you have line of sight to simplification issues for 2020. Chris mentioned SKU reduction plans, but beyond that. ","And on the organization front, is it fixed? Should we be surprised that the model continues to be tweaked? And I'm particularly curious, like how functions such as R&D and e-commerce and marketing fit in and whether those are going to be more centralized and more autonomous going forward relative to the past? Just anything you can offer around that would be great.","Ravi Saligram","Sure. I think on the complexity side, I actually think that Chris laid out a really good framework in 2019 and we're executing against it. And it is really SKU reduction. It is reducing obsolete inventory, the whole E&O side. It is about forecast accuracy. It is about standardizing systems. And it is really about improvising our network of plants, improving efficiencies. Lot of it's about automation, standardization. ","In many ways, Newell \u2013 even though it had a centralized structure for a while, this legacy things for each business did its own thing. We have hundreds of applications. And even with the standardization or SAP, there are homegrown systems that people have become very fond of. We've got to speak a common language. So, that's why putting someone in charge who is very good at it, like Chris and saying, 'hey, your job, think of him as the chief complexity reduction officer that you've got to really \u2013 because without that, it's very tough to move forward. ","There're so many \u2013 even on overheads, we can't really move on the next step because there are structural barriers. We do so much manual work on our AR and our A&P, there's just lot of that and that's why this global business services, really going after that, is pretty important. So, I think that complexity, I feel pretty good about what we've got.","On the BU structure, in my mind, there is pretty good clarity now. So, I think with Newell, culture was we don't have a dimmer switch. We're either completely centralized or we say completely decentralized where the completely decentralized is commonwealth of independent states and everyone declaring UDI, unilateral declaration of independence, or so centralized and bureaucratic, no one can move. I think we really have \u2013 getting to a hybrid model. I think it's very important that when you have disparate products and categories, the BU is the center of attention. So, we've got to really focus there and we're creating CEOs for that. ","So, the marketing, sales, R&D will still be housed there. The connecting point is the enterprise for efficiencies. But even on R&D, how do you exchange best practices. So, the way you do that is not just structure, but through becoming very collaborative and that teams are more important than the individual.","Steve Powers","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you. Good morning. So, my question is a follow-up on your comments about margin. So, on the bridge to full year margin outlook, the EBIT expense, about 30 basis points at the midpoint. So should we think about the gross margin improvement in 2020 because of this SKU rationalization, but that will fund more A&P and R&D? Or are those two accounts from your comments before \u2013 it sounds as if you're now going to go up that much this year yet, and then use some of those gross margin dollars into rebuilding the structures and in other words creating more capabilities on those areas. So, how we should be thinking on all the puts and takes between gross margin accretion and EBIT expansion? Thank you.","Chris Peterson ","Yeah. So, just on that question, I expect the gross margin to improve more than the operating margin in 2020. So, if our operating margin is 10 basis points to 40 basis points of improvement, I think the gross margin improvement will be ahead of that. And then, there'll be reinvestment back, primarily in A&P, that mitigates that. And we're also driving overhead costs down year-over-year on a dollar basis. So, that's effectively the way to think about the components of it.","Andrea Teixeira","Yeah. Thank you. Go ahead.","Ravi Saligram","Did you have a quick follow-up for Chris? Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.","Andrea Teixeira","Yeah, Ravi. Thank you. Yeah, Chris. So, I just wanted \u2013 the follow-up that I \u2013 I think we're all trying to figure out the order of magnitude, right, if it's going to be really transformational, the A&P investment this year. Or we should be thinking more of a transition here, as you highlighted before, to make sure that you're not throwing dollars at projects that are not fully baked in. Is that the way we should be thinking? Or, no, you'll have great visibility on the businesses that are working well and you want to make sure those get fully funded?","Chris Peterson ","Look, I think that maybe another way to think about it is, as we mentioned, our innovation pipeline heading into this year is stronger than our innovation pipeline was heading into last year, but it's not yet fully where we want it to be because of where we are with Appliances and Outdoor. And so, with a stronger innovation pipeline, our plan calls for us to spend more in advertising and promotion behind it, which we think is a good investment, but we're probably not spending the full amount that we'd like to because we're not going to spend in areas where we don't have strong innovation because that we don't think is a good use of money. ","As I said, we're not going to give specific guidance on the components. Our guidance is on operating margin, but, conceptually, you're going to see the gross margin being stronger than the operating margin. Advertising and promotion, we expect to be up as a percent of sales. And then, overhead costs, we're working and have a plan to reduce overhead dollars. And obviously, we'll report more as we go throughout the year.","Ravi Saligram","Okay. So, with that, thank you all for joining us today. We're going to be at CAGNY. So, Chris and I look forward to seeing many of you there next week [indiscernible]. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you, everyone.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After a brief discussion by management, we will open up the call for questions. In order to stay within the time scheduled for the call, please limit yourself to one question during the Q&A section. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellbrands.com on the Investor Relations homepage under Events and Presentations.","I will now turn the call over to Nancy O\u2019Donnell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O\u2019Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O\u2019Donnell","Thank you. Welcome everyone to Newell Brands fourth quarter conference call. I\u2019m Nancy O\u2019Donnell. And with me today are Mike Polk, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Peterson, in his debut call as our new Chief Financial Officer.","Please recognize that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations and plans. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any such statements made today. If you review our most recent 10-Q filing and our other SEC filings, you will find a more detailed explanation of the risks, uncertainties and inherent limitations in such forward-looking statements.","During the call today, we will focus our discussion on non-GAAP financial measures, including those which we refer to as normalized measures. Management believes providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. The comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation between the two measures can be found in our earnings release tables, as well as on the Investor Relations area of our website and our filings with the SEC.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Polk","Thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. I want to start by welcoming Chris Peterson, our new CFO, to his first Newell Brands earning call. Welcome, Chris, and thanks for joining the team. I hope you felt in your first nine weeks here, a warm welcome from all of us at Newell. I\u2019m personally very pleased to have Chris on board, and I look forward to working together to strengthen our operating and financial performance, while simultaneously shaping the future of the Company.","Today, I\u2019ll offer a brief perspective on our fourth quarter results, as well as the progress we\u2019re making on our key strategic priorities. Chris will then provide a detailed review of our financial performance and our outlook for 2019 before we open it up for your questions.","Let me start by saying that our performance is beginning to turn the corner. And for the second consecutive quarter, we\u2019ve made good progress. We made a series of organization and leadership changes starting in May that have served us well, been right for the organization, and with strong leadership increasingly in key positions and investable teams in place, our progress should accelerate through 2019.","Some of our leaders are own grown, like Laurel Hurd in Writing; Rich Wuerthele, in Home Fragrance; Tom Russo, in Connected Home; and David Hammer, in Appliances & Cookware. And some have come to us from the outside, like Chris Peterson, our new CFO, and Mike Donohoe, who runs Outdoor & Rec, having joined us from Kraft Heinz, where he led the flagship cheese and meat business. And Russ Torres, who has driven the [cost] [ph] work over the last couple of years, establishing our new supply chain organization, while simultaneously leading our Baby business through the turbulence of the Toys\"R\"Us bankruptcy. And Dennis Senovich, our Company\u2019s new \u2013 supply chain transformation leader, who has recruited and built a team of professionals, who will in partnership with our talented leaders in the division, transform our supply chain over the coming years.","This blend of own grown and new talent are driving our transformation. And they and their teams have exhibited the grit and determination to deliver results through adversity over the last six months. They believe in our capacity to transform, while simultaneously reigniting our growth and performance, and are busy driving that commitment into action.","Their work is focused in five core areas. First, we are turning the business to a consistent pattern of delivery. This means setting appropriate milestones and delivering against them, and strengthening our operating discipline to make the business more predictable and efficient.","Second, they\u2019re working hard to optimize our cost structure by delivering on our ongoing savings programs and extracting the retained corporate costs, related to the Accelerated Transformation Plan divestitures. We\u2019ve made good progress on costs over the summer and into the fall, with more actions to follow in 2019.","Third, they are focused on increasing cash flow, by driving profitable growth in transforming our working capital by reducing complexity across our business system. Over the next two years we expect to reduce our continuing operations SKU count by over 35%. This effort, coupled with other working capital initiatives, should yield significantly improved working capital ratios and free cash flow productivity.","Fourth, they are shaping and focusing our portfolio on the most attractive businesses. Executing the divestitures as described in the Accelerated Transformation Plan, and perhaps more importantly, they\u2019re making sharp choices, allocating the most resource to the most attractive businesses, deploying more A&P and innovation activity to those businesses with the greatest potential for accelerated growth and performance.","And fifth, they are repositioning the organization for more consistent and sustained operating performance, restructuring division and function designs, while simultaneously strengthening and upgrading talent. In the fourth quarter, we made progress in all five of these areas. Specifically, we delivered sequential improvement in core sales growth in all segments.","Learning & Development growth strengthened in the fourth quarter, driven by Writing. Excellent holiday merchandising of Sharpie and Elmer\u2019s gift sets, the launch of Glow-in-the-Dark slime from Elmer\u2019s and new metallic colors from Sharpie, coupled with the expansion of Slime around the world, and good growth on fine writing in the U.S. and Asia yielded strong core sales growth.","Baby continue to make progress against year ago comparators that include Toys\"R\"Us, delivering innovation and distribution led share growth on Graco\u2019s swings and high chairs, and NUK Sippy cups and bottles. Food & Appliances results also improved substantially, driven by the launch of a new line of Calphalon appliances, year two support on Calphalon Space Saving Cookware, distribution driven share gains on Rubbermaid TakeAlongs, and Oster growth in blending in the U.S. and Brazil.","New Crock-Pot innovations in express cooking solidified our number two share position in the express cooking segment. However, we were late to this segment, and face formidable competition, more progress is needed here.","Home & Outdoor Living made good progress in the fourth quarter, as a result of strong share growth on Yankee Candle, Chesapeake and WoodWick in the U.S. FTM channels, our return to growth on Home Fragrance in Europe, excellent innovation-driven growth in Contigo behind the launch of Couture, thermal beverage containers, and continued strong growth on First Alert. These gains were offset by the impact of lost distribution on coolers and air beds, which we will continue to face into through the second quarter of 2019.","And Home Fragrance was also burdened by Yankee Candle\u2019s mall-based retail store footprint, which continues to be a drag on growth and margins. We intend to exit unprofitable mall-based retail stores as their leases expire, and expect to end 2019 with just over 400 stores.","Beyond our sequential progress on growth, we delivered increased normalized gross margins and operating margin percentages versus prior year in the fourth quarter, despite higher inflation related to resins and transportation, the imposition of tariffs on many of our businesses, and the increasingly negative impact of foreign exchange. The operating margin increase was delivered in the context of our highest A&P investment levels of the year at nearly 5% of revenue.","Pricing and productivity were positive contributors in the quarter, with particularly good progress in securing sourced finished goods, cost concessions in the face of tariffs, and strong value engineering cost reduction impact, particularly in packaging materials. We also made substantial progress on overheads. We were pleased with this outcome, but our progress needs to continue as we expect the headwinds we faced in Q4 to stiffen in the first half of 2019.","On cash, we delivered about $500 million of operating cash flow, bringing our second half operating cash flow to nearly $1.1 billion. This result was less than what we forecast, driven in part by the completion \u2013 the completion timing of the Jostens and Pure Fishing deals, higher cash taxes and transaction related costs, as well as lower accounts payable balance.","We expect to deliver more sustainable performance on payables going forward as we\u2019re making very good progress, integrating extended payment terms into our sourced finished goods contracts. This work began in earnest in late 2017 through our procurement organization, with measurable progress in 2018 and more to come over the next two years.","With respect to portfolio changes in the quarter, we completed the divestitures of Jostens Inc., passing back over $1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends, while reducing debt and exiting the year at our target leverage ratio of 3.5 times.","On our fifth priority, we\u2019ve actions difficult, but necessary decision to restructure the organization, and those changes contributed to our professional headcount on the continuing businesses being down by about 14% compared to prior year at the end of 2018. There is more work to do, particularly in our back office operations where global business services implementation should drive significant cost reduction in the transactional areas of Finance, IT and HR over the next few years. Chris and his team will lead this work on behalf of the Company.","We are laser focused on strengthening the operational performance and financial flexibility of the Company. While we know we have much more work to do, the fourth quarter was another quarter of sequential progress.","Let me pass the call now to Chris to walk through a deeper review of our financial results and our outlook for 2019. Then I\u2019ll return for some closing comments. Chris?","Chris Peterson","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to have joined Newell Brands as the Company\u2019s CFO and look forward to connecting with many of you over the coming weeks. Over the past 2.5 months I\u2019ve taken a very aggressive onboarding approach, which included meetings with each of the seven continuing divisions, in Atlanta, Boca Raton and Deerfield, Massachusetts. Visiting key manufacturing plants in Merrillville, Wichita, Mogadore and Juarez, Mexico; visiting distribution centers in Broomfield, Shelbyville, and El Paso, Texas; visiting stores for each of the company\u2019s top 10 retail customers.","Investor meetings with the number of both buy and sell-side analysts. Meeting with each member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and finalizing the 2019 budgeting process with each business unit and corporate function. While it\u2019s still early days for me, I\u2019ve come to quickly appreciate both the complexity of the organization as well as the opportunity for significant shareholder value creation over time.","At a high level, my initial observations are as follows. The continuing business comprises a leading group of brands with strong market share positions and brand equities in their respective categories, with the right to win relative to subscale competition. A disruptive external business environment in combination with significant organization change within the Company have weighed on the underlying performance with the full potential of the Company yet to be seen.","There is an opportunity for operational discipline improvements in areas, including; sales and operations planning, working capital management and IT infrastructure, to name a few. The ultimate goal is to return the Company to consistent and sustainable core sales growth, accompanied by operating margin expansion and improved cash conversion cycle. I\u2019m committed to partnering with Mike and the team to drive improvements in these areas.","Moving on to financial results. Net sales from continuing operations in the fourth quarter were down 6% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, driven by headwinds from foreign currency, the adoption of the 2018 revenue recognition standard, and a decline in core sales. For the year, net sales came in at $8.6 billion, modestly below the Company\u2019s expectations due to a stronger than anticipated dollar. In Q4, core sales from continuing operations declined 1.2% year-over-year, in line with the outlook with sequential progress made in each of the Company\u2019s three segments.","Normalized gross margin increased 170 basis points versus last year to 34.7% as the benefits from the Company\u2019s productivity efforts, pricing actions, and the impact of the revenue recognition standard more than offset inflationary pressures including the effect of tariffs. Normalized operating margin improved 70 basis points versus last year, to 11.4%, reflecting the improvement in gross margin as well as the benefits of ongoing cost management. These benefits were partially offset by increased levels of incentive compensation, as well as currency headwinds.","Consistent with the plans to drive consumption, A&P spending moved up sequentially in Q4, both on an absolute basis and as a percent of sales. In the second half of 2018, the Company delivered normalized operating margin at the midpoint of the guidance range.","Net interest expense of $104 million was down from $116 million a year ago as we ended the year with a net debt balance of $6.5 billion as compared to approximately $10.1 billion a year ago. In 2018, we made significant progress strengthening the balance sheet by deleveraging. The normalized tax rate was negative 30%, favorable relative to the year-ago rate of 3.7%, reflecting discrete tax items. Normalized net income from discontinued operations was $107 million, down from $196 million in the year-ago quarter, largely due to the loss of contribution from businesses that have been divested throughout the year, including Waddington, Rawlings, Goody, Pure Fishing and Jostens.","We purchased 44 million shares during the fourth quarter. The weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 452 million, down 7.6% year-over-year. At the end of the year, the Company\u2019s share count approximated 423 million shares. Normalized diluted earnings per share were $0.71 versus $0.68 a year-ago. Normalized diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.47, up from $0.28 last year. Normalized diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.24 versus $0.40 last year.","Let\u2019s now switch gears to segment results. Net sales for the Learning & Development segment decreased 3.2% versus the prior year to $707 million. Core sales inflected back into positive territory and grew 1.7%, driven by healthy growth in Writing, which cycled against significant retailer inventory de-stocking in the office superstore and distributive trade channels in the year-ago period. The Baby business remained under pressure, reflecting continued headwind from the TRU bankruptcy.","Net sales for Food & Appliances declined 7.2% year-over-year to $824 million as core sales contracted 1.7%, largely reflecting reduced promotional activity in Food, partially offset by Appliances growth in Latin America, and the early impact from new appliance innovation in the U.S.","Revenues for the Home & Outdoor Living segment were down 7.2% versus last year to $809 million, with core sales falling 3%. Continued strength in the Connected Home & Security business and a return to growth in Home Fragrance in Europe were more than offset by the ongoing headwind from Yankee retail stores and distribution losses on coolers and air beds in the U.S.","In Q4, the business generated operating cash flow of $498 million compared to $990 million a year ago, largely due to loss of cash flow from businesses that have already been divested, higher cash taxes in transaction related costs, as well as the lower accounts payable balance. During the fourth quarter, we announced and closed on two transactions, Jostens and Pure Fishing, and applied the proceeds to share buyback as well as deleveraging. We successfully completed tender offers for over $2.6 billion of debt, and reached the Company\u2019s targeted leverage ratio of 3.5 times in 2018. During Q4, we also returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends with the full year figure at over $1.9 billion.","Before moving on to the outlook for 2019, I wanted to briefly discuss two new practices that we are adopting this year. First, in order to offer more visibility, particularly in light of the moving parts associated with the divestiture program, during 2019 we will provide guidance both for the full-year, as well as the upcoming quarter. Once we complete the asset sales, we will revisit whether to continue quarterly guidance. Second, we are updating the Company\u2019s normalization practice effect of first quarter 2019. Thus far, the Company has excluded from normalized results, the cost of its Transformation Office, consisting of employees fully dedicated to executing the integration of the merger of Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden, and other costs associated with the integration and start-up of the combined entity, such as advisory costs for process transformation and optimization initiatives.","Now that nearly three years have passed since the transaction, beginning in 2019, the Company will no longer exclude these expenses from its normalized results. Please note that, for ease of comparability, our commentary for 2019 will refer to the year-over-year metrics, adjusting the reported normalized 2018 figures for the new methodology. In 2018, for the continuing operations, these expenses amounted to $96 million or approximately 110 basis points as a percentage of sales. The discontinued operations included additional $12 million of such expenses. You can find the quarterly split in the press release tables issued today.","As we look out to 2019, we expect to stabilize and then reignite core business, executing on an aggressive cost savings agenda and improving the Company\u2019s working capital metrics. Although we generally see healthy macros in the U.S., they are accompanied by continued disruption in the retail landscape, headwinds from currency, uncertainty stemming from tariffs and related price increases, as well as continuation of commodity and transportation inflation. We are planning the business prudently for the year to account for these factors.","This morning we issued an initial outlook for 2019, which calls for net sales of $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion, which represents a decline of 3% to 5%, underpinned by a low single-digit decrease in core sales as well as an approximately 150 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. We expect normalized operating margin to expand 20 basis points to 60 basis points year-over-year versus the adjusted normalized operating margin of 9.1% from 2018, despite higher investment in the business and significant headwinds from inflation, currency, as well as bonus true up.","This forecast assumes that the inflationary pressures from tariffs, commodity and transportation cost, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange amount to approximately $200 million. We plan to mitigate this by pricing actions, productivity, and reduced overhead cost as we optimize the Company\u2019s cost structure.","Normalized effective tax rate for the continuing operations is anticipated to be in the high single-digit range in 2019. Normalized diluted earnings per share for the total Company are expected to be between $1.50 and $1.65 for the year.","The earnings per share outlook also reflects an updated timeline from asset sales. We\u2019ve made considerable progress on the divestiture front throughout 2018, and have completed transactions that have generated over $5 billion of after-tax proceeds. As we embark upon the final wave of divestitures, we have decided to split up the Consumer and Commercial Solutions business and sell the MAPA and Spontex businesses in a separate transaction from the remainder of Consumer and Commercial Solutions, which is largely Rubbermaid Commercial Products along with Rubbermaid Outdoor, Closet and Garage and Quickie. As a result of this decision, we now expect the divestiture timeline to extend until the end of 2019, and our guidance assumes these two businesses are sold in the second half of the year.","Current plans assume that the remaining transactions, which include U.S. Playing Cards, Rexair and Process Solutions are completed by the end of the second quarter. We\u2019ve also modified assumptions surrounding the total expected proceeds to reflect recent market movements and valuations for commercial assets and other conditions. We now expect the combined after-tax proceeds from all of the ATP divestitures to be approximately $9 billion.","The earnings per share outlook that we shared reflects the aforementioned timing of asset sales and the expected deployment of the proceeds toward further debt pay down and share repurchases. Given the expected timing of the transactions, we currently anticipate a modest reduction in diluted shares outstanding in 2019 relative to the year-end position of 423 million shares in 2018.","We currently forecast $300 million to $500 million in cash flow from operations for the total Company for 2019. Within this outlook, we are accounting for a meaningful year-over-year loss of cash flow from the assets that have been sold or will be sold throughout 2019, approximately $200 million in cash taxes and transaction costs related to divestitures, and over $200 million of restructuring and related cash costs. One of our key priorities is to make significant progress on working capital by improving the cash conversion cycle.","Turning to Q1 2019. It is important to keep in mind that it is a seasonally the smallest quarter of the year, both from the top line and profitability perspectives, and the business typically uses cash during the quarter.","Company\u2019s guidance contemplates the following assumptions for Q1. Net sales of $1.66 billion to $1.7 billion, which represents a decline of 6% to 8%, with core sales down 2% to 4%, and an approximately 300 basis point drag from foreign exchange. Recall that Toys\"R\"Us announced the complete liquidation of its stores in the U.S. in late March 2018, which means the Company will not fully lap this disruptive event until the second quarter.","Normalized operating margin is expected to improve 10 basis points to 50 basis points, relative to the adjusted normalized operating margin of 2.5% from Q1 2018. Normalized effective tax rate for the continuing operations is anticipated to be around 10%. Normalized diluted earnings per share for the total Company are expected to be within a $0.04 to $0.08 range with share count similar to the year-end position. We are assuming full quarter contribution from the businesses that have not been sold yet.","Given the reshaping of the portfolio and significant changes in the external environment, we have started a category and Company strategy update process, which we expect to complete later this year. As such, we believe it is premature for us to provide specific long-term financial goals.","Our long-term goal remains to drive shareholder value improvement through our return to consistent and sustainable core sales growth, operating margin expansion, and improved cash conversion cycle as we reshape the portfolio and create a more focused Company.","While 2018 was a challenging year for Newell Brands, we are encouraged and energized by early signs of a turnaround. As the organizations continues to execute the Accelerated Transformation Plan, I\u2019m excited about the opportunity to help Mike and the team create a simpler, faster and stronger Newell Brands. We expect to make further progress in 2019 through completing the divestiture program, deliver \u2013 delivering sequentially improved core sales and operating margin results versus 2018, while continuing to support the Company\u2019s brands and innovation in the marketplace, and overcoming significant external headwinds, strengthening the Company\u2019s working capital metrics and driving operational discipline across the organization.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks.","Mike Polk","Thanks, Chris. We entered 2019 with building confidence, but also a pragmatic view of the complexity of executing such a broad transformation agenda in the turbulent environment. As Chris laid out in his comments, our outlook for 2019 contemplates a couple of key challenges. The tariff impact on margins in the Toys\"R\"Us impact on our top line. On tariffs, we priced in taking actions through procurement to mitigate some of the negative margin impacts of tariffs, and will complement this with further work on overheads and aggressive complexity reduction.","On top line, we prudently guided core sales growth with the negative consequence of Toys\"R\"Us bankruptcy to our top line in Q1 2019, embed in our outlook. TRU creates an unavoidable 250 basis point headwind for our total company core sales growth in Q1 2019. Despite these challenges, we\u2019re confident in our agenda and our vision for the Company. We have leading brands in large global in growing categories that positively impact hundreds of millions of consumers lives every day where they live, learn, work and play.","We\u2019ve invested to build advantaged capabilities and innovation design in e-commerce to further strengthen these brands. We\u2019ve funded strategic research and done the product development work to significantly strengthen our innovation bundle and our ideas for growth. We\u2019ve proven that our brand and innovation-led strategy coupled with strong commercial selling capabilities that reach consumers where they shop can yield further market share growth in our home markets.","We have much more opportunity to release the trapped capacity for investment in our brands and margin development that\u2019s tied up in overheads in working capital, and we have a massive opportunity to deploy our portfolio outside our home markets, and the development of new channels of distribution make the cost of deployment much lower than it\u2019s ever been in my time in this industry. And we\u2019re strengthening our leadership team at Newell, so that we successfully operationalize this broad agenda and unlock the value creation potential of the Company.","My underlining \u2013 underlying optimism is grounded in the power of our brands, in the green shoots of growth we see in many of our businesses, the strength of our innovation funnel and the increasing capacity to spend behind these ideas. Our leading e-commerce footprint relative to our competition and others in the consumer goods space, which should mix our growth rates up relative to others.","Our strengthening supply chain capability with their very aggressive cost and cash agenda, which should fuel investment while simultaneously driving margin and cash flow improvements, and the unwavering determination and desire to win of our people. This is a powerful formula for growth and performance.","While we play for that future, our focus today is on doing what we say we\u2019re going to do. Both the third and fourth quarters of 2018 were good examples of this commitment in action. We are confident we\u2019re on the right path to reigniting growth in driving operating performance.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Nancy to set up the Q&A.","Nancy O\u2019Donnell","Thanks, Mike. [Indiscernible] turn it over to the operator, I\u2019d like to remind you that we\u2019re asking each caller to limit yourself to just one question. We\u2019re going to try to manage our time to get you out in approximately an hour, and at the same time to fit in as many callers as possible within that time limit. So we appreciate your cooperation. Thanks. And at this time, operator, we\u2019re ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Thanks. Good morning.","Mike Polk","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Chappell","Hi, just a question around kind of your top line outlook for 2019 on the core business. I just want to understand what\u2019s baked in in terms of pricing, in terms of SKU rationalization, how that impact the outlook and does that carry on for beyond this year? And with tariffs and kind of pricing related tariffs you anticipated \u2013 I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to happen, but if there is any rollback of tariff, that you have to roll back pricing or\u2013 in general, what do you expect on price versus volume for this year, and what is SKU rationalization impact on that top line outlook?","Mike Polk","I\u2019ll answer part of that question and then Chris can build. On pricing, we are pricing to cover the absolute tariff impact, dollar for dollar. And we\u2019ve had reasonably good success in landing \u2013 in landing that. And so, while, that will create an issue for us from a margin percentage standpoint from a dollar for dollar standpoint, I think we\u2019re going to be okay, and that pricing is built in to the plan.","Right now we\u2019ve got the 10% tariff rate on category three tariffs in place for January through March, and we\u2019re currently planning to increase again on March 1. Our customers are aware of that. We\u2019ve communicated that. If the tariffs get delayed, we will push that price increase out in that we\u2019ll price appropriately when the tariff increase occurs if it occurs.","We\u2019ve built into our modeling for top line, the volume impact as best we can of what is a substantial amount of pricing, that\u2019s a bit of uncertainty that we have because the kinds of price increases we are talking about typically go beyond the model tolerances for predictability, but we\u2019ve done our best job of estimating that. On SKU rat, I\u2019d pass this \u2013 that onto to Chris maybe to kind of build on my comments.","Chris Peterson","Yes. I guess the thing I would add to Mike\u2019s comments are, in the prepared remarks I mentioned that we have $200 million of headwind from FX, commodities and tariffs combined. And so in addition to the pricing that Mike\u2019s talking about on tariffs, we\u2019re also pricing for commodity inflation and transactional FX. So when you put the three of those factors together, we\u2019ve got a fairly significant amount of pricing built into the guidance.","We\u2019re not pricing for margin on top of that, so there is a bit of a margin headwind from the pricing baked in, but that\u2019s included in the guidance. If the tariffs did get rolled back, I think it would be a benefit to us as a company, but hard to say how that would flow through, because we probably \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t take the pricing for the tariff, if the tariff gets rolls back, as Mike said.","On SKU rationalization, we\u2019re working very hard from a sales and operations planning standpoint. We think there\u2019s a big opportunity to unlock cash conversion, productivity and the supply chain through this SKU rationalization opportunity, and we\u2019re working very hard to manage the phase-in and phase-out of that SKU rationalization effort. And I think that\u2019ll be a theme that we\u2019ll be talking about for the next 18 months to two years or so.","Mike Polk","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, good morning. Just following on that exact line of questioning, one of the pressures I know that you\u2019ve seen on the top line has been choices that you have made to leave some distribution, either unprofitable distribution or channels that you didn\u2019t think represented good partners for the future. So can you talk about the impact of those choices?","From a distribution perspective, how much distribution \u2013 forget about Toys\"R\"Us, but ongoing other retailers \u2013 you\u2019ve left some retail on the appliance side, how much of a headwind is that? Because I guess, just looking at the guidance I totally get the first quarter guidance for core sales, but I\u2019m a little bit surprised that you\u2019re not expecting more of a ramp up in core sales growth in the back half when you\u2019ve lapped some of that. Thanks.","Mike Polk","Well, let me just give you some of the details on the things that are in the base that we need to lap. There is two \u2013 there is two areas where we\u2019ve got lost distribution, and that\u2019s business that we didn\u2019t pursue aggressively through line reviews because of the margin structure and our need to cover inflation and price \u2013 and price the businesses, but there really are a few areas. One is, in the Outdoor category, where in coolers and in air beds, we chose not to price down those businesses because of the margin consequences, they would have been nearly unprofitable gross margin, had we chosen to do that, so we took the hit on top line.","We have lapped \u2013 that it \u2013 those choices in particular have turned out to be good ones as we come into 2019, because the alternatives that our customers chose to pursue haven\u2019t worked out for them. And so there is likely to be some benefits flowing back to us later in the year, but we have to lap those losses through the second quarter. The way the Outdoor category works is the seasonal selling will happen in that March-April time frame, and until we get to that, you don\u2019t get to the resets of the aisles, and so we\u2019ve got that that issue to lap into the second quarter.","On Appliances, we continue to look at the tail of that business and ask questions about whether these are businesses we should be in at the margins they currently have, and we certainly stepped away from some of the lower-end opening price point offerings that existed in non-strategic product families last year. Again, the timing of that is, those choices were Q2. We will continue to prune this business. There just are \u2013 portions of that portfolio that don\u2019t make sense from either a cash generative standpoint or from a margin perspective, and that will be an ongoing headwind that\u2019s contemplated in our guidance. But the big changes we made last year, we lap in the second quarter and we\u2019ll have a little bit longer-tail that drags on through the back half of the year.","Our goal \u2013 our long-term goal is to drive profitable core sales growth ahead of our markets and build market share, and we think we can do that. We want to simultaneously increase our margins and also significantly improve the cash flow productivity in the business. Some of these choices that we\u2019ve made on distributions are designed to enable those outcomes. And so, yes, we\u2019ve been prudent on our guidance, and we think that\u2019s the right posture to take, and where we will do everything we can to do better than that. But for now, given the uncertainty regarding tariff pricing impact on volumes, we think this is the right posture to take.","Wendy Nicholson","Got it. Thank you very much.","Mike Polk","Thanks, Wendy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Good morning, everybody. Welcome aboard, Chris.","Chris Peterson","Thank you.","Steve Powers","So I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how far you can go here on the fly. But I guess I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any way for you to break out the anticipated cash flow guidance continued versus discontinued ops, maybe allocating the pro forma interest expense you expect to pay down through the divestiture program to the discontinued bucket. I mean, even some directional commentary will help, because just, it\u2019s really hard to unpack it all and contemplate the cash earnings power of the RemainCo business without having that detail. So any further transparency there whether today or just going forward would be really helpful. Thanks.","Chris Peterson","Yes. Let me try to provide a little bit of help in this regard. So the operating cash flow guidance that we issued of $300 million to $500 million for the year is the total company operating cash flow. Within that guidance, there\u2019s $200 million of costs that are related to divestitures, which are basically the tax and deal costs related to the divestitures, and there\u2019s over $200 million of restructuring costs. So those two things are effectively one time-ish a nature. So if you were to back those out, that would give you the operating cash flow to the Company, excluding those two things of $700 million to $900 million.","If you look at what\u2019s embedded in that guidance, we expect operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2019 to be significantly better than operating cash flow from the continuing operations was in 2018, and that\u2019s because we see an opportunity for cash conversion improvement. When we look at the cash conversion cycle, and benchmark versus our competitors, our days sales outstanding are relatively high, our days of inventory are relatively high, and our days payable are relatively low. And so we are putting \u2013 and have put, but are putting a aggressive push on each of those areas. And we think that there is opportunity to go after each of them.","We think we can do better at resolving deductions with customers and ensuring that customers comply better with our terms, which will drive our days sales outstanding improvement. We think on inventory, the SKU rationalization program that we\u2019ve talked about, and cutting some of the tail can drive significant improvement in days inventory. And on payables, we think that we\u2019ve got an opportunity to negotiate extended payment terms that are more in line with what the competitive set has been able to do. And when you put that together, I think we\u2019ve got a multi-year cash opportunity on working capital. So...","Mike Polk","Steve, the only thing I\u2019d build is, I think Chris brings a real energy to the space and his partnership with Russ in the supply chain leadership teams on strengthening our working capital metrics, I think it\u2019s going to make a huge difference for us going forward. So it\u2019s \u2013 I think the disciplines around these three areas are the things that Chris will drive into the organization, and I\u2019m really excited about the possibilities for progress here.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey, good morning, Mike. I hope I can sneak in just two, but the first one is just a data point. Mike, what do you think the category growth rate is for the business at this point in time, understanding the core business declining, we had destocking issues, et cetera, et cetera, but I think that\u2019s really important for folks in terms of when you can get back to sort of the normal rhythm here.","And then, but the broader question is, really how you\u2019d like investors to think about productivity and the cost savings opportunity, because, Mike, as you\u2019re well aware, I mean, it was the key reason to own the stock once upon a time with the $500 million synergies going up to $1 billion, but given the challenges, it\u2019s frankly it\u2019s been loss and really there\u2019s nothing just to count in the stock, I would argue for any sort of material upside from it.","And if I\u2019m not mistaken the number now is like $750 million, that is like $600 million from synergies and renewal $150 million stranded overhead, which is a huge number, it\u2019s greater than 8% of sales, but it also doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much commitment in terms of getting after it in any sort of flow through for investors that they can rely upon in a meaningful way. So after being a bit for both, but maybe if you can kind of help us think about that, that\u2019d be helpful. Thank you.","Mike Polk","Sure, Kevin. I\u2019ll start and then I think it would be helpful for you to get to hear Chris\u2019s perspective on what\u2019s going on in this area. So just on your first question on category growth. As you know, we only measure category growth in the U.S., we really don\u2019t have a good way to measure it outside the U.S.. Historically, you know these categories have grown in line with the GDP growth, but there are things that can happen in a market that create catalytic events that drive either expansion or decline. We \u2013 it\u2019s interesting in our numbers in the U.S. in 2018. We see the sort of bifurcated profile where we got some categories with really excellent category growth and that\u2019s generally connected to broaden category distribution for flagship brands or it\u2019s driven by provocative innovation that drives consumer interest in a product family or segment.","Best example for that on us is, if you look at the Calphalon appliances launch in the fourth quarter, and you look at the category growth in the toaster oven product family, you see massive shifts in category growth because of the power of that hero item. And we\u2019re getting share growth on top of that, coupled with that category expansion. That sort of the model in this space. When you bring news and it\u2019s an exciting consumer idea, you can create market growth, and we see that on Home Fragrance as we make Yankee and WoodWick and Chesapeake more broadly available. We see that when we nail an innovation like we have on the toaster oven platform between what we\u2019re doing on Oster and what we\u2019re doing on Calphalon.","And so the key in most of our businesses is for us to accept \u2013 because of our leadership position from a brand perspective, we have to accept our responsibility to drive market expansion. And where we\u2019ve done that well with good ideas executed well in the marketplace, we can do really interesting things. And so I think that\u2019s in our hands when we\u2019ve had a sort of a bifurcated year where in Baby gear you\u2019ve got market contraction because of the shifts going on with Toys\"R\"Us bankruptcy. And then on the other side, you have really vibrant market growth in some categories like Home Fragrance where there\u2019s a lot of activity going on.","But I think the way to plan the business is to think about our category growth globally weighted for our sales based on GDP growth, and that\u2019s historically how this is \u2013 how this has played out. As we come through next year and as we continue to work on margin development, we\u2019ll have more capacity to spend and that shouldn\u2019t enhance our category growth dynamics as well. On cost, I\u2019ll pass it to Chris to give you his impressions. I personally think there\u2019s an awful lot of stuff going on here, and you see it in the way we\u2019ve overcome some of the headwinds on FX and on inflation, but Chris\u2019s fresh eyes in the \u2013 I think you benefit from his perspective.","Chris Peterson","Yes, I think the \u2013 I think the Company has a very aggressive focus on productivity in the cost of goods area, as well as overhead cost reduction. And let me take them sort of each in turn. From the productivity in the supply chain, we think we\u2019ve got opportunities that we\u2019re actioning on manufacturing plant consolidation, distribution center consolidation, we have opportunities to increase forecast accuracy of the SKU level, which will allow us to plan better and take cost out of the system. We\u2019ve got opportunities in automation of lines that drive cost savings.","We\u2019ve got opportunities through the SKU rationalization work that we\u2019ve talked about. And I think that embedded in our guidance is a fairly significant help from that already in 2019. It\u2019s being masked, as Mike mentioned, by the inflationary pressure of commodities, foreign exchange and tariffs. But I think as we \u2013 as those items get behind us, I think you\u2019ll start to see the gross productivity work come through in a much more meaningful way.","On overheads, the Company likewise has a very aggressive plan at cost reduction and right-sizing the organization for the size of the Company post the ATP plan, and that really is looking at a lot of different areas. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, some of the opportunities of the Company has on implementing things like GBS, rationalizing our IT system, for example, when Newell bought Jarden, the Company went from one to, I think 43 ERP systems. We have a plan to get from the 43 ERP systems down to three by the middle of next year.","And so that drives significant opportunity. And the three that we\u2019re going to \u2013 that we\u2019re going to have our SAP across the majority of the business, Oracle for the Home Fragrance business, and SAP retail for Marmot, because it\u2019s a retail oriented business. So I think we\u2019ll be in a much better place to drive scale, synergies through a lot of the activities that we\u2019re moving on across the organization.","Mike Polk","And the only thing that I would build is to call your attention to the guidance, which if you look at the operating margin guidance that we provided on the continuing operations and reflect on Chris\u2019 comments in the script, where he laid out the fact that we have $200 million of headwind connected to tariffs, FX and inflation, you see us committing through guidance to operating margin progression in that context. And so I think that\u2019s sort of the lead indicator of progress from my perspective.","But I think it\u2019s an important question, Kevin, and it is really going to be one of the centerpiece of what we have to focus on not just in 2019, but in 2020 and 2021 as we continue to take the retained costs out of the business, but more importantly give ourselves room in the P&L to invest at higher levels for growth. And that \u2013 I think we\u2019re on the right track, but I think it\u2019s right to continue to challenge us with those types of questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. Good morning.","Mike Polk","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","Hi. I wanted to ask about divestiture proceeds. You extended the timing and the total proceeds now you\u2019re expecting to be slightly lower, but I guess help me understand, if your priorities for debt paydown versus buybacks have changed at all. And then, just wanted to clarify that your EPS guidance does consider both of these, and how we should think about maybe the phasing first half versus second half? Thanks.","Chris Peterson","Sure. So we have updated our guidance on the total proceeds from $10 billion previously to $9 billion is what we\u2019re expecting in total. To-date, our after-tax proceeds that the Company has received has been 5.2% through the end of last year. And our EPS guidance does contemplate the update of the divestiture timing. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, because we\u2019re separating out the MAPA-Spontex business from the CCS business, we\u2019re expecting those two deals to happen in the back half of the year. So the guidance reflects that. The U.S. Playing Cards, Rexair and Process Solutions business effectively we\u2019re expecting to happen by the end of the second quarter.","And as a result, that changes the timing of when the proceeds are coming in versus what the original plan assumed, which is why we are guiding the share count to be only modestly lower this year, because we\u2019re expecting a significant amount of the proceeds from CCS and MAPA-Spontex toward the end of the calendar year. So all of that is embedded in the guidance, but that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s the update on where we are on the divestiture program.","Bonnie Herzog","And then just quickly to clarify the split between the proceeds, is it still 45-55 in terms of debt paydown versus buybacks?","Chris Peterson","Yes. So on that, if you look at what we\u2019ve done through 2018, I think we\u2019ve used about 30% of the proceeds for share repurchase. We\u2019re committed to investing in the business and we\u2019re committed to returning excess cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. I think we\u2019re continually looking at the Company\u2019s capital structure, and I think we will make progress on both debt paydown and share repurchase, but given the moving parts here, it may not be a straight line as what it was previously.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thank you. Good morning.","Mike Polk","Hi, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Hi. So you guys mentioned that you are kind of starting this strategic review process. So two questions off of that, recognizing it\u2019s early days. One is, to what degree you thinking through geography, I feel like when you\u2019d acquired Jarden, part of the conversation was around the geographic opportunities, it opened up for some scaling of entry in some markets. So to what degree geography still sort of an interesting vector, if there is a likelihood of kind of scaling some of that back?","And then the second piece is just to think about the longer-term margin profile of the continuing businesses, because I understand there\u2019s the big headwind that you\u2019ve called out for 2019 on \u2013 in commodity costs and so on and then lower share count, but it also, if you like, there\u2019s implication that there is now a view that the margin structure of the continuing businesses is probably lower than you might have thought previously. So if you could just comment on that or maybe my math is kind of often and it\u2019s too early to pass judgment on that. Thanks.","Mike Polk","Great question, Lauren. So with respect to the future development of our business, there are really three things that we\u2019re focused on. One is, continuing to build out our brand and innovate brand building and innovation agenda for each one of these \u2013 each one of the product families that has the best potential to contribute to both our growth in our margin development. And we are obviously investing to shift our selling capabilities to reach consumers where they shop, and then clearly, there is a huge market product deployment or category deployment opportunity for some of our categories around the world.","And so if you think about this, the three drivers of growth going forward, it\u2019s brands and innovation, it\u2019s leveraging our selling capabilities both in brick and mortar but also increasingly in e-commerce as a result of the scale we have there and the capability we\u2019ve invested to create, and then deploying the portfolio. In my comments, I mentioned that, that\u2019s a huge opportunity, and that the cost of deployment is coming down as a result of the emergence of new ways to deploy your portfolio, and its a function also of consumers ability to get to know brands prior to them arriving onshore. And so, we are committed to deploying the portions of our portfolio that make the most sense to deploy into the markets where the people in the economic development of the world is going to occur.","And so we\u2019ve begun that process, particularly with the focus on Writing, we will do that with Baby over time, and there\u2019s opportunity in the balance of our portfolio is, well, to look \u2013 to look forward and make some of those choices. Chris referred to the category strategy work that we\u2019re doing, we call it Cat-Strat activity in the divisions, that\u2019s a process that we\u2019ve launched, that will culminate with the Board in the summer that will help us make a series of choices that is below the division level, that product family level on which categories are most attractive and offer the greatest potential in which categories deserve disproportionate resourcing.","And so that work is under way. It\u2019s going to be division-led with insight and help from some of our corporate resources, but it\u2019s essential to road mapping the next three to five years of the Company. And it cuts across, it\u2019s not just a growth-oriented discussion, it\u2019s what kind of supply change you need to be able to support the ambition. What kind of capabilities you\u2019re going to need to be able to strengthen the potential outcomes that come through some of those choices.","And so Chris, Rich Mathews, Russ Torres, the division leaders will really drive that process through the summer, and I think it\u2019s going to be really exciting for our people to begin to do this kind of thinking and work an important work for us as we define the roadmap forward.","Chris Peterson","Yes, I guess what I would add, Lauren, just on the numbers is, the Company reported, I think, in 2018 an operating margin for the year of 10.2%. When you adjust that for the normalization Practice Change, that becomes 9.1% because of the 110 basis point differential in the normalization practice, and we\u2019re guiding to 20 basis points to 60 basis points up from the 9.1% for 2019.","Given the work that we\u2019re doing on the category strategy work, as Mike mentioned, and how that ladders into the Company strategy work, we think it\u2019s premature for us to issue long-term guidance. So we are not issuing margin guidance for 2020 or beyond at this point, because we think that that work will help us have better visibility into that.","That being said, we see a clear opportunity to take the operating margin on the continuing business higher over time. The pace and path of that, I think is what will be informed by the strategy update work that we\u2019re doing.","Mike Polk","And the two levers for that will be in overheads, which are still quite high for the Company as a percent of revenue, some of that due to the retained costs associated with the disposals. And the other being gross margin development, which in today\u2019s environment is pretty tough, although I was pleased with what we saw in Q4, and we will work hard next year to overcome the headwinds we\u2019ve talked about.","But if you look backwards, Lauren, at the period between 2011 and 2015 for Newell Rubbermaid, and look at that story, you saw really meaningful gross margin improvement in that window through innovation and through smarter deployment of our programming against the businesses with the best potential for growth, which tended to be the higher margin businesses.","You should be looking for us to demonstrate that same dynamic, which has been difficult over the last two years to do as a result of the negative mix effect of the Writing reset that occurred in 2018, and because of the challenges now that the business has with the retained costs associated with the divestitures, but our orientation is going to be to drive those very similar sets of outcomes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Great, thanks.","Mike Polk","Hi, Olivia.","Olivia Tong","Hi, good morning. One, to talk a little bit more about cash flow, and first in terms of investors, how you\u2019re feeling even with the amended $9 billion expected after-tax proceeds? And I guess, if you don\u2019t end up seeing offers at what you believe are fair prices, what would you consider in terms of other levers to cash, especially given that the dividend is well above market, first goal still 30 to 35 payout. And then just as you think about cash longer term after fiscal 2019, where do you think sort of the right level to get that?","Mike Polk","Yes. So thanks, Olivia. So I think our focus is on driving shareholder value. And so to your question, if we don\u2019t get a deal value that we believe drive shareholder value for the Company, we\u2019re not going to sell the assets at fire sale prices. So we\u2019ve done the analysis to look at what the keep value is for the assets, and our $9 billion assumes that we get valuations that exceed that keep value \u2013 valuation, is the first point there. So that could change if we get offers that are below what we think the value of the enterprises, because we\u2019re focused on shareholder value creation.","Relative to how we deploy the proceeds for our debt repayment versus share repurchase, I think it\u2019s the same answer, which is we\u2019re focused on shareholder value creation, we continue to be committed to having a sustainable balance sheet and leverage ratio and returning excess cash to shareholders, and we\u2019ll make those decisions as we go along through the process here.","Olivia Tong","And then just on the dividend?","Mike Polk","We have no plans to change the dividend.","Olivia Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Mike Polk","Hi, Nik.","Russ Miller","Hey, good morning, Mike. This is Russ Miller on for Nick. We just want to ask on Writing, and specifically now with the Staples and Essendant deal closed, is there any more perspective you can provide on the impact that may have to the Writing business? Thank you.","Mike Polk","We are very pleased with the progress in Writing, Laurel Hurd and her team have done a remarkable job, Russ Torres on the sidelines sort of providing some guidance and input to them as they\u2019ve come through a very, very turbulent period of time. As you know, that whole landscape reset in the middle of \u2013 started in the middle of 2017 and through the first half of 2018 \u2013 under new leadership and new ownership, the traditional channels within Writing established a new set of inventory targets for themselves, which we have worked with them to make progress on achieving. And we have a little bit more work to do there in 2019. But the real pain of that transition is behind us, and we start to see the kind of opportunity you would hope to see in this business.","Businesses made very good margin progression, recovering the step down from 2017, and the team is mobilized now on reigniting growth, and you start to see some of that occurring over the last two quarters. So we\u2019re quite optimistic about where the Writing business is. Very proud of the team for fighting through that adversity, and delivering very, very good 2018 in that context, and are excited about the future. They\u2019ve got some great innovations coming in the back half of 2019 that will serve us well into 2020, and we\u2019ve got very good momentum on Slime now around the world.","So if you want to create Slime in Europe, you can. If you want to do it in Australia, you can, and we\u2019re looking at new markets every day for that opportunity. So look, I love this business. I think it\u2019s a great business. I think it\u2019s an important business in terms of the role it plays in social and economic development in the emerging markets, and we\u2019re very committed to making this business bigger, and does \u2013 and building the equities of these brands around the world.","Russ Miller","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Mike Polk","Hi, Joe.","Joe Altobello","Good morning. So welcome, Chris. Welcome aboard.","Chris Peterson","Thank you.","Joe Altobello","Looking forward to working with you. I suppose to go back to earlier line of question. And I know Mike you mentioned that Newell earlier was turning the corner, but the core sales outlook for 2019 obviously doesn\u2019t really show that at least on the top line. I would think that if I can ask you that question six or even three months ago, what your 2019 core sales guys would be? It wouldn\u2019t be down low singles and I\u2019m guessing that delta\u2019s probably, call four points from where we are today versus where we would have been maybe six months ago.","How much of the change is macro, and how much of the change is the decision you guys have made? I know you\u2019ve mentioned lapping QRQ and the lost distribution in Appliances and Outdoor, but you know knows for a couple of quarters now. So I\u2019m just trying to figure out what\u2019s changed from a macro level, and what are you guys doing differently that has caused that outlook to come down? Thanks.","Mike Polk","Yes. We don\u2019t have a different view on the macros. I mean there is some slowdown in Europe and in parts of Asia, but we don\u2019t have a big footprint in those geographies that would cause me to have that factor into our guidance on core sales. We\u2019ve got the realities of what we described, which is Toys\"R\"Us, in the first half of the year and we\u2019ve got the realities of the distribution issues which will continue to govern the upside. We felt \u2013 coming into this year, this was the right way to plan the year. It will enable the continued progress on margin development and set the stage for grocery ignition on this business going forward.","The year will be a little different in terms of its flow. Q1 obviously steps down from the sequential result improvement in Q4 and Q3 before it, and we\u2019ve guided 2% to 4%, that is an art-to-fact of Toys\"R\"Us, there\u2019s really nothing we can do around overcoming 250 basis points of top line headwind. But from that point forward, once we lapped the distribution, you should see sort of the normal progression you would expect to see in our business. We will always ask questions about relative attractiveness of businesses, and we\u2019re going to give ourselves the room in our guidance to be able to make choices around some of those activities.","An example of a choice we\u2019ve made that impacts top line, not really core sales but impacts top line, that is the right choice to make, it\u2019s the choice to exit about 100 stores on Yankee \u2013 out of mall-based retail from Yankee Candle. That\u2019s \u2013 those are not attractive stores, they lose money, as the leases expire there\u2019s an efficient way to get out of those businesses, that will help us in our margin development going forward. And it\u2019s the right choice to make irrespective of the consequences of the top line. And so we\u2019re going to do the right thing. Our long-term goal is to drive profitable core sales growth ahead of our markets. To build market share, to increase our margins and to significantly improve the cash flow productivity in the business, and we have a tremendous opportunity on all of these fronts.","Joe Altobello","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys.","Operator","We have reached the end of the time allotted for our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Polk for closing remarks.","Mike Polk","Well, thank you everyone for all the questions and for sticking with us through the call. Chris and I look forward to seeing many of you next week at CAGNY. And to our team, thank you as always for your drive, your determination, and your commitment to Newell Brands. Chris and I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the energy and effort you put into this business and are very gratified with the progress we\u2019re making in a dealt environment, and we see the green shoots we\u2019ve been talking about, and we\u2019re optimistic and excited about the prospects going forward.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After a brief discussion by management, we will open up the call for questions. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellbrands.com on the Investor Relations home page under Events & Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download.","I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Miss O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome today's Newell Brands' second quarter earnings call. Before we begin our discussion, I like to point out that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations. Please refer to our earnings release and the most recent Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional information concerning risk factors. Newell undertakes no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements.","Let me remind you also that we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures today including those identified in the tables of the earnings press release. We provide these non-GAAP measures because management believes that providing insights on the measures discussed enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results. Specifically, the biggest differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP metrics this quarter are one-time charges and other expenses related to the Jarden transaction, including inventory step-up, acquisition-related amortization and other transaction costs.","In addition, we're defining Newell Brands core sales as if the Jarden combination occurred April 15 of last year, meaning we are including last year's Jarden results in our 2015 base. Waddington, Jostens and Elmer's are not included in core sales until their respective one-year anniversaries. The reconciliations of these and other non-GAAP measures with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP are included in the earnings release and are available on our website. Our call today will be led by Newell Brands' Chief Executive Officer, Mike Polk; and Ralph Nicoletti, our Chief Financial Officer.","So, I'll turn it over to Mike now.","Michael Polk","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our first quarterly results call as Newell Brands. I'm very pleased to report a strong set of second quarter results with positive momentum on a number of fronts. We drove very competitive levels of growth in the quarter, cost synergies and Project Renewal savings are ramping and right where we expected them to be and cash flow was strong, enabling us to pay down $750 million of our $1.5 billion term loan. So a strong start as Newell Brands, and as a consequence, we reaffirmed full-year guidance this morning.","The Q2 headlines are as follows. Net sales have more than doubled as a result of the Jarden transaction, to $3.86 billion. Core sales grew 5%, led by strong performances in Writing, Baby & Parenting, Food & Beverage, Yankee Candle and Appliances. On both the reported and normalized basis, gross margins and operating margins were right in line with our expectations. Reported EPS was $0.30 per diluted share. Normalized EPS was $0.78, up nearly 22% versus prior-year. And operating cash flow was nearly $600 million. So all-in, a very good set of second quarter results, with continued momentum in our key businesses and a lot of energy and excitement around the opportunities ahead.","Let me hand the call over to Ralph to go through the results in more detail and then I'll return to provide an update on our roadmap forward and the perspective on our outlook for the balance of 2016.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As Mike noted, we were pleased with our second quarter results, with strong reported and core sales growth. Gross and operating margin came in consistent with our expectations and we are on track with our deleveraging plan, as strong operating cash flow allowed us to pay down about $0.75 billion in debt. Overall, a very good start.","Turning to our detailed review, second quarter reported net sales were $3.86 billion, 147% increase versus last year, largely from the contribution of the Jarden transaction. Core sales increased 5%. Reported gross margin was 28.4% compared with 39.8% in the prior-year, largely due to a $334 million inventory step-up related to the Jarden transaction. There will be a similar step up impact of around $130 million in Q3 as we expect substantially all of the remaining inventory to turn.","Normalized gross margin was 37.2%, down 280 basis points versus last year. The decline is due to the negative mix effect from the Jarden acquisition and the deconsolidation of Venezuela, as well as the impact of unfavorable currency, which more than offset productivity and pricing. Reported SG&A expense was $947 million, or 24.5% of sales, down 70 basis points over last year. Normalized SG&A expense was $827 million, or 21.4% of sales, down 260 basis points versus prior year, thanks to the mix impact from the inclusion of the Jarden legacy businesses, which have historically carried a lower SG&A spend rate, also benefiting from Project Renewal savings and early Jarden deal synergies.","Advertising and promotion spending at the Newell Rubbermaid legacy businesses increased 50 basis points in the quarter, driven by incremental investments behind new products, including Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens, Mr. Sketch Scented Crayons, Rubbermaid FreshWorks produce saver and Graco Extend2Fit Convertible Car Seats.","Reported operating margin was 3.6% of sales, compared with 13.8% in the prior year. The decrease was largely driven by the one-time inventory step-up, acquisition-related amortization costs and other expenses incurred in connection with the Jarden deal. Normalized operating margin declined 20 basis points to 15.8%. Interest expense of $127 million, rose $109 million year-over-year, reflecting a $10 billion increase in debt, resulting from the financing of the Jarden and Elmer's transactions. Our reported tax rate was 20.3%, compared with 22.7% in the prior year. The normalized tax rate was 29.2%, compared with 24.5% in the prior year, attributable to the mix effect of the Jarden acquisition and geographic earnings.","Reported EPS was $0.30 per share, compared with $0.55 in the prior year, due largely to a number of acquisition-related charges and expenses. We also had an increased interest expense and a higher share count. These Jarden transaction charges were partially offset by the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions and a gain on the sale of the D\u00e9cor business. Normalized EPS, which excludes the transaction-related expenses, among other things, was $0.78, a 21.9% increase versus last year. The improvement was primarily driven by strong sales growth, the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions and Project Renewal savings. These benefits more than offset increased advertising and promotion support, negative foreign currency, increased interest expense and increased shares outstanding.","I will now move on to our segment results. Starting with Writing, net sales increased 15.8%. Core sales increased 11.3%, driven by strong double-digit growth in North America. We had a very good start with the Back-to-School sell-in, thanks to innovation and increased advertising and promotion. Net sales in the Home Solutions segment decreased 1.1% as strong growth in our Food & Beverage business was more than offset by the negative impact of the divested D\u00e9cor business and planned exits in the low margin Consumer Storage business and unfavorable foreign currency. Core sales grew 1.7%.","Tools net sales declined 3.8%, reflecting continued weakness in Brazil and negative foreign currency. Core sales declined 2.3% as growth in North America was offset by Brazil macro challenges and industrial sector softness in China. Net sales in Commercial Products declined 7.9%, primarily due to the divestiture of the Rubbermaid medical cart business and unfavorable foreign currency. Core sales declined 1.4%, reflecting softness driven by complexity reduction initiatives in the North American distributor channel and in Brazil due to macro challenges in that country. Our Baby segment grew net sales 12.4%, thanks to continued strong momentum at Graco North America, driven by innovation and advertising and promotion. Core sales grew 11.1%.","In my discussion of the legacy Jarden segments, I will refer to post-transaction net and core sales, compared against pro forma results for the same period in 2015. Post-transaction net sales in Branded Consumables increased 36.8%, reflecting the Waddington acquisition. Core sales increased 7.8%, due largely to strong growth in Yankee Candle and Home & Family in Europe. Net sales in Consumer Solutions increased 4.9%. Core sales increased 8.3% driven by strong growth in kitchen appliances in North America, Europe and Latin America. Outdoor Solutions net sales increased 53.6%, due largely to the Jostens acquisition. Core sales increased 50 basis points, reflecting strong growth from Pure Fishing, offset by weather-related softness in the ski businesses. Net sales in Process Solutions increased 20 basis points. Core sales increased 50 basis points.","Let's now turn to Q2 core sales by geography. Importantly, North America, which represents 79% of total sales, delivered strong core growth of 6.7%. In EMEA, core sales grew 2.6%. Latin America core sales increased 1.9%, reflecting solid growth across the region, with the exception of Brazil. Asia Pacific core sales declined 7.7%, due primarily to softness in Branded Consumables in that region.","Moving on to cash flow. During Q2, we reported almost $600 million in operating cash flow compared with $102 million in the prior year, reflecting the contribution from Jarden, including Jostens and Waddington, improved operating results and favorable working capital movements. We also generated $236 million from the sale of D\u00e9cor. We returned $92 million in dividends to shareholders. We also paid down debt by $750 million, bringing our quarter-end debt balance down to $13 billion. We remain confident in our ability to reach our leverage goal of 3 times to 3.5 times in the next two years to three years. So, a very good start to the quarter and with progress on many important areas.","With that, I'll now turn the call back to Mike.","Michael Polk","Thanks, Ralph. Since coming together as Newell Brands, we've been hard at work getting to know each other and laying the groundwork for accelerated value creation. Together, we have a strong portfolio of leading brands and significantly greater scale across a number of key channels, customers and geographies, with the opportunity to leverage these assets in a bigger way for expanded reach, visibility, impact and growth. We've identified a number of new growth opportunities and put many into action that will materialize through channel cross-sell, accelerated international deployment and strengthened innovation delivery over time.","We're also making very good progress on costs. As previously shared, we've committed to achieve an incremental $300 million in Project Renewal savings over the next few years. And against that target, we've delivered $70 million in incremental savings in the first half of 2016. We also have a clear line of sight to the $500 million of cost synergies, with significant upside potential. The synergy teams have hit the ground running and are now in full flight, with early successes on procurement, where we've already realized $40 million in annualized savings. We're quite confident in our ability to deliver the targeted synergies, given our track record of success on Project Renewal.","We're also making good progress on developing the new strategy for Newell Brands. A few weeks ago, my leadership team spent time together discussing the choices ahead and the next steps in our transformation that will flow from that strategy. Critical decisions about portfolio roles and category and geographic priorities were at the center of our discussions. Mark Tarchetti and his team led by Russ Torres led the dialog and much of the thinking. As you'd expect, if you're familiar with how we work, those discussions were underpinned by rigorous analysis.","The insights generated will frame a set of sharp portfolio, resource allocation and organizational design choices. In early August, we'll solicit input from the Board of Directors, and with the benefit of the board's perspective incorporated, this new strategic framework will shape our activities and investment choices from 2017 forward.","Let me now turn back and take a look at the balance of 2016. This morning, we reaffirmed Newell Brands 2016 full-year guidance. We continue to expect 2016 full-year Newell Brands core sales growth of 3% to 4% and full-year normalized EPS of $2.75 to $2.90. Despite a strong start to the year, we continue to believe that both full-year guidance metrics appropriately bracket the most likely outcome from the full year, which is right in the middle of both guidance ranges.","Where we actually fall in the full-year guidance range will depend on three key factors. The first factor relates to the success of the second half 2016 drive periods of Back-to-School on Writing and the holidays on Yankee Candle. We are well positioned against both. Importantly, both businesses have leadership positions in large growing global markets with tremendous opportunity to still capture market share, both in their markets at home and in their markets abroad. Yankee and Writing also have above-fleet average margins structures and so their performance can move the needle for Newell Brands in a meaningful way.","On Writing, we have tremendous momentum. The latest 12-week U.S. value market share through the middle of July as measured by IRI is up over 140 basis points, with dollar sales growth of 7%. In Q2, writing had an extraordinary sell-in for the Back-to-School season delivering about $15 million more revenue in this key selling period than we anticipated. While the revenue and the associated income will reverse out in Q3, the strength of the sell-in and the programming and innovation in place bodes well for display activity and merchandising-driven sellout in Q3.","As we complete the Back-to-School drive period on Writing, we'll turn our attention to the holidays. The Yankee Candle team is gearing up for the holidays, with strong merchandising plans and with new products on their way to retail. We're pressing forward in a new effort to broaden distribution even further in the U.S. and Canada with incremental placements that leverage Newell Brands route to market in the adjacent channels that could potentially positively impact Q4 2016 and, more importantly, 2017.","We're also exploring ways to enhance brand investment in the fourth quarter and certainly into 2017. Importantly, if we find ourselves with full-year earnings upside beyond the midpoint of the full-year normalized EPS guidance range, we will likely reinvest a substantial portion of that upside back into the Yankee Candle business for strengthened consumer impact around the holidays and positive momentum into 2017.","The second factor that could influence where we fall in the full-year guidance range is the delivery of Project Renewal cost savings and the transaction cost synergies. We have a clear line of sight to the full-year Project Renewal incremental savings and, as planned, we expect to deliver well over $100 million in incremental savings this year. With respect to the Jarden transaction cost synergies, we are well on our way to deliver our $50 million to $80 million full-year cost synergy guidance, with a good probability of delivering towards the high end of that range. So, we're on track and foresee no issues here, and perhaps some opportunity.","The third factor that could influence where we land in the full-year guidance range is product line exits. To be clear, our full-year guidance reflects our intention to actively manage the portfolio. In 2016, we expect to begin to exit certain product lines, with roughly $250 million to $300 million of revenue over the next two years to three years. These are businesses that have low to no likelihood of featuring as strategic priorities for the company.","As we've stated, our goal would be to sell these assets, if possible, rather than exit, and we hope to be able to find a buyer for some. If we're unsuccessful at finding buyers, the process of exiting these businesses will begin as early as the third quarter. As mentioned previously, we do not expect a material financial impact related to potential product line exits.","While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to provide some context for the flow of our business in the second half. Given the likely Q3 reversal of the Writing incremental Q2 Back-to-School sell-in and the possible Q3 timing of product line exits, we expect Q3 core sales growth rate to be near the bottom of our 3% to 4% full-year guidance range. In Q4, we expect growth rates to recover towards the mid-point of our full-year range. We also expect normalized EPS to skew roughly 10% higher in Q4 relative to Q3 as a result of the holiday season peaking of the profitable Yankee Candle business.","So in closing, we've had a strong start to the year on many fronts. We successfully completed the most transformative deal in the history of either Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden. Despite the potential for distraction that a transaction of this size could create, we grew core sales 5% and delivered normalized EPS growth of nearly 22% in the second quarter. We've made good early progress in the integration of the two companies while simultaneously taking a big step forward on Project Renewal. With continued positive momentum in our business, we're well on our way to delivering our 2016 full-year financial outlook.","We've committed to reduce the leverage ratio to 3 times to 3.5 times over the next two years to three years. And in the second quarter, we've paid down $750 million of our $1.5 billion term loan. And our work to prioritize our investment choices and realign resource against the capabilities that can differentiate us and the brands with the greatest potential is well underway, setting the stage for future acceleration of growth and value creation.","I want to thank our people for their hard work and unwavering focus on delivery. Performance is an everyday thing, and I'm very proud of the determination and the drive for results, particularly in the midst of increasing change. Together, we're building a bigger, stronger, faster-growing and more profitable company, with a portfolio of leading brands that compete in large growing, unconsolidated global categories that are responsive to innovation and brand support and also have a low cost of growth, given the lack of market consolidation.","Our confidence is high because our team has done this kind of work before. We are incredibly well-positioned to build these brands and energized by the opportunity to simultaneously create a ton of value for our shareholders. And we're driven by the prospect of building one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world, a company that helps consumers live better every day where they live, learn, work and play. That is both the promise and the potential of Newell Brands.","With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions and pass the call back to Ebony.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Dara Mohsenian. Please go ahead.","Michael Polk","Hey, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","Hi. Good morning. So, just big picture, Mike, I was hoping you could take a step back and give us a bit of state of the union view of the Jarden business here now that you've owned it for a few months. How much greater visibility do you think you have as you look out over the next few years? What have been some of the positive and negative surprises so far as you've gotten to know that business better? And also, as you look out over the next few years, I guess, what are the biggest opportunities here to drive shareholder value from that Jarden side of the portfolio?","Michael Polk","We've had a really good first few months together, I've got to say. I'm really pleased with the way the team is coming together, the connections. I've made this point before that the DNA of both organizations are really similar. This is a highly intense operationally-focused group of business unit leaders that I've had the opportunity to engage with. And in fact, we just came back from \u2013 I guess, it was about a week ago now, maybe a week-and-a-half ago. We spent the whole week going through the 2016 back half plans and the outlook for 2017, business unit by business unit. And it was a full-on week every day, five days\u2019 worth of plowing through operating reviews. And I came away from those reviews really encouraged.","There's some great brands here. If we do our job and deliver beyond the $500 million in synergies that we've committed to, we're going to release a lot of ability to invest back into the business. If I said \u2013 if there was one observation I'd make, it's that while we've got the same level of operational intensity, the P&L in the legacy Newell Rubbermaid side gives us much more flexibility to invest back into the business. So, the combination will release a lot of costs that should enable us to extend some of the core capabilities that have the potential to differentiate us like insights, design, innovation, delivery, e-commerce across the total enterprise, and also the ability to put more advertising and promotion investment behind the businesses with the greatest potential to create value on the legacy Jarden side of the family.","Obviously, I talk a lot about Yankee Candle because I know it really well. This is obviously a crown jewel in the company. It was a great acquisition that Martin and Ian did. There's tremendous opportunity to build our footprint there. We love our Writing business. Obviously, we're going to continue to invest across that. Food & Beverage has done really well. The combination of the assets between Newell and Jarden on Baby create a really powerful platform for growth going forward. And in the Appliance business, you can see how responsive the Appliance business is to activity and merchandising. These are great brands. Oster, Mr. Coffee, Sunbeam, these are terrific assets, and some of them even stronger outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And so I'm really encouraged by the possibilities here.","All of our choices will drive off the strategic work that we're doing today. So, we will establish a strategic framework that puts relative priorities in place on these businesses. Many of the Jarden businesses could benefit from the design capability we've built out, and we intend to apply that design capability more broadly to help support innovation delivery over time. And then there's an entrepreneurial spirit in many of the Jarden businesses that I think we'll look to figure out a way to preserve within the context of the operating model we'll eventually build out. Businesses like Jostens are really interesting. They have their own ecosystem and culture. The Jostens business I like, in terms of its scale, profitability, and the ability to spin off cash to fund other potential investments in other parts of the portfolio.","So our choices will pivot off the portfolio prioritization work that's underway today. I'm encouraged by what I see. There's always opportunity to do work. I think we have work to do on Coleman to strengthen the brand. It's a great asset with a tremendous amount of equity, but I think the portfolio could be broadened, and the innovation capability we have could be applied to premiumize certain aspects of that business in a way that would give it more growth potential. We have to work our way through on all the winter weather-related businesses, the hangover from last winter, which we've got baked into our guidance, so that'll just be a matter of time and clearing of inventories in certain parts of the business to get ourselves through to a normal year. This won't be the normal year for any of the winter-sensitive businesses.","But all in all, my impression is incredibly positive, and I'm really excited and I think the team is energized by the possibilities. It won't be simple. We've got a lot of change that the organization is going to go through over the next six months and into 2017. And we're going to have to do our best to deliver while simultaneously changing. And we've demonstrated the ability to do that. That'll be the key kind of executional issue that we'll have to lead the organization through, but I'm confident because of the experience we have in doing things like this, that we will get through that period of change and really come out a much stronger company on the backside of it, with more growth potential and more potential to create value. That was a pithy answer, Dara, to a very straightforward question. But it's probably my favorite question to answer.","Dara Mohsenian","Great. That's very helpful. And then as you think about managing this more complex company post the acquisition, do you feel like you have the capabilities in place that you need from a management perspective to manage the combined business after additions like Ralph? Or is there more to go on that front in terms of head count and management upgrades? And also maybe just discuss Jarden systems and where they are versus heritage Newell? Do you need to upgrade the info systems to give you better visibility in the business from a POS standpoint, or in other areas? And how long that takes?","Michael Polk","On talent, I think we will always raise the bar on ourselves with respect to what's required to lead an organization. And our ambition is way ahead of where our current reality is. So, we want to build a team fit for the company we aspire to be, not the company we are today. So, we will always be challenging ourselves to continue to develop. And all of us, including me, have development opportunities. So, we're going to invest in our people and help them grow. A growing company creates great opportunities for personal development, and we're going to ensure that our people have that opportunity.","My team is set now. We've talked about potentially one other job, which is a supply chain leadership role. And I think as we go forward, we'll be looking and exploring and figuring out whether there's somebody that can plug into our team dynamic, which I really love now. I'm impressed with the talent that I've got on both sides. I think areas for improvement, we're always going to want to strengthen our commercial operations and strengthen and broaden our customer reach and channel reach in our selling organization.","So, that'll be an opportunity for investment. It's not because we're not happy with the people, I just want to broaden the direct selling capabilities in the organization. And supply chain is probably the other area where we'll want to invest to strengthen our capabilities. We've managed the supply chain in a very disaggregated way, and quite frankly, pretty well. But there are opportunities across the network that we're going to want to create a leadership catalyst to activate over time. And this isn't an urgent role to fill, from my perspective, but it's an important area where we want to step up leadership. And Ralph on IT?","Ralph Nicoletti","Yeah. Dara, on the IT side, significant opportunities, a lot of the focus in the very short-term here is on building some of the infrastructure on the legacy Jarden businesses on just visibility to things like daily sales, point-of-sale information, those kinds of things. That information sort of exists across their group. But we need to develop a more systematic way to get visibility to that kind of across the company and in the center as well on a more daily basis. So, that's a big effort going on now.","Also as we develop and formulate the portfolio and the sets of choices that we make, we'll be leveraging what I think is a great platform on SAP that the legacy Newell business developed. And we'll begin to make some migrations to further leverage that platform over time. That will be a second piece. And I would just say the third big effort that is really getting started now really relates to synergies. But there's an IT infrastructure opportunity that we could really unlock some value and costs by harmonizing a lot of the, I'll call, back of the house support for running servers and telecommunications and all those kinds of things. So, that's another piece of systems work that's going on.","Dara Mohsenian","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bill Schmitz","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Michael Polk","Hey, Bill.","Bill Schmitz","Hey. Can you just like talk about the next 100 days, because you finished the first 100 days? So, what's on the agenda? I mean, I know you talked about the board meeting, but maybe also how you're going to communicate that. So sort of when, perhaps, we'll get like an update on the portfolio or the synergies?","Michael Polk","Yeah. Yeah. I've got to say, it's been a really intense 60 days, 90 days on portfolio work and strategic work. And we're very close to putting the pre-read together for the board and getting it front of the board and having a good debate about the opportunities and also the cadence of change in the organization. And that will happen very quickly. We will go to the board August 9 and August 10 and come out of that with their input. And my team will meet right after that, the next week, to really agree on where we go from there. Obviously, you don't drive change from the leadership pulpit. You drive change by socializing change in companies.","And we need to engage leadership in discussions about what it is we think is right to do. And that process will begin from that point forward. I think it'll take us probably to the end of September to work through and solicit all the right input and revise plans and thinking. And I think by the fourth quarter, we'll be in a position to talk about it a little bit more openly.","And in terms of external communications around it, I think the earliest you'll really hear a deep discussion would be with Q3 earnings and more likely sometime in the early winter with a full on review. But I'm sure, I'd like to kind of not have anybody be surprised by what it is we're doing. So I'm sure I'll preview this through the different touch points we have ahead that are public and you'll be able to \u2013 well, by the time we get to talking the story, you'll probably know the story.","Bill Schmitz","Okay.","Michael Polk","So, I think that's how you'll probably see this play out.","Bill Schmitz","That's perfect. Thanks. And then is there a way to understand the sources of growth for the Writing business? And then maybe how sustainable you think that is going forward?","Michael Polk","Yes. Writing benefited from a couple of things in the second quarter and this is an important point to register. We were very successful at the sell-in, which I love, because at this time of year that's a really constructive thing to do, because you force all these inventories to the floor in retailers, which is how you get the merchandising sell-out. So we're really excited about the fact we nailed Q2, the sell-in period. There are two things underlying the share gains we're experiencing around and the underlying growth we're getting in the business. And one of them is the innovation agenda and the brand support agenda that goes with that. InkJoy gel is going to be a huge hit. You can already see it in the consumption data.","I'm really excited to see how it plays post back-to-school and see how much of a step-change we get from it, because the product is beautiful, the ink system is unique and differentiated for anybody who loves gel pens. It's beautiful smooth write, but it doesn't smear because it's got an ink that dries three times faster than the next leading competitor. So it's got a really differentiated proposition. So I think the innovation agendas are going really well.","We have also extended the footprint of this business. As you know, our progress in Mexico in Writing is really pretty extraordinary. Our progress in Canada where we're underdeveloped is really quite strong. Bob King who runs the Canadian business has done a great job on writing over the last 18 months to build out our footprint and build the business. And as you know, we've invested to launch Sharpie in the U.K. about a year and half ago. That's going really well. We've got great presence at Tesco and Sainsbury and in the mass retailers in the U.K. and there's opportunity still to be had there. And we will leverage the Jarden business going forward to apply the same principles in France and Germany, leveraging their mass retail footprint.","But, I think, the current reality is, it's U.K., it's Canada, it's Mexico and it's the obvious success we've had in the U.S. Part of the success is driven by this macro trend on adult coloring, which has helped Sharpie Fine Point, it's helped Flair, and obviously Prismacolor, which is right in the center of that big trend. And that trend continues. That's a tailwind to this business. That's probably worth a 1.5 point, two points of our growth. That macro event, which it really has nothing to do with our marketing, but we're extremely well positioned to take advantage of it. So the real question there is, is this a sustainable trend or is this a fad that will ebb over time? And that's why I always say to you guys, you should not plan Writing at double-digit core growth. You should build your models with Writing in the sort of the 5% to 7% range, which I think is the right place to be.","Now, we've got all kinds of exciting things ahead on writing. If I was with you, Bill, I'd give you the Chinese product that's set to launch, both regular InkJoy, InkJoy Gel, and Sharpie in Shanghai in the fourth quarter. And the product looks great. I've seen the videos of the sell-in discussions with the distributors. That went great. So we're excited by the prospects for broadening the footprint over time, both in France and Germany, most likely, leveraging Jarden's mass retail footprint and, obviously, in China where we've made the commitment.","So there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic ahead on this business, and as you know, it's a beautiful category, but lots of share consolidation opportunity around the world.","Bill Schmitz","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Michael Polk","Hey, Bill.","William Chappell","Good morning. Just going back to Outdoor Solutions. I don't fully understand the commentary behind it. I certainly understand that it was weak because of weather, but I think what Ralph had said had to do with winter sports. And my understanding was winter sports was really kind of a third quarter, fourth quarter sell-in. There is very little sell through in the back half and most of the excess inventory sat with the retailers. So just could you help us understand that? And then was there anything as it connected to your commentary about Coleman that you saw some weakness in the quarter on that business that needs improvement?","Michael Polk","Within Outdoor Solutions, we have a bunch of different moving parts. The pure fishing business did really well. But anything that's winter sensitive is dealing with the hangover on inventories from the sell-in from last year and working through that. Within ski, K2 is probably more challenged than V\u00f6lkl. V\u00f6lkl had a pretty good quarter in Q2. But there clearly are winter weather-related hangovers in any business that ships a lot in, in the back half of the year, hoping to have it consumed out in the front half of the year.","So we're definitely dealing with the hangover there. Coleman is a challenging business at the moment. It's not that we don't believe in it. We do, actually. It reminds me a lot of where Graco was when I started, in that the brand has unbelievable legacy equities. We'll find out maybe before September we'll get these results where we put all of these brands into equity testing. So we're going to get relative metrics that we can compare across the total portfolio.","I'm betting that Coleman stands out as probably one of the strongest brands from an equity perspective in the whole portfolio. I think Oster will be there. I think Mr. Coffee, despite people's preconceived notions, will be there. Obviously Yankee I think will do really well. But I bet it's Coleman's top of the league table within the legacy Jarden portfolio, as was Graco and Rubbermaid. But there's work to do on Coleman, because too much of its portfolio sits in the good segment of good, better, best, and that's where pricing and margin contraction becomes an issue if you don't have a broadened footprint.","And so the Coleman business I think is going to have an okay year. It won't have a brilliant year because it's stuck with too much of its portfolio in that segment of the market. And that's the segment of the market where you get a lot of pressure. And if you don't have differentiation in your product offerings relative to store brands, then you run the risk of always being under pressure. And that's the cycle. I just guess I'd describe it as that's the cycle that Coleman is currently in. And we're going to have to address that. And we'll address it in the same way we did with Graco.","We'll work through. It will take some time. This will be one of those projects that takes multiple years to get right. It's going to require investment in insight. It's going to require investment in design and in innovation. We're a big enough company where we can afford to take a margin contraction and hit on a big brand like that in order to get it reset. But this is going to be one of our big projects. It's actually very exciting because I think the brand has tremendous potential, but we need to get it into a more sustainable pattern of strategic growth. And that will take some time.","So it's all hands on deck on that business. It's not a crisis. It's just an opportunity under-leveraged. But this is where the best of our model can be applied. And I think it'll be really interesting to see what we're able to do with it over a couple years.","William Chappell","Okay. I'm still not sure I fully understood the winter sports impact in the quarter, but I'll get back offline on that.","Michael Polk","Yes. I'm happy to talk to you privately about it. But the headline is you ship a lot of stuff in the back half of 2015, winter doesn't come, all that stuff sitting there has got to be moved through, and that's the environment we're in. You discount to move it through. We're getting there, but that becomes a hangover that we've got on this year's business. And I'd say V\u00f6lkl's done that better than K2's been able to do it up until now. And then we have the next season right around the corner, as you point out.","William Chappell","Okay. And just separately, you talked about another $250 million of business to exit. Is that the thought process going forward of 1% to 2% of the business per year you'll look to rationalize, because it's similar to the number you talked about last year? And as you've now looked at years in Jarden's portfolio instead of having a fire sale or a big exit of businesses, is it trimming each year going forward?","Michael Polk","Well, we've articulated $250 million to $300 million across the total enterprise, two thirds of which we've said is Jarden, a third of which is the continuation of the repositioning of the Rubbermaid business. But I wouldn't expect us to be exiting 1% to 2% of the business every year. This is the portion of the business that it probably doesn't fit the model or doesn't have real opportunity. It will never get up on the list of investment priorities we'd make, whereas it may be interesting to somebody else.","Our priority for that $250 million and $300 million, if we were in a situation where we don't have to bifurcate a trademark, like a Rubbermaid situation, where you can't really sell the stuff you don't really want without licensing the brand, which I'm not prepared to do. In situations where you don't have that scenario, obviously we'd love to find a buyer for these businesses rather than exit them. But I'm not clear at all whether we'll be able to find a buyer for some of them. And so that's why I've laid out this issue of $250 million to $300 million of product line exits. If we can sell them, we'll sell them, because that's a much more constructive way to manage the exit of those businesses.","But it's not part of some broader plan to wean the portfolio down. We may make, in the future, strategic choices about the portfolio, but it won't be in the context of businesses that don't necessarily have any role within the portfolio. It'll be about bartering one part of the portfolio for maybe something stronger that's out there that we could acquire in.","William Chappell","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Michael Polk","Yep.","Operator","And your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Michael Polk","Good morning.","Lauren Lieberman","First, just a follow-up on the conversation, I guess it would be on Coleman but also to go a little bit more broadly. I think one of the things you talked about a couple months back was the opportunity to quickly get into some of the businesses with clear profit deficits...","Michael Polk","Yeah.","Lauren Lieberman","...and that actually being something you could do in 2016.","It sounds like on Coleman that you're going to take it on in a bigger way. So does that still hold some of the profit things you want to address very quickly? Is that still in the cards?","Michael Polk","There's a lot of different businesses that'll play different roles in the overall agenda. I think the point on Coleman is it's probably an and, that we want to attack the cost structure at the same time, although the cost structure is pretty lean, at the same time as investing in other areas to create more growth potential and maybe more margin trajectory in it.","So that one's a give and a take. There are others where there's opportunity to go to market more efficiently. And part of the outcome of the portfolio choices work will be to articulate which businesses should benefit from the full-cost model and which businesses could be managed more entrepreneurially and more efficiently. So there will be change across the entire enterprise with different bits of the portfolio playing different roles and therefore having different models with respect to the cost structure.","And there's some of the Newell legacy businesses that will be moved around with respect to prioritization. So there's a lot of cost work going on. There's opportunities within businesses and then there's opportunities across the enterprise. And we're doing both sets of work.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Thank you. And then in Home Solutions, I was just curious, do you think the run rate for that business, the category as it stands today, not where you might move pieces around. Do you think the right run rate for growth of that business once the exits are done, is it like a mid-single digit rate? I'm just thinking about the growth you must be seeing in food and beverage versus the drag you're experiencing from the Rubbermaid?","Michael Polk","Yeah. We have near double-digit growth in the portions of the business that we're prioritizing, but we have pretty significant down elevators on the other side. So that's what's governing the growth. I don't know that I'd build a plan to mid-single digits. But if you were to break out the portion that we're most strategically interested in, certainly that portion needs to grow in the mid-singles, to mid to high-single digits, and that's where, obviously, we're going to dedicate resource.","It's also where the opportunity to differentiate product is, which should give us the opportunity to margin up that portion of the business. But, yeah, I think I wouldn't give you a forecast on Home Solutions. But I would tell you that Food & Beverage needs to be growing mid to high-single digits in the model going forward and we believe it can.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. And then just finally on the appliance business. That result was striking and the numbers there have been strong for a long time.","Michael Polk","That's amazing.","Lauren Lieberman","And that's something I've wondered about, the incremental distribution that Jarden had achieved for that business, the consumer trend towards more at home fresh food using those appliances and so on. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity you see there, if it's just even at the start better merchandising? And how quickly you can kind of act on that, because the momentum is already so great.","Michael Polk","Look, I think there's opportunity for distribution still even at home in some of the channels that Newell competes in. That's some of the stuff that we've already talked about. They've had a nice run in the appliance business. And while we're not quoting pro forma numbers year-to-date for those businesses, it's been a solid first half for the appliance business. And I think people underestimate the quality of the brands. I actually think Mr. Coffee and Oster and Sunbeam are excellent brands. We're going to find out that they have a lot of potential.","The challenge in the business was the margin structure of the business. And so will this feature at the top of the list when you've got assets like Writing or assets like Yankee? I think that we're going to need to continue to think about how to get operating margin into this business so that we can right resource it. I do think that there's a huge opportunity in the emerging markets in appliances as people move into the middle class. I think there's a real opportunity to tap into mom's needs in those countries to simplify life a bit. And the portfolio fits right into that space. But there are also opportunities in appliances in the developed world. So there's a lot of potential here.","Our challenge will be how much investment can you put into it given the operating margins in the business. And we'll have to work through that. We'll look for the efficiencies where we can get them, again, while increasing investment probably in insights and design to help the innovation funnel along.","In the short term, I believe there are distribution opportunities and merchandising opportunities that can sustain solid growth. I wouldn't build a model around 7%, 8% growth. That's a big number on a big business. But mid-single digits, maybe. Maybe in that 4% to 5% range, that's probably the right place to build that business model out. But there are portions of that portfolio that are really interesting in those mega brands that I was describing, really interesting. And then there's some other challenge aspects in that portfolio.","Lauren Lieberman","All right. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on.","Michael Polk","Okay.","Operator","And your next question will come from Steve Powers with UBS.","Michael Polk","Hey, Steve.","Stephen Powers","Hey. Thanks. Good morning.","Michael Polk","Good morning.","Stephen Powers","So, Mike, and Ralph as well I guess, you both mentioned in your opening remarks that cash flow was strong versus your expectations. I just want to press on that a little bit because first half free cash flow net of CapEx has \u2013 came in around 35% of adjusted net income. And I realize your business skews heavily to the back half in terms of cash flow generation. But I'm curious as to where you expect to finish the year, either in terms of an absolute level of free cash flow or stated as a percentage of the about $1.2 billion of net income that you've guided to? And then ultimately, do you have a more ambitious objective, if not in 2016, for free cash flow conversion as the integration takes shape, kind of, in 2017 and beyond?","Ralph Nicoletti","Yeah. Steve, it's Ralph. I guess, a few things on cash flow. Feel good about where we came out. And coming out of the quarter here, we had the benefit of the acquired businesses. There was some working capital movement that was favorable going into the second quarter, both from the legacy Newell side of the business principally on inventory, and then on Jarden across the board. And a lot of that, again, when you go from sort of pre-acquisition to post, there is a lot of movement in working capital. So that did help us quarter to quarter.","Overall, we're right on track with where we want to be. So, it enabled us to pay down the debt, as we talked about in the remarks. Still looking at getting by 2018, mid-2018, down to the 3 to 3.5 times level on leverage. And with that kind of run rate, we're going to have a lot of excess cash after supporting the dividends and CapEx and the debt repayment of maybe $2 billion to $2.5 billion in that period of time. There's still room for unallocated cash to drive more value. As it relates to the balance of this year, don't really want to give you an exact number on this year. We're, kind of, looking beyond the calendar there. But quarter to quarter, we're right on track, and we feel good about where we are.","Michael Polk","Steve, the only build I would make is that Writing tends to have a good cash-in period in Q3. And, obviously, Q4 is a huge cash window for the legacy Jarden businesses. So, you'll see a nice cash delivery in Q3, but the real cash-in window is Q4.","Ralph Nicoletti","Q4.","Stephen Powers","Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. And then separately, I think, you alluded to maybe a more selective incremental approach to integration. But as you do integrate the Jarden businesses onto the Newell platform and onto the Newell design platform specifically, are you inclined to do that more all at once? Or more serially, more incrementally, more selectively business by business over the course of time to manage the, I guess, integration risk?","Michael Polk","Yeah. We'll \u2013 it depends on what aspects of the integration you're talking about. On the business unit work, there are businesses that will benefit from investments that we want to get on with doing right away. And to the degree, that's part of the \u2013 how you would define integration, we're going to definitely do that. So we've got people needs that we will increase, and money that needs to go into research that's started already. And that's guided by the strategic prioritization work.","The corporate duplication synergies we're going after fast. So we're right in the middle of that in Q3. We'll have that largely behind us, all those choices made and done in the third quarter. I would be surprised if there are things hanging out there beyond that. And then with respect to route to market synergies, there's opportunity in every country to look for where those synergies might come. We'll work together as a team to play for the things that make the most sense. And I don't think we'll drag it out over a whole long period of time.","I think consensus is that whatever changes we're going to make, we ought to get them done as fast as we can, as long as we are confident in our ability to not be distracted on delivery. And that's why some of the guidance makes sense in the context of a strong first half. There will be a fair amount of work to do in the second half with respect to the integration. But our goal would be to get the organizational-related stuff behind us as fast as possible so we can pivot towards growth and fulfilling the ambition that we've articulated for the company.","But will it all be done in one shot? No, I mean, there's a sequence to things that you have to do, and there's \u2013 you need to bring people with you on these change journeys. So I wouldn't think of some sudden event. This will be a series of changes that play out in a condensed period of time to get the business pivoted towards creating the future.","Stephen Powers","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Michael Polk","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Altobello","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just want to talk about cost synergies for a little bit, and I'm not sure you guys gave the number. But what was the number in terms of the second quarter? And it sounds like that probably would be ratable this year. We're talking about the $80 million number in terms of the high side for this year. Would that be $25 million, $25 million, $25 million per quarter?","Michael Polk","No, I wouldn't \u2013 first of all, Joe, we haven't given the specific number yet. But I wouldn't think about it that way. The only number I gave on synergies other than saying that we could end up towards the high end of the range that we've committed to is the fact that we've delivered in the second quarter $40 million of annualized savings related to procurement. Okay? I didn't quote any numbers for anything else. But there clearly are other things out there that we're doing related to corporate duplication. So I \u2013 but we're not intending to communicate a synergy number every quarter, but we'll give you a flavor for it.","Joseph Altobello","Okay. That's certainly helpful. And in terms of revenue synergies, obviously, the cost side takes precedence, I understand at this point. But you guys talked about getting some revenue synergies. Cross-selling, I guess, is the most obvious opportunity, at least near term. Any early wins there? Or is that more of a 2017 event you think?","Michael Polk","No. I think, there's some things we're going to get in 2016. So we've talked about a couple of them before, but \u2013 and I mentioned one in the script which is we're looking for broadened distribution and presence on Yankee. One of the great \u2013 one of the most interesting things about the Yankee business that we've learned is that if you look at the size and scale of the business in Europe per capita, relative to the per capita size and scale of the business in the U.S. and it tells you that there's really opportunity to kind of broaden the footprint of the business here. So we're excited by the prospect of trying to get a Yankee Candle within arm's reach of as many consumers as we can.","And so that clearly is the near end opportunity, and Newell's footprint channel breadth offers some opportunity for those guys. Just in the same way that Coleman's channel breadth offers opportunity for the beverage business, and we've made pitches already to key customers on beverages leveraging the Coleman route to market and relationships with customers. So we should see wins quickly to be honest with you. But we're not banking that in revenue upside at this point, and if we were to get that upside we might choose to accelerate some of the exits, so that we that behind us.","Joseph Altobello","Got it. Okay. Thank you, Mike.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason Gere","Okay. Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in and I guess kind of dovetailing a little bit on Joe's last question, if you think about the benefits of scale at this point, we have been hearing just about some retailer inventory tightening in some kind of specialty retail channels. So I was just wondering if you could talk about having that incremental scale, how that's helped you in some key categories? Or do you feel that maybe some of the areas you've been a little bit susceptible to? So I was just wondering if you can put some color around that.","Michael Polk","You know I'm not a big fan of using retail inventory as a conversation point. There's always pressure on retailer inventories. If I were a retailer, I'd squeeze inventories as hard as I possibly can because they're rewarded on return on invested capital. So as a manufacturer, as a supplier, you have to accept that as part of their business model and you have to deliver your business plans in the context of ever increasing pressure on inventory positions.","There always can be, sort of, discrete windows where events happen. We saw one of those in Q1 of 1996, or 2006, with Wal-Mart and where they really created an event in a short period of time for everybody. And \u2013 but they're so few and far between. So there's always pressure on inventories. There's always a dynamic that occurs when retailers consolidate or exit, but we ought to be able to anticipate those things and work our way through them and not have them really come up as guidance discussion points with you guys.","Jason Gere","Okay. Good. Great answer. And then I guess the bigger question I have is, as you learning more and more about all your kids now, and you benchmark, I guess, the Jarden businesses and the Newell businesses and looking at productivity, do you see clear differences in terms of the performance of these \u2013 of the legacy Newell businesses and then the Jarden businesses that you've just acquired and the ability to kind of narrow the gap between the two?","Michael Polk","Look, I think there's a lot we can learn from the Jarden businesses on the Newell businesses. I mean, the Yankee story is really a pretty incredible story about extending a brand and taking risks in geographies. And I think, we haven't been as courageous as that team has been, and Jim, Martin and Ian were on that business after they acquired it.","So there's an important lesson learned there for us, legacy Newell Rubbermaid folk. I think there's opportunity connected to applying some of the lessons learned we had through the growth game plan to a set of assets that Jarden had available to it. And I think the fact that we will manage the portfolio in a different way where we don't just \u2013 we don't look at individual businesses with specific accountabilities, we make trade-offs on investments across the landscape, we manage resources dynamically, horizontally across businesses more actively than the Jarden team did. That'll give us the flexibility to make some investments that wouldn't have otherwise happened in a Jarden model, like on Coleman.","This is going to be a one year or two year series of investments we have to make. We'll try to fund it within Coleman, but the likely answer is that it'll be funded from outside of Coleman and we'll mortgage or rip costs out of corporate or do something that enables us to make those investment bets and take the step back on EBITDA margin while we're fixing the business. That's the thing that we will do differently.","So there's really different business conditions and different things that can be learned from both sides of the new company, and that we really intend to do that. I'm \u2013 I have no pride of authorship, other than things I believe are important and applicable. But if there are things on the other side that I wish I had done on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses, I'm going to be selfish and take them and go do it. So and there's plenty of examples of that. When I said at the very beginning in December that we're going to take the best of both, really meant that. Best of both talent, best of both ideas for how to go to market, best of both sets of learnings. And we're going to apply it across the enterprise.","Ralph Nicoletti","Jason, it's Ralph. Something else maybe just to add. Likewise on the, I'll call, functional side, plenty of opportunity, we get best practices let's say in the financial area, as it relates to cash management, treasury, tax, those kinds of things. So seeing really strong practices in both groups that there'll be some group learning, and we'll be able to leverage that over time as well.","Jason Gere","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","And you next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Polk","Hey, Olivia.","Olivia Tong","Hey, Mike. How are you?","Michael Polk","Good. How about yourself?","Olivia Tong","Good. Good. Thanks. So first just in terms of the Jarden portfolio. Clearly you're very bulled up about various parts of that. And it doesn't seem like you've really obviously unleashed the model yet. So where do you think these branch and grow with that added support, particularly given that you are able to achieve what looks like about 4% to 5% growth on the toughest comp of the year? So that's the first question.","Michael Polk","Yeah. Look, I think long term it's a very exciting set of possibilities. I think in the next \u2013 what we've said in terms of guidance on core growth for this year and next is 3% to 4%. And we're very unlikely to change that guidance because there's a lot of work to do within the portfolio that will both help the growth agenda, but some things that will, given how we define core sales, potentially hurt the growth agenda.","So, we're going to work through that over the first 18 months. And I have a very long view on our agenda and the company we're trying to build. And I think we get growth acceleration after we get through this period, this transition period of change and portfolio work. But we haven't committed to what that is. But certainly Q2 where there was less portfolio activity is encouraging. So that tells us a little bit about what's possible, and that's without the benefit of applying the best of what we could potentially apply from a capability standpoint.","I do think the things to look at if you want to get a sense of what's possible, who would've thought Baby would be growing at 11% five years ago? And if you look at the period in 2012, 2013, was compounded 10%. Who would've thought Writing would be growing 11% double-digit core growth in the first half of the year when we first started. And there's a lot of talk about technology convergence making, Writing was dead with the first series of questions I've gotten, why would I ever bet on Writing. But that's obviously not true. And so there's \u2013 there are lots of reasons, if you look back at the evidence over the last five years, to believe that these brands will respond to investment activity and capabilities in the area of design and innovation. And our challenge as leaders is to figure out how within the P&L to free up the space to drive that investment forward while simultaneously delivering the margin improvement committed to in the deal.","And I think it's doable. I mean I'm excited by that. The question becomes how much growth potential is there really here? I don't know. But Q2 certainly, Q2 and the other evidence, would suggest that when we get it right, we can grow really well on these businesses. And they're really responsive. And probably the most important strategic chart for investors to look at is the one that talks about the size of these markets, our position in the markets, the relative, the market share \u2013 the cumulative market share of the top three players in these categories globally, and then the cost of growth.","And that is a really attractive chart, because it tells the story of what's possible in this set of categories, these types of categories, relative to what's possible in fast-moving consumer goods where they are far more consolidated. The top five have 90% of the share, and the cost of growth is so high as a consequence.","And so this is a much more attractive space to be playing in, if you really think about it in that way, as long as you can tackle the costs and release the costs in the P&L to be able to invest behind the brands. And we had a theory that these categories would be responsive to activity. We now have plenty of proof that they're responsive to activity? So this algorithm is working and it has the potential to even work harder across this broader canvas once we get through the transition period.","Olivia Tong","Got it. Thanks. That's very helpful. If I could turn to the legacy Newell businesses then, just in terms of the profit by segment, Writing's obviously made a huge contribution over time and it's always been an outsized contributor. But even going back to prior back-to-school sell-in periods this was particularly notable. So how comfortable are you with, sort of, the makeup of the profit contributors by segment? And do you think that normalizes as sort of the back-to-school season closes out?","Michael Polk","I think Writing \u2013 we have to be careful to not bank too much profit out of Writing because there's so much opportunity to grow and strengthen our share position around the world. And so the balancing act when you've got an operating margin as high as the one we have, is to not get too ambitious for the margin, and to really think about the growth. I think we've struck the right balance up until now.","We've substantially increased the amount of A&P in that business over the last five years, and while geographic footprint extension will require incremental investments if we don't want to mortgage investment levels at home, I'm not sure how much more \u2013 it doesn't really need, I don't think, given the competitive set, personal care levels of A&P ratios. So we're getting close. If we can get ourselves to 9%, 10% A&P ratios I think we've got a really interesting and extendable place to be.","And then I think some of the other businesses, we want to continue to work on the margin structures. So a lot of the work we're doing on costs are in businesses that have less to offer in that respect and we have to do more. We have more work to do. That's why there's $230 million left on our project renewal roadmap, is because we want to get the margin flexibility into that portion of the P&L such that we do have the ability to invest.","Now in the combination, we may not choose to re-apply the investment where we get the cost savings out. I may take that money, Ralph and I may take that money with Mark and give it to Bill and ask him to go spend it on Yankee, because that's a better choice that makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts.","So we have plenty of room to go, room to run on costs on the legacy Newell business. And we have scale leverage to be captured through the integration in route to market, in cost to serve, in many, many places that we're going to be able to go after. And we should be able to get beyond the $500 million such that we have increased firepower. The question is how quickly do we do that and how quickly are we confident enough in that outcome that we're prepared to share that with you.","Olivia Tong","That's great. Thanks, Mike. Appreciate it.","Operator","And your next question will come from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Michael Polk","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good morning guys. Mike, I just wanted to follow-up on the Jarden portfolio question just to make sure I'm clear with that, because the business clearly has very strong momentum. The 5% organic sales growth clearly came in ahead of expectations. So is it really the product line exits? There's nothing suggesting that the momentum should slow, because it looks like the guidance which you conservatively took down to about 2% to 4%, it feels a bit conservative relative to the business momentum that has continued since the deal closed, particularly in JVC and JCS. I just wanted to make sure that I was clear on that.","And then secondarily, I don't know if you're prepared to comment on this today, but Yankee, and I share your optimism there and what you could potentially do with the business, can you talk a little bit about your willingness to expand the retail footprint, distribution opportunities, particularly abroad, potentially product category expansion plans, leveraging that brand equity and we've seen a little bit of that at a large mass customer in auto air fresheners.","Maybe you could build upon that a little bit and further context. The CEO of Jarden thought that they could double the size of that business over a reasonable amount of time, which I also agree felt reasonable. Maybe you can comment on that a little bit with respect to the potential long-term growth rate for the business. Thank you.","Michael Polk","Yeah. So the first part of your question on sustaining a 5% growth rate on the total business, clearly part of the reason we won't do that in the back half of the year is product line exit-related. Part of it is because I think it's the prudent thing to do, given the amount of change the organization's going to go through. So it's the right kind of cautious stance to take. Whether we beat that or not, time will tell. But Q2 didn't really have any material product line exits executed in it. So that's part of the discussion.","I don't want to get too specific on where those exits will occur because I don't want to be disruptive, either internally or compromise potential external opportunities to sell some of these assets. So I'm cautious on that one, and I know that feels like a bit of a fudge. But I think it's actually in your interest and in the investors' interest for me to manage it that way.","On Yankee. Look, the compound annual growth rate on Yankee has been around 7% for a long period of time. So if you want to double a business, all you've got to do is compound the growth at 7% for 10 years. Now, I'm not time-bounding how long it will take to double the business. But that's how the math works on that. Do we believe in Yankee? Absolutely. Do we believe in Yankee as much as we believe in Writing? Yep. Will Yankee end up being right up there at the top of the list of things we want to bet on? Yes. And is there an immense opportunity here? Yes. Is it broader than fragrance candles? Work to be done to confirm, but my intuition says, yes.","And so we'll see. It's a big category. It's a very, very strong brand. The experience in Europe that Jarden really has led increases confidence in the ability for the business to travel. And that is one of the reasons. That, coupled with the margin structure, coupled with the ability to create beautiful products through design, are a number of the reasons that it factors as a potentially really attractive play for us.","Kevin Grundy","Great. Congrats on the quarter.","Michael Polk","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Michael Polk","Hey, Wendy.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Good morning. Two questions. First on Yankee specifically. Number one, can you just remind us how much of that business is seasonal? In other words, in the fiscal fourth quarter, how much of the business shows up?","Second thing, the Nielsen data has not looked good for the last couple of months for Yankee. And I'm just wondering if that's irrelevant because it's such a small piece of the business. If there's something funky in the data. So if you could comment on that.","And then my second question is, just as you begin to look at the Jarden business, do you have a sense for the ballpark 4% of sales on advertising that you have talked about spending or you think it's right for the Newell business? Is that going to be higher or lower going forward for the Jarden business? Thanks.","Michael Polk","Thanks, Wendy. So I don't think Nielsen or IRI are going to be really good ways to measure the underlying performance in the business, in part because they've got to order a $500 million retail business that's not in there. And also I think that you're not able to see the direct to consumer piece of that through Nielsen. So we'll do our best to help you understand the underlying performance. I'll have to figure out how to do that. But there's no way we'd be growing 7% if we weren't having really good sell through, and it's been consistently there.","So I wouldn't use that as an indicator. I think that might be misleading because it will be such a small piece of the franchise. But you know what I'll do, Wendy, is we'll go do the math and figure out what percentage of the U.S. business Nielsen is really representing so I can be more precise with you than what I just said.","What was the second part of your question?","Wendy Nicholson","On the seasonality. How big a deal is the fourth quarter?","Michael Polk","Well, obviously, Q4 is a big deal because of the retail portion of the business, largely. And I haven't lived through a Q4 on the Yankee yet. But the Jarden folks do caution me to buckle up for Q4 because of the amount of revenue and profit that comes in between when the holiday merchandising and retail really kicks in in the end of the quarter. So it's a big bit of the overall performance of the business.","I'm actually going to just take a sneak peek at one of my cheat sheets because I don't mind giving you the quarter four percent. But I don't know that I've got it in front of me. Wendy, you know what we'll do? I'll have Nancy follow-up with you and just give you a snapshot of how the Yankee business profiles by quarter.","We've got a lot of seasonality in the business. We just came through Jostens', for example, key period in Q2 where nearly 50% of the annual business is done in the second quarter on Jostens. Yankee is I don't think quite that high, but it's a pretty high quarter. And there's another element to that, which is the relative profit contribution, which is also quite high in Q4. But I don't have any problem passing that along. So let us do that after. It's probably about \u2013 I would guess, it's close to 40% of the revenue is in the fourth quarter.","Wendy Nicholson","Perfect.","Michael Polk","On Yankee. That'd be a rough estimate, but Nancy will get back with you precisely.","Wendy Nicholson","Perfect. And then on advertising?","Michael Polk","On advertising. Look, I'm not ready to declare really what I think the end state advertising A&P ratio ought to be for the business. We're going to work through that over the next month or two as part of the strategy work. As you know, on the legacy Newell businesses I was targeting 7% A&P ratio. I think the average across the total business is going to be something less, substantially less, than that when we get to articulating it. But it wouldn't surprise me that we would want somewhere near 5% across the total landscape.","There are portions of the business where we really have learned either it doesn't work and therefore we'd be better off pivoting that investment to selling expense on the legacy Newell businesses and then there's specific businesses within the Jarden footprint that really we wouldn't put big A&P behind, Process Solutions being one of them. And there are some other businesses as well. So I'm not ready to declare, but I think it's certainly less than 7%.","Ralph Nicoletti","And, Wendy, I think importantly as we move forward in communication on this area, we'll probably more guide to total A&P spending and talk about specific categories across the whole enterprise, not legacy Jarden businesses versus legacy Newell, because we're going to allocate across all.","Wendy Nicholson","Perfect. Makes sense. Thanks much.","Operator","And your next question will come from Stephanie Wissink with Piper Jaffray.","Michael Polk","Hey, Stephanie.","Stephanie Wissink","Hi. Good morning and welcome, Ralph, officially.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thank you.","Stephanie Wissink","Just two really quick ones. Mike, you mentioned that the cadence of sales in the back half kind of the Q3, Q4 split, but you didn't mention the anniversarying effect of Jostens or Waddington in that?","Michael Polk","Yeah.","Stephanie Wissink","So I'm just curious if you can give us some sense of how we should be modeling the incremental businesses that are joining the core sales?","Michael Polk","Sure.","Stephanie Wissink","And then Ralph, one for you just on the \u2013 this is a bit of a follow-up to Wendy's earlier question, but as the costs come out of the business, it sounds like a lot of that is in background functions and, Mike, you mentioned some investment back in at the brand level. So can you just help us think about the relationship between gross margin and SG&A, maybe even over time, not necessarily just in the next couple of quarters, but how those should evolve in relationship to one another? Thank you.","Ralph Nicoletti","I'll start on the gross margin SG&A side. I think the way to think about that is once you look at it on a pro forma basis, so that there's no mix effect of the combination of the businesses, we'll look to grow our gross margins over time through a combination of driving innovation and mix. Our assumption is on cost, that we'll be able to price costs away over time. So any cost increases, we should be able to manage through pricing over time. In any one particular month or quarter, there'll be some lumpiness to it, but we should be able to manage that over time.","And then leveraging our fixed costs that still sit up in the gross margin line through growth is the other piece. So we should grow our gross margins, and some of that gross margin improvement is going to get reinvested into the A&P line as Mike alluded to earlier, as we look to kind of settle out at an A&P range across the whole portfolio, which should get us, ultimately, some operating income improvement.","Michael Polk","On your question on Waddington and Jostens, Waddington will come into core sales on August 1, that anniversaries the acquisition that Jarden made of Waddington. And Jostens will come in on December 1. So Jostens really won't feature in core this year. Waddington will begin to feature in core. Jostens, interestingly enough, as a little sound bite, grew in the second quarter, which is really important and good news.","But I think the way to think about it is, that Jostens growth rate will be dilutive to the overall core growth rate of the company, because we don't expect Jostens to be much more than a 1% to 2% growth business. So you have to build that into your thinking as well. And Waddington has some interesting opportunities, so I wouldn't declare which way Waddington will break. I think depending on whether we resource some of the opportunities there, it could be accretive to our growth rate.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Polk","Hey, Joe.","Joe Lachky","So I know you haven't given specific 2017 guidance yet, but I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more generally? So, obviously, you've headwinds in Q1 because of the interest expense and then Jarden seasonality, but, I mean, I guess through 2017 you should begin to see some accelerating synergies here. So I guess overall, I mean I know you've talked generally about accretion from the deal, but I'm wondering if maybe, given the headwinds, we should prepare for a below algorithm EPS growth year for 2017, just kind of wanted your thoughts on that.","Michael Polk","Yeah. You know I think last call we had, we talked about this specifically and Q1 would definitely be a dilutive quarter versus prior year because of share count, interest expense and the fact that it's not a great normally a big quarter for the Jarden businesses. So we, in all of the conversations that I've provided around accretion, I talked about year one being high single digits. Now we may do better than that, given some of the numbers we're putting up. But Q1 definitely is going to be dilutive, needs to be built into the model that way.","I looked at your guys' estimates for Q1 through First Call and I don't want to get into a specific number, but they're close to what I would think it would be. But we shouldn't be thinking about Q1 being a big winning quarter for us from an EPS perspective. So it definitely needs to be built into your models that way on share counts, on interest expense alone.","And then the other side of this is, although synergies will work as a positive, as will renewal savings work as a positive, but on balance there's no way to overcome the share count. Because remember, your share count's going from 260 million to something almost double that.","So not a chance we're accretive in Q1. But full-year, I think you guys are pretty close in aggregate. I don't think everybody's got their estimates in for 2017, but when we get closer, you should expect us with Q3 earnings to provide some perspective on 2017.","Joe Lachky","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And your final question comes from Rupesh Parikh. Please go ahead. From Oppenheimer.","Michael Polk","Hi, Rupesh.","Rupesh Parikh","Hey. Thanks for fitting me in. So I just had a quick question just overall on the retail landscape. So we've continued to see challenges with brick-and-mortar retail, Sports Authority going bankrupt and other challenges with sporting goods. Just as you look at your business, are there challenges for the brick and mortar space accelerating and are you generally recapturing that on the e-commerce side of the house?","Michael Polk","I don't look at it as shift, but we are definitely investing in e-comm, both direct-to-consumer, pure play e-comm retailers, and then bricks and mortar dotcom equally important to us to pure play. So clearly, there's a shift in shopping behavior underway in the U.S. and we want to reach consumers where they shop. And we also want to win with winning customers. And so those two principles drive the allocation of resource for us.","In order to reach consumers where they shop, when they're shopping in an e-commerce environment, we've made the determination that we need to invest in specialized skills and we've built out a whole team of e-commerce resources from the outside that are really driving our activity plans in these areas. And so we intend to continue to step up investment in this area this year, next year, the year beyond. And this can be, and should be for Newell Brands, a differentiated capability, relative to our competitive set. That does not mean we're taking resource away from our bricks and mortar partners. Wal-Mart is our biggest partner. A big 95% of their business with us is brick and mortar still.","So, obviously, for all of those folks that are in that phase of striking the right balance within their business model, we need to resource our relationship with that customer and our programming with that customer in a way that fits their strategic roadmap. And so that's the moment we're in with respect to e-commerce. We expect to disproportionately grow our e-commerce business relative to bricks and mortar. And we want to grow ahead of the market growth in the channel because we want to have our share of market in the e-commerce channels, plural, greater than our share of market in brick and mortar because as shoppers shift to that channel, we do not want a negative share mix effect on the aggregate market. And so really, really important, one of the dislocating ideas and the most important things we do as a company over the next 5 years to 10 years is to be in front in this space.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. Thank you for all the color.","Operator","There is...","Michael Polk","Yes. Thank you, Ebony. I think that's our last question. I would just end by saying, and this is probably a message to our team. I'm incredibly proud of our team for what we did in the second quarter. A deal like this has the potential to be incredibly distractive, and the team was able to focus on delivery in an unwavering way that inspires confidence in our ability to really play for the upside in the combination. So thank you to my team if you're still listening. And let's go after the upside together. Talk soon, everybody.","Operator","A replay of today's call will be available later today on our website newellbrands.com. This concludes our conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After a brief discussion by management, we will open up the call for questions. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellrubbermaid.com on the Investor Relations home page under Events & Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download.","I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Laurie. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Newell's third quarter 2015 conference call. On the call today, in addition to myself, are Mike Polk, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stipancich, our Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that on today's call we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that Newell has provided reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.","Our comments today also include forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on assumptions and actual results could differ materially from management's expectations. We direct you to the cautionary statement in the 8-K that we filed with our earnings release and on our website.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Go ahead.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call.","Building on very good first half results, we delivered another strong performance in the third quarter. In that context, we've reaffirmed our 2015 full year normalized EPS guidance and raised our core sales growth guidance.","Before we get into the results, let me briefly address two strategic changes to our portfolio. First, as we've announced, we will divest our D\u00e9cor business. And consistent with our practice on businesses held for sale that do not qualify for discontinued operations, we will exclude D\u00e9cor from core sales from the beginning of Q3 2015 through the completion of the sales process. I want to acknowledge our D\u00e9cor associates for their many contributions to Newell and also thank them in advance for their continued focus through the process.","Second, last week we completed the acquisition of Elmer's Products Incorporated. We're delighted to welcome the Elmer's team and Elmer's three leading brands, Elmer's, Krazy Glue, and X-ACTO, to our company. These brands provide terrific drive period synergies at back-to-school, great cross-sell potential across our channels and together with our Prismacolor, Rotring, Paper Mate Flair, and Mr. Sketch brands strengthened our position in crafts. Consistent with our practice on acquired businesses, Elmer's sales will not contribute to core sales until the first anniversary of the completion of the acquisition.","So let's get into our third quarter performance. In Q3, core sales grew 5.9%; the strongest quarterly core sales growth in years. Net sales grew 3.1% with acquisitions and planned and completed divestitures contributing 340 basis points to growth, offset by a 620-basis point negative impact due to foreign currency.","Normalized gross margin increased 30 basis points to 39.5%, driven by productivity, pricing and mix partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency. We sustained high levels of investment in advertising and promotion at 5.2% of sales. And we delivered strong normalized operating margin of 15.2%, a 90-basis point increase compared to prior year.","Normalized EPS was $0.62, $0.01 ahead of consensus and 6.9% ahead of prior year, despite having to overcome a $0.14 negative impact from foreign currency.","Our third quarter core sales growth was broad-based with growth in all five segments and all four regions. Combined, our Win Bigger businesses grew core sales 8.8% with standout growth in our Writing & Creative Expression and Food & Beverage businesses.","Our Writing segment grew core sales 11%, Commercial Products, 3.7%, Tools, 3.1%, Home Solutions, 0.8% and Baby, 8.1%.","Our nine month results are really strong as well. Core sales increased 5.2% with growth in all five regions and all four \u2013 all four regions and all five segments. Our Win Bigger businesses grew 8.7%, with strong double digit growth in our Writing & Creative Expression and Food & Beverage businesses. We've returned our Baby business to growth, delivering 5% growth over the first nine months. And our acquisitions, when combined with our core growth, have offset the negative impact of currency and divestitures to yield 3.7% net sales growth year-to-date.","Despite unprecedented currency pressure on our cost, we've expanded normalized gross margins 30 basis points to 39.5%. And importantly, year-to-date, we've increased advertising and promotion investment by over 17%. Despite spending more behind our brands, we simultaneously increased normalized operating margins 60 basis points, enabled by the work we're doing to make Newell leaner and more efficient through Project Renewal, all this together, yielding 7.3% normalized EPS growth despite having to absorb a negative $0.33 impact of foreign currency.","We are obviously very pleased with the first nine months of 2015. We have clear momentum in our business and view our results as evidence of the progress we are making transforming Newell into a leading performer in our industry.","Let me hand the call over to John to go through our results in more detail. And then I'll return to provide perspective on the balance of 2015 and our initial outlook for 2016.","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Third quarter reported net sales were $1.53 billion, a 3.1% increase versus last year. Core sales, which exclude acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency, and the planned disposal of our D\u00e9cor business, increased 5.9%. The net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and D\u00e9cor contributed 340 basis points to reported net sales. Foreign currency had a negative impact of 620 basis points.","All five of our segments and all four of our regions delivered core sales growth with Writing and Baby leading the pack. Strong volume growth and pricing in Venezuela contributed 150 basis points to our Q3 core sales, a decline from last quarter's contribution. And we expect the contribution to further decline in Q4. We now anticipate the full year contribution from Venezuela will be around 130 basis points of core sales growth.","Reported gross margin was 39.1%, up 30 basis points to last year. Normalized gross margin was 39.5%, also up 30 basis points over last year. This improvement was driven by productivity, lower input costs, pricing and favorable business mix, which more than offset unfavorable currency and the negative mix impact from the gross margin structure of our 2014 acquisitions.","Normalized SG&A expense was $372 million or 24.3% of sales, down 60 basis points versus prior year. And we reduced overhead by 20 basis points versus prior year. We continued to invest in advertising and promotions, spending 5.2% of sales in the third quarter. Our year-to-date A&P investment is up 60 basis points at about 4.7% of sales, and we still anticipate spending at around 5% of sales for the full year. We increased advertising and promotion investment dollars in Writing and Baby, where we launched marketing campaign to support Paper Mate InkJoy, Sharpie Extreme and Sharpie Clear View, Mr. Sketch, Graco Pack 'n Play, the Graco 4Ever Car Seat in North America, and Aprica's Hero Innovation in Japan.","Normalized operating margin was 15.2%, up 90 basis points, reflecting the benefit of Project Renewal, gross margin expansion, and other cost savings initiatives, partially offset by significant FX headwinds. Reported operating margin was 12.2% compared with 11.7% in the prior year. Interest expense of $17.5 million increased $3.2 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of our late 2014 debt refinancing and higher overall borrowings related to our acquisitions in the back half of last year.","Our normalized tax rate was 20% compared with 19.5% a year ago. We still expect our full year normalized 2015 tax rate to increase versus last year, but now land under 24%. Normalized EPS which excludes restructuring and other project costs and other items was $0.62, a 6.9% increase to last year despite about $0.14 of FX headwinds. On a reported basis, third quarter EPS was $0.50 compared with $0.44 last year.","I'll now move on to our segment results, and starting with Writing, reported third quarter net sales grew 1.4% to $459.5 million. Core sales increased 11% with strong mid-single digit growth in North America and low single digit growth in EMEA driven by strengthened innovation, core distribution gains, strong Back-to-School marketing and merchandising, and pricing. These results were achieved despite having a comp of strong Back-to-School a year ago period of over 8% growth. We continue to drive impressive POS in the U.S., thanks to the combined impact of increased A&P and more robust merchandising efforts.","Our emerging markets Writing business in Latin America continues to perform well with pricing and strong sell-out fueling great results. Q3 normalized operating margin in our Writing segment was 25.3%, a 120-basis point increase over the prior year due to strong productivity, pricing, favorable mix and cost management which more than offset foreign currency impacts.","Net sales in our Home Solutions segment grew 10.2% to $459.4 million with acquisitions contributing $47.7 million. Core sales increased 80 basis points due to the sustained high single digit growth in Food & Beverage, which includes one month of Contigo sales, having now lapped the 2014 acquisition.","This more than offset our continued exit of portions of the low margin Consumer Storage business, as well as a reduced amount of retailer promotions in the quarter. Home Solutions normalized operating margin was 16.7%, up 140 basis points, reflecting the favorable mix, productivity and lower input costs.","Our Tools segment delivered net sales of $196.7 million, an 8.4% decrease, all of which and then some was driven by FX. Core sales grew 3.1% with all four geographies delivering growth. Our Irwin Construction Tools & Accessories business continues to perform well with our Irwin Brazil business recovering in mid-single digit growth, though our Lenox Industrial Tools business is showing signs of being impacted by the global slowdown of heavy manufacturing. Normalized operating margin in the Tools segment was 10.4%, a 50-basis point decline versus last year driven mostly by negative FX partially offset by pricing and productivity.","Reported net sales in our Commercial Products segment decreased 5.1% to $206.8 million, reflecting the sale of our medical carts business in August. Core sales increased 3.7% lapping over 11% growth on the third quarter of last year, reflecting strong distributor growth, pricing and solid growth in North America and EMEA.","Both regions showed good underlying sell-out trends enabled by strong innovation and sales execution. Commercial Products normalized operating margin was 15.2%, a 260-basis point increase to last year due to pricing, productivity and input cost benefits partially offset by negative FX.","And our Baby segment reported $207.6 million in net sales, a 14.4% increase compared to last year. The Baby Jogger acquisition contributed $19.6 million in net sales during the quarter. Core sales grew 8.1% with mid-single-digit growth in North America and double-digit growth in Asia, as well as good growth in the emerging markets portion of our EMEA business, despite continued weakness in Russia. We continue to experience very good POS growth, fueled by new innovative products, like our Graco 4Ever car seat and increased advertising and promotion in both the U.S. and Japan.","Baby's normalized operating margin was 4.9%, down 90 basis points to last year, largely due to increased advertising and promotion spend and pricing actions on the value end of our product line at a key U.S. retailer to defend our core, as well as negative FX, partially offset by mix.","Now if we look at Q3 core sales by geography, North America grew core sales 3.4%. We had strong results from Writing, Baby, and our Food & Beverage business, with all five of our segments contributing to growth.","In EMEA, core sales grew 4.7% due to strong growth in Tools and Commercial Products as well as Baby's return to growth in the region. In Latin America core sales grew 26.5%, reflecting volume gains in Writing and pricing across the region to cover FX. And finally, Asia-Pacific core sales grew 8.2%, with dramatic improvement in our Baby business and strong growth in Writing.","Moving on to cash and our balance sheet, in Q3 we generated $339.9 million in operating cash compared with $339.2 million in the prior year. Year to date we've generated $288.1 million compared with $343.3 million last year, but recall we made a $70 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. pension plan earlier this year. Adjusting for this, our year-to-date operating cash flow is up about 4.3% compared to last year.","We returned $93.3 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $51 million in dividends and $42.3 million to repurchase a little over 1 million of our shares. And as of the end of Q3, we have $270 million available under our authorized open market repurchase plan.","And finally, our balance sheet remains healthy with $266 million of cash on hand and about $588 million in liquidity. Our balance sheet metrics continue to be strong, giving us continued financial flexibility to support Project Renewal and for other acquisitions beyond Elmer's should we choose to pursue them.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, John. Let's now turn to the balance of 2015.","This morning we reaffirmed our 2015 full-year normalized EPS guidance and raised our core sales guidance. Our revised core sales guidance range is now 5% to 5.5%. And our normalized EPS guidance range remains $2.14 to $2.20. Our best estimate for delivery is at the midpoints of each component in this full-year guidance.","We've held our normalized EPS guidance despite our expectation that the full-year negative foreign currency impact will now be $0.41 to $0.44, about $0.05 worse than previously communicated, as a result of the further weakening of currencies in Latin America and Canada. We've taken broad-based actions to deal with the currency impact and have made good progress covering the exposure. The expansion of Project Renewal has helped, and we will take further action through Q4 to cover the full impact.","In 2015, we expect A&P investment to increase by over 16% and A&P as a percentage of sales to be about 5%. Despite the unprecedented ForEx challenge, we remain firm in our conviction to steadily increase brand support given the core growth acceleration and market share increases we're experiencing. Year to date, we've increased value market share in the U.S. in 10 of 13 product categories that IRI measures, and dollar sell-out has increased over 5% in 11 of those 13 product categories. Our innovation, brand investment, and drive for broadened core distribution are working.","In 2015, on a currency-neutral basis, the $2.17 midpoint of our normalized EPS guidance range represents very strong double-digit EPS growth of nearly 30%. If circumstances develop that give us flexibility to deliver beyond the $2.17 normalized EPS guidance midpoint, we will prioritize investing back into the business rather than strengthen already highly competitive earnings growth any further in 2015.","Our 2015 guidance now assumes Venezuela will contribute about 130 basis points to our core sales growth, an increase of 60 basis points versus last year's contribution. Excluding the contribution to growth of our Venezuelan operations, the midpoint of our full-year 2015 core sales guidance range would be 4%. Our 2015 guidance now estimates Venezuela will contribute $0.12 to our 2015 normalized EPS. Excluding the contribution of our Venezuelan operations to normalized EPS, the midpoint of our revised 2015 normalized EPS guidance range would be $2.05.","Our initial outlook for 2016 calls for continued growth acceleration and sustained strong normalized earnings per share growth, in line with the Growth Game Plan acceleration stage guidance. Our initial 2016 full-year guidance is core sales growth of 5% to 6% and normalized EPS of $2.35 to $2.44. Our guidance assumes another double-digit increase in A&P investment in 2016. The 2016 guidance also assumes that foreign exchange negatively impacts normalized EPS by an additional $0.21 to $0.23 beyond the $0.41 to $0.44 experienced in 2015. On a currency-neutral basis, our 2016 full-year guidance represents strong double-digit earnings per share growth of over 20%.","In order to provide more visibility into our initial 2016 full-year guidance, we have provided a view excluding the contribution of our Venezuelan operations. Excluding the contribution of our Venezuelan operations, our initial 2016 full-year guidance is core sales growth of 4% to 5% and normalized EPS of $2.21 to $2.30, an increase of 8% to 12% compared with our 2015 Venezuela adjusted base of $2.05. We will provide more perspective on the factors that could influence delivery in 2016 with our fourth quarter earnings.","So let me close now by reiterating that we've had a very good first nine months of the year, delivering strong competitive results. Growth continues to accelerate. And despite unprecedented foreign currency pressure, we're delivering very strong normalized EPS results. Our initial 2016 full-year guidance aligns with our long-term outlook of 4% or greater core sales growth and double-digit normalized EPS growth.","Our building momentum is a function of the sharp choices we've made. We're investing to create advantaged brand development and innovation capabilities and are backing them up with category-leading marketing investment. Our innovation funnel has nearly doubled since 2013, with value per project up over 150%.","These bigger projects have moved steadily from concept to market and are now launching, like: Graco's 4Ever car seat, offering four seats in one, so that your car seat grows with your child; or Dymo's XTL Industrial Labeling System, which is outfitted with time-saving features to make complex labeling jobs simple for tradesmen; or Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens, which dry three times faster for reduced smearing; or Rubbermaid's FRESHWORKS Produce Preservation System, which keeps produce and berries fresher for up to 80% longer.","These innovations leverage strengthened execution capabilities in R&D and the new product design capability we've invested to create at our purpose-built design center. Our growth ideas are being supported with industry-leading investment and the near doubling of our advertising and promotion spending. This investment has been enabled by our determination to make Newell leaner and more efficient and to unlock the craft capacity for growth.","Coupled with the actions we've taken to strengthen our portfolio like last week's acquisition of Elmer's, Krazy Glue, and X-ACTO, these choices to build and then invest behind industry-leading brands and innovation are yielding some of the strongest growth results Newell has experienced, record normalized operating margin and record normalized earnings per share.","We're on a path to completely transform Newell, delivering highly competitive and differentiated results. Growth is the engine that powers us. That's the Growth Game Plan into action. That is the new Newell Rubbermaid.","Let me now pass the line to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Dara. How are you?","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good. How are you?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, Mike or Stip, just one clarification. As you think about 2016, if you did decide to deconsolidate Venezuela at some point, do you think you'd look to offset that negative impact through other areas in the P&L? Or with the FX pressure even before Venezuela and the planned investment behind the business, is it unrealistic to expect any significant mitigating actions versus that potential Venezuela impact in 2016?","And then, the real question, Mike, ex-currency, you're expecting local currency earnings to be up about 30% this year, next year as you mentioned 20%-plus. It's heroic you were able to offset the FX through other areas in the P&L, and certainly better than peers. But do you worry at all that you're stretching the organization to hit these numbers and to fully offset FX?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dara, great questions. It's awfully early to know or speculate about what we would do if we were to deconsolidate the Venezuelan business. We actually have a ton of flexibility with all the work we're doing on cost and with the significant investments. We've got incremental investments we've got planned for next year as I said. Our base plan assumes we deliver double digit increases in A&P investments next year on top of the increases we delivered this year, and on top of the increases we made last year on our way to this goal of getting to 7% A&P ratio in the business by the end of the first \u2013 the end of the Growth Game Plan window, five-year window. And so, we have lots of flexibility to deal with all kinds of different circumstances going into next year.","I wouldn't want to speculate on exactly what we would do. I think strategically, our commitment is to continue to invest in these brands, because we see the phenomenal results and the growth acceleration, and more importantly, the sheer gains we're garnering in our core businesses and our home markets.","And so, while we'll have flexibility to do any number of different things in 2016 and beyond, we want to keep our eye on the ball of the strategic agenda we have for growth acceleration, and the strengthening of our brands. We feel we're really in a terrific position right now having started to prove out the effectiveness of this operating model, and we want to see that all the way through.","That said, we've demonstrated this capability to flex and find the right balance between both the top line growth in margin development and earnings development, and you should expect us to continue to apply that principled approach and balanced approach going forward.","Our guidance, we've given you visibility into what our guidance would look like ex-Venezuela that our guidance really is the 5% to 6% core growth and what effectively is 8% to 12% growth off of our midpoint of $2.17 this year \u2013 or next, and we'll see how the whole year plays out as we get a little bit closer. Obviously, lots of moving parts in currency, and we've made a set of assumptions about next year, but we'll have to flex and adapt in what has been a pretty volatile and changing environment.","With respect to stretching the organization, one of the great assets of Newell, and I've learned to respect and appreciate it as I've been here for a little bit over closing in on four-and-a-half years now, this team just has this tenacity for delivery, and it's a great asset. It's one of the things you can't teach. And it's such a core in asset of what we've got here.","So, I think our team is unwavering in their commitment to try to achieve everything we've been leaning our shoulders into. And there are moments, when that gets tiresome and people are weary, but we've got a strong focused team committed to changing the perception of our company in the marketplace in making Newell into a leading industry performer.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Hi. Good morning.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wanted to talk a little bit about Home Solutions. So you mentioned Food & Beverage doing high single-digit growth. How much longer is there on the storage tote exits really left? And then I was curious about the timing of the innovation launch on the FRESH deal, if that's a fourth quarter initiative because I feel like that could drive another leg of growth beyond the hydration that you're already seeing.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, it's a great question. So, Lauren, we still have more work to do and we're pacing that work against our need to deliver the results in aggregate. You see this playing out actually in our Canadian results right now, where we have even a bigger Rubbermaid Consumer Storage business than we do on a U.S. on a per capita basis.","And so we've got more work to do there. We will manage it deliberately and planfully against the upside potential of our Food Storage business. But we will continue to work that issue right through 2016 and maybe even into 2017. But you should expect and understand that that's captured in our plan and it's captured in our guidance. And so, don't expect us to really kind of spring any surprises on you about that. That's baked into our logic and the algorithm for Home Solutions growth.","On Food Storage, you're right. We've got this great innovation, called FRESHWORKS, which goes towards the end of this year and really kind of picks up momentum in next year. We're extending the concept behind LunchBlox, which has been a terrific success, as households become more durable and less focused on consumable storage. And school systems and regulatory bodies and municipalities get concerned about waste in landfill cost. We're extending that concept which is kid-focused to adults with an idea, called Rubbermaid FASTEN + GO, which is a terrific application of lunch to work for adults that I think is going to really be interesting to watch play out over next year that comes a little bit later in the year than FRESHWORKS.","And then we've got more activity in the back end of the year that is \u2013 it's probably more of a 2017 idea on Rubbermaid core Food Storage. I'm not going to go into it too much now. You should expect that we end up with this nice rhythm and sequence of sustained innovation coming on Rubbermaid that effectively creates a renaissance for that brand, with its core in the kitchen and in Food Storage Preservation and Food on-the-go.","And so, it's very exciting next few years on Rubbermaid, I think. Combine that with the Beverage work we're doing on all three brands, bubba, Contigo and the Rubbermaid brand and you get some exciting stuff that should more than offset the down elevators on the less profitable portions of the Consumer, Rubbermaid Consumer business. And importantly, you should see some growth acceleration on Home Solutions next year as a consequence of that profile of performance.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's great. Thank you. And then on Baby, you mentioned that you have adjusted pricing on the value end of the portfolio. How far into the quarter did that flow through retail? Are you seeing any indication of competitive response? Do you think pricing will be sort of stable there for the next couple of quarters?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, we implemented that through the third quarter. And we've \u2013 it's on certain items on our flank at a couple of mass merchants where we've done that. So it's not across the board. It's really a defensive tactic that we do not want any of the lower end players to grab too much share and then be able to over time, leverage that scale to do more strategic work or directly competing with Graco.","So, we're always prepared to kind of take the defensive posture and the competitive posture that gives us to degrees our freedom to do what we want to do with the brand itself. I was very pleased with the Graco growth at 8.1% \u2013 actually Baby growth at 8.1%. We had strong recovery in Japan, and as importantly, really good Graco momentum in the U.S. despite the valuing down in certain mass merchants to protect our flank against some of our competitors.","So, I think we're striking the right balance. We continue to invest in advertising. In fact, we're investing heavily in advertising in Baby and accepting the margin contraction for the sake of catalyzing the growth. And I think you should expect us to continue with that algorithm forward into next year. And if we can, eventually we'll back off but we're going to block and flank \u2013 we're going to block any flanking activity on our competitors' part, because we believe that's the strategically right thing to do to enable us to have the degrees of freedom to invest in the core and in the premium end of our portfolio.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Bill.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Can you just talk broadly about the retail conversations you're having right now. Obviously, they're facing quite a bit of wage inflation. They're paranoid justifiably so on some of the e-commerce growth, and then in obviously emerging markets given the currency moves, my guess is cash is at a premium right now. So, can you just like broadly talk about what you see on the pricing side and things like that?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. All of our partners are moving \u2013 all of our bricks and mortar partners are aggressively moving into the e-commerce space. So, they're all benefiting as they get there with the kind of the growth surge that comes from reaching consumers where they want to shop. And we've made a significant investment to strengthen our capabilities here a few years back and we're, I think, on the front of that curve in partnership with our retailers to help unlock the upside for them and for us.","So, on the e-commerce side, I think we're all moving aggressively. And, of course, the strategic motivation for us, Bill, is that we need to have greater than our fair share position in that channel in order to mix up our overall share position as consumers increasingly shift through that medium to do their shopping.","So, this is a critical strategic thrust for us as important as broadening our geographic footprint into the emerging markets, and you should expect us to be prepared to talk about that pretty steadily for the next four years or five years to be honest with you because that's going to take that kind of investment and energy in pivoting of our talent base to that space in partnership with our retailers. That's one aspect of the question you asked.","The other relates to some of the pressures that retailers are feeling as a result of wage inflation that they're doing to help their associates live better lives in the context of what's still a tough macro environment for the middle class and, in particular, the lower end of the middle class.","And so, I respect all those choices. Those are strategic choices. They're the right choices, that puts pressure into their P&L and as strategic partners with our retailers, we need to work with them as they deal with those issues. And there are very constructive ways to do this that benefit both us and \u2013 can benefit both us and them through growth acceleration.","Our growth in the mass channel is very strong relative to the mass channels growth right now. Our POS momentum adds most of the big names. Mass retailers is quite strong relative to their comp store growth. And the reason it is, is because we built a capability in selling that's committed to a collaborative approach to growth. Not always do we agree. We have some tough wrestling matches over terms at times but it's constructive.","And when you think about how we approach moments in time like what many of the retailers are facing right now, you should think about it in that context that we will sit down and strategically work through how to make this a win-win scenario. And that's what the teams are doing and have been doing for a few months, right, probably since July and August as we got closer to operationalizing our commercial plans for the first half of 2016.","And I sit here today feeling quite confident that we won't be talking about those types of issues with you, that we'll deal with it within our operations and we'll end up in a place where we are supporting our retailers' strategic agenda while being uncompromising in our strategic agenda. And there are always creative paths to the proper resolution in moments of time like this. So, I know that's vague and not too specific, but that quite frankly is strategically how I've encouraged the team to deal with it and that's how they're dealing with it.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. That's super-helpful. And then just, Stip, can you just tell me what the overhead ratio \u2013 SG&A overhead ratio was down for the year, and then maybe when it starts to accelerate because I know you have some pretty ambitious targets to try to get that number below 15% or 14% over time. I'm just curious what you think the duration is and when we're going to kind of see that step change because I think that's 20 bps this quarter which is fine, but it's not huge either.","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So with respect to the year, we're down noticeably. And we continue to make progress. Part of our big step-up where you'll see probably next year as we tackle some of the support functions coming up. We have some work to do, but it's been well played out and well planned in terms of the delivery overall. So, I think you'll see a better step-up in terms of SG&A.","I think Mike's consistently talked about where we try to benchmark ourselves on what's realistic and where we want to ultimately get to. The good news is we see the benefit of the SG&A reductions going into the increased advertising and promotion. And so it, obviously, gives us more incentive to push harder on the overheads within reason in order to fund the A&P agenda overall.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So the only build I would make on that is that I think on the full year, we'll see our overhead below 20%. And on our way to another step change down in 2016, we've focused a lot of energy up until now on resetting the organization to the new operating model, and we've deferred on a lot of the back office work until this point in time. And that's where the next round of savings will come through playing for a more efficient back office overhead structures.","Part of that is the choice we've made to get out of this beautiful corporate headquarters building, beautiful but expensive, and play for a different type of environment that is more in sync with the kind of the virtual nature of how management today has to operate. We're on the road all the time, so you don't need these huge edifices anymore. We want our money focused not on infrastructure but on brands. And so, you will see the benefits of those choices, which we've made now start to flow through in 2016.","And the other thing you should recognize in our numbers this year is actually, relative to our expectations, we're having a very good year. So, and despite making progress on overheads, we're covering what should be a good year from a management incentive perspective this year for our people, which I'm very happy for, I'm proud of because I do think it reflects the extraordinary work that they've done, but in bed within our overhead numbers that you see or you can back into are those costs.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. That's super helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Mike, you talk a lot about incremental investments sort of continuing to put money back into the business. And I guess at some point when do you reach the point of diminishing marginal returns? And how are you thinking about allocating that incremental spending sort of way down the line? And I guess this leads to a second question which is, is that one of the things that's sort of feeding your appetite from an acquisition standpoint in terms of the ability to invest more behind these brands maybe than what their current owners can do?","And then to add another thing on to that, how are you feeling about divestitures on the other side in terms of \u2013 you're obviously dealing with D\u00e9cor. Is this something where we should expect a modest change from a divestiture standpoint every year, every two years, something like that? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","John, great questions. We continue to believe that the right destination for us in order to be able to afford to deploy our portfolio into white space geographies is about 7% of revenue in A&P. We don't expect to get there overnight. We expect to get there over the next couple of years. And we can always adjust the cadence by which we play that story out. So, there's no rush to get there and we're not going to spend any money on things that don't justify spending money on.","So, every dollar is valuable to us and we are looking at the investment profile in certain businesses and asking the questions you would want us to ask on growth yield. And also to your point, the next dollar, how do you deploy the next dollar? Should you put the next dollar into Writing? Are you sure you're going to be able to get the growth yields you've gotten so far out of that investment?","So we have an ambition for geographic deployment of the portfolio, particularly in Writing and Tools, increasingly in Food and in Beverage, and those will come with costs. We look at some of the acquisitions like Contigo as a brand. And we look at the acquisitions that we've just made on Elmer's and say man, I wonder if you could accelerate the growth even further on a brand like Contigo with an investment in communication, which is a possibility. We're exploring that.","We don't default to an assumption that in fact that can yield. We really don't. We're pretty objective about this. But we will go explore that. So what does branded communication look like in a brand like Contigo?","The Elmer's business, we love these brands. They're great brands. We think we can apply our operating model to these brands. And because of the breadth of resources we have relative to their prior owners, we do believe that a brand like Elmer's and maybe a brand like Krazy Glue and probably someday a brand like X-ACTO could benefit from brand support in a way that the prior owners couldn't generate. And so that's clearly another opportunity for us going forward.","But all that said, we're not going to spend money unless it generates a yield. There's plenty of investment we need to make in e-commerce, for example. And I'd just gladly put some of that money back to capability development to set up a more strategic future for our business as put it into brand support. These are very specific choices that our leadership team sits around the table and discusses. We continue to manage resource deployment both human capital and money very \u2013 in not such a democratic way. We sit around the room and we make those choices based on where we think the most strategic value can be created.","If there isn't a place to spend it on, we'll just let it flow through to margin. And like I said, when we announced the third phase of Project Renewal that was related to overheads, about 50% of the savings we expect to generate from that restructuring extension is going to flow to margin, and you're starting to see some of that. We delivered operating margin of 15.2%, which is a 90 basis point increase despite delivering 5.9% core sales growth with 5.2% A&P investment. That's a really cool algorithm. And so we're not in a hurry to get to 7%, but we're going to \u2013 and we're going to be very thoughtful about where we deploy the money, but it's money deployed to extend the growth trajectory in the business. We've taken our guidance for next year to 5% to 6% core growth. That's above what we envisioned being able to do at this stage in the Growth Game Plan, and it's a testament to the algorithm working.","So I truly appreciate the fact that our investors want us to strike a balance, and I actually want us to strike a balance too. And I never want to spend money on things that don't yield some either strategic benefit or commercial benefit, and we won't do that. That said, we'll make mistakes. We'll learn through our experiences as we go, and we'll process that learning. And if that yields an acceleration in margin versus an acceleration in investment, great. We're as interested in sustained strong growth and simultaneously delivering margin and EPS growth at leadership levels as we are just simply growth as a standalone metric.","So the beauty of our algorithm is I think we're going to be one of the unique companies over the next few years that can deliver strong growth through increased investment in A&P while simultaneously delivering margin expansion and generating free cash flow yield as a result of the restructuring waning through that timeframe. I'm hard-pressed to see too many companies that will be in a position to do that. And I think that is what makes us unique in this environment that we're all managing through. But you have our assurance that we'll be thoughtful and deliberate and disciplined in how we spend your money.","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, John, and on your question on divestitures, I don't think you should anticipate we'll be divesting a business every year. I think we've gotten the portfolio pretty close to where we want it. Overall, there may be some small pieces that we would still consider whether we'd be in that business or not. But right now, I wouldn't anticipate anything significant on the horizon in the short term.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Just to build upon some of the other line of questioning here because we talked a lot about some of this at least at a high level. So, Mike, so the top line accelerates to 5% to 6% including Venezuela from the guidance this year, which is 5% to 5.5%. But the EPS growth guidance on an FX-neutral basis slowed. So I guess a couple; could you bridge those two things? What gets better? What accelerates within the portfolio? We talked (47:18) spending, Baby Jogger, Contigo, other accretive M&A goes into organic. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the acceleration, bridge that for us.","And then secondarily, the deceleration in EPS growth, particularly given as Project Renewal starts to flow through here seemingly at what should be an accelerated pace? So if you could bridge those two gaps for us, that would be helpful.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No problem. So I think the thing to look at, if you do the math on our growth on a currency-neutral basis, this year will be nearly 30%. Next year, if you look at our numbers with Venezuela and adjust for the $0.22 of negative FX that we expect to see, there's somewhere north of 25% normalized EPS growth on a currency-neutral basis with Venezuela included in our numbers. And so yes, it does slow from 30% to 25%. But in the context of the strategic environment we've got where we're continuing to invest in brands and we expect to increase A&P double digit next year, I think that's one that we would accept as a smart and balanced approach.","On the growth acceleration, we talked a little bit about innovation, and the innovation is quite strong as we head into next year. And so you've got this convergence of all this work we started in 2013 working its way through our innovation funnel to market at the same time as the cost work has enabled this increased investment in A&P. So you have the convergence of these two events, more, bigger innovation coupled with more spending to be able to build awareness on these ideas and interrupt the shopping experience with the brand experience to drive commercial conversion. And so that's the event that leads us into next year, and that's why we believe we see growth acceleration.","When we did the Growth Game Plan, we first put the Growth Game Plan in front of investors in February 2012. We did so and promised, excluding capital allocation, 4% or greater core sales growth in the acceleration stage and 6% to 9% EPS growth in the acceleration stage. We are well beyond that. We've been well beyond that all the way through.","And so we feel like we've struck the right balance. I think that leaning into further EPS growth on a currency-neutral basis, it's a choice we can make if we don't have ideas to invest behind. But I'd rather play for the annuity of revenue expansion and scaling of the company over multiple years than to mortgage that for a short-term benefit beyond 25% EPS growth on a currency-neutral basis.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Understood. If I could, just one follow-up, Mike, on Venezuela. I know you're probably sick of talking about it, but just a quick update there because the environment is still very difficult if not worsening. It seems like most CPG peers have all decided to deconsolidate at this point. It's going to be 6% of your profit based on what you've disclosed, and even Pepsi recently has deconsolidated this quarter. So could you comment on how you weigh the distraction versus the contribution? And maybe just give us an update on the business. Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, just one comment on Venezuela. If you deconsolidate it, it doesn't mean you stop operations in countries. So the distraction is no different from a management perspective. But it certainly helps in our conversations with investors to take Venezuela off the table. But the reality is we're not going to walk away. We don't want to walk away from a 50%-plus share of the Writing market in Venezuela because it's a callout. What we're doing is preserving \u2013 taking a call option on the different geopolitical future there.","And so it would be extremely difficult to ever create a 50% share of market in a country like Venezuela with all the resources it has. Of course, the environment is very difficult and it's going to be volatile. So taking it off the table would certainly help in our conservations with investors. We've tried to bring great transparency to the dynamics in Venezuela so that people don't have the opportunity to second guess the core momentum in our business.","You're right. There's a lot of things that happened. John and I are both very, very connected to what's going on in Venezuela. Pretty much every day there's something new. Monday \u2013 or over the weekend, 350 companies in to see the Finance Minister and the VP to hear about new margin laws that they're considering implementing. And there are consequences back into our operations. We're deeply connected to what's happening there.","And we've been quite strategic in our approach here. And I'm not too bothered by what other people do because I don't understand their circumstances. We're making the choices we believe are right for us and trying to provide as much visibility for investors such that that they can choose whether to invest in us with full knowledge and exposure.","But the real headline here is we've got a 50%-plus share of the Writing market with great brands in Venezuela. We have a factory with 350 people that work in it on the ground in Venezuela. We are very disciplined about managing the cash in so that we don't let the exposure build too dramatically over time, and we're looking for all kinds of creative ways to be able to source raw materials locally, to be able to someday produce without having to import our raw materials in, particularly in our Woodcase Pencil business.","So, I don't think that I would do anything differently. There's no catalyst at the moment for us to deconsolidate. I'm not sure what other people's logic is for the choices they make. We took a long position on inventory connected to the October 2014 SICAD auction and that's covered us all the way through this year, and will cover us through the end of this year. It'll come to an inflection point at that point in time, and we'll have to see what kind of rate the government offers up for us to access that point because we'll need to be bringing raw materials into the country either late Q4 or early Q1.","Our intention is to be incredibly transparent about this. It's an awful lot of inside baseball kind of detail for you guys, but I don't like some of the narratives out there that I hear occasionally that talk about Newell in the context of Venezuela. I think they're factually flawed. And so, I'm prepared to give you every bit of detail you need to see what's going on, and we'll take a very strategic approach to building our brands over time in the countries as we think is appropriate, balancing the cash exposure against the strategic value.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Steve.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hey, thanks. Mike, just to be 100% clear on Venezuela following on from those comments; is your base case now that you are leaning more towards full deconsolidation of the potential next step versus a simple deval to SIMADI, maybe with some offsets, which I think \u2013 offsets, which I think was your base case previously? I'm just trying to determine if we're truly in a binary situation here or whether there is still maybe a middle ground?","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Steve, this is John. We're still evaluating the situation. We're in a little bit of unique position because we're guaranteed a certain amount of margin there. And actually, we've accessed dollars at the CENCOEX rate this year, a couple million dollars worth at CENCOEX. So you have to throw that into the equation as well for us.","Right now, I think our anticipation is to continue to evaluate it. I'm not sure whether going to SIMADI is a likely outcome or not for us. But again, as Mike said, it's a very dynamic situation for us. It literally changes every other day and we'll continue to evaluate it together with our auditors in terms of what the right decision is for us going forward.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Perfect, thank you. Switching gears, so I think on the last call you guys mentioned that the team was on the ground in China working through route-to-market assumptions on Writing. And I'm just wondering if you could talk more now with that work behind you in 2016 guidance set, what the plan is there? How broad, how fast, when do we start that kind of stuff? Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, so good question, Steve. Kristie Juster has been in China for the last week working with the team on this. And we've built an assumption into our plans that has a very modest contribution coming from China in our Writing business in 2016. So, the way to think about this is that very late 2016 entry into China and a very modest revenue contribution this year, more pipeline than consumption, and then 2017 a more material contribution. However, our algorithm for growth in China is going to be slow and deliberate. So, it'll be a multicity entry and then we'll learn as we go and broaden the number of cities as our capacity to do so increases. And when I say capacity, I mean our capacity within the P&L to be able to support the investment.","Our first priority for growth is building market share at home. And our second priority for growth is to extend the footprint of our business to the faster growing emerging markets in a disciplined and systematic way on a select portion of our portfolio. That's the logic and the algorithm is supported by the Growth Game Plan and that's what's built into our guidance, both are a short-term and a long-term guidance.","And so, China is not a big contributor to our overall performance next year in Writing but will be more material in 2017, late 2016 shipment for 2017 Back-to-School, which happens in the first part of the year and then we'll see how that goes. And we'll learn from our experience in a couple of cities and then we'll decide how to proceed from there.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great, that's very helpful. If I could squeeze in one last question; switching gears again to Baby. The rebound there continues to be great, I'm just wondering as you look at 2016, should we think about that as another year of sort of rebound and prioritized growth or you start to flip back and focus more on margin or are we somewhere in between?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, you're right. We've spent a lot of money on Baby, invested a lot to catalyze growth this year. We've put a lot of money into A&P. The A&P ratio is higher than what we believe it will be on a run rate basis. So, likely, Baby, some money comes off the table. That said, we've got amazing innovation coming to market. I just can't bring myself to not spend trial to build awareness on this stuff.","So we're really excited about what's coming. We've got some really cool stuff at Baby Jogger that starts to ship at the end of this year, into the first part of next year that they never would've been able to do on their own. So we obviously want to communicate around that.","So I think probably we'll spend lower amounts as a percent of revenue next year on Baby, but I wouldn't expect this massive margin recovery. We didn't build that into our algorithm. We'll probably spend a little bit less on Tools. We'll probably hold what is a relatively low investment level on Commercial Products and then we'll post more investment in behind Rubbermaid, clearly, with the new items that are coming and probably a little bit behind Contigo. And that will be some of the shift.","So, it's where the incremental money goes as opposed to too many pullbacks. I wouldn't expect incremental money though to go into Baby and go into Writing, Food Storage & Preservation, Beverages, and perhaps, a bit into Baby Jogger. And so it will follow our Win Bigger investments with perhaps the exclusion of Tools and Commercial Products given that we've got growth occurring in both places without huge investment.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Chris.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. I guess first, the $0.21 to $0.23 FX, drag is that with or without Venezuela? Because if Venezuela is going to be an FX drag, is it included in there?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's included in there, Chris. So, we've made assumptions about what happens with the SICAD rate, not based on anything we know. But then we did the same thing this year as we made some judgments at the beginning of the year about what happens through the year. So, it's baked in. That's why I connected in my script that comment to the full year guidance, including Venezuela.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And, I guess, Michael, just for clarification on the whole topic, right? Because I think, if you go back to last quarter, I think, Stip, you'd said for the back half of 2015 Venezuela might be $0.02 and you guys would scramble if you have to offset it. There've been various disclosures, but I think the K might have implied an annualized rate of something like $0.10.","But I think that \u2013 it seems that you guys were leaning towards trying to muscle through that and offset it. And now, today, with the guidance, Venezuela's $0.14 for 2016 and you're not going to try to offset it. So, I guess, one, did something change there like how'd you made that comment to try to offset that I just misunderstand that? Did something change like FX elsewhere maybe that makes it harder? And then the concept of mitigating actions in Venezuela on that $0.14, maybe you go back to SIMADI versus deconsolidation. But what is there that you can do?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right, so let's step back to what we've said. So, we've said $0.10 was the Venezuelan impact. What's happened is because we can't get the bolivars out in U.S. dollars, we invest those bolivars into what have become increasingly high-yield bonds that generate interest income. So what's happened here is a blend of us pushing and selling more in Venezuela and then also having higher interest income in Venezuela related to those high-yield bonds.","So, that's what's happened. And we've seen through the year that interest income accelerate pretty dramatically from Q3 into what we expect to generate in Q4. So, that's part of the underlying movement from $0.10 to $0.12.","All we've done in providing a framework, ex-Venezuela for you, is apply the same growth rates off of the midpoint $2.05 ratio. So, if you look at 8% to 12%, which is what we've guided to with Venezuela, ex-Venezuela we've applied 8% to 12% across that $2.05 midpoint number. That was because you're taking a fixed number and you're applying a ratio to it and you've got a higher fixed number that you're applying a ratio to, to get expansion in the numbers, in the GAAP. That is a data point. That is not necessarily how the whole year will play out but it was meant to dimensionalize for the Street the contribution currently and the dynamics that would play out at the same growth rate occurred across with and without.","As I said, we have a lot of flexibility. I'm reluctant to compromise the strategic investment posture that we've taken. But as John asked earlier about are you getting a yield for the next dollar, that's similar to the yield you've gotten for the last dollar, it's a fair question. And how we play that will be a matter of how the year sort of unfolds.","Another variable that could influence delivery next year within the EPS range, with and without Venezuela, is the timing by which the D\u00e9cor business gets sold. We've made assumption about when that occurs, but to the degree that takes longer, that's a positive. To the degree that takes shorter, it's a negative. And we'll have to figure all of those things out as we get closer to the year.","The thing that I think you guys can count on is that we're going to strike the right balance here. We want to be one of the leading performers in our industry from both a top line and bottom line perspective, not just the top line perspective. And as we get closer and get into this and get a clear line of sight to what currency really looks like next year, we'll be able to make the right judgments about how to strike that balance.","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Chris, to add on, you answered your own question about scrambling to cover this year. We do have, as Mike mentioned during the script, $0.05 more of FX headwind that has gotten worse since the last earnings call, and that's obviously part of what we're scrambling to cover, to still deliver within the midrange of the guidance.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Wendy.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good morning. My first question is just kind of a follow-up; if you exclude Venezuela, dear God, can you look at the core business and just comment on pricing generally? I know you don't break it out numbers-wise but qualitatively, kind of the role of pricing in 2016 top line growth as opposed to 2015 top line growth?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. So, we won't give you a percentage but here are some facts that we'll need to confront next year that while the ForEx impact will be in part influenced by Venezuela, it's certainly much broader than that particularly in the first half of the year related to the Canadian dollar, related to a bunch of Latin currencies.","So, you should expect us to have a rollover benefit from pricing next year to cover that transaction effect and probably incremental pricing to cover the transaction impact related to first half currency issues. We continue to be able to cover with those moves. This will be most pronounced in places like Brazil. It'll be an issue, and something we'll have to do, in Mexico, we'll have to do it in Canada, we'll have to do it in Colombia. So, you should expect us to continue to price next year to deal with and to obviously work hard on productivity to deal with the currency-related \u2013 the transaction portion of the currency-related challenge.","And we've done a lot of work this year to stay in front of it. I wouldn't expect us to, in a market like the U.S., compensate for transaction issues occurring in other geographies. So, responsibility of our leaders in their \u2013 on the ground in country to deal with their transaction issues. So, we're not going to price in the U.S. for the sake of covering a transaction ForEx issue in Brazil. That's just not how \u2013 that's not smart strategically to do.","That said, we have pricing opportunities in the U.S. connected to the new go-to-market program that we've rolled out in 2015 and the new Trade Promotion Management tool that we're putting in place that will give us great visibility to how our sales teams are spending the money they spend between gross price and net price. And if our salespeople are more effective at driving volume with that fund of money, it's effectively a net price realization benefit that will flow through in the U.S.","For the first time ever in our company, we will be able to track net sales by salesperson, and they will be bonused on net sales by salesperson. So, they will have skin in the game to spend that money wisely. In the past, it's been \u2013 they've been bonused based on invoice sales because we didn't have visibility. So, there is leverage through that improved operating capability to capture net price realization through the way we spend our money in the marketplace, and that's another variable that will contribute to price delivery next year.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And given the pricing you took in the Writing segment earlier this year and yet you continue to gain market share there, with the sort of commodity deflation we've seen in some areas, have you seen a spike up at all in competitive activity on the pricing front or the promotional front that would lead you to potentially have to take back some of that pricing?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. We're going to put \u2013 I don't envision us pricing down the Writing business next year. I want to continue to innovate and invest behind the Writing business in a way that creates more consumer involvement with this category which would benefit both the retailer and us in terms of penny profit and margin development for the category.","And so, that's the algorithm for us. If we need to, just like in Baby, we'll protect our flank. As you say, next year is going to be a modest year in terms of net inflation between sourced finished goods, wage-driven inflation and commodity-driven inflation. So, there'll be another quite temperate year in that respect.","So, there may be a couple of folks that choose to play the price game, I doubt it, though, in Writing. The place where we're more vulnerable to that, quite frankly, is in the less differentiated portion of the Rubbermaid Consumer Storage business, which is why we don't want to be in it because there's no material path of differentiation there that would justify premium pricing, and that's the portion of our portfolio that tends to get whipsawed in environments where commodities are going in the other direction, which is why we don't like it, which is why we're steadily and progressively getting out of that, and focusing on the portions of our portfolio that are more value-added.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it, okay, and then just one last one. On the recent management changes, I feel like Mark's [Tarchetti] change was probably fairly well telegraphed in advance. But on the Bill Burke side, I mean, I know he's been obviously very important in the organization. He played a big role in recruiting other people to come over the years. How much transition do you expect? Do you expect other people to be following him out the door? How much risk is there associated with his departure?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me just say about both people, they've been unbelievable business partners for me; playing different roles but playing absolutely critical roles in affecting the change that we've driven here over the last few years. And they've been great partners to each other, which has been really important as we've established our new operating model of development and delivery. They were the two leaders of those two portions of our organization, and they partnered in a way that was terrific to amplify this model of these two activity systems being independent but interdependent. One group focused on the strategic. The other focused on commercialization of the ideas. And so I want to thank them for everything that they've done to breathe life into that model.","Bill is an extraordinary leader. He's helped the organization understand the context for change, and he's helped great Newell legacy employees understand how they can succeed in this new model. Bill's got immense capacity. Bill can be the CEO of a company. Bill and I \u2013 Bill had the same issue I had at Unilever, which is an age compression issue. Bill and I are the same age. Paul [Polman] and I were a few years apart but not enough to make enough of a difference. And so Bill wants to lead big, and he's got a tremendous opportunity to do that, and this is probably the right time. We're both 54 or 55 years old. If he's going to swing for something big like that, this is the time to do it.","So I totally understand why he'd want to go give it a shot. Bill will be with us right through the first quarter and into the second quarter of next year. The baton pass on the business will happen on 1\/1 to Joe Arcuri. We're really happy he has joined us and he's really well prepared to take the baton pass from Bill.","I'm just very pleased that we actually have two internal successors. We didn't have to go to the outside to effect this change. And Bill and Mark are in charge of delivering the results in 2015, and then they'll pass the batons to Joe and Richard [Davies]. And I think that will happen quite seamlessly. Richard and Joe are already engaging in the same way that Mark and Bill did. So I think that we'll continue to be able to breathe life into the model and accelerate its impact. And I think everybody will be proud to have been part of building out this story.","And Bill is going to help me in the first half of next year with a bunch of different things that we're working on in the supply chain. As you know, we're out looking for a supply chain leader externally, but we continue to want to drive the transformation of the supply chain. We're not waiting for that supply chain leader to come in to do that. Joe will be involved with a number of big projects that we've got going on there. And he'll also help activate with me the broader transformation agenda that we've got going on in the overheads area. And so Joe and Richard will be driving the business. Bill and I will be working the strategic transformation, work with Stip. And then when Bill signs off, we'll celebrate his impact and we'll wish him the best in landing the big job he deserves to garner.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Terrific, that's very helpful color. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Olivia.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. How are you?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good. First on Baby margins, should this essentially go back to becoming a double-digit margin business, not necessarily in fiscal 2016 obviously? But is that your expectation over time, or is there still a need for incremental investment or things to do on the lower end of value price point?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Olivia, it's important to remember what's unique about our Baby business. First of all, we've demonstrated the ability to grow this business quite fast. In 2012 \u2013 2013, compound growth globally of just about 10%. And as you see us investing now into this business, we've got the growth going towards 8%, 5% year to date.","The thing to remember is, of course it's a lower margin business, so it's dilutive to us at gross margin and also at operating margin given the investment profile we've got on it right now. But the thing to remember is we don't own many fixed assets and we don't have title for the inventory beyond its port of departure and a good chunk of this business from China. And so as a result, it has a very high return on net assets ratio despite having low gross margin and operating margin.","So as you think about it from a value creation perspective, if we grow this business, we create a lot of value.","Now all that said, I don't expect this business to be a single digit operating income margin business. This business will get back to a double-digit operating margin business as the revenue continues to scale and as we moderate the investment we've made in this business to catalyze growth.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, that's very helpful. And then just on M&A, as you look at your existing portfolio, are there areas you think you can continue to bolster with incremental M&A, particularly in the Win Bigger businesses? And how important is M&A relative to growing the core organically as you think about the out years?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As we mentioned at a recent conference, we end up with tremendous amount of flexibility and capacity building over time. Our market cap today is what, about $11.5 billion maybe, somewhere between $11.5 billion and $12 billion. And the kind of total capacity cumulative we end up having with today's capital structure is somewhere around $5.5 billion by 2020. That's the model we exposed at a recent conference. So, we end up with tremendous amount of flexibility beyond the fundamental improvements in our performance.","And we're going to put that to work in a way that creates value for shareholders and also scales and strategically enhances our company. Up until now, we've been focused on organic growth until late 2014, and then we began to complement that organic agenda with bolt-ons in the core. Elmer's is a bit of an extension of the shoulders of one of those cores into crafts, which I think is exciting and we're going to learn whether the model extends. I think it does, and I think it will be really interesting to see how we do over the next couple of years in accelerating that business's growth with new capabilities deployed and more money deployed against the brands. So that's going to be an exciting thing to watch.","The other opportunity for the company long-term is to scale the company. And the question becomes if this model is working, which it clearly appears to be working, can you apply the model across a sixth or a seventh or a tenth segment? And my theory would be yes, it could be applied. And so there will be options at some point in the future where we'll have to decide whether we want to do something more transformational than the bolt-and-build approach. I think that's going to be an option that's in front of us, and that will be something very exciting if it ever were to transpire.","Our goal is to build the preeminent consumer durables company in the world. That's our strategic long-term goal. That's the ambition we have for our company. In order to do that, we've got to continue to do what we're doing but also scale the company. And we'll have to see how that all plays out. That may be a dream more than a reality. But I think it's important for you to understand that that's the scope of our ambition.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, Mike. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You know what, I think all my questions are exhausted at this point, so I will pass on to the next caller.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jason.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser with B. Riley.","Linda B. Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for fitting me in. So, Mike, can you just comment on \u2013 was the Tools growth of 3% in the quarter, you said it was improved in the second half. Was the 3% in line with your planning? And you said that some macro issues are still impacting, but you said Brazil improved and EMEA was actually good Tools growth. So what's so weak?","And then on top of that, is the overall macro regarding Tools, is it stronger or weaker than, say, compared when you first took over as CEO, just when you take all of those different parts of the world together? Are you feeling macro good, good or just medium, or it's very weak? Just give us some more color on that. And then for next year, is that a low single digit or a mid-single digit grower in Tools? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, great question. Clearly in the second quarter, I think Brazil has been an issue for virtually everybody. We have a big tools business in Brazil. We had a tough second quarter in Brazil. We had a strong third quarter in Brazil. So some of the issues there have been a little bit more spiky. The more strategic question mark is in the industrial sector of our Tools business, and that has been softer than what we expected.","So the brand that plays there is our Lenox band saw business, not the Lenox tools or accessories business but the Band Saw business, and that represents about 10% to 15% of the total Tools business. We grew 3.1% in the quarter. We expected stronger growth on Tools. And the thing that fell a little bit short was the Lenox band saw business connected to Industrial sector softness.","It's going to be something we need to watch. That business was on fire last year and it's had more tempered growth this year. And that hasn't gotten better through the back half as we had expected. We had good Irwin growth in virtually every geography in the third quarter, but Lenox fell short of our expectations. And that was covered by Baby momentum, more than covered by Baby momentum and Writing momentum.","So the thing to watch going into 2016 is what happens with the Industrial segment \u2013 sector and I think your assumption about how to build the model for 2016 is mid-single digit is probably a good number to have, 4% to 6%.","Linda B. Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust Bank.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning and thanks.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","A simple one; outlook for resin and kind of how that plays into your gross margin outlook for this year and next year?","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Hey, Bill, we see resin most likely, as Mike said, probably a favorable commodities environment next year, maybe coming down just a little bit, not as much as you may think, and we've had this conversation before about resin not moving as much as, and being as volatile as actually the feedstocks are. But probably it'd be down just a little bit in 2016 would be our anticipation right now.","Now, that being said, again, the caution for us is there's a pretty high demand still on in the number of resins that we use. So, resin guys have done a fairly good job keeping pricing up despite the drop in their feedstock price.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, it's not a meaningful kind of impact on the gross margin expansion?","John K. Stipancich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I wouldn't say it's meaningful next year.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then second, Mike, just going back to Elmer's.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Other than citing my favorite Lloyd Bridges quote from the movie, Airplane, are there other uses for glue? I'm trying to understand the revenue synergy potential. And when I say that, is it a different take? Contigo and Baby Jogger was kind of we're buying growth businesses so we can grow even faster. This is a kind of a slow growth where you're \u2013 I mean, I know that the historical Newell models that utilize it and turn it around, but are you going to look at it a little bit of everything going forward for bolt-ons or is this kind of a one-off?","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is an interesting business because of its adjacency and the buyer synergy between Writing in this business. So, if you were to walk at Walmart, the aisle right next to Writing would be where you'd find Mr. Sketch, you'd find Crayola, you'd find crafts, and that's where the Glue business tends to live.","You could have made the same argument, Bill, on Writing. When we started, it was a low, slow growth business. And here we are, four years later, growing through innovation and through brand support. I think there's all kinds of different applications for Glue that would drive \u2013 and crafts that would drive more consumer involvement in the category.","And we'll see how that plays out over time. Our teams need to connect with the Elmer's team to think about what's in their funnel of ideas, and then we got to investment in insights to kind of chart that path forward. You should count on growth acceleration on the core Elmer's business. And there's all kinds of really interesting ideas on Krazy that you could embrace, doings that we would need to discuss with our new JV partner, a Japanese company. And so, I think this is going to be about money and it's going to be about concept developments around the application of the Elmer's brand in the core Glue business and maybe the expansion beyond.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, do you think it can be growing by the time you lap it for organic growth a year from now where it doesn't dilute kind of your organic growth?","Michael B.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for sneaking us in. We'd like to go one level deeper on the A&P spend, if we could. So, two parts to the question; the first is, just if you look at that spend, can you break it down between brand spend and maybe product-attributed spend or new products that you're introducing and whether that spend need to be attached to a new product innovation?","And then secondly, do you have any cases where you have been in a stretch investment position and maybe you pulled back where you've seen sales persist at above average rate? Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Stephanie, you're looking for the split of our A&P by new products versus core. Is that what you're looking for?","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Yes, if you're willing to break it out that way.","Michael B. Polk - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right, what we've learned over the last couple of years is that our investment generates the most growth yield when it's connected to innovation. So the vast majority of our investment is behind product news. And there are a couple of exceptions to that. We've done some work on Sharpie, on the core brand of Sharpie, that have worked to expand consumption, but most of the investment is focused on new news. And that's what you should expect going forward. That's certainly true on the advertising line.","On consumer promotion, it's a more balanced approach; on trade promotion, more balanced approach because that's the part of A&P that's focused on activating our brands in key drive periods. So it's a balance of core and new items. So all the display materials we use to get off shelf during key merchandising windows are clearly both on the core and on the new news. So advertising's skewed very dramatically towards new news and promotions skewed \u2013 and promotion, more balanced across the whole portfolio. That's the logic you should have in place.","I've seen plenty of ideas and businesses grow without major A&P investment. You establish a new idea and you get great distribution on it and you continue to activate it with great display activity and punctuate A&P investment or advertising investment, you can deliver a sustained growth. There are many, many examples that I can point to in my career where you seed an idea with significant investment upfront and then you pull back over time and did great, and continue to innovate in it, you get great year two, year three momentum.","We're seeing that on InkJoy right now. If you look back at our spending a year ago, two years ago, the vast majority of our Writing investment went \u2013 a good chunk of it went against Paper Mate InkJoy. Today, our spending is focused on InkJoy new items and not on the core proposition. So, we established InkJoy, it continues to grow and now we're punctuating spend on new items. And so, that is one of the kind of, the keys to sustained growth, to be able to play the game the way you just described, and there are many, many examples that I could point to across all the categories I've worked in with that has held up.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you.","Michael B.

Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining our call.","My goal today is to walk you through the underlying performance of the business and then explain why we're feeling good about our prospects moving forward. There's a fair amount of noise in the Q1 numbers, so I'll take the time to parse that out so you have a clear line of sight into our results and a good understanding of the opportunities and challenges ahead.","There's no doubt that the start of the year was not what we expected. You've already seen the announcement we made earlier this quarter about the harness buckle recall on Baby. And in the U.S., we were not alone in seeing an impact on retail sales from severe weather, which particularly affected our U.S.-centric home solutions business.","The Q1 top line impact, either one of these events might have been handled in stride. But both in the same quarter created the challenge called out in our early March press release. I see our team stepping up into this challenge nicely as we strengthen plans for the balance of the year. We become a stronger and more agile company, able to overcome these types of challenges, and I'm confident that we will.","Importantly, we have a strong pipeline of new ideas coming to market starting in Q2 and significant investment fire power that will flow from our cost work. We will reunite growth by pulling A&P bending forward from Q4 into Q2 and Q3. If at all possible, we'll look to replenish Q4 spend by doubling down un-generating savings. Our ability to do this will, of course, depend on the growth yield we get from the step up in Q2 and Q3 investment versus prior year and the margin expansion we generate between now and then. These revised plans are already in motion. While this will result in a different flow of growth and earnings than originally envisioned when we provided our outlook for the yearend in January, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance for core sales growth, normalized operating margin improvement, normalized EPS and operating cash flow.","As announced this morning, the boards approved a 13% increase in the dividend to an annualized rate of $0.68 per share. This is the fourth dividend increase in the last three years, demonstrating the board's continued confidence in Newell's strong cash generation ability and in the promise of the growth game plan.","With that as a background, let me dive into our first quarter results. Core sales grew 0.7%. While we're certainly not content with this result, I want to unpack the numbers so you understand the dynamics that underpin it. There were two key events during the quarter which disrupted our plans and are not indicative of our underlying performance. First, the baby harness buckle recall interrupted our two-year streak of nearly 10% global core growth.","Baby core growth accelerated through 2013 to 15% in Q4 and strong momentum carried forward into January of this year. This growth was disrupted by the recall and the previously communicated European exits with baby core sales down over 4% in the first quarter despite the very strong January.","In Q1, that nearly 20 percentage point core growth swing versus the run rate on the business cost the company as much as 200 basis points of global core growth in the quarter. The second event was the well-chronicled weather impact in the U.S., which most directly impacted our U.S.-centric Home Solutions business. While there are other things happening in this business that contributed to the overall performance, there's no doubt that lost point of sales due to weather-related store closures in the U.S. during the late January through February period impacted the flow of shipments into key mass food and specialty retailers.","The absence of these external events would have put Q1 core sales at the low end of the full year guidance range of 3% to 4% right in line with the suggestion we made for Q1 when we provided full year guidance. Importantly, an assessment of underlying performance should also consider the previously announced decision to exit roughly $25 million business in Europe in 2014 and the prior year pull forward of volume into Q1 related to the SAP conversion in Brazil.","Combined but netting out all double counting potential variables, these factors represented another 60 basis points of underlying core growth in Q1. So core growth of 0.7% in Q1, but with reason to believe that Q1 core growth would have been well into our full year guidance range of 3% to 4% absent these discrete events.","Normalized operating income margin in Q1 was 11%, down 20 basis points last year with good gross margin expansion of 60 basis points offset by increased advertising and selling capability investment. Q1 progress on gross margin is important, as we're beginning to see pricing land in stick and very good writing growth resulting in strengthened mix.","The cost associated with the Baby recall is $11 million. This reflects cost incurred on the harness buckle recall on toddler car seats that we referred to in our first quarter press release and now, our best estimate of cost associated with the potential additional recall of harness buckles used on some infant car seats.","Given the significance of the combined cost and their non-repeating nature, we have normalized this $11 million or over $0.02 out of our Q1 results. Importantly, Q1 normalized results do reflect the top line and operating income impact of lost toddler car seat sales during the roughly five weeks we were not shipping the effective product as well as the impact of product returns.","Normalized earnings per share was $0.35 and reported earnings per share was $0.19, both were equal to prior year period. Given the decision to now normalize out the non-repeating combined cost of the recall, our normalized earnings per share of $0.35 does not represent a $0.03 beat to consensus given our prior communication.","Our Q1 growth was led by our writing and tools segment partially offset by core sales declines in Home Solutions and Baby. Writing core sales grew 8% despite the exit of certain product lines in Europe driven by strong value and volume market share growth across the Americas. While writing had an easy year ago comparator in Q1, we're pleased with these results particularly in light of a continued contraction in retail real estate and the office superstore channel in the U.S. and Europe.","We continued to advertise Papermate InkJoy through Q1 and are now on air with a new very exciting Sharpie campaign. We have strong innovation, advertising and record merchandising plans set at back to school and we'll support our brand levels well beyond historic highs in Q2 and Q3.","Home Solutions core sales declined 4.5%. We saw some softness at point of sale and consciously reduced merchandising uncertain Rubbermaid consumer low margin product lines. These effects were partially offset by increased distribution on Calphalon and very good value and volume market share growth on Rubbermaid food storage and beverage.","We've taken some tough calls on portions of the Home Solutions portfolio on pricing and customer merchandising with the goal of strengthening the mix within the segment and driving profitable growth on portions of the portfolio where we can establish a susbtainable brand and product point of difference. We have a strengthening innovation pipeline on Calphalon, Levolor, Goodie and portions of the Rubbermaid portfolio. And we'll advertise Calphalon for the first time in many years this coming holiday season.","Tools segment core sales increased 2.4% driven by strong growth on Irwin in Latin America and building momentum on Lenox in North America and Irwin in Europe. Adjusting for the prior year pull forward of sales due to the SAP Brazil conversion, tools global core sales increased 5.2% in quarter one.","We have strong innovation in merchandising programs planned for the balance of the year in both North America and Latin America and are beginning to make progress on gross margin through strengthened mix and pricing. Commercial products core sales increased 0.2% as good growth on Rubbermaid commercial products was largely offset by a significant step back in our U.S. healthcare business.","The healthcare business was up against an extremely tough year ago period in Q1 related to prior year new distribution and pipeline film [ph]. Having the last -- the difficult Q1 comparator in healthcare and with the benefit of a significant investment in selling expense on the balance of the portfolio, the overall commercial product segment should now return to steady solid core growth.","Baby and parenting core sales declined 4.4% as a result of the exit of certain product lines in Europe and the U.S. harness buckle recall. The loss of momentum caused by the U.S. recall was significant as previously discussed. We have a very strong pipeline of innovation flowing to market through the balance of the year and are quite confident that we will recapture momentum in the business.","Point of sale is recovering on toddler car seats and we expect that to sequentially increase in Q2 and get back to solid mid-single digit growth in the back half of the year. While we may not be able to recover the lost sales from Q1 associated with the roughly five-week period where we were not shipping product and were off shelf, we're comfortable that we can and will recover momentum through Q2 and into the second half of the year.","So core sales growth of 0.7% in Q1, but underlying core growth that was well into our full year guidance range and future quarter core sales growth that will be considerably improved with the unexpected events of weather and recall largely behind us and strong programing and innovation in front of us.","With that, let me pass the call over to Doug for a more detailed review of our Q1 financials and then I'll return to provide a deeper perspective on the full year before opening the call for questions. Doug?","Douglas Martin","Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone.","As Mike noted, there were some real bright spots as well as some challenges in the quarter. I'll start with the discussion of our Q1 results and then update you on operating cash, Venezuela, share repurchase programs and the balance sheet.","Q1 reported net sales were $1.23 billion, a decline of 0.7%. Core sales, which exclude the impact of unfavourable FX, increased 0.7% versus the prior year. Strong pricing in the quarter was partly offset by product line exits, the impact of the harsh weather on our U.S.-centric businesses and Baby harness buckle recall challenges. Reported gross margin was 38.1% and normalized gross margin was 38.8%, up 60 basis points over last year. Inflation and unfavourable currency were more than offset in the quarter by pricing and productivity.","Normalized SG&A expense was $342 million or 27.8% of sales, up 80 basis points versus the prior year as we continued to invest behind brands and capabilities despite the short-term sales challenges during the quarter. The composition of our SG&A spend continues to change as well as we increased advertising and promotion expense by about 10% in the quarter primarily to fund our InkJoy TV ad campaign in the U.S., Mexico and Asia. Normalized operation margin was 11%, down 20 basis points reflecting positive gross margin expansion, offset by continued investment behind our brands and capabilities.","Reported operating margin was 8.5% compared with 7.9% in the prior year. Interest expense was $14.4 million, essentially flat year-over-year and our normalized tax rate was 18.4% compared with 16.5% a year ago because the company recognized a lower amount of discrete text benefits in the current quarter.","Normalized earnings per share which excludes restructuring and restructuring related costs, cost associated with a harness buckle recall and the impact of the Venezuela monetary asset devaluation were $0.35, flat compared to year ago results with the benefit from a lower share count resulting from the accelerated share buyback plan offsetting a less favourable tax rate.","First quarter reported earnings per share were $0.19, equal to last year. We used operating cash of $92.1 million during the quarter, a $31 million improvement of the use of $123 million in the prior year. The change was driven primarily by the absence of an incremental pension plan contribution in the current year offset by larger year-over-year annual customer program and restructuring payments.","We returned $87.3 million to shareholders during the quarter including $42.9 million in dividends and $44.4 million for the repurchase of shares. The low number of shares outstanding contributed about one penny to EPS as we are now back to active status under our recently authorized $300 million open market plan, and we have $256 million left available under that authorization as of the end of the quarter.","I'll now move on to segment results. Starting with writing, reported net sales grew 6.1% to $361.3 million. Core sales increased 8%. Our Latin America writing business continued to deliver strong growth over 20% this quarter fuelled by pricing and the benefit of our InkJoy ad campaign in Mexico, Columbia and the Caribbean. North America had strong double digit core growth against a relatively easy comp last year and behind InkJoy advertising. EMEA sales were down high single digits largely as a result of planned exits.","The Q1 normalized operating margin in our writing segment was 21.3%, a 270 basis-point improvement over year ago results driven by pricing, productivity and project renewal related cost savings in Europe partially offset by the increased advertising spend behind InkJoy.","The Home Solution segment first quarter net sales declined 5.2% to $321.2 million. Core sales declined 4.5% due in large part to weather-related POS softness and the deemphasizing of some low margin businesses within Rubbermaid consumer. Calphalon had another strong quarter driven by recent distribution gains. Home Solutions normalized operating margin was 8.2%, a 190 basis point decline versus the prior year reflecting the deleveraging impact of lower sales volume and inflation.","The tool segment delivered net sales of $184.8 million for a decline of 4%. Core sales growth was 2.4%. You will recall that we implemented SAP in Brazil in Q2 2013 and we called out a pull forward impact in this segment of approximately $5 million last year due to this timing shift. Adjusting for this SAP timing-related shift, our underlying Q1 core sales were 5.2%.","This trend is largely attributable to our success in Brazil with our expanded tools offering in the back half of last year, which has driven both share and distribution gains. We're also seeing strength in the Lenox business in North America. Operating margin in the tools segment was 11.4% versus last year's 9.9%.","This improvement was driven by gross margin expansion behind pricing and improved mix. Reported net sales in the commercial product segment declined 0.3% to $182.6 million and core sales increase 0.2%. Favorable pricing in North America and Latin America was offset by weather-related softness in the U.S. and a difficult comparison against strong healthcare results in the prior year.","Commercial products operating margin was 7.6%, down compared with last year's 11.8% due to input cost inflation, mix and capability investments primarily in Latin America. Our Baby segment reported $179.3 million in net sales, a decline of 5.4%. Core sales were down 4.4% due to low sales volume and returns related to the harness buckle recall, lower sales in Asia and planned product line exits in Europe.","We anticipate a return to healthier sales volume trends in the balance of the year, and we expect Baby full year core sales growth of mid-single digits. Q1 normalized operating margin which excludes direct cost associated with the recall but does not adjust for returns or lost sales was 9.1%, down 350 basis points to last year largely due to FX and input cost inflation partially offset by pricing.","Looking at Q1 sales, core sales by geography, North America grew 0.9% with strong results from writing and tools and declines of Baby, commercial and Home Solutions. In EMEA, core sales declined 5.1% driven largely by planned product line exists of $6.3 million primarily in writing and Baby.","If adjusted for the impact of these exits, EMEA\u2019s underlying growth rate was a negative 1.3%, which is a little better than our 2013 trend in our EMEA businesses. Despite the top line pressure from exits, the normalized operating margin in EMEA increased nicely year-over-year as a result of the project renewal European simplification actions that were taken to improve profitability. All thanks to the great efforts of the EMEA team.","In Latin America, core sales grew 10% despite the headwinds of $6 million of SAP timing-related pull in 2013. Adjusted for that pull forward, Latin America would have generated core sales growth of approximately 17%. And lastly, Asia core sales showed a slight decline of 0.3%. We saw modest growth from fine writing as we reached stabilization of the business this quarter and peak of sales declines coming off two years of very strong growth.","Now I'd like to take a minute to talk about Venezuela and FX in general. As we've said in the past, Venezuela represents about 1% of total Newell sales and 3% to 4% of operating profit, mainly in the writing business. Based on recent changes to the Venezuela currency exchange rate mechanisms, we have moved the rate we used to translate our Venezuela financial results into U.S. dollars effective March 31st to SICAD I. This resulted in a monetary asset devaluation of $38.7 million at the close of the quarter which is reflected in the other expense line in the as reported income statement and as exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement. The impact of the one-time monetary asset devaluation has been excluded from normalized earnings.","Subsequent to the first quarter, we will be using the exchange rate determined by periodic auctions for U.S. dollars conducted under Venezuela SICAD I, which was 10.7 Bolivar to the U.S. dollar at the end of the first quarter compared to the official exchange rate of 6.3. We expect the impact of changes in global currencies including the Bolivar to have an unfavourable impact on operating income. Based on current spot rates, we estimate the negative impact of translational FX to be between $0.04 and $0.05 per share for the remainder of 2014. The total negative impact of both transactional and translational FX is expected to be between $0.10 and $0.12 this year over last year, given overall currency volatility versus the U.S. dollar. This is incremental to a negative $0.06 impact in the prior year.","Additionally, the Venezuela government has issued a new law on fair pricing establishing the maximum profit a business can earn when in Venezuela. However, there's not yet clarity from the government on how profitability will be measured. We are continuing to evaluate the impact a new law may have on our 2014 operating results and have not yet included any further actions in our guidance.","I'll now switch topics and give you an update on our share repurchase programs and the balance sheet. We completed the $350 million accelerated share repurchase plan in the quarter taking delivery of the final 2 million shares in mid-March and purchased approximately 1.5 million shares in the quarter under the open market repurchase plan.","From a share count perspective, we're modelling an annualized average share count of approximately 282 million shares. And finally, our balance sheet remains very healthy after having returned to $87 million to shareholders in the quarter and approximately equal amount of dividends and share repurchases. We have $137 million of cash on hand, over $800 million in liquidity and no long-term debt maturities until mid-2015. Our debt to equity, EBITDA multiple and interest coverage ratios continue to be strong.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike.","Michael Polk","Thanks, Doug. The progress we've made driving the growth game plan into action has made us a stronger and more agile company. We have robust plans for the balance of the year and we will increase brand investment significantly to reignite growth. We're well on our way to delivering the project renewal savings and we're strengthening our drive for further savings by scaling our sourcing activities, optimizing distribution and transportation and by value engineering our packs and products.","Our pipeline of new ideas and new products are the strongest we've had in recent years, particularly on writing, tools and baby where we will launch over 10 new products or platforms starting in Q2 through the end of the year. We are or have already created new stronger advertising on Sharpie, Graco, Irwin and Calphalon that will complement our very effective Paper Mate InkJoy advertising.","In all of these campaigns, we'll air over the balance of the year with record levels of media support. In this context, we\u2019ve reaffirmed the full year guidance for 2014, core sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%, normalized operating income margin expansion of up to 40 basis points, normalized EPS of $1.94 to $2 or 6% to 9% growth and operating cash flow of $600 million to $650 million.","There are two key factors that could influence delivery in the year. The first is our ability to reignite growth. We're well positioned with a strong pipeline of new products, new advertising and new selling capabilities that will be supported with a significant increase in spending.","Our ability to support our brands at the rate we plan will also -- while also delivering the margin expansion and EPS growth we're committed to deliver will be a function of tight overhead management and gross margin development through the year. Project renewal savings and very tight discretionary spending will enable the delivery of the overhead objectives.","We're working gross margin from multiple angles of cost, price and mix with the ambition to create a deep pipeline of ideas that sustain gross margin increases through 2014 and beyond. Our 60 basis point increase in gross margin in Q1 is encouraging and slightly ahead of our original expectations, so we're off to a good start. Our work to establish Newell as a lean and efficient operations will be the critical enabler to increase brand support and growth acceleration, not just this year but over the balance of the growth game plan.","Given the challenge of Q1, reigniting growth will be the big focus for both our development and delivery organizations. Delivering core growth at the high end of the full year guidance range would require 4.9%growth for the balance of the year. Delivering growth at the low end of the core guidance range would require 3.6% growth for the balance of the year.","In the second half of 2013, we grew core sales nearly 4%. This gives us a line of sight and confidence that would significantly increase investment and stronger brand plans we can deliver in the full year core sales guidance range despite the tough start to the year.","Importantly, our core sales guidance assumes that a potential additional harness buckle recall related to certain infant car seats does not result in a significant retail disruption like the one experienced in quarter one, on toddler car seats. This assumption is consistent with our best estimate of the most likely of all outcomes. There is the possibility that we could reach a different resolution with NHTSA than that reflected in our core sales guidance.","The second factor that could influence our full year results is foreign exchange. This factor is pretty straightforward. Our reaffirmation guidance assumes we cover $0.04 to $0.05 of further negative currency, largely related to our decision to take the Venezuela bolivar to the SICAD I rate. We believe this to be the right assumption given what we know today.","While we don't provide quarterly guidance, there are two factors that could influence the flow of core sales and EPS over the balance of the year. The first factor is the quarterly profile of our brand investment. As mentioned, we will focus the significant step up in brand support versus prior year in Q2 and Q3 to reignite growth. This flow of spending will influence the delivery of EPS for the balance of the year.","The second factor is the shifting of shipments at quarter-end between Q2, Q3 and Q4 related to two unique events. With the timing of July 4th on a Friday this year, we could experience a shift of quarter two back to school writing shipments from the last week of June into early quarter three as retailers will be more reluctant to take inventory into their system before their floor stock of July 4th merchandising is cleared.","Additionally, on October 1st 2014, we will go live on SAP across the balance of Latin America. This will result in a pull forward of volume out of Q4 into Q3 to ensure smooth SAP transition. These two factors will drive a different profile results to last year with solid core sales growth in Q2 and a further step up in growth rate in Q3.","In Q4, core sales growth will be more modest with the full value of second half launches partially offset by the loss of volume due to the SAP pull forward into Q3 and the step down in brand spending related to our focused surge of investment in Q2 and Q3.","We believe the core growth and new spending flows could result in normalized EPS growth rates in the middle of our full year guidance range of 6% to 9% in Q2 and Q3 with a step up in Q4 to slightly above the high end of the range. So a different start in the year than we anticipated as a result of two unplanned events, the recall and to a lesser degree weather.","In the context of these challenges, we delivered a solid set of underlying results with very good growth on tools and writing, strong delivery of savings and encouraging progress on gross margin. Nearly one year after the restructuring of our marketing and R&D teams, our development organization is starting to hit its stride with stronger innovation and advertising flowing through the funnel to market.","Their work along with the strengthened capability in selling puts us in a good position to handle this year's challenges. Our business has come a long way in the last three years and I'm very proud of the work we've done and I'm especially proud of our people for their commitment in drive to strengthen our company. The challenge of Q1 raises the bar on leadership, driving us to act fast, to focus sharply on the things that matter and to manage our resources even more dynamically.","All great tests of the new operating model and a terrific opportunity to demonstrate what the new Newell is capable of delivering. We know that a sustainable acceleration in performance will come from Newell bringing the best we have to offer to our consumers, our customers and our people.","I see a new type of collaboration occurring across the enterprise as our new organization matures with increasing energy to execute winning ideas really, really well.","We're beginning to see in writing what's possible when we set the right ambition and build aggressive plans, just as we've done in Baby over the last two years. Next week, we'll bring all of our sales and marketing teams together to work on a much stronger set of 2015 plans in our second annual global planning summit.","Five hundred people from around the world and across our organization collaborating for 2015 growth. That's the growth game plan in action. That's our new operating model coming to speed. And with that, I'd like to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions.","We'll go to our first question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Michael Polk","Hi, Wendy.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Research","Hi. Good morning. My first question has to do with the recall that you've gone through for Graco. And how confident you are that there aren't lingering issues associated with the brand equity or stuff like that? Or do you think that even once you get passed on whatever you need to do to fix the harnesses, do you have to enter into a prolonged period of higher promotional spending to support the brand, or anything like that?","Michael Polk","That's great question. Wendy, since the moment of the recall, we've been measuring consumer feedback on the brand. These brands are our greatest asset. This is a great concern. We've done and we continue to do research to understand how the -- particularly the immediate coverage impacted people's brand perceptions, and also how the disappointment in the quality issue we have on the buckle has influenced their perception of the brand.","And this is an incredibly strong brand and a very resilient brand. I'm very pleased that we haven't seen a step back. And I think part of that has to do with the way our marketing teams and our selling organization has engaged on the issue. It was incredibly disruptive, but our consumer services and customer services teams, along with our marketing and selling organizations have done a great job over communicating with consumers. This was a different kind of recall than any we've experienced before because of the nature of it in terms of breadth and also the timing between decision and implementation.","And that caused us to have some challenges with the respect to getting replacement parts to consumers. And the group did just an extraordinary job of managing that dynamic and I'm pleased that we can say that there hasn't been any noticeable change in equity or attribute ratings on the brand.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Research","And can you tell us what percentage of the Graco brand is car seats?","Michael Polk","We haven't really communicated that Wendy before, but it's well into sort of 20%, 30% range. I'll just give you a sort of a bracket there.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Research","Got it. That's helpful. And then my second question is just going back to what you just said at the very end about the planning meeting that you're about to have, which sounds great, I assume most of that is kind of innovation related and brand-building related, but are -- the conversations about either further product line exits also takes place there. I'm wondering specifically the $25 million of revenue that you're exiting in Europe. Is there a chance that number goes up? Are those the kinds of things that you entertain as well or are we kind of -- it's a portfolio set and SKU assortment kind of set at this point?","Michael Polk","Well, everything is on the table at those meetings. This is where our integrated marketing plans or global plans, our development team are building brand plans out for 2015 for the brands they work on and for the relevant countries for those brands. And the way this process works is that integrated marketing plan is translated into a national merchandising plan and then translated into joint customer business plans. That three-step process in building an annual plan for the company is what is initiated at these discussions.","So everything is on the table. It's a media spending. We've got a framework for what we intend to do in 2015, each brand does. That's been vetted through the marketing organization now. And now it's time to kind of socialize that agenda and also to talk about the more executional side of the business, core brand distribution, what the optimal distribution footprint looks like by brand, by channel, by customer.","And so, those are the types of conversations that are happening. We're talking about price increases for next year. At that time, we're talking about merchandising price points, merchandising frequency, all the display material that we'll use next year is being communicated, the frequency of off-shelf displays, back to school planning for '15 will be initiated at this call. So it's everything that you can imagine you would want to talk about along that dimensions I've just described from global brand plan to national merchandising plans, to individual joint customer business plan. So it's a very, very important meeting. It's a week long and these are full on working sessions for four and a half days.","We'll talk about, as I said, we'll talk about everything there. Your specific question about product line exits in Europe, we initiated those exits to be able to initiate the complexity reduction in our infrastructure. John Stipancich and his team led that work and it's yielding great margin improvement in Europe, and now we're on the verge of getting our European business back to growth ex those exits.","There are constantly conversations happening around mix within brands and product lines. Certain portions of our business have very high variable contribution margins and other portions of our business in some cases, have very low variable contribution margins. We need to think through all of those dynamics and how we set targets and how we pull [ph] portions of the portfolio for growth.","Those are constant on-going conversations. For example, we never talked about this in 2013, but we exited Goodie Electrics a year ago. If it's a substantial exit, we'll talk about it. A $25 million is a big number. If it's a less substantial exit, we'll manage it within our numbers but we're going to do the right things in terms of strengthening the portfolio while delivering against our ambition to accelerate growth as a company.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Research","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Michael Polk","Good morning, Chris.","Douglas Martin","Hi Chris.","Chris Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hey guys I guess, when you have adversity, obviously you have decisions to make, where you have to the balance delivering in the near-term with the long-term health of the business. So I guess, what I was hoping for was some color and context around the decisions you are making this year, right? So you are accelerating advertising and marketing, pulling it into Q2, Q3 to jumpstart top line growth. You are also absorbing another sort of nugget on Venezuela. I guess, talk through if you can, the decision process around not lowering guidance on Venezuela, accelerating the marketing, like what is the trade-off of accelerating that marketing if any, and how you're thinking about that stuff?","Michael Polk","Yeah. Well, I think it's really important. The first filter with all this -- in situations like this from my perspective, the first filter that we have a responsibility to apply is whether any choice we're making is consistent with the strategic agenda we've laid out for the business. And that's the first pulled filter that's been applied in this re-plan. So if this re-plan was going to result in us having to cut the step up in A&P support that we have built into 2014 as part of the strategic phase of the growth game plan, we would have just taken our lumps and gone to the market and dealt with that conversation with you guys on EPS because we're not going to mortgage the strategic agenda in the business. That's what we're accountable for delivery. And we believe it's the best path to value creation for our investors. And we have confidence and we\u2019ve built confidence through last year that when we invest behind these brands, we can get a real growth yield and if we\u2019re smart about how we manage, how we deploy A&P we can get a mix benefit as well, which you're beginning to see through the writing momentum that we've got in Q1.","So we were not about to mortgage that agenda item. That said, when you look at the growth game plan, you look at the five ways to win. There are two things that we talk about and we\u2019ve organized the company around these two things. We believe we can do both of them really, really well, which is making our brands really matter, which is what the development organization has accountability for and building out an executional powerhouse, which is what the delivery organization has accountability for.","It's too early in the year given what we know and given a rigorous set of analytics that we've applied. It's too early in the year to mortgage the second pillar for the sake of the strategic agenda. And as I laid to you, it's plausible for us to get right in the middle of the range. Everything would have to go well. We couldn't have another misstep executionally or we couldn't have another event hit us, a material event hit us. But it's just month three. So I've never in my career ever pulled back on delivery in that context but to be very, very clear strategic priority and strategic agenda for the company first.","And then if we're comfortable that we're not mortgaging that, then by all means, there's no way we're pulling off our ambition to deliver the commitments we've made. If it comes to some point later in the year where that probability is not high enough, we'll let you know. But at this point, I'm comfortable as I've laid out in the material today that we can pull this off. I think it's a great test as a new operating model. It's a great test of our leadership team, and whether where you succeed or whether we don't succeed, it doesn't matter, we will all grow through this experience and we'll move on to 2015.","Chris Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great. Thanks. And I guess one other on M&A, obviously, you've been talking about it a lot more at CAGNY. You indicated that you've got a number of deals. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're thinking about there, has your thought process changed at all or have you become more interested, less interested in doing deals? And what do you see out there in the environment?","Michael Polk","Yeah. So this is a really interesting opportunity for us as we sort of turn the corner through the midpoint of the year. And we really get the operating model up to speed and our capability start to getting traction. We then have the opportunity to complement all the organic capability and growth acceleration, capability deployment and growth acceleration to come through the plan with external development.","And we will certainly have the cash flexibility to do that. We have the borrowing capacity to do that. And as a result, in my narrative, I'm sure you've noticed over the last six to nine to twelve months you've seen M&A sort of start to feature a little bit more prominently in the dialogue.","We are out getting targets. I think it's really important given our track record and history in the space to make sure that whatever we do, we do really, really well and it creates a lot of value and it's not dilutive at all to any of the metrics if we can avoid it across the P&L and also to -- from an EPS perspective.","And for us, perhaps more importantly that it fulfils a strategic need that we got in the business. Remember we said we had five anchor categories, two of which are scale Home Solutions and writing and three of which are subscale and subscale to us means less than a billion dollars. So our ambition is to try to scale all five of those anchored categories. So our filters are strategic, but we also have the ambition to do things that are accretive and enhance, if we can, growth in margin when we do them. And it come with the package of synergies either cost or revenue synergies that are very attractive to us.","So when you start to apply all those filters, your ability to find the right targets becomes narrower and narrower. And again, I don't think it's right -- I think a long view on the agenda we have here, so I'm not in a rush to do anything. That said, we have a bunch of conversations going on. Mark Tarchetti and Jason Mullins lead that work for us. And when I say conversations, there are internal conversations going on.","And I'm hopeful we can find the path over the coming quarters and into next year to demonstrate our capacity in this area to execute acquisitions as brilliantly as we hope to be able to demonstrate on our core agenda.","Chris Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Michael Polk","Hey, Bill.","Douglas Martin","Good morning, Bill.","William Chappell \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning.","I kind of want you back to the shift in the A&P spend, and so with the understanding of your businesses are all a little bit different. Some of them are seasonal. And so you certainly had a reason why you had the A&P spend kind of weighted towards the fourth quarter. How easy is it to shift it, so that, how do you move it if it was planned for certain categories to other? Can you help me understand how you move it back, and then manage the business at the same time?","Michael Polk","Well, in the past, that would have been nearly impossible. That would have been like pulling teeth because of the way we were organized. You had a holding company structure with 43 different bonus pulls. Pulling resources and managing resources dynamically like what we've just done would have been really difficult from an execution standpoint within the design of the company we had.","We're different company today. We're an operating company, all the boys sit at that top table. We needed to make the choice that we were going to jump start. We've used this language to reignite growth. And we had increases in Q2, Q3 built into our first plan, as you know, based on our earlier conversations, and we have an increase built on top of an increase a year ago in Q4 in A&P support.","And so what we've done is we pulled -- to be very specific, we pulled some writing support out of Q4 and make sure it's really sitting right on top of our writing initiatives, and we've got a very, very strong plan on writing in Q2, Q3. Most of the investments that we've pulled forward is media behind the new campaigns that we're working on. We've also made the decision on Graco that we need to make sure that in the context of the disruption in Q1 that we had strategic plans to build a new campaign out for Graco. We haven\u2019t advertised Graco in God knows how long. And we made the decision a year ago that we're going to work on advertising.","Well, we're fortunate to have made that decision because now we want to deploy that media behind the brand despite the fact that the P&L's taken a knock in Q1. And we were going to protect that investment and pull it forward a little bit so that we can get on with the reigniting growth there.","What's the mortgage? There were some support in Q4 on those businesses and some others. We pulled back a little bit on commercial products support. We pulled back a little bit on tools. But we protected the Calphalon spend in Q4, which is when we should be advertising Calphalon around the holidays.","And again, a brand that hasn\u2019t been advertised in a very, very long time. But we're working on that communication as we speak. So it\u2019s that sort of logic it's enabled by our structure, the fact that we're an operating company, it's enabled by the new operating model, it\u2019s really Dough, Mark Tarchetti, Bill Burke [ph]and myself in a room, and we can decide what we need to do in moments like this. And that's effectively what we've done.","William Chappell \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And just a follow up on the Baby, your kind of understanding the dynamics behind that. But when you were out of the market for four or five weeks, what did the retailers do? I mean did they put it inside the label, did they put it in other brands? And so is it as simple as kind of coming back and saying, \"Thanks for holding our thoughts. We'll take that space back\"? Or how quickly are you able to get back in and re-establish yourself?","Michael Polk","We're back in already. Those spots don't sit there empty. They're savvy. They flow inventory into them temporarily. We obviously talk to them about putting some of our other items that weren't recalled into those slots. But they don't hand them off to somebody else. I think they understand the situations. This was a different one than we've had in the long, long time because of the fact that we were -- there were so much inventory in their system of this product.","We learned a lot of things through this experience about how sophisticated some of the systems are out there or how well they segregate inventory through their systems, traceability, all sorts of things that we will learn and adapt our programming around that would enable us to do it more efficiently. You would think that first in, first out would apply on inventory through retailer system but not always we've learned.","So you've got all those dynamics. And you've got the dynamic that our re retailer will not want the exposure of selling anything that's being recalled. And so you have to make sure that there's not going to be a circumstance where UBC [ph] will flow through their system after you think you've got a cleaned up into the retail environment because then they won't be able to kind of check the consumer out through the cash register, if it's a recalled. You'll be seeing a very reluctant to once they've stopped selling those items. Flick the switch and turn that sell back on. So you have to really spend a lot of time going through their entire warehouse, their inventory systems and making sure you caught everything. And that's the process that we went through. We are the leader in this market by far globally and in the U.S. We quoted you global growth rates of 15%. Our core growth rate in largely flat to slightly increasing market was well over 20% all of last year in North America and right into January.","So we're the one driving. We're capturing immense amount of market share right now in this business and we're the one driving the category. So we have those assets and I think those helped us move through the issue with the retailer because these things are unfortunate for them as well. They lose, it\u2019s not just us who loses the revenues, they do, and our buyers lose their ability to reach their bonus target. So it's really a tough situation when you get into a place like we were in and have been in.","But I think that's largely behind us. We have the possibility probability of another dynamic unfolding on infant which we hope to get resolved in Q2, although our best view of that situation is that it would be far less dramatic at retail. But of course there's -- as we called out in the script, there's a risk that we may not end up exactly where we think our discussions with NHTSA will end up. But we made our best call on that, our best call does not presume a major retail disruption associated with the potential exposure on infant.","William Chappell \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it. Thanks for color.","Michael Polk","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question will be from John Faucher with JP Morgan.","Michael Polk","Hey, John.","John Faucher \u2013 JP Morgan","Hey good morning. I apologize for continuing to follow up on the baby piece. But my understanding of the situation is that this is due to -- or at least this is involving a co-packer that you guys use. And so your view on Baby has gotten more positive over the past couple of years as the revenue trends have accelerated. Is there any thought to changing the business model here where you say, \"You know what, this is something where we need to bring this in house. That way you could potentially capture the margin opportunities, you get more control obviously at the expense of capital. Is there a thought in terms of potentially changing the business model on Baby as a result of this?","Michael Polk","Just to be clear, the issue that we're dealing with is a buckle issue, not a co-packing issue. And there's a company that we've procured these buckles from, our supply partner uses the componentry that we procure or define. And so the relationship we have with our partner has no way contributed to the situation we're in. I think if we look in the mirror and went back six or seven years and looked at our choice to use the primary buckle that's at the heart of this. In the context of the growth game plan, you wouldn't have made that choice.","So we own that decision and thankfully there are no safety incidents for us or for anybody else in the industry who use the same buckle. But in the context of building great brands with superior performance, that's a buckle you wouldn't want to have on a product and a brand like Graco. But we've got to live with legacy of things decided whenever they were decided within our company and we're cleaning that. We're cleaning that out.","But to be clear, it had nothing to do with our supply partner. We've rekindled a very, very strong relationship with those guys. And they deserve a lot of the credit for the impact we're having in the marketplace over the last two years and they're great partners and we're lucky to have them.","With respect to whether we want to vertically integrate or re-integrate, we've got a very high return on net assets on this business, we create a lot of value on this business if we can grow, even though it has dilutive gross margins to the fleet average. So I don't think this issue really warrants a re-evaluation of that. I think there's going to be other ways that we can apply capital to create value for our investors that are going to be much more attractive than that one might be. Not to say we wouldn't ever do it, but it has to be really thought through in where we fit on a list of opportunities. It\u2019d probably be further down the list on other things we envision doing with our cash.","John Faucher \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. And then a separate question on writing, you talked about the pricing in the press release there. Can you talk about \u2013 is the brand investment driving your ability to take price? Because a lot of companies that we covered just simply aren't seeing that type of pricing here. So what's driving that, how sustainable is that, as you look out over the next couple of years.","Douglas Martin","Yeah. John, this is Doug. I think our brands are strong enough to -- many of our brands are strong enough to take and sustain price. And the investing behind the brands is helpful. In the case of writing specifically, we\u2019ve begun advertising InkJoy brand, as you know, in Latin America. And that's where a lot of our pricing is coming from in this business right now. So it's a combination of brand support and pricing and driving really nice volume.","John Faucher \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. So is that more mix then or sort of straight price?","Douglas Martin","It's straight price.","Michael Polk","In Latin America.","Douglas Martin","In Latin America, right.","John Faucher \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi guys. Good morning.","Michael Polk","Hey, Bill.","William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Doug, just a quick one on the tax rate, I think I might have missed it. But what do you guys think the normalized tax rate is going to be for the year?","Douglas Martin","It hasn't changed, Bill. It's still between 24% and 25%. As you know, the thing that we have difficulty judging is when discrete items might hit throughout the year and they traditionally hit for us in Q1 and Q3, but it is difficult to tell in our rate. And those are items you can't actually build into a flat rate for the year, so they pop up. But I think 24 to 25 is still a good range.","William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Great. And then the advertising ratio for the year, did you guys ever say what you expect the ratio of sales to increase and how that's changed versus your previous guidance? And then you look broadly across the industry, and obviously, it's horrible for the brands. But there's tons of money that's moving from advertising to promotion. And so, are you tempted to take that path or have you taken that path a little bit? Any color would be appreciated.","Michael Polk","So we did move down that path last year, Bill. So as we built out the scale events that our merchandising teams pivot around. That was an investment we did make in 2013. Actually, this year, we're pulling back a little bit. We have some shifting between consumer promotion and merchandising devices. But the real step up in A&P is almost all advertising related in 2014.","And we haven't communicated an advertising ratio externally, but this is a very material step up in advertising investment in Q2 and Q3 well into double digit increases. And the bits impact is quite significant. And I prefer not to kind of give a specific number out for competitive reasons. But we last year spent at a much higher rate than our competitors and this year you'll see us spend even more significantly than our competitors.","It's our responsibility as the leaders in these markets to build the categories. Of course we're going to do it through our branded assets, so we're going to capture share as we are in our key strategic businesses, whether it's baby, whether it's a writing portfolio, whether it's our food storage, food beverage portfolio within Rubbermaid. Where we're making these bets we\u2019re winning. And so we're encouraged by the responsiveness of the business to the investment.","And because of the way we're managing the company, we're taking the power of $6 billion company and applying it against competitive interphases -- at the interface between a category in a country against smaller competitors. We can flood those competitive interfaces with resources if we manage the resources dynamically and we don't let them get trapped in businesses.","And that's exactly what we're doing and that's why we see the share yield in the places where we've applied it. Our ambition is to obviously do that in more places and that's why the cost work is so important because getting the cost out enables us to cover more geography, more category country sales with that type of resourcing model. And that's why when we talk about our cost agenda, we talk about this unlocking the trap capacity for growth. Our drive to make Newell lean and efficient is inextricably linked to our ability to accelerate growth and our growth acceleration is a function of taking those call savings and deploying them against strategic investments, either in capabilities or in brand support. That's the algorithm we're trying to kind of implement. And it's early days, but if Q4 was a good indicator, I think Q1 when you really do the math on the underlying performance, yeah nobody is happy with Q1. But if you look at the underlying performance in the business, you feel okay about those gross rates given the spending level. And that\u2019s' why we can be optimistic about the impact that we'll have in Q2, Q3. But time will tell. But it's a significant \u2013 your question was very straightforward. My answers is always long.","William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","It's a good answer. And then just lastly, what was the home solution especially Rubbermaid home. You guys, the team has done an amazing job broadly across the portfolio, but it seems like Rubbermaid home is your kind of kryptonite. So is there anything there that -- a code you can crack, resin prices are at their three-day high. They're up 12% year over year. So that's not going to help the cost much in that business. But is there a point in time where you say, \"You know what, screw it. It\u2019s not worth it. Let's just move on\"?","Michael Polk","No, it's a great brand. We're going to figure out this one out. This is my life mission. So I love the brand. It's a power brand and it's like any other brand. I've worked on some tough, tough brands before, coffee business, Maxilla House, not an easy brand. There are plenty of margarine, not easy brands. This is just another naughty -- there are plenty of margarine, not easy brands. This is just another not-easy brand. And so we're going to figure this out. I've got a really good team on Rubbermaid both on the delivery side and on the development side. And we're encouraged by the ideas that are coming through the innovation funnel.","We've got some of our best thinkers on this business. This is where shops design capability will be able to kind of really create value. By the way, we just opened that design center a few weeks ago. And so we're going to crack this code.","Now, just remember, Rubbermaid is 7 to 8 different businesses under one brand. We go up from everywhere from big storage codes to food storage to food beverage containers to durable water bottles to water coolers to outdoor sheds to outdoor d\u00e9cor to closet organization, to garage organization. So this is a big sprawling brand. Not all of the product lines within this brand are interesting to us. But many of them are really interesting to us and are on trend.","So this is going to take us a while. This will be our toughest brand challenge I think of all the stuff we've got going on. We're not ready yet to put real money behind it, but I think this is one of the most interesting businesses we've got and we're going to figure it out. It may take us another year to get it right, but we're going to give you evidence that even this brand can be cracked.","William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Connie Maneaty \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Good morning. I also have a follow up on home solutions, the business. What percentage of the home solution products are the ones that either you can't take pricing on or low margins or that caused you the trouble in the first quarter.","Michael Polk","I'll just tell you that the line. I'm not going to give you a percentage, Connie, but it's a big home organization, tods business which is the toughest business we've got. It's the most competitive business we've got and it's a place where it's not easy to create a product based point of difference that enables you to command a premium price. And that's the one that\u2019s set a portion of that portfolio that will be trouble for us.","We may not get to all the other portions of the business that are right upfront in terms of renovating their design and their configuration. But this is probably the biggest challenge within the business. And of course, you can't just pull back the throttle on something that's sizeable like that those big tods are as a percentage of your revenue stream because you get into a fixed cost absorption with you and your factories.","So we're going through the process of understanding the variable contribution margin of every one of our product lines by factory. We're looking at the hours produced within those factories. We're figuring out how to reconfigure our demand and create the demand that enables us to absorb the right amount of -- absorb the fixed cost in these factories but on the businesses with a higher variable contribution margin. So we're not going to live the old ways that we have historically lived where the big volume-producing items with the low variable contribution margins absorb the fix cost, and we rationalize our gross margin percentage in the back of the assertion that they absorb the infrastructure cost. We believe we can grow the other portions of our business quite substantially. And so the mechanism by which you get this thing fixed is you invest in the product and the brand but in those other areas, such that your volume grows, you absorb the infrastructure cost and it gives you the ability to pull back on the portions that have lower variable contribution margin. You could argue, \"Well, why don't you just scrip the asset down?\" et cetera. We've done a lot of that.","So we've got to get this. We're in the process of unpacking this thing. It's really interesting. It's like a puzzle, which is great. So if you message to my people, if you work on this business, it's my favourite business even though it's the most difficult one because it's complicated and you've got to -- you work on so many different levels and dimensions to be able to unlock an answer here.","But the question was that before I think there is an answer in an algorithm to be found and we're getting really close. But the most unattractive portion of the business are the big tods, that\u2019s the most competitive. And we're just not going to fall into the -- or step in the pot hole that we've historically stepped in where in tough moments for growth we lean in to that. I'm not doing that anymore.","So if that forces me to have a difficult conversation with you at some point in the future, so be it, on top line. But we're not going to do that because we're not -- by doing that we mask the underlying issue and we don't confront it. So we're working on it. It's going to take us a while.","Connie Maneaty \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks. And I also have a follow up on Venezuela. My understanding was that you need to report the rate at which you're actually getting access to dollars. And I also thought you were getting access at the 6.3 rate. So I'm wondering why you went to SICAD I if you were invited in? And also, if you made that -- that that was your choice. Why didn't you also -- did you think about going to SICAD II and just sort of like getting rid of the risk over the long term? Because you see, in two companies now go to SICAD II so I'm wondering what your thought process was.","Douglas Martin","Yeah, Connie, this is Doug. I'll take that. We actually are in profession in the industry that needs to record at the rate at which you expect to be repatriate earnings and or royalty streams as opposed to what you're daily transacting the business at. And for us, the most likely rate that that will be is SICAD I.","Now, to be clear, we continue to get approvals for under the old regime at 6.3 to get payment to vendors on an everyday basis. While we get approvals, we're not getting cash. So there still remains a tremendous amount of uncertainty as to when we can actually monetize those in U.S. dollars on our side.","And then from a SICAD perspective, when we look at the different classifications between SICAD I and SICAD II for our products -- and remember, our products in country are mostly in the writing business. They're mostly educational tools and we believe that they'll most likely fall in to SICAD I.","We haven't been invited to participate in either SICAD I or SICAD II at this point. But SICAD I is where we expect to go.","Connie Maneaty \u2013 BMO Capital Markets.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joe Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Hey, thanks. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Doug.","Michael Polk","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","I just want to go back to gross margin for a second and the expansion you saw this quarter. Obviously, you surprised us and it sounded like it surprised you to the upside as well. I wonder how sustainable that was. You mentioned that you're looking for a step down in promo spending this year. So was there any sort of one time item in that number or is that really a sustainable expansion number going forward? And if you could tease out, how much of that was from pricing, and how much from promotion?","Thanks.","Michael Polk","Yes. We got good price realization. Remember, we started to take pricing in Q4. We've got good price realization in the quarter. So that's a positive. How sustainable that will be? That will be a question over time and we have a set of principles that we need to embrace which are relative which are competitively driven. So we have price gaps that we are looking to maintain relative to our competition and that's the principle that will drive us because that's what in the brand's interest.","So there may be some movement and maybe some movement back on some of that pricing. But we'll see. It depends what our competitors do. To be clear, if our competitors match, then there won't be any reason to have to pull off of that number. That said, we think we're going to have a positive price impact to gross margin on the full year significant one in part because of the inflation that Bill was talking about on the resin based businesses. But in part because we can begin to price as we build these brands and build the equity in these brands. We're changing the value proposition in these brands and we think we can capture more pricing and be less merchandising dependent.","That said we spend a huge amount of money between gross price and net price. So don't think that we're pulling back hard on the throttle. We're just taking series of steps here. Mix is certainly a variable in Q1. Remember, Home Solutions was down lower gross margin. Baby was down lower gross margin. So that's a variable in the gross margin increase. Had the Graco recall not happened, we wouldn't have gotten a stronger gross margin outcome because Graco would have been stronger on the volume side, with mix of the business down a little bit.","That said, we still think we would have gotten margin increase. And so the differential versus prior year and our expectations, because we had expectations of gross margin increases in Q1, relates largely to that. We've got a significant amount of inflation that's figuring into gross margin well over 100 basis points in gross margin, which is what Bill was mentioning.","And so the long term algorithm for gross margin improvement for us is going to be fundamental cost -- productivity and cost management, sourcing savings and productivity through value engineering our packs and products efficiency work in factories, hard looks at distribution networks and distribution cost as a percent of revenue, transportation cost as percent of revenue. And mix, and maximizing the mix.","Those are going to be the things that drive gross margin increases for us going forward. And we're just beginning quite frankly to do that well. Mary and her team have -- we've reorganized the supply chain in the middle last year, big changes. Just like in every other aspect of our business, the folks, the new functional capabilities we're building are just beginning to get up to speed and to have the impacts we hope they will have over time.","So this will become one of the key enablers going forward. We expect and we need the gross margin increases in the full year. And our ability to increase spend is in part dependent on that, as I mentioned, in the factors that could influence delivery and also dependent on continued progress on overheads.","Joe Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. In the (indiscernible) one question. Thanks guys.","Michael Polk","Thanks Joe.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. I appreciate it. Just on the outlook on sales, can you talk about some of the puts and takes of the sales outlook that gets you back to plus three to four because obviously baby is a little bit lower and it'll take some time to get back to a steady state. But it sounds like you also have a delay in some of the office consolidation which is probably giving you some cover. So can you walk through some of those puts and takes please?","Michael Polk","Yeah. So obviously, the ODO and OMX merger, Office Depot, OfficeMax merger, and -- what we anticipated in Q1 with respect to store closures and consolidation of networks, et cetera, that hasn't happened. In the cadence we thought it would, and that certainly contributed in some ways to our writing success.","We've been very engaged with Office Depot and we have a good plan in place, good joint customer business plan, a better one than we have last year set now for the new entity. And we expect to have and are hopeful that if we execute well, have a very, very good back to school merchandising drive period across the total company. But in particular, the change in our conversations with Depot Max versus our conversions last year should strengthen our overall performance there.","So that's encouraging and that's a positive with respect to guidance relative to what we thought we would have when we first laid out our plan. So kudos to the team for planning a path to a better discussion. And we're hopeful that in execution, it actually yields an outcome.","We're more bullish on writing overall as a result of the brand work that's going on. We're relaunching Mr. Sketch. We're launching Clear Point Highlighters on new really innovative item on Sharpie. We've got the momentum really building now on InkJoy from a share and from a geographic perspective. We've got Finepoint Expo going to market. We've got a lot of stuff going on in writing, six months ago I would've been confident talking to you about. The new Sharpie advertising tested extremely strong. Three times the U.S. national average of all ads ever tested in all industries. Three times as effective along the metric that we look at to measure effectiveness amongst our testing partners inventory of all testing ever done. And this is one of these testing partners that does big company testing.","Our confidence in the impact of the work of developments doing is increasing in that, and that work is focused on our most strategic businesses at this point. So writing, I'm encouraged. It's too early to high five because Q1 was an easy comp, but we'll see. So that's one of the reasons to believe.","The other reason to believe is the responsiveness of the Graco business. So we're back in distribution now. We've seen a nice step up. We won't see April results for another day or so, but based on the acceleration results through the month of March once we got the issues behind us \u2013 and the point of sale data, I'm hopeful that we can rekindle growth faster than maybe what our core assumption and our forecast looks like. So there\u2019s some opportunity there.","I think the step back that we experienced on Home Solutions and to a lesser degree at home centers on Rubbermaid commercial products, we'll get a bounce back effect on some of the weather effects in Q2 as most of the home center guys have communicated externally. So there's a reason to believe and that the step up in advertising support Q2, Q3 is really quite profound. So if it doesn't work, we won't do it again. I guess it's the headline.","But I'm really going to be interested to see what kind of POS lift we get as a result of that kind of investment.","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, Mike. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your final question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc.","Jason Gere \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Good. I mean Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. I guess, just more of a bigger picture. I want to talk a little bit about Asia. I mean, if we think about the plan longer-term, Latin America is obviously hitting its stride, your Europe efforts to stabilize are working. So when we think about the long-term organic sales or core sales in that 3% to 5% range, Asia seems to be the missing ingredient. So I was just wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit about the selling capabilities, the infrastructure that is in plan, to really focus on when top line acceleration will come in. And whether some of the issues that are going on in some of the other businesses, other geographies are kind of slowing down the plans to get Asia up and running in 2015?","Michael Polk","Jason, our strategic thinking around this as you recall when we talked about the growth game plan at the very beginning was that we were going to increase the margin in the developed world as a mechanism for having the investment firepower to drive growth through two different means. One is market share growth in our home markets, and secondly, the deployment of our portfolio to -- a selected portions of the portfolio into the faster growing emerging market in a disciplined way; first, south to Latin America and next east to Asia.","So that's the narrative that we put out there and that's the plan we're executing right now with a real intense focus on scaling Latin America. But the next horizon is it's not just China. It's Southeast Asia and China. We have a huge opportunity. We don\u2019t sell anything in Indonesia. We don\u2019t sell anything in Vietnam. We have a limited portfolio available in the Philippines. We have a good business in Thailand and Malaysia in writing but we don't have the rest of the portfolio there.","So there's a huge opportunity for the company. I think it's fair to say that the next chapter of the company -- the next five year plan, we'll have Asia right in the center of it. That said, we're going to begin to move to east here over the coming years. I think with the real focus in 2016 with the start of that agenda in the late 2015 with a real interest in our win bigger categories in the baby business, particularly in China for the baby business.","And so, I think that's the way you should think about it. We're in the planning stages now. We've got a lot of work to do on route to market, as you say, on sourcing, and on the brand. We're focused in that work and the inside work on writing today and in China. We're thinking about Southeast Asia on tools and commercial products where we\u2019ve made progress on route to market under Curt Rahilly's leadership on commercial products.","But I do not think you should build into your models a big step up in Asia performance. I think the window to think about that is 2016, 2017 because we don't want to enter these markets in a way that's not sustainable and is not focused on building brands. In the past, we've sometimes been a little bit too opportunistic in pursuing revenue in some of these moves. And we don't want to do that. We want to build a business that's going to be in those countries 30 years from now, not a business that\u2019s going to be there for 18 months and give us a nice pop of growth.","Jason Gere \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Great. This sounds like everything is on plan there. So I'll leave at one question as well in the interest of time.","Michael Polk","Thanks Jason.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Polk for closing remarks.","Michael Polk","My closing remarks I think will be really focused which is I really appreciate all the challenging and the support through what's been a tough first quarter and your questions, your commitment to stay connected to what it is we're doing. It's very helpful to us as a management team as we try to chart the path forward. So we're optimistic about what we're going to be able to deliver on the year despite the disruption we've had in Q1 and it's going to take my team fully embracing the challenge.","And from what I've seen, the folks have really immersed themselves in this area and some may even relish the challenge. So with that, I'll close the call and I appreciate all the feedback and the challenge and the support.","Talk to you soon.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellrubbermaid.com on the Investor Relations home page, under Events and Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download. I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell","Great, thank you. Welcome, everybody, to Newell Rubbermaid's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. On the call with me today are Mike Polk, Newell Rubbermaid's President and CEO; and Juan Figuereo, Executive Vice President and CFO. ","We have a couple of administrative items before we begin. First, during the call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, normalized results and outlooks. We present this non-GAAP information for comparative purposes because management believes providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. For further information on reconciliations to comparable financial measures under GAAP, please see our earnings release on the Investor Relations area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. ","Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from management's current expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statements in the earnings release in our most recent 10-Q. ","And now with that, let me turn it over to Mike Polk for his comments.","Michael B. Polk","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. My objective today is twofold. First, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year results and share some observations about our performance. Second, I'll explain our thinking about 2012 and provide guidance for the year. ","Let's get into the results. We posted a solid Q4, delivering 3.7% core sales growth. Q4 was the strongest quarter of the year, driving second half core sales growth to 3.5% and full year core growth to 1.8%, versus our guidance range of 1% to 3%. Reported sales in Q4 were also up 3.7%, resulting in full year reported sales growth of 3.6%. Q4 normalized EPS was $0.40, resulting in a full year normalized EPS of $1.59, up 6% versus prior year and in the middle of our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.62. While our effective tax rate was substantially higher than prior year in Q4, we did benefit from a better rate than expected. This benefit was driven by improved European profitability, which enabled us to access more NOLs than we had anticipated. ","In Q4, we delivered 150 basis points of operating margin expansion, driven by tough discretionary cost discipline, the very early impact of Project Renewal and favorable management incentive costs. We achieved this result despite gross margin being down 10 basis points versus prior year. Importantly, we generated strong cash flow of $561 million in 2011, at the high end of our guidance range of $520 million to $560 million. Our solid cash flow enabled us to pay down $183 million of debt in 2011. And as a result, our strengthened balance sheet has taken another step toward our target leverage ratios. We also used just over $46 million to buy back 3.4 million shares in 2011, a little more than 1% of our float at an average share price of $13.72. ","In Q4, all 3 operating groups grew reported and core sales. Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products had another strong quarter, with reported sales up 7.7% and core sales up 8.0%. Office Products delivered reported sales growth of 3.7%, with core sales up 3.8%. Home & Family delivered reported sales growth of 1.2%, with core sales up 0.9%. In Q4, 10 of our 13 global business units grew core sales, 4 of the 13 grew core sales greater than 5% and 3 grew core sales greater than 10%.  Baby & Parenting delivered core sales growth of 4.5% in Q4 and close to 2% in the second half of 2011, as a result of very strong growth of Aprica in Asia and progress towards stabilizing Graco in North America. ","While there's more work to be done here, this is a step in the right direction. In 2011, our top 14 brands delivered 4.9% reported growth, with the best absolute contributions coming from IRWIN, Lenox, Rubbermaid Commercial and Aprica. Together, these 4 brands grew reported sales over 11%. In the emerging markets, core sales grew over 10% in Q4, with double-digit core sales growth in most of the major emerging market countries. Our Q4 core sales growth was 2.5% in the developed world, with strong growth in Japan and solid results in North America, partially offset by a decline in Western Europe. ","Our key growth initiatives are yielding the results we expect. Industrial Products & Services achieved their eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth behind strengthened selling capabilities in the emerging markets and the successful launch of our Speed Slot Hole Saw. Parker Ingenuity has been successfully launched into 11 countries now, to positive critical acclaim and terrific sell-through, particularly in Asia and via e-tailers in North America. ","IRWIN delivered strong growth as a result of our new GrooveLock Pliers and levels and measuring launches. Paper Mate InkJoy has been launched into virtually all countries where Paper Mate is sold, with the bulk of the marketing support still to come. Rubbermaid Medical increased revenues over 80%, as we continue to scale this brand. Sharpie and Paper Mate were successfully launched in Brazil and are making good early progress. And as mentioned, Aprica had a terrific second half in Asia, as virtually every new item we've launched exceeded expectations. Aprica Asia had Q4 core sales growth of over 20%. And Calphalon had an excellent year behind the expansion of kitchen electrics, the new bronze contemporary nonstick line and the distribution win at J.C. Penney. ","On the cost side, our efforts to unlock the Kraft capacity for growth are also progressing well. Project Renewal is up and running. We've reset my top team. Our new group in GBU architecture was announced in November and the North American restructuring is well underway. We're strengthening the U.S. selling organization and our consumer-facing businesses, deploying integrated cross-functional customer and channel teams in the U.S. And we've announced that we will close our Rubbermaid Consumer factory in Greenville, Texas and consolidate production in our Winfield, Kansas and Mogadore, Ohio factories. There've been many people impacted by these decisions, and I'd once again like to thank all of our employees for how professionally they're leading through change. ","On the other side of the Atlantic, we're moving rapidly toward the April 2012 SAP and European principal company cutover. I spent time with the transition team 2 weeks ago in the U.K. outside of Newcastle and Sunderland. They've made a tremendous amount of progress. And while we have a lot of work still to do, the team is focused and energized by the challenge. This is, by far, the most comprehensive systems project we've implemented. And while we have the finish line in sight, we need to cross over a series of testing hurdles before we throw the go-live switch. So far, so good, but lots to do. Importantly, despite a tougher year than planned, we have the changed agenda, associated with the SAP and EPC, EMEA, delivered slightly better than 10% operating margin in 2011, about a year ahead of our targeted delivery date and 800 basis points above the 2009 baseline. ","So overall, some solid results. Before moving to 2012 guidance, there are 3 subjects I'd like to discuss that could impact our results going forward: Western Europe, foreign exchange and gross margin. ","First, Western Europe. We generate roughly 10% of our total business in Western Europe where our core sales decline accelerated in Q4. This slowdown was fairly widespread, with the weakest performance in Southern Europe and progressively poor performance in the U.K. Growth in the Russia, Eastern Europe and Middle East businesses, which get consolidated in our EMEA region, remains healthy. We expect the worsening Western European macro environment to carry forward into 2012 and affect our core sales growth rate. We've captured this in the 2012 guidance I will share with you in a moment. ","The second subject I want to discuss is foreign exchange. Since our Q3 earnings call, foreign exchange has become more challenging. Through the first 3 quarters of 2011, we benefited from about 250 basis points of positive ForEx in our reported growth. Since then, ForEx has essentially done a full inversion. We entered 2012 with foreign exchange on many currencies virtually back to where we were in 2010. The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar has caused us to temper our outlook for reported growth in EPS for 2012. Our 2012 guidance assumes a negative 200 basis point impact on full year revenues. The 2012 top line impact will peak in Q2 and Q3. Our 2012 guidance also assumes the combined translation, and transaction ForEx effect on EPS will be about negative $0.04 to $0.05 versus 2011. ","The third subject I want to discuss is margin. Gross margin was 37.2% in Q4. Our gross margin in most of our businesses landed right where we expected them to be. However, our Decor GBU had a tough quarter due to an operational issue in one of their factories that impacted both growth and gross margin on our custom blinds business. The Q4 issue relates to our Q2 decision to close our Salt Lake City custom blinds factory and consolidate production in our Ogden, Utah facility, roughly at the same time as our mid-Q3 SAP conversion. In retrospect, this was more change than this facility could handle at one time. Our supply chain and business team has had all hands on deck. And while we've made sequential improvements through the fourth quarter, we may continue to feel pressure in sales and gross margin on Decor until sometime in Q2. ","So some positive momentum in our business as we exit 2011, partially offset by emerging external challenges with European macros and ForEx and an execution issue in one GBU. ","With that, let's move to our 2012 guidance. I'll start with top line. We guided 2012 core sales growth to between 2% and 3%, sequential improvement on our 2011 full year results but below our second half 2011 run rate. Underpinning this guidance, we expect our markets in the developed world to continue to experience slow to no growth and in the emerging markets to grow in line with GDP. We believe we'll grow ahead of those markets and continue to build market share. That said, we assume worsening European macros continue in 2012, dampening market growth relative to 2011 and negatively impacting our core sales. Separately, we will reduce our merchandising activity in the first half of the year as we migrate our European systems to SAP and our business practices to comply with the new European principal company framework. These 2 factors, worsening macros and lower merchandising activity in the first half of 2012, will drive weaker growth renewal in Europe than in 2011. When coupled with the Decor factory issue, we believe our core sales will be in the lower half of our guidance range in the first half of 2012 and recover to the higher end of the range in the balance of the year. ","On margins, our guidance is for normalized operating margin to expand in 2012 by up to 20 basis points. Inflation will have over 150 basis point negative impact on gross margins, but we expect to cover this and more through pricing and productivity. As a result, we expect gross margin to increase in 2012. We will continue to be really tight on discretionary SG&A costs. However, our SG&A ratio will increase slightly as we build new capabilities and strengthen our agenda. Project Renewal savings will build through the year and we intend to reinvest the majority of those savings back into the business. We will be tough on these investment choices, focusing them on capabilities and programming that create lasting value and sustainable growth. These investments will be back half loaded largely, with some investments made in the second quarter. By holding back the majority of the renewal reinvestment until the second half, we will gain visibility into our 2012 delivery before locking the Project Renewal investments into the P&L. ","The combination of the core sales growth range, the ForEx impacts and the normalized operating margin expansion results in the following guidance on EPS and cash flow: we expect normalized EPS to fall in the range of $1.63 to $1.69; and operating cash flow to fall in the range of $550 million to $600 million. For those of you wondering how we get to the upside of the EPS guidance, we get there if: we deliver better core growth as a result of either our growth initiatives delivering even greater impact than we planned, or the macro and consumer environment being better than we expect; or we experience less ForEx headwind than we built in; or we allow more of the Project Renewal savings to flow through to EPS, rather than be invested in strengthened capabilities and programming. We cannot control the macro conditions. The trends on ForEx in Europe are not positive and I don't see any catalysts out there that could affect those dynamics in the near term. With respect to Project Renewal savings, I've consistently taken a strategic view of these monies. We intend to invest the majority of these funds back into the business. How could we end in the low end of the range? The 2 most likely causes would be worse macros and\/or further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. ","I think our guidance range is well balanced. If I had to make a call today, I'd call it in the middle of the range given that it's still very early in the year and our guidance reflects the most recent thinking. With that, I'll pass the baton to Juan so he can add some detail to the numbers.","Juan R. Figuereo","Thanks, Mike. And good morning, everyone. Starting with our Q4 results, core sales grew 3.7%. In North America, net sales and core sales grew 3.8% led by the strength of our Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products and Office Products segments, both with high single-digit growth. Sales outside North America grew 3.5%, with FX having a neutral impact. Both Latin America and APAC delivered double-digit core growth of 11.2% and 10.6%, respectively, while EMEA core sales declined 3.2%, mainly due to the tough macro environment in Western Europe. ","Gross margin was 37.2%, essentially flat versus prior year, but below our expectations for the quarter. Pricing and productivity offset the input cost inflation. Versus the prior year, pricing contributed 130 basis points to margin improvement, which was in line with expectations. Raw material inflation at $23 million was a sequential improvement versus the previous 2 quarters and better than expected. ","Versus expectations, we were held back by operational issues, mainly in our Ogden, Utah facility, where our Decor GBU makes custom blinds, which Mike described earlier in his remarks. I am confident we will get this business back on track and that we have the right plans in place to fix the issues, but we could be into the second quarter of 2012 before they are fully behind us. ","Despite the gross margin pressure, we continue to invest in demand creation initiatives in focused growth areas: the Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products segment, where we are showing the strongest growth trends, was one of those focus areas; and support for the Paper Mate InkJoy launch and geographic expansion in the Office Products segment was another. These investments were partly funded by $9 million decrease in structural SG&A, which was driven by lower incentive comp and very early Project Renewal savings. ","Operating margin, on a normalized basis, increased 150 basis points to 11.8%. Interest expense for the quarter was $21.2 million, compared with $22.9 million in the previous year. This improvement was due to lower debt levels. Our normalized tax rate in the fourth quarter was 23%, compared with 20.8% in the prior year quarter. The change in the normalized year-over-year tax rate was primarily driven by the geographic mix of earnings and the timing of certain discrete items recorded in the prior year. Our expected tax rate was more favorable than expected in the quarter. We were able to use more foreign tax credits, as well as more foreign tax operating losses than previously anticipated, thanks in part to improved profitability in Europe and to our work in preparation for the 2012 go-live of SAP EPC. We are happy to see some of these benefits start to flow through the P&L earlier than anticipated. ","Now let's take a look at the balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $282 million in operating cash flow. We used $134 million to pay down debt and return $45 million to shareholders in the form of $23.3 million in dividends and $21.7 million paid for the repurchase of 1.5 million shares. The share repurchases during the quarter had less than $0.01 impact on normalized EPS. We continue to make steady progress improving our working capital. Notably, we reduced inventory by 14 days from Q3, in accordance with our seasonal patterns and a little over one day from prior year levels. This was a good outcome considering that we had to pre-build inventory at year end to support SAP EPC go-live in Europe and the Greenville plant shutdown in the U.S. ","As we look back on the full year, we made solid progress on a number of areas in 2011, especially in the face of very tough economic circumstances. First, we generated core sales growth of 1.8%, led by our Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products segment, with core growth of 6%, and Office Products core sales that grew 1.5%. The Home & Family segment declined 0.8%. Gross margin at 37.6%, contracted 40 basis points as input cost inflation was more than double what we originally anticipated coming into the year and operational issues created additional pressure. The good news is that our ability to price to offset inflation helped keep our margins in line or better than our competitor set. Normalized earnings per share of $1.59 represented a 6% improvement over the prior year. Operating cash flow of $561 million was strong, as we continued to make steady progress reducing our working capital. ","We spent $223 million in CapEx in 2011, which was higher than our guidance as our strong cash flow enabled us to accelerate certain investments in productivity and capacity. We successfully completed our Capital Structure Optimization Plan during the first quarter. Largely as a result of this initiative, our year-over-year interest expense decreased by $32.2 million. We increased our dividends 60% to $0.08 per share and returned an additional $46 million to our shareholders in the form of 3.4 million shares repurchased during the second half of the year. Clearly, a year of solid progress on many fronts. ","Turning now to our 2012 outlook. As Mike covered earlier, we expect full year core sales growth of 2% to 3%. We expect foreign currency translation will have a negative 200 basis point impact on sales for the year. This assumes average exchange rates for 2012 remain around recent spot rates. ","There are a couple of items worthy of note that will impact top line comparisons in 2012. First, as we prepare for the April go-live of SAP and EPC in Europe, we're slowing down merchandising activities and asking some of our larger customers to pull forward orders from Q2 into Q1, so we can reduce the risk profile during the go-live period. Our preliminary estimates for pull forward range from $15 million to $30 million. ","Second, our Decor GBU will be lapping the pipeline sale associated with the Q1 2011 placement of our size-in-store machines, which was around $15 million in sales. We anticipate normalized operating margin to expand by up to 20 basis points. This guidance reflects our expectation that we will generate gross margin improvement as productivity, improved product mix and pricing more than offset inflation. We will also increase SG&A spend to drive accelerated growth, funded largely by gross margin expansion and reduction in structural SG&A from Project Renewal. ","Based on that, our total SG&A, as a percent of sales in 2012, is likely to increase modestly. We expect interest expense for 2012 to be slightly down as debt reduction will occur in the second half of the year. Our effective tax rate for 2012 is projected to be essentially flat. This expectation includes benefits from the European Transformation Plan beginning after the planned April go-live. However, the year-on-year comparison will be impacted by some of the benefits realized in Q4 2011, related in part to the work performed in preparation for this project, which are not expected to recur in 2012. ","We expect normalized earnings per diluted share between $1.63 and $1.69 in 2012, or about 3% to 6% growth. This estimate assumes a $0.04 to $0.05 drag on earnings related to adverse ForEx. The phasing of the impact is weighted heaviest in the second quarter and into the third as we compare against the weaker dollar in 2011. We expect the EPS increase will be somewhat back half weighted. This EPS guidance excludes between $110 million and $130 million of planned restructuring and restructuring-related costs associated with the European Transformation Plan and Project Renewal. Operating cash flow is expected to be between $550 million and $600 million for the full year, including $110 million to $120 million in restructuring and restructuring-related cash payments. ","Capital expenditures are projected at between $200 million to $225 million. We have $250 million in debt maturities in March of 2012, which we intend to bridge with short-term line and pay from operating cash flow in the second half of the year. We believe our balance sheet will continue to get stronger and towards the second half of 2012, we should be coming close to our desired comfort range of 2.5x adjusted leverage ratio. ","We plan to continue to repurchase shares opportunistically over the course of the 3-year share repurchase plan period. The Board gave management discretion to be more opportunistic or more conservative, depending upon the attractiveness of share repurchase versus other competing options. Those other options include investing back into the business to fuel organic growth, dividend payments, further debt payments and potential small bolt-on acquisitions. ","In conclusion, as we enter 2012, we anticipate headwinds from continued economic uncertainty in Europe, gross margin pressure in the beginning of the year as we work through our Decor operational issues and headwinds from volatile currency markets. On the other hand, our businesses are gaining momentum and we feel comfortable with our ability to manage through the challenges and opportunities ahead of us. We're excited about our growth, excited about our growth plans for 2012 and are looking forward to creating an even stronger company for our employees and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mike. Mike?","Michael B. Polk","Thanks, Juan. As most of you know, and I had a chance to meet many of you over the last 6 months, I'm very excited by the opportunities I see ahead for Newell Rubbermaid. The organization is responding to our new agenda for the business. The team is leading change while getting back into a rhythm of doing what we say we are going to do.","As I've communicated in various forums, the next chapter of the Newell Rubbermaid story will be written in 3 stages: first, the delivery stage. We're in the midst of rebuilding our cadence of delivery and the credibility that comes with this; the second stage is the strategic stage. Effectively, our path forward, which Project Renewal is in part designed to enable. I'll lay out the strategic roadmap for the business on February 22 at CAGNY. I plan to use that venue to discuss our long-term vision for the company, our strategy for growth and do a deeper dive on the specific areas where we will invest to strengthen performance. We'll spend much of 2012 into 2013 reallocating both financial and human capital to those choices and capabilities we believe are most important to our growth agenda. We expect the payoff to come in the final stage, the acceleration stage, where we see a step change in performance. ","We've got a lot of work to do. We're making progress and there will no doubt some be some bumps along the way, but our team sees a clear path to building Newell Rubbermaid into a bigger, faster growing, more profitable, more global company, and we're committed to getting us there. With that, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping to get a more exact sense for the percent of savings under Project Renewal that you expect to reinvest behind the business in 2012. Is it effectively all of it? The vast majority of it? Or is there a chunk of it which drops to the bottom line? And then, more importantly, what gives you the confidence that you're going to be able to earn a solid return on those investments, particularly in difficult macro environment? And last, just given you\u2019ve such a different set of businesses, and a diverse set of businesses, some of which are more responsive to investment than others, how do you approach allocating spending across the various segments?","Michael B. Polk","Dara, it's a great question and it's at the heart of what we'll talk about when we get together at -- when we have the opportunity to speak at CAGNY, and I'm going to start with the end of your question first. The thing that will drive where we allocate our investments will be the strategic choices we make with respect to portfolio rolls for our different businesses. And as I've said in other forums, we have 2 jobs to be done. We have one job to be done, which is to get more growth where we are and the second job to be done is to systematically, in a disciplined way, deploy the portions of our portfolio that are relevant into the faster growing, emerging markets. And as we think about Project Renewal and the funds that get generated and any other savings that we can identify, and there's other pots of savings out there to be tapped into that don't fall under Project Renewal. As we think about how to reinvest that money, we look at it through the lens of portfolio rolls, where we want to play, portions of the portfolio that we think offer the most strategic potential for growth and offer the best return and offer the best option for creating value against those 2 jobs to be done that I've discussed. And there are different levers to be pulled in different businesses. There are different growth levers to be pulled in different businesses. And so the investment that we will make back into this business will happen sort of at a line item level, activity-based level. The filter we will apply is that matrix I've just described, the 2 jobs to be done against the portfolio rolls. And we'll be selective about how to deploy the money back in. The timing of how that money flows back in, is in part a function of me gaining visibility into our delivery in the first part of the year. So I've been quite specific with my team and I think clear in the comments I just made, that the vast majority of the money won't be allocated until the second half of the year, although some spending will start in Q2. The money will flow to things that create lasting value. So I'm not going to deploy that investment into tactical things. We'll put it into things that can get us onto our strategic agenda. So an example of that might be investment in selling capabilities in Latin America. Another example of that might be the development of digital capabilities and e-commerce capabilities for a number of our businesses around the world. And so the types of investments we're going to make are ones that are positioned to create essentially an annuity for us and allow us to get on to delivering against our strategic ambition, which again I'll lay out at CAGNY. So I think that's how I would -- I'd answer the question you got. Again, I want to post the money in and I don't want to lock it into the P&L until I get visibility into gross margin delivery. We've got the Decor issue in Ogden resolved and we get a little bit more visibility into our first half performance. It would be wrong to kind of put the money in and then have to pull it out, depending on where we are from an earnings perspective. The question you asked about how much of it flows to EPS versus capabilities and programming. Well, it's not all going into capabilities and programming, but I've said the vast majority of it will. The ability to stay true to those words will be a function of us doing what we say we're going to do in our core business plans. And time will tell. I look at it every day and my folks know we're all kind of watching it as it unfolds, and I think I wrote an e-mail this weekend saying we're about 4.5% through the year here, on January 20, and we're 4.5% of the way to our ambition. So -- I mean, you have to manage the business as an everyday thing. Vince Lombardi said that winning's an everyday thing and he's right. You have to have your eye on the outcome virtually every day. And until I have greater certainty about that and greater clarity, I'm not going to post the money in. But I'm certain we will and we've modeled it obviously, otherwise we wouldn't be laying it out as explicitly as we have. And so I have confidence that the vast majority of it will be able to flow back. Does that answer your question?","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It does. That's very helpful. And then if I can slip one other one in. The momentum in Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products is very strong this year. Can you just break down into more granular level what's really driving that and your thoughts on how sustainable the different drivers are as we look to 2012?","Michael B. Polk","Look, I got to tell, some of my favorite businesses are Bill's businesses: the CT&A group, the IP&S group, our Rubbermaid Commercial businesses. These are great businesses where we have differentiated propositions and differentiated capabilities. And they are businesses that are relevant for us around the world. I mean if you look at the emerging markets and the move from rural living to urban living and all the infrastructure build that's going on around those macro trends, these are businesses that can draft on the back of these trends. So they're strategically very important to us. And so you see us investing behind them, as a result. They've got good margins, they've got upside trajectory because they've got better macro trends in the emerging markets and so we're placing bets here. And so that's why you see the growth sustained. And importantly, we're delivering decent growth in a tough environment, even in the developed world, which tells you that we've got great brands in IRWIN and Lenox and Rubbermaid Commercial and Rubbermaid Medical and great products that are differentiated versus competition. Otherwise, we wouldn't have that kind of traction. And as a result, they're doing well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Laura Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First, I just wanted to follow-up on Baby, so Baby and Family. So obviously, great news that you saw some acceleration in the benefits in Asia. But what about the traction of some of the launch activity in Graco in the U.S.? Is it kind of too soon to tell? Does it have any impact on category growth? Or is it still a little bit more of a share benefit that you're seeing?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So great question. I wouldn't get overly excited about our performance in the second half of the year and I'm not. I think we have a lot of work to do here and Christie's got her arms all over this now and we're making all kinds of changes to our leadership teams all around the world. I think the most sustainable news I shared with you is the news on Aprica. We have just a really terrific piece of momentum going on there. And it's driven by the fundamentals. It's great innovation. It's a power of a strong brand in that part of the world. And also very good leadership. The guy who's leading that business, a guy named Tom Brown, is actually now moved -- has moved back to the U.S., and Christie's actually drafted him into really tackling one of her hot spots, which is Europe. So Tom's going to move from Asia to Europe to really get his arms around that business. But I want to be clear about where we are. We have a lot of work to do. We've got -- the innovations that have gone into the market in the U.S. are doing okay and they're supported by a much stronger merchandising program, which is very important to us. Would I say to you that we've got real sustainable traction there yet? No. I think we need to do more in North America and clearly more in Europe before we let the confetti fall from the ceiling. I think it's going to take us 6 to 9 months to really get strategic traction in that part of the world. So we can -- we'll bridge that time period with stronger tactics and better execution. We're having very open dialogues with our sourcing partner, which I think is encouraging and is going to lead to better impact in the marketplace. And we've appointed a new lead on our side in R&D. Really talented young guy that I think is going to drive a more strategic approach in partnership with our supply partner into our Graco business. But Lauren, just be quite clear, I mean we're going to muscle our way through the first half of the year. We've got easier comparisons on that business so the optics will look maybe a little stronger than the fundamentals. And I will just be crystal clear with you guys as we go and let you know where we stand. Importantly, as we go to the new segment reporting that ties to our structure, you'll have better visibility into the P&L and you'll be able to track it a little bit more clearly than you are today. But irrespective of that, just like I exposed our challenge on Decor to you in some detail, I'll bring you along as we make progress.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then if I dare ask one more. Rubbermaid Consumer, last quarter, you guys had said the pricing was coming in but just given the nature of how the products are going to move to retail, it was too early to have much gate on volume impact. So just any update now that's kind of 3 more months in -- 3 more months, excuse me.","Michael B. Polk","Yes, Jeff Heoler, who runs that business for us, is doing a great job. He's actually picking up the Beauty & Style business and the Decor business as part of his new GBU, which is -- we call Home Org & Style [ph]. And that's where the Rubbermaid Consumer business will be consolidated. Again, Q4 was a good quarter for Rubbermaid Consumer. We don't give GBU core sales numbers, but I was pleased with the progress. We made sequential progress from Q3. And this a tough business, but Jeff and his team did a really nice job and we got core growth ahead of the market in Q4.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just trying to reconcile a couple of things on the SG&A line. I think you said you were going to reinvest most of it, or most of the savings in the back half, but at the same point you're expecting full year SG&A to be kind of up on a year-over-year basis and also said you're expecting earnings to be more back-end loaded. So I'm trying to figure out -- it would seem like a big benefit, in terms of lower SG&A in the first half, as you get these savings from the, I guess, sales -- I mean from the workforce reduction or don't reinvest in the back half. So I'm trying to understand what the offsets and how I get there?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So there's a number of moving parts within SG&A. One of the most significant ones is this year, because we fell well short of our targets, our management incentive payouts are going to be quite low. So when we build our business plans for '12, we got to replenish those back to par. So that's going to be an inflow of cost into SG&A. There's also another dynamic in the 2011 numbers that you need to remember. Remember, in Q3 2011, we did a true-up of those incentives. So you've got a one-time low number in Q3 that we've got a lapse. So those are some sort of ins and outs that just have to do with the curiosities of one year versus another year. Look, we expect to spend the renewal money and it will largely flow back into SG&A starting in the second quarter and although the vast majority is flowing back into the second half. Our EPS flow, I think the way to look at our EPS flow -- knowing that, the way to look at our EPS flow is to follow our core sales growth. So I told you that I thought core sales was going to be in the lower end of our guidance range in the first half of the year and strengthening through the back half is a function of us pulling back on merchandising in Europe as we make the SAP EPC conversion and also because the effect of European macros is most pronounced in the first half of the year. Because this trend began in late Q3 into Q4 as the tightening in the U.K -- government's tightening in the U.K. happened and the economy slowed down there and you saw the numbers this week in Q4. The U.K. was in -- had negative GDP growth and there's many out there saying that they think Europe's in recession. I heard one this morning sort of go so far as to lead that discussion. I don't know if that's true or not. It's almost irrelevant. But the majority of that impact's first half. And so with our Decor issue to resolve, with the fact that we're going to have less merchandising in the first half of the year, with the fact that the European macro impact is more severe in the first half of the year, our growth will be skewed, still within the range, but skewed to the lower end in the first half and strengthening in the second. And that's why the EPS sort of flows that way. It's not that material, though.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. On the office market, I mean, from your vantage point, we've seen it's going to bounce along the bottom for now a couple of years. Are you seeing any room for optimism, especially as we move through into the back half of 2012?","Michael B. Polk","On the market itself?","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","On the developed kind of office market.","Michael B. Polk","Europe's going to be troubling in all categories, so I think the office -- our office product categories in Europe, I'm not particularly optimistic about. The good news is we have good ideas flowing into Europe, so I'm confident, whether it's in our labeling business or whether it's in our writing business, and so I'm confident that we will continue to build share and grow those businesses as best we can in a very, very tough and worsening macro environment. In North America, I'm optimistic that if we get our Paper Mate brand going in the right direction, given its share position in North America, that we can contribute between Paper Mate and Sharpie to market development or market growth. So I want to predict that we're able to get market growth going in the right direction in 2012. Bill, not yet, but do I think we have great ideas with InkJoy, with the Sharpie platform coming into this market? And do we have the kind of partnerships building? I spent a day up with Staples in Boston and I think the relationships we're building in those interfaces, we can build more strategic partnerships there that help develop the market. And we can bring insights to that. And increasingly, you should expect us to be doing that. That should, over time, help unlock the market dynamic. But there's a lot of structural issues out there so I wouldn't be too bullish about that in 2012. But our strategic objective with our leadership position ought to be to build markets, not just to drive share shifting between our competition and us. We want to build real, strategic partnerships with our customers. We need to commit to be able to do that. Do I think we've got all the capabilities in place to deliver against that promise today? No. Is that the type of thing that Project Renewal might fund? Yes. When we talk about building integrated customer and channel teams in our U.S. selling organization, what does that mean? Well, it means doing just what I just described. When will we get the benefit of that? Look, I think the reality is we probably won't get the full benefit of those choices and those investments until 2013. And so again, I'd be cautious on any commitments or thoughts I might leave out there about our ability to drive the market today but I would hope, over time, that, that's one of the things that we become more famous for with our retail partners.","Operator","Your next question comes from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a question on basically the structural SG&A versus the brand building SG&A percentages. I think you've given that to us in the past. Where do you see that -- how did it wind up this year? And what is it going to be next year? What do you see?","Michael B. Polk","So Budd, as we've said through the Q3 call, and we're inferring here -- we haven't been that explicit, we saw a shift this year between structural SG&A -- from structural SG&A to strategic SG&A and brand building. And we would expect that dynamic to play forward into 2012. The caveat to that, Budd, is that when I talked about replenishing our management incentive bonuses to par versus significantly below par in 2011, that will result in some inflow into structural SG&A because structural SG&A are people.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Could you put the numbers of that, Mike? I mean, that's kind of what I'm trying to get to. I know it's significant. It's hard to get to on a calculator.","Michael B. Polk","No, I got it. We haven't guided at that level of granularity, Budd. But it's just a decent amount of money that's going to flow back and maybe I can have Nancy connect with you and help you understand all the moving parts so that you can make a judgment about that. But it's not a huge shift. But I think even structural SG&A maybe up as a percentage of revenue in 2012, we'll see. I'm pushing really hard on this because I want to pull the money out of there. And how you do that is you pull people out and you also pull discretionary costs out, because the money -- we talked about the fact that we want to get our brand building investment up to over 8%. Today, I think we ended Q4 just a little bit ahead of our run rate \u2013 2%, 3% [ph] year-to-date. So our historical -- we said 150 basis points is what we needed. We did a little better than our run rate in Q4, despite SG&A being down. I think we did 670 basis points on brand building. So we're moving in the right direction in terms of the investment there, Budd. Next year's going to be an odd one because there's a little bit of money that has to flow back because we want to provide the right level of engagement for the folks that are in that structural bucket. But the principle that we have to look at over time is to make sure we work those costs down over the years so that we get brand building investment back to that 8% threshold that we think is sort of the starting line for brand building investment.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one quick other one. In Tools & Hardware, I think Juan said that you made some additional investments and I think you said they are among -- Bill's businesses are among your favorite businesses and yet you had great sales growth and no basically, earnings growth. I think if I did the numbers right, you probably should've posted maybe another $6 million worth of OpEx. Is that the amount that you reinvested in brand building, in strategic development for that business? Is that approximately the right way to think about it?","Michael B. Polk","Look, Budd, I won't give you a specific answer to the amount, but I'll tell you where the money is flowing to in Bill's group. It's flowing to selling capabilities. So when you think about Bill's trajectory in Asia and his trajectory in Latin America and the fact that we\u2019re able to deliver decent results in a very tough macro environment, Bill's business is not advertising and consumer promotion driven. Bill's business is really driven through the customer interfaces we have in building strategic partnerships and providing insights that help the Home Depots and the Lowe's of the world build their categories. And obviously, we do it to our brands so we'd benefit from that. So the investments are going into that space. The other thing that we've done, and I mentioned Rubbermaid Medical Solutions delivering 80% top line growth, so that clearly has been another place where we put some markers down because we've got great products that are differentiated. We have a really powerful selling proposition against both the choosers, the administrators in the hospital and the users, the nurses of our products. So we're working to improve the capacity of nurses to care, at the same time as optimizing workflow in the hospital environment and creating productive value for the chooser. And so that model is really yielding results but you have to invest in the selling structures to do it. And we invested both in selling structures in Asia on IP&S, which is a great source of traction, a great beautiful margin business. The operating margin in the business is amongst the highest in my total portfolio. And also, the capital investment we put increased capacity in that business to be able to supply demand. Some of the CapEx step-up that you see went to support investment in our East Long Meadow facility to enable us to be able to service the demand we're generating with the selling expense. So this is a source of funds business for us and it will continue to be in the context of the strategy we'll lay out over the coming weeks and months.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So basically, just to make sure I understand it then, you're basically saying the additional investment is people and people mean salaries and salaries continue?","Michael B. Polk","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering, just now that you've been at the company a little bit longer, if you could share any other insights or impressions that you have? I mean, you've alluded to capabilities in some areas and still needing to have capabilities. And I remember under previous management, there was a marketing executive who had provided a score sheet of marketing capabilities and sort of scoring the firm's capabilities in certain areas. Is that an idea you embrace and how's that score sheet coming along? Like maybe you could just talk about some of those things.","Michael B. Polk","I think, Linda, the principle behind what you just mentioned is important. What you don't measure, you don't improve. Let me just talk to these -- the capabilities a bit and then I'll come back to where I think we are. What we're building is a company that has 2 towering capabilities of equal stature. One, that Mark Tesler really led and started, which is the marketing capabilities and embedding a brand-led strategy into the company, building an innovation agenda that is managed in a disciplined way across the 13 different GBUs that we've had up until this conversion we're making. And so that's one of the towering capabilities. The other towering capability of equal stature, I think, is an opportunity for us and that's the selling capabilities and building effectively a powerhouse executional company. And if you've got great ideas and great concepts coming through your marketing capabilities and you build an operational powerhouse on your selling and supply chain side, you get a very potent combination. Today, I'd say our strength is in the marketing side. And then when we have pockets of brilliance in the selling side, but we don't have an even capability there. And I think there's opportunity to strengthen that, not only in the emerging markets where we're nascent, but as importantly, in the developed world. So as you think about us and as I lay out our agenda for the company, you should hear more evidence of that. Then maybe you have up until this point. In terms of score-carding where we are, I think our marketing capability is stronger than our capabilities -- our strategic selling capabilities. That's why we're building and deploying it cross functionally, integrated, customer and channel development teams as part of Project Renewal in the U.S. But do I think our marketing capabilities are where they need to be for the long term? No. I think there's opportunity there. Ted Woehrle has done a fantastic job, but I think if he were on the phone today, he'd tell you it's a work in progress. And from my perspective, that's great because that's upside potential as we develop those capabilities.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just tell us like what percentage you are complete with Project Renewal? I know the GBUs have already been flattened, but in terms of personnel decisions and things like that.","Michael B. Polk","Yes, we're moving quickly but I want to make sure we move thoroughly. And so we've got the architecture in the GBUs in place at the top of those GBUs. We're in the midst of the selling redesign work that I've alluded to in the U.S. We\u2019ve got -- we've announced the closure of our Rubbermaid Consumer factory, but we haven't implemented that. We've announced a couple of D.C. closures, again, but we haven't implemented that. So these things take some time to execute and you have to manage them in the right way. So there's still a ways to go in terms of the follow-through around that. On the people side and headquarters, most of that's behind us. So if I were going to rough it, I'd say probably, jeez, I'd say 25% of the -- 30% of the choices have been made. The money will start flowing in a differentiated way from that but it flows in an increasing way, Q1, Q2, Q3. So -- and some of it in Q4 because some of the big choices we made are more expensive. People choices we made were executed in Q4. But I mean, I think that's the way to think about it because the closure of that factory is a pretty big ticket item. The operational stuff we said was probably about 30% of the overall program and that comes late in 2012. All the people-related choices come in -- probably get done towards the month of July of 2012.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great . That's really helpful. And then just back to Europe. So SAP in April, what percentage of the total business will be on SAP and running when that's done?","Juan R. Figuereo","All of the European business will be on SAP once it's up and running.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","How about the total company?","Juan R. Figuereo","We would have Latin America and APAC to go. So that would be close to 80% of the company.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then when do you get rid of the legacy systems? Because if I'm not mistaken, there is a lot of, sort of, overlapping costs between keeping the legacy up and then putting SAP on. So when do you kind of get that step change cut over?","Juan R. Figuereo","That's probably going to be after 2013, because after Europe, we'll still have APAC and Latin America to do.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just to get a -- I'm sorry there's a lot of questions, but the tax rate for the year. I know, obviously, when you go to the EPC, that should be sort of the step change in the tax rate as well. Have you given guidance on the full year tax rate? And how much of that is impacted by EPC?","Juan R. Figuereo","Yes. We said, Bill, that the tax rate is going to be about flat for the year, which is a good thing if you take into account that we had some benefits in Q4. Some of those benefits' driven by the improved profitability in Europe so it's good news that we have more profit. So some of those benefits that were locked in the balance sheet, we're now being able to access. But they relate to the structuring for EPC, not the ongoing benefits of EPC. So once EPC goes live in April of next year, we begin to capture the benefits, I'd say, beginning in May and those become structurally lower rate. So basically, flat to this year, but taking into account that this year was -- particularly because the Q4, was helped by some of the prep work for EPC.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then 2 more quick ones, I promise. The health of the European distributors. I know last time, the 2008 downturn, there was an issue because a lot of distributors were overlevered and they kind of raced to get rid of inventory. So the market is what the market is, but how would you describe the health of your distribution partners?","Michael B. Polk","Look, the business that I would -- that I think we see that first is in our Tools & Hardware business. So far, so good, despite a very difficult environment, but I think we have to be -- we have to plan for a worse environment and hope for something better. But that's the one -- that's sort of the lead indicator that we'll watch, those categories.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And then the last one, I promise, is just -- I know Walmart is specifically, or we can say, your largest customer. The comps are obviously really easy in the front half of the year and we saw some big year-over-year swings as Walmart's percentage of sales in the front half of last year. I mean, does that seem like that relationship is largely repaired?","Michael B. Polk","Yes, I mean I think -- I'm very optimistic about our relationship with Walmart. I think the thing that drove the front half challenges in 2011 was actually their philosophy with respect to their merchandising approach. And on the full year, we ended up at around 11%, despite that slow start. So they represented about 11% of our total revenue. So the relationship was never an issue. That was a strategic choice that impacted the activity. And we have good relationships with these guys. They're people we've known for a long time, I've known for a long time in a whole variety of different ways. And we have the type of dialogue with them that if they're not happy with us or we're not happy with them, it's shared quite transparently. And we have the kind of relationships where we can get to a constructive solution. But our numbers look -- are looking fine with them and our Q4 numbers with them were back to sort of historical levels, and as I mentioned, the full year at 11%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Ferrara with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just quickly on the dividend -- I know we ask about it every quarter. Is raising the dividend still contingent upon on S&P upgrade? Because it sounds like you may have more discretion from the board to make that decision. And I guess, is 30% to 35% payout ratio still how you're thinking about it?","Michael B. Polk","Look, we -- that is how we're thinking about it. We want to get back to that level of dividend payout ratio. We believe we're going to have the flexibility to get back there. Of course, it is the board's discretion. Our capital priorities, we've been pretty clear about. We're going to opportunistically leverage the share repurchase program but job one is to put the money into the business. We need to get on with our strategic agenda. But I think we're going to have the flexibility to provide value back to shareholders in a variety of different ways, through top line growth and margin improvement, through continuing to work on working capital such that we free up cash to be able to have more flexibility. So I think we're going to -- this is a very cash generative business and that's -- with still plenty of opportunities left in working capital. So I can't give you a specific moment in time when we'll be able to get in there. We increased the dividend by 60% in 2011 and I hope we can find a path to being able to do the same sometime soon.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But are you guys waiting for that S&P upgrade to do it?","Michael B. Polk","It's not contingent upon that. That's not how we think about it. I think we're going to be able to get everything done we want to get done, and one of our priorities is to get the dividend payout ratio to more competitive levels. And of course, we want to get our leverage ratios to where we think the optimal capital structure is. So I think we can do both in a very reasonable amount of time.","Juan R. Figuereo","Yes, I would agree with that. I mean we have been prioritizing debt repayments because of the leverage ratio. I think we're making really good progress. We're going to be where we want to be in the second half of next year. The board has expressed a desire to get to 30% to 35%, so that would imply kind of consistent increases in the dividend and I don't see anything that will keep us from doing that.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's really helpful. And on the same kind of cash topic. So CapEx at $200 million to $225 million. That's the highest number, I guess, in 9 years and I know you're definitely telegraphing need for investment. But I guess, can you just talk a bit about what the bigger items are that may be driving that for next year?","Michael B. Polk","Look, I mean, I talked to -- I think, Chris, the most strategic piece of this, obviously, is SAP but the other strategic piece is investing in capacity in IP&S. So being able to service the demand that we're creating there is an important priority for us in 2011. We put a fair amount of investment into our East Long Meadow, Massachusetts facility in order to be able to step up our growth. And it's playing out beautifully. I mean, the team have done a fantastic job there and I think there's -- that we want to make sure we've got the capacity to be able to service all the demand we intend to create. We're strengthening our selling systems in Southeast Asia and in China. I was actually in a metal cutting shop outside of Shenzhen at the beginning of December with Rich and his team, and we're making good progress there. But there's a lot of growth to be had. So we're going to continue to make those types of investments to be able to capitalize on the potential of our businesses. And obviously, we need to get the systems infrastructure in place to be able to have a greater clarity and transparency into the cost within our business and the working capital of our business and that's what SAP is going to enable for us.","Juan R. Figuereo","Just let me add a couple of data points. The operating groups, the CapEx as a percentage of net sales, was about 2.4%. That's higher than the ongoing rate because of the investments that Mike alluded to. There's almost close to $40 million in investments, either in capacity, selling systems or in the case of Decor, the size-in-store machines. The rest is related to SAP and the work in SAP EPC in Europe.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. That's really helpful. And I guess just one last. Mike, getting back to, I guess, Phase 1 of what you were talking about around delivering what you say you will, all right. 2012 is your first set of guidance as CEO here and you definitely spend a lot of time talking about rebuilding that credibility. So I guess the context you gave around earnings, is that -- look, Europe's a drag, FX is a drag. You seem like you're holding back some of the restructuring reinvestments until the back half to make sure the range is okay. So I guess the question is: Do you feel comfortable that you got it conservatively enough, understanding that the portfolio kind of have -- had the ability in the past to have things sneak up on you a little bit? I guess you feel comfortable there.","Michael B. Polk","Look, I feel comfortable, but that's not to say that we're where we want to be from an operational perspective. I mean, the Decor example's just another point of evidence. Now every business has issues that crop up. I've made a commitment to you guys to be very transparent about them. So when we have them, we talk about them so that you have greater visibility into the business. But do I think we're where we want to be with respect to our performance relative to our ambition? Not yet. I think that's something that's still in front of us. So we talk, as a leadership team, about building an operational powerhouse that is -- in as a complimentary capability to our strategic development thinking in our brands and in our categories. That's an aspiration. That's not where we are today. So I think we have more to do. Do I feel like we've called the guidance in a way that can deal with the sort of error band that's inherently in this business around the midpoint? Yes, absolutely. Six months in, and unfortunately, for everybody, I look at every number. And I'm feeling like we've called it in the right place, right in the middle of the range. As I said, it's a balanced range given what we know today, given the volatility in the markets today. That's where I would call it. And we're on to kind of focusing on delivery here. I think the first stage of the strategic agenda and the last phase of the delivery agenda, they overlap with each other. I think it's going to take us a while to build back our credibility. I think we got an entire year, at least, of doing what we say we're going to do. That will be 6 quarters. If we can string together 6 quarters, then we can maybe take a breath. But of course, any quarter you step back and you miss, you might as well go back to go. It's like Monopoly, you go to jail. So I don't want to land, I don't want to roll the dice and land in that little cell and end up back in jail and not collect $200 at the start. So it's an everyday thing, like I said. I don't think I'll ever declare success, quite frankly, Chris, on the delivery stage because I think it's the wrong message to send into the business. So there's always things you can do better. I think as we go along, we'll have more of our time freed up as we get more confidence and more capacity to do exactly what we say we're going to do to spend on unlocking the future. And that's -- I hope to shift the balance of our energy towards that, to find more balance in our time towards that as we go through 2012. And I know that's a very vague, abstract answer to your question, but that's the best I can do at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Could you tell us what you think the real opportunity in working capital improvement is? How much you believe you can improve cash conversion? And what metrics you're targeting?","Michael B. Polk","I think the opportunity is more than my guys are forecasting. So that's a message for my team. But they are forecasting improvement this year, but I think there's more to be had. But Juan, why don't you tackle that one?","Juan R. Figuereo","Yes, we have internal targets, Connie, which we'd rather keep aspirational and private for now. But we're committed to consistent improvement. You saw that we took 2 days out of receivables. We took one day out of inventories and that is in a year when we're having to build some buffer stock, where plants shut down and the Europe go live that will put up more pressure on the inventory. We gave back a day in payables. So we'll get that back. The thing is that we are putting in place the process improvement that will deliver consistent improvement in working capital. So we decreased it a little bit this year -- in a year where the pressure was going the opposite way, and we feel confident that this should continue.","Michael B. Polk","Connie, I think SAP in Europe will help. When I look at our working capital in Europe, I'm not -- I think that's a big opportunity in getting through that -- the window of conversion and then being able to put a front end on the system so that we can see that all the costs in our business model in Europe, both in the P&L and also in working capital, that's going to be an enabler. I think there's more work to be done in the U.S. We need to make it very visible every day, like all the other metrics in the P&L are. I hesitate to give you a number but it's something that is on my personal priority list and Juan's personal priority list to kind of work on in 2012 and make meaningful progress on.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. A follow-up, again, on the tax rates. I mean the tax rate in 2011 was down about 250 basis points, 270 from 2010, with most of the improvement in the fourth quarter, although the rates were better in the first 3 quarters. This just can't all be Europe, or is it? And if it's not, what else is going on? And then also, why does the fourth quarter tax rate tend to be lower than the rest of the year?","Juan R. Figuereo","Most of the improvement in the fourth quarter is related to Europe, Connie. And there are 2 sources. I'll put them in 2 buckets. One is the unlocking of the tax operating losses from the improved profitability in Europe, right? Because we're making more money and now we can benefit losses that we were unable to benefit in the past. And you don't really know that until you basically close the books and look at it legal entity by legal entity. The other bucket is as we prepare for EPC and we make changes in the legal entity's structure, there are tax planning opportunities that present themselves. And our tax team was aggressive to take full advantage of them. Those are nonrecurring because they are related to the structure itself and at the ongoing profitability. But they are real money. So they're real, they came through. So that answers that part. The other about the tax rate, the tax rate will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter because there are always discrete items and it's hard to predict when those come. Last year, there was a big one that was the R&D credit, which would have benefited Q1, and that law was retroactively passed by Congress in Q4. So all of that, that would have been recognized in the first 3 quarters was recognized in one quarter. So those kinds of things caused the variability in the tax rate.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And one final question, if I could, on the quarterly flow. Just from the comments you've made, it seems to me that second quarter earnings are likely to decline if sales shift in Europe from Q2 to Q1, if the merchandising is pulled while SAP is going in.","Michael B. Polk","There is that dynamic. I think the best way to look at our health as a company is to look at the first half as a whole because you're going to have that Q1, Q2 flip, which is unfortunate, and we'll have to be talking about it for a whole another year. But it is what it is and we need to do that to protect the business in April. It's a big and complicated transition where we're leading. Is it going to be negative in Q2? Could be. I hope not. I don't want to capitulate yet, but that's the type of thing that we're going to arm wrestle our way through with the business teams. But your observation is right on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess I just have a couple of questions. One, I guess I want to just go to Europe. And thinking about it, I know long-term target has always been that 10% margin. So as we think about Europe's weakening sales, and hopefully it's only one year, and maybe by 2013, we can start to see improvement, but you do have some of the European restructuring savings coming through. I was just wondering how you think about managing that business next year and maybe putting some color around the context of getting back to that goal of 10% margin?","Michael B. Polk","Look, I think the thing that's going to determine how well we do is getting back to growth in Europe. But growth not at any cost, growth -- profitable growth. When we talk at CAGNY, we'll talk about the portions of our portfolio that are most leverageable in those geographies, any portfolio of strategies, the intersection of geography and category. And we're looking to build strong sales, geographic and category sales. So you talking about Europe as a whole is probably not the right way for us to talk about our agenda going forward. But in broad terms, the thing that's going to really stabilize Europe and get us on to sustainable improvement in the business there will be getting back to growth. And that's going to be very, very difficult in the macro environment next year. But again, I'm not willing to capitulate at this point, but the plan doesn't assume. In fact, the plan assumes a worsening growth performance there. What's the end game? What's the operating -- normalized operating margin end game for EMEA? Don't know. I wouldn't be happy if we stayed where we are. I think in a better macro environment, we ought to be -- and in general, in the developed world, we ought to be able to fuel some of the investments we want to make and broadening our geographic footprint on the back of our developed world markets to include Western Europe. Next year, that's unlikely to be possible. But strategically, should we expect that out of our European business, to be able to grow ahead of the markets and make progress year in, year out and delivering normalized operating margin increases? Yes. Do we have all of it, all the plans lined out to achieve that yet? No. But is that the mile markers that I hold out for that business? Yes.","Juan R. Figuereo","And we think that's the right aspiration to have because, again, with increased profitability in Europe on the OI level and the tax advantage structure around it, the flow-through of that business will have increased considerably from what it was just a year or so ago.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that\u2019s a good answer. And just second, I guess thinking about the 2 to 3 core sales for the year. How do you look at it in terms of where you need sell-through in categories as opposed to where you're getting incremental distribution in 2011? We saw some good points of incremental distribution that you talked about, whether it's the J.C. Penney business, et cetera. So when you think about that 2 to 3 from that perspective, can you kind of just add a little color to that?","Michael B. Polk","I think -- look, when we think about the emerging markets, I think you should think about it as expanding our footprint in trying to lock down some of the initial wins that we've got. So Sharpie and Paper Mate in Brazil, for example, is going to be a combination of both. If you look at our business in that geography on those brands, we've got the first big step forward, which is landing all the big direct buying accounts. But if you look at the northern part of Brazil, there are fewer of those -- the penetration of those accounts into that part of the country is less and so you have to sort of work it street by street, distributor by distributor. In a place like Brazil, on a category like writing and creative expression, we'll get a combination of both. I expect to get increased sell-through in the initial distribution that we got in Brazil, and we're going to continue to broaden distribution through the distributors into the smaller retailers in the Northeast and the northern part of Brazil as we build the business case for our brands to those distributors. So that's an example of what can happen in the real world. We have a blend of those opportunities all over the world, even in the U.S. So I continue to believe that our Goody brand has plenty of opportunity to broaden distribution, not just sell-through. I walk into many stores and I see our competitor with a better distribution footprint than us. So I think we continue to have both types of opportunities. Our marketing programming and our brand building activity in a place like the U.S. is focused primarily on driving increased consumption on the distribution we've got. And then our selling activities are focused on broadening the distribution footprint. So I don't think there's one answer. I think it's a blend by geography, different by business. And we have to approach it that way and at that granular level.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Did you calculate what the impact, I guess, of the change in Q1 Western Europe and also some of the challenges with Decor? What that would be to total year of sales?","Michael B. Polk","Well, they're in our guidance. So we've -- that's how we -- I said to you guys that our full year guidance is below our second half run rate and those are the 2 drivers of that core sales step-down and so that the macros in Europe, there's the Decor issue and then there's also just the reality of what we have to do to manage the transition in Europe with less merchandising in our European business in the first half of the year. Those are the key things. And then the recovery on Decor. And that's how we end up in the range we're in. So it's been modeled pretty well, I think. It's as best as you can do with the volatility in the markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","No, that's fair. And just one last question and then I'll jump off. Just where you have taken pricing, or where pricing was going in for 2012? I think one of the things that are people talking about now is who's taking pricing and who's following? So I was just wondering if you could talk maybe about that type of dynamic and the price gaps that out there? And how comfortable you feel with you versus your competition on the shelf right now? Maybe really focus more obviously on developed markets.","Michael B. Polk","Yes, sure. Look, I think this is a category by category answer as well, but let me just start at a macro level. We did achieve the pricing we had built into our gross margin objectives. Our issues on gross margin in Q4 were not pricing related. They were cost of failure related and a little bit of mix. And we have pricing built into 2012 as well in our gross margin assumptions. We have the rollover effect of the pricing actions we took in 2011 and we have some new pricing as well in 2012. In many categories, I don't think it's going to be an issue to land that pricing, in part because we go through this process of line reviews every year and most of that's behind us. There are some businesses where the pricing every day is a critical issue. Rubbermaid Consumer's a great example of that in the U.S. business, particularly in the container segment and in the food and bev segment. And so that's where Jeff has to manage that dynamic every day. He's got a sort of pricing principles relative to competition that he's managing to. Those are the guardrails on his business. He knows what kind of premium he can afford to have without losing consumers. And he manages to that and he's empowered to manage that. So I'm not sitting there waiting for him to send me a note to approve a price increase or price decrease. He's got to manage that every day and maintain competitiveness in that category. That category is an example of a more intense category with respect to pricing. And there are a couple of them like that. Everyday Writing -- in some of the segments of Everyday Writing, we have that same dynamic. And Ben Gadbois, who runs that business, he's -- that's his call. He needs to make those real-time. Of course, he's got margin objectives as well, so every one of those choices comes with a trade-off somewhere else, either more productivity or him playing the mix differently, because he's got to deliver his margin numbers as well. But there\u2019s certain portions of our portfolio where relative pricing to competition's essential, and there's other portions of portfolio where it's less of a key driver. And each one of our leaders understands the different levers to pull for the outcomes we're seeking and they're empowered to pursue them, and I'm looking at their delivery and at the numbers and challenging that, but the decision points differ in the organization.","Michael B. Polk","Thank you for the questions. I think they're really helpful. As I said at the beginning of the call, we view Q4 as a solid quarter. It's another step in the progression we believe we need to make. So progress, much more to do, lots of excitement within the business, lots of change within the business, but building confidence that we can be the kind of company you can count on to do what we say we're going to do and also that we can build Newell Rubbermaid into a bigger, faster growing, more profitable, more global company. So thanks so much, and I look forward to seeing many of you at CAGNY.

After a brief discussion by management, we will open up the call for questions. In order to stay within the time schedule for the call, please limit yourself to one question during the Q&A session.","As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellbrands.com on the Investor Relations home page under Events & Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download.","I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, SVP of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell ","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s fourth quarter conference call. On the line with me today are Mike Polk, Newell's Chief Executive Officer and Ralph Nicoletti, our Chief Financial Officer who will discuss the company\u2019s financial results and management\u2019s outlook for 2018.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to point out that we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including but not limited to core sales and normalized EPS. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in quarters with GAAP in today\u2019s press release and in the slide presentation on the investor relations section of our website at newellbrands.com. ","Let me remind you also that we will include forward looking statements in today\u2019s discussion. Actual results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties which are described in our press release and in the risk factor section of our filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements.","Thank you. And I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mike.","Michael Polk ","Thank you. Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Our fourth quarter performance was in line with the preliminary results announced on January 25th. With a particularly strong outcome on operating cash flow, we have work to do in some other metrics. The entire board and management team recognize what needs to be done and we\u2019ve taken this step of decisive actions designed to deliver the results and value shareholders expect. ","2017 was a transformational year for Newell Brands. We\u2019ve restructured the company from 32 discreet business units to 15 operating division. When coupled with procurement benefits, this resulted in over $350 million in savings and synergies that have flowed to the P&L. We've broadened our competitively advantaged design and innovation capability and we've tripled the value of the innovation funnel on the legacy Jarden businesses with ideas that will begin to flow the market in the second half of 2018. ","We invested the scale to our new enterprise wide e-commerce division opening our e-commerce offices in the talent rich New York metro area. This new team doubled the budgeted growth rate at our leading e-commerce retail partner and is already established a profitable $1.6 billion global e-commerce business that grew over 25% this year. ","In 2017, we further sharpen the portfolio completing three bolt-on acquisitions in 8 divestitures which generated a combined EBITDA multiple of 12 times. We used the net proceeds from these divestitures in combination with our over $900 million in operating cash flow to repay $1.4 billion in debt. ","At the same time, we've returned over $580 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Despite significant disruption in the U.S. retail landscape that is encumbered the selling of our products, the consumer macros have strengthened through the year and as the growth rate in our markets. ","In the U.S., we increased market shares by 71 basis points resulting in sell out growth of 3.5% for the full year. Our U.S. market share growth was broad-based with share growth of 22 basis points on fresh preserving, 40 basis points on beverage containers, 55 basis points on writing excluding glue, 77 basis points on vacuum sealing, 109 basis points on outdoor and recreation equipment, 180 basis points on food storage, 193 basis points on baby care, 273 basis points on home fragrance, 300 basis points on fishing, 418 basis points on team sports and really, really strong increases on glue from sign. ","Consumer takeaway has accelerated through the year, from 1.5% sell out in the first half to 3.5% growth in Q3 and nearly 5% growth in Q4. Despite these good results, selling in the second half of the year was exceptionally choppy. For the most part, the gap between sell out and selling has been event driven and is transitory. If we come through the first half of 2018, we should move past the disruptions we've experienced since September. ","Core sales in the fourth quarter would have been roughly flat versus prior year had it not been for two customer category sales. First on baby, invoice sales at our largest baby gear customer were down nearly 45% versus prior year related to inventory liquidation in advance of their Chapter 11 store closures which are slated for Q1 and Q2, 2018. ","And second, on writing, invoice sales at our third largest customer were down over 55% related to a trade dispute we hope to resolve by the second quarter of 2018. These specific issues were compounded by general inventory liquidation across a broader set of customers. ","While we've taken pricing to recover hurricane related resin and transportation inflation, the majority of these price increases did not take effect until early 2018, and as a result, pricing continued to have a negative effect on net sales and margins. Margins were affected also by steps we took to reduce inventories, including the reduction of production line time in writing, foods and commercial products. We made a cautious decision to prioritize cash generation and working capital reduction, ahead of our other key performance metrics and that helped in our delivery of nearly $1 billion of cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter. ","I am pleased with the way the organization response to the call to reduce working capital and increase cash. This choice enables higher than expected repayment of debt in the fourth quarter. Since the completion of the Jarden transaction, we have now repaid $3.4 billion of debt including $1.4 billion in 2017. ","So, 2017 has been a transformational year for Newell Brands, a year of transition from both the Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden legacy models to a new Newell Brands model. A year of significant change in organization, operating models, leadership and ways of working. Changes that are now one year old with organizations and leadership teams just recently into a familiar rhythm of working. Of course, all of this has happened during a period of disruption in segments of the US retail landscape that were particularly expose to given our category footprint. ","While our second half commercial outcomes did not live up to internal and external expectations, we have put in place a new organization with a strengthened set of capabilities that will outperform our sub-scale single category competition over time. ","Our capabilities in e-commerce, innovation and design are yielding results and will deliver value to shareholders that other approaches simply cannot and will not deliver organically. I say this with the sense of certainty based on my 35 years of consumer goods experience in all kinds of different organization models, and based on my teams proven track record, of strengthening the financial performance of the companies we have worked at. ","We believe sustained margin development and cash generation is dependent on building leading brands with differentiated value prepositions, winning with winning customers and in growing channels. And driving cost out of the business to provide both the fuel for growth and the funds for margin development.","With that, let me now hand the line over to Ralph, for a more detailed discussion of 2017 results and then I'll return to provide more perspectives surrounding our outlook for 2018 and our plan to accelerate the transformation of the company. ","Ralph Nicoletti ","Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Our full year 2017 results were in line with the pre-announcement on January 25. During the fourth quarter, our core sales declined 1.9%, largely due to temporary customer disruptions in Baby and Writing, while normalized EPS came in at $0.68 as compared to normalized EPS of $0.80 from the year ago period. Please note, the year ago figure includes approximately $70 million of pretax income associated with divestitures that were completed earlier this year. ","Our focus on cash flow delivery in the quarter drove solid results, as the business generated $990 million in operating cash flow, compared with $992 million in the prior year due largely to favorable working capital movements. ","Turning to the details, fourth quarter reported net sales were $3.7 billion, a 9.5% decline versus last year, driven by divestitures net of acquisitions as well as the 1.9% decline in core sales. Foreign exchange was a tailwind.","Reported gross margin was 32.8% compared with 36.8% in the prior year, while normalized gross margin was 33% compared with 37.2% last year. The $33 million benefit from synergies and cost savings that was recognized in cost of goods sold was more than offset by several factors, unfavorable net pricing and mix primarily in writing, food and appliances, commodity and transportation cost inflation, and reduced fixed cost absorption driven by our focus on reducing inventories. We have begun to take pricing actions to help offset the impact of inflation.","Reported SG&A expense of $876 million represented 23.4% of sales as compared to last year's ratio of 23.6%.","Normalized SG&A expense was $735 million, or 19.6% of sales versus 20.8% of sales in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decline in the SG&A to sales ratio reflects the $42 million benefit from the cost synergies and Renewal savings, lower incentive compensation expense, which more than offset the impact of incremental investments behind e-commerce.","Reported operating margin was 8.6% of sales compared with 12.4% in the prior year. Normalized operating margin was 13.4% compared to 16.3% in the prior year. Net interest expense of $116 million was below last year's level of $124 million, reflecting the lower debt balance as we paid down $1.4 billion of debt during 2017.","The reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was a benefit of 715% compared to an expense of 58% in the year ago period, reflecting a one-time net tax benefit of $1.4 billion stemming from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S. ","The major components of this noncash tax benefit include the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities at a new 21% rate versus 35% previously, which resulted in a benefit of $1.5 billion, which is partially offset by a one-time transition tax expense of $108 million related to the mandatory repatriation tax on historical foreign earnings that have not been repatriated to the U.S.","The normalized tax rate was 12% compared with 29.8% in the previous year, primarily due to a favorable geographic mix of income and discrete tax planning benefits.","For 2018, we anticipate tax rate of 20% to 21% which reflects the benefit from the tax reform as well as our tax planning work. We repurchased 5 million shares and ended the fourth quarter with 489 million dilutes shares outstanding as compared to 486 million in the prior year with the year-over-year increase coming from the shares issued in early July as part of the resolution of the central law suites. Reported earnings per share were $3.38 versus $0.34 last year. Normalized earnings per share were $0.68 compared with $0.80 last year.","Shifting gears to our segment results, net sales in our Live segment came in at $1.72 billion, increasing 2.7% relative to the year ago period. Core sales fell 1.8% as declines on Appliances and Baby more than offset growth in Home Fragrance and Fresh Preserving. In Baby, we expect the impact from inventory destocking by a leading baby retailer related to their reorganization proceedings to continue in the first half of 2018 as the retailer works of inventory issues caused by significant reduction in store count as it has been publicly announced.","Next sales for the Learn segment, were $551 million and 8.9% year-over-year decline. Core sales contracted 9.7% as low single-digit growth in Jostens was offset by a double-digit decline in the Writing segment, which is primarily driven by retailer inventory destocking in the office superstore and distributive channels and a significant trade terms dispute with one of Writing\u2019s large customers in the U.S.","For the Work segment, net sales were $705 million, representing a 3% decline year-over-year. Core sales decreased 1.2% as growth in Waddington and Safety & Security was more than offset by lower sales in the Consumer and Commercial solutions business. ","Net sales for the Play segment were $563 million which represent a 6.6% increase versus the prior year. Core sales grew 5.4% driven by growth in Outdoor & Recreation division, reflecting strong performance in Coleman, Contigo and Marmot.","Net sales for the Other segment were $198 million as compared to $596 million in the prior year with the year-over-year decline reflecting the divestitures, which were completed earlier in 2017. Core sales were down 0.8% as growth in the Process Solutions business was offset by weakness in Home & Family. Importantly, the business generated $990 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, about even with the year ago period, despite the divestitures. ","Although still early days, we\u2019re pleased with the responsiveness of the business towards working capital improvement, particularly on inventories which declined about $350 million from the end of the third quarter. We expect to make progress on working capital during 2018.","During the fourth quarter, we returned $264 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Mike.","Michael Polk","Thanks, Ralph. This morning, we reaffirmed our initial guidance for 2018, which calls for normalized earnings per share in the range of $2.65 to $2.85 and operating cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.45 billion. We also provided a net sales guidance range for 2018 from $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion. ","This net sales range is provided using the new 2018 revenue recognition standards. Importantly, our current forecast assumes continued ownership of all businesses for the entire calendar year. Our guidance also assumes our leading baby customer executes its restructuring plans as publicly announced with no further weakening of its financial condition, then we resolve our differences with our third largest writing customer in the second quarter of 2018. We expect both Baby and Writing to have negative core sales growth in the first half of the year.","We also expect our first half results to sequentially improve from Q1 to Q2, with Q1, 2018 results roughly in line with the quarter, just reported. Our guidance assumes the divergence between selling and sell out growth is transitory and returns to more typical levels in the second half of 2018 with the first half negatively impacted by the dynamics in baby and writing and the lapping of the 2017 Slime pipeline fill in the second quarter. ","Our guidance assumes an improvement in gross margin and operating margin with positive price in about $275 million in incremental savings and synergies more than offsetting bonus replenishment and inflation in sourced finished goods resin and transportation. We expect operating cash flow to increase substantially driven by further working capital improvement about a 50% reduction in normalized cash bonus payments partially offset by higher cash taxes related to the deferral some 2017 taxes into 2018. ","The most significant risk to our 2018 outlook relates to the US retail landscape and the financial help for our leading baby gear customer. We\u2019re committed to building a leading consumer goods company that delivers strong result in significant value for our shareholders. On January 25th, we announced our plans to accelerate the transformation of the company. The Board has expressed unanimous support from management\u2019s recommendation to explore strategic alternatives with the balance of our commercial industrial is in our smaller consumer businesses. ","The accelerated transformation of the company will result in a simpler, faster and stronger Newell brands. We will create an $11 billion portfolio of leading consumer brands with the entire portfolio responsive to our advantage to capabilities in design, innovation and e-commerce. It will be a portfolio that maintains the scale advantage filled through the Jarden acquisition and our consumer channels with the business that\u2019s roughly twice the size of legacy new rubber made with a substantially higher operating margin of nearly 15%. ","Importantly, the proposed portfolio simplification will significantly reduce operations complexity lowering our global factory, warehouse and customer footprints that add up 50% eliminating virtually all of the unbranded businesses in all major cyclical businesses. Consolidating nearly 80% of our global sales on two ERP platforms by the end of 2019 from over 30 today and dramatically reducing a resin exposure. ","We do not expect to lose more than $50 million of the remaining synergies and savings to be delivered and expect any potential dis-synergies resulting from the divestitures to be offset by an additional savings opportunity unlocked by the simplification. So, optimizing the portfolio will not compromise our ability to deliver the remaining synergies and savings committed to as part of the Jarden transaction. ","We expect to generate about $6 billion in after tax proceeds and the transformation program with roughly two thirds of the proceeds to be used to delever the balance sheet to just below three times leverage and sufficient capital available to help offset the loss of earnings associated with the divestitures. ","The business is we\u2019re looking to potentially exit high quality franchises with good teams consistently do not fit our consumer branded goods business model and would play more of strategic role to others. Multiples in the commercial and industrial space are quite high, as evidenced by roughly 13 times multiples we achieved on the divestiture of our tool business last year. The processes associated with actioning the portfolio changes are under consideration have begun, and there has been substantial interest expressed. ","Despite the challenges in our business, we believe we're on the right track. Our confidence is grounded in the knowledge that we have a leading portfolio of brands, advantaged capabilities in an innovation and design with the commercial impact in the legacy Jarden brands still to come. We have a peer group leading e-commerce organization that will only be getting stronger in 2018. ","We have a long list of opportunities for core distribution and international deployment and the pipeline of synergies and savings that are largely underserved by our actions to reshape the portfolio. And as importantly we have a forward-looking seasoned and proven consumer goods leadership team that's adapting our playbook to the current market realities. We could not be more committed and driven to deliver the transformative value creation story that's inherent in Newell brands. ","Before I turn to Q&A, I would like to briefly comment on the recent development. As many of you are aware, Starboard Value recently notified us of its intention to nominate 10 director candidates for stay in for election the Newell brands board of directors at our 2019 annual meeting. Our nominating governance committee has a formal process in place to review all nominees and is considering the nominations as part of this process. ","As you've heard today, and as you'll hear more about at CAGNY next week, we have a clear plan in place to drive value. The accelerated transformation strategy is designed to enable us to improve our operational performance and accelerate capital allocation optionality. We continue to take actions that are in the best interest of our shareholders and enable us to maximize shareholders value. ","I won't be able to provide more commentary on this today. I would appreciate your understanding with that that you focus your questions on the topics we can't discuss, earnings results and our transformation strategy. ","With that, let me pass the line back to the operator to help facilitate questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. ","Steve Powers","Great, thanks good morning. How are you? Maybe we can just start by taking just a step back and revisiting the logic of the plans announced on the 25 January. I guess just from the outside it seems a fairly strong departure from where it's felt. We were heading even just exiting the third quarter. So, some more comments on the logic, the process and the timeline that led you to decision specifically on the asset sales decision. ","And I guess related to that, just some more color on how confident you are in achieving the valuations implied in the $6 billion after-tax leakage proceeds estimates. I think that implies sales prices of 11-12 times to EBITDA. So just your confidence there. ","And then finally any color on what if you could, any color on what you expect core sales growth and ideally free cash flow to be next year on a pro forma basis, in other words excluding the assets that are now effectively held-for-sale. Thank you. ","Michael Polk ","Steve that's a lot of questions, but I'll take them one at a time. The actions on portfolio are actually the continuation of theme, if you go all the way back to 2011 and look at the choices, my team and I have made on legacy Newell Rubbermaid and the choices through 2017 into 2018, you see this thread that you can pull through those that history that's pretty well integrated, we have sold most of our industrial and legacy Newell Rubbermaid industrial and commercial business, starting right when I joined the company in the middle of 2011, we sold BernzOmatic which is a torch business, we subsequently sold Endicia which was an online mail order, a fulfillment business, we sold Bulldog, which was a hardware business, we subsequently sold the Decor business which was the Levolor brand which was a remodeling business, we subsequently sold the Rubbermaid Medical business, which was a business oriented towards hospitals, we sold Mimeo which was a business oriented towards schools and municipalities, we then sold our tools business and so the assets that were in the commercial industrial space, so really just continuation of a theme, we have been moving aggressively as a company, as Newell Rubbermaid and now as Newell Brands, to pivot the company to become more consumer facing and less cyclical. ","And so, the choice the sell the commercial and industrial assets is driven by that strategic orientation, the moment we're in is an attractive one to be considering an acceleration of that activities given historic multiples on commercial and industrial businesses, if you go back and look at what we generated on the tools business, we generated nearly 13 times on tools last year, which was a surprise for most folks in terms of the value generated through those assets and it was a really good win-win situation for us and Stanley Black and Decker, we expect the same types of outcomes on the commercial and industrial businesses. ","We executed eight divestitures in 2017 of sub-scale small consumer businesses as well, so you have got largely sub-scale small consumer businesses. So, you have got the three businesses that are consumer facing, that were considering selling that our continuation of those choices. The reason to keep a business or to not keep a business from my perspective is grounded in whether those businesses can benefit strategically from the commitments we are making and capabilities in the flexibility we have within the P&L to invest behind the brands. And the choices we have made are driven to focus our portfolio around the assets that can benefit the most from these capabilities we have built, in innovation, design in e-commerce. ","The percentage of all the businesses, that we left in the portfolio will benefit from those capabilities and as I said, even the consumer facing assets that will sell, while they could have benefited from those capabilities they would have featured much lower down our priority list in terms of funding for investment. And so, we have made the choice to do this now and get behind us so we can focus on first fixing the assets and the core that are underperforming and then getting on with deleveraging the balance sheet and also applying the capabilities we\u2019ve invested to create against the assets that would benefit the most. So, I think that\u2019s I\u2019d answer your question broadly with respect to how we got to the announcements we\u2019ve made, there is a whole series of dynamics that underpin the sequencing of events that I don\u2019t think I'll get into today.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Mike, just I\u2019m going to follow up on Steve\u2019s question ask another one. I guess on the timing I\u2019m just trying to understand much like others six months ago or two years ago you did a full portfolio review, came up with a group of brands to sell and did it and then kind of say this is the new group going forward. You could have I guess sold these brands you are talking about them two years ago. So, I guess we\u2019re trying to understand what changed in the past six months to accelerate this? And then also with this in plan, what is the change in terms of restructuring cost and can you kind of give us a timeline of will restructuring in this year will it wind down this year by accelerating this program and what is that due from a zero-restructuring kind of comment?","Michael Polk ","Sure. So, let me answer the last part of your question first. As I mentioned in my comments, operating cash flow will benefit from a significant step down roughly 50% step down in the normalized cash cost in 2018 versus 2017. A significant portion of that step down relates to the cash cost associated with the restructuring and restructuring related activities. ","So, we\u2019ve organized our synergy and savings delivery through what we called the transformation office, those costs get normalized out of the P&L. Those costs will come down year-over-year by about $50 million 17\u2019 to 18\u2019 and we had a whole series of other normalized cash cost that will reduce from 17\u2019 to 18\u2019 some related to deal bonuses, some related to M&A fees, some related to the debt extinguishment cost associated with the tender we issued earlier in the year. But as I said, normalized cash cost will come down by about 50% year-over-year and then they will sequentially decrease in the out years. They don\u2019t stop this year. The program was never designed that way, the program is designed to deliver savings and synergies through 2021. So, there are cash costs that come out of the business associated with the delivery of those savings and synergies, but you should kind of think of it is the sequential deceleration in those costs from 2019 onward.","I think at one point I would like to make and reemphasize that I made in the strut is that the disposal activities will not compromise the synergy and savings deliveries that we committed to as part of the broadened transaction. So as said, we\u2019re going to deliver about $275 million in 2018 which would bring our cumulative savings and synergies to over $840 million by the end of the year and we\u2019re committed to the $1.3 billion savings in synergy numbers that we articulated over the last year and have a line of sight to deliver them in the context of the new $11 billion portfolio, which gives us -- will give us some very interesting flexibility for both investment behind the brands and the capabilities, we will continue to invest in e-commerce for example and also simultaneous margin development. ","And that's a really important part of the story, if you go back and look at Newell Rubbermaid legacy results. We accelerated core growth through the deployment of this model, while simultaneously increasing gross margin from 37.5% to 39.4%, operating margin from 12.5% to 14.4% while more than doubling the fee investment in the business. We have a line of sight with this new business that we're creating to deliver a similar profile or performance. You know what changed is the retail environment and what's unique about our portfolio and that does not change with the change in portfolio footprint is the exposure to distress segment of the U.S. retail landscape and that will continue to be a bit of an overhang on the business with probably episodic events like the ones we're dealing with right now, but as we continue to scale our e-commerce business, if you do the math on that and you expect double-digit growth going forward off a $1.6 billion base as the result of creating community of practice in a high talent geography like we have in the New York metro area. You get a mix effect to growth and margin development over time that is very, very positive. ","And so, I think in large part, the scenario we put forward is, it's a very, very attractive scenario. We have to get through sort of this transitory and disruptive period that we're in, which is really largely a first half dynamic and then we get on with building the business from there in a way that's similar to what you experienced from the legacy Newell Rubbermaid business from the second half onward. And we're clear in that point of view, we're clear that our plans to deliver that with the one variable being sort of the episodic dynamics within the retail landscape that we will have to accept and do a better job than anticipating, quite frankly.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","My first question, could you comment kind of just on the allegation that\u2019s been made by starboard that execution has been a great problem internally at the company, that\u2019s always been in my understanding, a real strong suite of Newell over the last few years, but the allegation that sort of the left-hand doesn\u2019t know what the right-hand is doing internally. Is that your assessment as well? Is there area for improvement? Or is that just an off-base allegation? ","And then my second question has to do with your confidence in the recovery of the core sales growth in the back half and obviously the stock is trading where it is, because nobody believed you and I get that there are easy comps, but is it a particular set of innovations that you have, is it just the hope the things get easier in the retail environment or more stable in the retail environment or maybe if you could just address that and make us feel more comfortable about the outlook for brighter days in the back half? Thanks.","Michael Polk ","Yeah. Thanks, Wendy for the questions. So, let me start with the second question and then I\u2019ll come back to the first question. So, the second question was about, what is your confidence in the back half of the year, well, I've said all along that that the investment we're making in brands and innovation on the legacy Jarden businesses would have 8 months to 24 months gestation period.","And so, I mentioned the fact that we've tripled the value of the innovation funnel on the legacy Jarden businesses. So, the work that\u2019s gone done over the last 18 months has been focused on building the ideas, building the products and building the commercial launch plans associated with the innovation that was basically under leveraged in those Jarden assets. ","And so, we come to market, we begin to come to market with some big ideas in the second half of 2018 that leveraged those investments. And so, our confidence is built on what we know is coming from market, we've already presented all of those ideas to customers and we actually have already begun to present 2019 ideas to customers. So, we have a clear line of sight to that, it's about commercially doing what we have the potential to do and that's always -- that's in the hands of the operating divisions and the brand development teams and for the most part, our history would suggest that we in fact do, do well with new big differentiated ideas. So that\u2019s part of the confidence.","The other bit of the confidence is grounded in fact, we made a big investment in e-commerce in 2017 and we populated an organization here that is -- has been building through 2017. In 2018, we will continue to invest in that organization to scale its presence from the U.S. to outside of the U.S. and despite what is a big profitable and rapidly growing e-commerce business, we didn't get the full benefit of those -- of that organization build-out in 2017. And so, we expect as the year goes on to get an increasingly important impact from that organization. And so those two things inspire confidence.","The other thing is the team have to delivers and it has to deliver margin improvement in 2018 and working capital reduction. And I would say, connected to your first question, I think on the working capital management 2017, we could have done better. With respect to margin development, we had the flow-through of synergies, but we were dealing with a very difficult environment with respect to pricing and we had some real difficulty with this slow creeping inflation in the first half of the year and customers pulling inventories of that, it was a very, very difficult to get pricing implemented in 2017. ","And so, you've got inflation beyond what we planned, pricing more negative than what we planned and the combined effect of that our margins was not good. So, I think there's plenty of things we can do better. There always are for every leadership team, and for every company I've ever worked in, but I think the things that will be the determinant factors in our 2018 performance will be the speed with which we can get the margin development happening. I don't think it really does in Q1, knowing what I know about pricing, timing and inflation, but I think we start to make real progress in Q2 and from that point forward on the margin front.","And then with respect to innovation activity and e-commerce activity we\u2019ll get a consistent build on e-com and a step change in innovation in fact in the back of the year that will contribute to our overall performance. I\u2019m going to think my comments that when you focus on an internal way as oppose to an external way and I preferred not to comment on what other people are saying. This team is just focused on doing what we need to do to drive the business and improve the performance of the company and we\u2019re not going to be distracted by all the other things outside that context.","Wendy Nicholson","I appreciate that and that\u2019s very fair and thank you for the comments you made. If I could just speak one more in the trade dispute that you are having in the Writing business just hypothetically if that does not resolve well, can you kind of quantify or dimensionalize how much of a risk to sales side is?","Michael Polk ","Well, we might comment about first half performance on Writing, we captured the first quarter impact of that not being resolved, but we do assume the second quarter impact for this particular customer, our brands represent over a 40 share of their retail footprint. And so, we have a mutual need to resolve the conflict and advance the Back-to-School and I suspect that\u2019s how things will play out. And like all of these things you really have to be true to principle otherwise you end up compromising in the structural way your gross margins when you are in a situation where you disagree about performance for the payments that have been made. ","And I think we\u2019re on the path to resolution, but I don\u2019t expect that to occur really in the first quarter, I expect as we come into the second quarter, we\u2019ll get into a more virtuous space with each other and this will be resolved and we will build out a strategic plan going forward, at least that\u2019s what I hope we can find a path to deliver. ","We have taken a big hit in the fourth quarter I told you that the Writing business globally was down 55% as a result of this one sell. So that gives you a sense for whether we\u2019re shifting inventory or not that continued into the first quarter and that had two effects on our overall performance one that obviously impacted core sales as I said you the combination of that Baby one customer interface and the Writing one customer interface explains 200 basis points of the decline versus prior year and the fourth quarter, I said that the business would have been flat effectively had an option for those two events. We experienced more of that on Writing and Baby in the first quarter and then things will turn assuming that the Baby business doesn\u2019t face any more disruptions associated with TRUs restructuring plans.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Thanks, and good morning. I guess kind of start with why do you think that sell through and selling will eventually start to converge because it\u2019s been four quarters since you started getting call out, not just by you of course, but in theory if online keeps growing and retailers become more efficient on inventory this should be a secular dynamic which should continue, I mean, your own online growth is sort of proof of that, and thank you for giving the 25% growth number, helpful to get that. But could you provide a bit more granularity and how that compares to your recent trends. I suspect, there\u2019s a bit of deceleration and what are your expectations going forward? Thanks.","Michael Polk ","Yeah. So, Olivia, thanks for the question, I want to be -- I want to clarify something if that was the net impression I gave, I'm not suggesting that the sell-in and sell-out, the divergence, convergence to parity. I'm suggesting that it converges to a more historic relationship like what we experienced in the first half of the year. I think, you're right, there is huge differences in the inventories that particular formats carried in the retail landscape. So as the mix of our business shifts, we will see a mix effect on retailer inventories and that's why you have a pretty steady divergence between sell-out and sell-in.","The issues we faced in the back half of the year were more event based at specific retailers, where that underlying disconnect between sell-out and sell-in was compromised by much more acute dynamics, either related to Baby, or related -- and our leading customers, Chapter 11 filing or related to this particular trade dispute. ","So, you're right to assume that there's going to always be, a disconnect and your question on whether that is an accelerating divergence, structurally, I think, it\u2019s something I can't really answer at this point. The thing to remember though in all of these calculations is that it's not the absolute reduction that matters, it's the change in the rate of change that matters and impacts revenue.","So, theoretically, you could have an issue, but I think it's a very modest in relative terms to some of these event based dynamics like, where Wal-Mart\u2019s actions over the last four quarters, which is now behind us, where they took double-digit reductions from a percentage standpoint in their inventory positions, or a reset of a particular customer\u2019s point of view, we have one large distributor in Writing, they made the choices to be in the middle of the year to change their inventory algorithm from holding over 23 weeks of inventory as a distributor to deciding they can only hold 12 and that they\u2019re going to take 18 months to get there. ","Those types of events I think are discrete things that you have to kind of work through. I think we just have to be better at it anticipating when those are going to come out us, by making sure that our connections to particular retailers are sound and firm, and that we are listening actively for the signals that are being sent to us, but the structural stuff I think is more gradual and more manageable, to be honest with you.","Olivia Tong","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. I guess within your - embedded within your guidance, particularly in Baby and Writing, I mean, for Baby, do you assume a continued drain or once you left that the Toys\"R\"Us issue, things stabilized, and then similarly for Writing, does it stabilize at a lower base, or does that also continue to see some drains, given all the issues are going on?","Michael Polk ","Yeah. Well, I think the thing that we think, we look at and we consider probably one of the most important metrics in any one of these businesses is, how our brands are doing from a market share perspective because that\u2019s an expression of consumer involved in the business. So as BRU goes through, it\u2019s changes. It\u2019s not like the consumer isn\u2019t going to go buy her baby here. There is no real material. I wouldn\u2019t expect the material change in the value of the market. What does happen is that there are differences in price continuance by retailer, there are differences in branch strength by retailer. And so, it\u2019s really incumbent upon sports like us to make sure that as those stores come out that we\u2019re actively marketing to the consumer and trying to drive her to an alternative location where she can find our products in the price tear that she shopping in. And so that\u2019s a little bit of the inside baseball type of details that are going on in the Baby business right now. ","The other thing that\u2019s really important is we compete against subscale single category competitors typically. And so, when somebody is big as the leading baby gear provider in the U.S. faces challenges like the ones its facing, we have the flexibility as an enterprise to absorb those hits and invest to create that switching behavior I just described in a way that our competitors just simply can't afford to do. ","So, this is where the scale of our consumer franchise will really matter this is where even in the future context will have a huge scale advantage versus almost every one of our competitors in the categories we will be competing in, and we get a leverage factor from a scale that is really, really important in a situation like this. ","So, my sense is that we should see continued share consolidations as I mentioned baby gear shares were up 193 basis points in the U.S. in 2017 despite the back half turmoil created as a leading retailer. And the team is mobilized to try to sustain that level of share improvement year-over-year in 18\u2019 despite the disruption they are experiencing. And that\u2019s why I described it is transitory because on the back end of whatever that restructuring looks like people are still going to be buying baby gear. ","Consumers are still going to be making brand choices based on the value propositions that those brands have and we want to be within arm's reach of every one of those consumers whether it\u2019s in brick-and-mortar or whether it\u2019s online and we\u2019ve invested to create this advantaged capability in e-commerce that should serve us really, really well through this period. ","So, there is a lot to do in those moments, but the capability agenda we\u2019ve invested to create over multiple years at Newell Rubbermaid and the extension of those capabilities in the context of Newell Brands that doubling down of investment we\u2019ve made on e-commerce they will all serve us well through this period of disruption, particularly relative to our subscale single category competitors.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","I want to ask a little bit about gross margin and the outlook there. So, first was just in terms of continuing to work through inventory and you definitely made obviously it\u2019s going to progress in the fourth quarter, but seasonally I would have probably expected inventory levels to come down in a normal environment probably $250 million Q4 versus Q3 anyway. So, one, how do I think about the gross margin impacted continuing to work through inventories. ","Two, resin, just both given that polypropylene is still inflationary and the length of your supply chain and how much it was probably already in your inventory at the time of the hurricanes, I was wondering how long to expect resin to persist as a headwind to gross margins in 2018? Thanks.","Michael Polk ","Sure. Good questions, Lauren. We delivered four more days of inventory reduction in the fourth quarter than we did in the fourth quarter a year ago. So, we outperformed what we typically\u2026","Ralph Nicoletti ","About a $100 million.","Michael Polk ","About a $100 million more came out in the fourth quarter of 2017 than in the fourth quarter of 2016 because your observation is right. There's always this lead down of inventories, but it was worth about four more days. ","The other thing that the team did a great job in the fourth quarter was progress on receivables and extension of payables, but really the receivables number was probably the most important contributor beyond the inventory to working capital movements and then had to do with really getting into the details of customer compliance, with respect to our agreed trade terms and fighting for our cash.","Obviously, that's an ongoing dynamic, but the team really kind of put the full court press on and made good progress, and it's some interesting bit of learning for us in that that may offer opportunities going forward every day of receivables was about $49 million of cash every day of payables and inventories about $28 million - $29 million of cash.","So, these are really, really important levers for us, and there's a huge amount of opportunity tied up in working capital. Next year, we expect to continue to make progress on the inventories. We've got roughly about 7 days of inventories planned to come out in 2018. We will continue to make progress on payables. ","Our payables days are in the mid-60s and most consumer goods benchmarks are in the low 70s, Unilever will be in the low 90s. So, there's a lot of opportunity here on payables, we're working that in a structural way through the procurement activities, we've got going on synergies, they are not only negotiating rate-based benefits, but also terms benefits. So, we should be able to make more progress there. ","I think, if I look at our working capital metrics versus any consumer goods benchmark, there's a ton of opportunity, there was a legacy charge and then there was a legacy of Newell Rubbermaid, we have today made some good progress after a really bad Q3, as a result of the top-line miss, and that gives us some encouragement and it gives the organization kind of the energy boost in the confidence to kind of really go for this.","Next year, our incentives schemes approved by the board and I think probably released, I think publicly today, the 8Ks, later on today. That, our compensation scheme for the total corporation will be cash flow based and earnings based. The divisions will have a stake in the corporate performance that will be roughly 50:50 against our external goals. And then the divisions will have their own set of metrics that are operating income based, they\u2019ll be focused 75% of their incentives around divisions target 25% tied of the corporate performance. So, we're going to quit skin and again for the entire organization on continued progression of working capital improvements. As I said in my comments we have a significant step up in operating cash flow projected for 2018. What was your first question that I didn\u2019t answer?","Lauren Lieberman","Yeah, it was the overall gross margin outlook that you guys projecting because both the inventory drawdown and then also resin pressure.","Ralph Nicoletti ","Yeah, I think that\u2019s a really good point. I think our gross margins in the first quarter were look very much like what our gross margins looked like into the fourth quarter because we\u2019re pushing production time out of Q1 on Writing. Typically, we would start to build inventory in the month of March for Back-to-School selling at the end of June. ","The teams have found a constructive way to do that without having to start those builds so early and we want to keep the momentum going with respect to working capital movements versus what we were able to deliver a year ago right from the beginning of the year. ","We\u2019ll take the hit because we\u2019re going to prioritize cash above gross margin in the first quarter, but we\u2019ll take the hit on fixed cost absorption to gross margin in the first quarter to enable the movement of that inventory in the production plans out later into the year. We think that\u2019s the right call to make."," We will pay a mix penalty in the first quarter because we continue to struggle with the one retailer I was referring to in Writing and Writing has obviously a positive mix effect on the overall company. But I think the way to think about gross margin progression is Q1 looks a lot like Q4 and then things really begin to plow.","We get the resin pricing implemented were broadly by about February 1st most of those actions begin to get traction so we\u2019ll get a bit of that benefit in Q1 and the flow through of that benefit into the second, third and fourth quarters. We will get the mix benefit from less of the down track related to this one particular retailer on Writing.","I think one of the interesting business stories that\u2019s sort of lost in the cloud of discussions from 2017 is the progress on Yankee Candle and Home Fragrance and that business delivered growth in 2017 with a decent margin despite the challenges of Yankee retail. ","And so, we got some really interesting learning out of the popup store that we did in the holidays in New York. We got interesting learning from the personalization work we did. The team is really energized and focused around leveraging those insights for profitable growth going forward. We\u2019ve extended the shoulders of the portfolio into wholesale, which is yielding tremendous results as represented in the 273 basis points of market share growth on Home Fragrance. ","So, I think this is an interesting story. We will continue to have to face into the headwinds associated with retail, Yankee retail, but the shoulders of that business not performing well and Yankee has the potential to mix the company up before we able to sustain the growth performance. ","Another hit and Jim in 2017 was the performance of the Jostens business, which grew nearly 2% which is which is a credit to Chuck Mooty and his team and some of the investments we\u2019ve made in building out not only the scholastic and high school, grade school, college aspects of the business but also the professional aspects of the business and that\u2019s an interesting story, that also has the potential to makes us as we go forward. ","So there are lots of factors that will contribute to the margin progression, you should expect Q1 to look very much like Q4 and then things to really kind of get back into the zone you would normally expect because the choices on manufacturing activity will get into more of a normal rhythm, and we will get more pricing leverage, we\u2019ll continue to get procurement benefits through the synergy work we're doing and when we get into a more virtuous delivery. We expect gross margin improvement year-over-year and I think you should expect us to continue to deliver gross margin improvement from this year onward that\u2019s the lifeblood of the business.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. That's great. And then I guess one for Ralph on cash flow. So, you did mention the cash tax payments on divestures, I was just curious if you paid any cash tax in the Tools divestiture in 2017, a lot of that\u2019s been deferred into 2018 is one. And then two, are there any benefit to cash flow from any of the deferrals on bonuses, kind of Q4 versus what you had expected at the time of last conference call, that was all P&L. Thanks.","Ralph Nicoletti","Hi, Lauren. Yes, so, first we did pay some cash taxes in 2017 related to disposals, but included in our cash forecast for 2018, we are reflecting the fact that there's more -- the majority of the taxes related to the tools divesture, are hitting 2018. So that\u2019s factored into our guidance on cash flow that we talked about. ","And then in terms of Q4, and how we came in above where we thought, I think two things in principle. One, admittedly, we serve at the top hedge back a little bit forecast on inventory and the business units we\u2019re running -- we\u2019re operating at a target that was more aggressive than what we were projecting. Frankly, some of that was just we want to make sure we're getting the right traction and you saw that come through and you saw that in the change in working capital as well as the effects on the gross margin in the quarter on absorption. So that was one piece.","And then the second piece was really on receivables that -- and Mike alluded to it, but the team really did a nice job of stepping up on a lot of internal processes and practices that really paid some dividends in terms of relative to our own forecast on receivables. The other piece of it, immediately just within the forecast accuracy is that the pace in which our sales occurred during the quarter, were more front loaded and therefore you'll collect more within the quarter. So that has had some influence as well, but operationally, we feel really good about what the receivables group did and their capabilities sustaining going into this year.","Operator","And our last question will come from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason Gere","Thanks, guys. Hey, how are you? Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess I'm just kind of continuing on Lauren\u2019s question maybe, one part of the gross margin if you could talk on the price, so I just I know some of the pricing is coming through, I was wondering if you can lay some context of the pricing that you're taking now, like what type of pricing you\u2019ve taken on these products before is there pricing coming with some of the bigger innovation in back of the year. So, I\u2019m trying to think about price versus volume how we think about core sales being up modestly for the year just how you can kind of put them into context?","Ralph Nicoletti","Yeah, so I mean most of the pricing that we\u2019re taking right now is related to resin inflation in spite as you know with the Hurricanes in the late August into September. So, you had 60 to 90 days lag with retailers on price implementation from an announcement date. So, most of the announcements were made in early October. The big retailers are just -- you end up with a negotiating posture that probably pushes implementation dates back. As I said, they will go on 21 for the most part. And those increases are designed to recover the resin spikes we saw in the fourth quarter. ","Inflation has moved negatively on us since then. So, we will likely have to do more pricing, but I don\u2019t know that we will do that through invoice price changes that we will probably do that through customer programming adjustments which are another way to capture pricing. ","So those things are underway, those are the types of discussions the divisions are having. Just to be clear and transparent, the divisions were pursuing more price increases that we\u2019ve captured in our assumptions and in our guidance."," So, I think it\u2019s going it is a tough environment out there to get these things landed. We\u2019ll continue to be a tough environment to get these things landed. Divisions build plans that are typically ahead of what the corporation assumes in its guidance and we\u2019ve hedged some of their assumptions back given the risk profile on some of them.","So, I think this will be an ongoing discussion, you\u2019ve heard it from a lot of people it was difficult to get pricing in the fourth quarter that was true. I think the inflation spikes that occurred on resins make it more palatable and easier for us to engage in pricing discussions than the gradual inflation we saw through the first half of the year. ","So, my confidence in higher this year that we\u2019ll get things done that we couldn\u2019t get done last year. We\u2019ve also pulled back on some of the programming activity we had last year that didn\u2019t yield the kind of returns we thought were appropriate that also is a path to positive price. ","Now, you should not expect us to be given a volume. This will be a year of a blend of price and volume and we expect once we get through this very, very volatile period that were in the first half of the year, we expect to see a blend of both in the back half contributing to a meaningful improvement in the underlying growth on the business. So, I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, Jason or whether it was too big, but probably the best I\u2019m going to offer today.","Jason Gere","No, that was actually hit on all the touch points. And then just I guess the last follow-up would be just as you thinking about with the acceleration of the program and good to hear that the synergies are going to be largely intact. How does that make you think about the reinvestment rate that what you set out maybe when you guys combine this company and I think at CAGNY last year you talked about the incremental 500 million coming through. So, as you see the changing landscape and in terms of the investments you are making in e-commerce and other capabilities, has that changed dramatically or how do you think about, what will be reinvested as opposed to, what flows to the bottom-line for EPS? Thanks.","Michael Polk ","Yeah, I mean, we will continue to invest in e-commerce in 2018, but the way you should think about it is that we've got to do the things we need to do within our overhead structure to fund that investment from the business units that are experiencing the tough declines in their brick and mortar businesses. And so, the difficult conversations like the one I described with the Writing customer, are in part designed to enable the reallocation of resource to where the most and significant return on investment can be generated. And those are tough things to do, but that's how I characterize, how the investment in e-commerce occurs in 2018.","And so, this won't be a big spending year, because we have to calibrate spending to the environment we're in and the growth dynamics that are out there. And with the volatility, we\u2019ll experience in the first half of the year, we have to be very cautious to not spend beyond an appropriate level tied to the revenue, we believe we will be able to generate. ","But we can fuel the big investment bets, we want to make whether that's innovation, whether that's the investment in e-commerce, by challenging the businesses that are having the more stressed performance to look at the return on investment they're getting on the choices, they're making. ","And we're more engaged and actively involved leadership team, then the design that Newell Rubbermaid used to have as a holding company, where we delegated all that authority into the divisions. We don't think that's the right approach in this environment we\u2019re in. You have to be prepared to shift resources to the winning channels, the growing channels and the winning customers and that is a very difficult thing for divisions to embrace, because of the risk associated with it. ","So, if you disaggregate those choices to the lower levels in the organization, what you do is, you compromise the pathway to making the whole greater than the sum of the parts, because people will aim off those choices whereas the corporation can accept those risks with involvement in the business.","And so, it\u2019s a different operating model, it\u2019s a different way of working than either the legacy Newell Rubbermaid prior to my joining in 2011, or the legacy Jarden organization prior to Jarden becoming part of Newell Brands, but we're quite clear, this is the right model for the moment we're in and we don't believe the moment we're in, changes very much with respect to the shifting dynamics in consumer purchasing activities and approaches and the impact that's had on the retail landscape, forcing companies like ours to pivot their resources from where they\u2019ve heroically been focused to where the market is moving towards. ","And companies that don't do that aggressively and proactively, will end up experiencing real trouble, because their top-lines will compress and the fixed cost absorption associated with declining top-lines will be profound on their margin structure. ","So, this is a very, very important topic and it's at the heart of why we built our operating model the way we have and why we operate the way we do. So, Jason, I don\u2019t know if that answered your question, but I think it was sort of an important thing to put out there.","Jason Gere","No, no, it definitely did and thanks for all the color and we\u2019ll then Florida.","Michael Polk ","Okay, Jason. I guess that\u2019s our last question. I just have a couple of final comments before we sign off. Just thank you to all of my Newell colleagues. This has been an incredibly challenging year and you probably never worked harder. I want to thank you for your perseverance, your drive for your determination and while we may not be happy with the outcomes we delivered. We put in place and built an organization and set capabilities that are going to serve us very, very well into the future.","Let's stay focused in the here and now and not be distracted by all the headlines and being uncompromising in our drive to reach our long-term potential. Thanks so much for the support and for your drive and attentiveness. That\u2019s it from me, operator.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellrubbermaid.com, on the Investor Relations homepage, under Events and Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download. I will now turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell","Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Mike Polk, Newell Rubbermaid's President and CEO; and Doug Martin, our Chief Financial Officer.","First, let me remind you that we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from the results predicted in our statements. We caution you to consider important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ from management's expectations, and we direct you to the most -- to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent SEC filing.","And finally, as we normally do, we will include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation with the directly comparable measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in the press release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.newellrubbermaid.com.","With that, I would like to turn the presentation over to Mike.","Michael B. Polk","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call.","We have 2 objectives today. First, Doug and I will review our third quarter results and update you on the progress we're making driving the Growth Game Plan into action. Second, I'll provide some perspective on the balance of 2013 and the factors that could influence delivery as we head towards the new year.","This morning, we reported a solid set of Q3 results that represent our ninth consecutive quarter of consistent delivery. Core sales grew 3.3%, driven by strong North America growth of over 4% and very strong Latin America growth of nearly 35%.","Normalized operating income margin increased 30 basis points, driven by a significant reduction in overheads as a result of Project Renewal, partially offset by a 50-basis-point increase in advertising and promotion and a 30-basis-point decline in gross margin, largely due to segment mix of our business.","Normalized earnings per share was $0.52, up 10.6% and $0.03 ahead of consensus, and operating cash flow was $361 million, up nearly 20%.","Our accelerating growth and increased operating margins and strong cash generation enabled us to pass nearly $91 million back to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, up over 65%.","As previously announced, we completed the sale of both our Hardware and Teach Platform businesses in Q3. Proceeds from these disposals will help fund the $350 million accelerated share repurchase program our board authorized and we announced earlier this morning.","Importantly, in the third quarter, the transformation agenda in EMEA has moved from planning to execution. We've made a number of changes to simplify our operations for increased profitability and long-term growth, leveling the flow of shipments in Q3 and starting the exit of certain markets and product lines as an enabler to reduce complexity and infrastructure in the region.","Specifically, we've begun to exit direct sales in over 50 of the 120 countries and territories that the EMEA region serves. We've begun to exit our unprofitable custom logo Fine Writing business, and we've begun to discontinue the unprofitable parts of our Baby business in about 19 countries.","This simplification of our footprint has allowed us to announce the closure of 7 distribution centers, 6 customer service centers, 2 factories and 1 test center, while also simplifying our go-to-market organization in Europe.","In Q3, this transition, when coupled with some timing-related year-ago factors, contributed to the step-back from our EMEA underlying core growth rate of about negative 3% to 4%. If one considers this rate of growth as more reflective of our underlying performance, global core sales grew at nearly 4% in Q3.","Over the next 18 months, we will execute the phased exit of about $25 million of business in EMEA. These choices will result in increased absolute dollar profitability in the region, and over time, lead to core sales growth in our key countries and categories, as we focus our resources for growth in our most attractive country category sales. We plan to absorb these exits within our global core sales results, as we did in Q3, and our forward-looking guidance will include the effect of these exits. All of the restructuring costs associated with the EMEA transformation are funded as part of Project Renewal. So a solid set of numbers, particularly in the context of the changes we're initiating in Europe.","We're starting to see the benefits of the changes we launched earlier this year. Our new operating model is deployed, and we've reorganized the company around its 2 core activity systems: development and delivery. We've restructured marketing and R&D, seeding new processes that will drive a more robust innovation pipeline, as a result of significantly increased investments and insights, and strengthen design, e-commerce and marketing teams.","We've restructured our go-to-market capabilities in North America, deploying a customer development model that broadens and deepens customer and channel reach through a one-company approach to customer team and channel leadership, using the resulting leadership savings to invest in increased retailer and distributor coverage.","And we've created a global supply chain that is gearing up to unlock costs through strengthened capabilities across all 5 supply-chain disciplines of plan, source, make, deliver and serve.","These changes are starting to yield strengthened results. Operating margins in the developed world are increasing as Project Renewal delivers significant cost reductions in North America and Europe. The resulting developed world margin expansion is funding both increased market shares in our home market and the deployment of a select portion of our portfolio into the faster-growing emerging markets: first, south, to Latin America; and in the future, east, to Asia.","The reset of our growth and financial algorithm is gaining traction as is evident in our geographic and segment Q3 results. Core sales growth outside Europe was up over 5%, driven by over 6% core sales growth in the Americas. Tools grew global core sales nearly 6%, responding very favorably to increased investment behind new Irwin advertising in North America and a significant expansion of the Irwin portfolio in Brazil.","Baby grew global core sales nearly 8% as a result of double-digit growth in North America, driven by strong innovation and customer partnering.","Home Solutions grew global core sales growth over 7%, delivering its strongest results in recent years, while flattened slightly by shipment timing, these strong results were driven by new distribution and innovation on Calphalon, strong Back-to-School merchandising on Rubbermaid and new innovation on Levolor.","And our Writing segment had a strong Back-to-School performance in most markets. For the second consecutive year, in the U.S., we grew share across all channels in the Back-to-School drive period, with particularly strong share gains on Sharpie as a result of the successful launch of Sharpie Neon.","Our Writing segment POS growth did not translate to strong global revenue growth because of the continued office superstore channel contraction in North America and Europe, and the ongoing reset of our Fine Writing business in China, resulting in global core sales growth of only 0.2%.","At the same time as driving sequential increase in our global core growth rates, we delivered operating income margin expansion of 30 basis points, while also funding increased advertising and promotion investment of 50 basis points. The 50-basis-point increase in A&P was fueled by a 125-basis-point reduction in SG&A, excluding A&P or overheads, driven by Project Renewal. Our strong progress in structural and discretionary costs allowed us to more than cover the headwinds in gross margin related to negative segment mix, inflation and foreign exchange, and the retained costs associated with our disposals that hit SG&A, excluding A&P or overheads.","We entered the fourth quarter with momentum, particularly on Baby, Tools and Home Solutions and across the Americas. While our Commercial Products segment did not grow in Q3, the team was up against a tough year-ago comparator of over 8% growth.","Despite very tight health care capital budgets affecting the pace of new purchases of our Rubbermaid medical carts, the Commercial Products segment is positioned for a better Q4 and good full year results.","In Writing, we're winning on the fundamentals in most markets and channels, with strong innovation, new advertising and very solid merchandising support. We take a long view on the Writing segment, given its potential, the strength of our portfolio and the opportunity for this category around the world.","In that context, our guidance and plans have and will accept that revenue growth will continue to be diluted by the impact of the North American superstore contraction and impending consolidation.","All in, I'm pleased with our Q3 results, while recognizing there's plenty of work still to be done. With that, let me hand the call over to Doug to go through a more detailed review, and then I'll return to provide perspective on the balance of the year.","Douglas L. Martin","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to step you through our Q3 results, cost programs, and then take a minute to talk about the balance sheet.","Newell's Q3 reported net sales were $1.49 billion, which represent a 2.1% increase over the prior year. Core sales, which exclude the impact of unfavorable foreign currency, increased 3.3%.","Normalized operating margin was 38.1%, a 30-basis-point decline year-over-year. Improved productivity was more than offset by inflation and unfavorable mix, as some of our lower-margin businesses and regions, such as a Baby in North America and Home Solutions, were our best growing performers during the quarter.","Normalized SG&A expense was $349.3 million, or 23.5% of sales, a decline in overall spend of 60 basis points from the prior year. Total SG&A declined slightly by $2 million, and cost savings from Project Renewal enabled us to fund additional strategic advertising and promotional investment. The biggest increase was in our Tools segment, where we invested an incremental $10 million behind the Brazil Tools launch and National Tradesmen Day, with good top line results. Our plans continue to call for another step-up in advertising and promotion behind our brands in the fourth quarter, again, funded by Renewal.","Normalized operating margin was 14.6%, a 30-basis-point improvement from the prior year, as Renewal and other savings offset gross margin contraction and brand investment. Reported operating margin was 12%, compared with 12.8% in the prior year. Interest expense was $15.7 million, and our normalized tax rate was 24.3%, compared with 28.6% in the prior year, largely driven by the geographic mix of earnings and discrete items in each period.","Normalized earnings per share, excluding restructuring and restructuring-related costs, income tax items and discontinued operations, were $0.52, a 10.6% increase from a year ago. The increase is primarily attributable to the acceleration in core sales growth, complemented by the lower tax rate this quarter and partially offset by about $0.01 of foreign exchange. Third quarter reported earnings per share were $0.66, compared with $0.37 last year.","We generated operating cash of $360.8 million during Q3, compared with $301.5 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily driven by a 6-day improvement in net working capital year-over-year. We also returned $90.8 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $44 million in dividends and $46.8 million from the repurchase of 1.8 million shares. Program to date, we have spent $257 million to repurchase 12.9 million shares at an average price of $19.86. This leaves us $43 million available under the current program, which we intend to use by the middle of next year.","Turning now to the segments. In our Writing segment, reported net sales declined by 0.9%. Core sales increased 0.2%. Our Latin America Writing business generated strong growth of almost 40%, fueled by pricing and volume increases. We also had solid growth in North America outside of the office superstore channel, which was offset by office superstore channel and European declines. Third quarter normalized operating margin in the Writing segment was 24%. This 550-basis-point improvement was largely due to pricing, productivity and structural SG&A reductions.","The Home Solutions segment had strong third quarter results, with net sales growth of 6.8% to $431.4 million. Core sales grew 7.2%. The growth reflected good execution in the U.S. behind Rubbermaid Consumer merchandising, successful new product launches at Levolor against weak year-ago results and robust growth from Calphalon, driven by distribution gains. A portion of the growth was also timing-related, as we shipped some Black Friday merchandise earlier in the season than we did a year ago. Home Solutions' normalized operating margin was 15.4%, a 90-basis-point decline versus prior year, reflecting mix and increased customer promotions to support new product launches and new customers.","The Tools segment also delivered a good quarter, reflecting the success of our expanded product offering initiative in Brazil and the impact of National Tradesmen Day around the globe. Reported sales grew 3.4%. Core sales growth was a robust 5.7%. Normalized operating margin in the Tools segment was 5.8%, down versus last year's 13.2%. Most of the decline was due to the increased advertising and promotion to support these 2 big growth initiatives. We made a big bet in this segment that paid off in Q3 top line growth and we believe will drive higher sales for some time to come. We expect to realize operating margin leverage from this -- from these investments in brand support beginning in 2014, as we continue to grow this one bigger business.","Reported net sales in the Consumer Products segment were down 4.5% and core sales declined 4.3%. We were up against our strongest year-ago comparisons this quarter versus 8.4% growth last year. In addition, our health care business slowed this quarter due to category dynamics in the health care industry, fueled by uncertainty around health care reform and government budget priorities. Operating margin for this segment was 12%, down versus last year's 15.2% due to higher promotional activity, selling and product marketing expense, partially offset by Renewal savings.","","Our Baby segment continued its strong performance this quarter with reported sales growth of 4.8% and core sales growth of 7.9%. We continue to win in Baby due to successful innovation and increased presence at our retail partners in North America. This was somewhat offset by weaker results in Asia, where we are comparing against 2 years of very strong growth. Baby's Q3 normalized operating margin was 12.7%, up 280 basis points to last year, largely the benefit of Renewal cost savings and increased sales.","Looking at Q3 core sales by geography, North America grew 4.1%, as a result of strong performances from Baby and Home Solutions. In EMEA, core sales declined 9.9%, which reflects ongoing overall market trends, exacerbated by some of the strategic changes we're making to exit unprofitable categories. In Latin America, core sales grew 34.7%, driven by very strong results from the Writing and Tools segments. In Asia, core sales declined 7.4% due to continued pressure from the step-back in the Fine Writing China model and from Aprica, which is experiencing tough comparisons against very robust growth trends in 2011 and 2012.","Developed world core sales growth was approximately 2%, driven by solid U.S. growth rate of 4.2%, offset by softer results in Europe and Japan. Our emerging markets business grew approximately 10%, attributable to very robust growth trends across all segments in Latin America.","Switching now to cost programs. We continue to make good progress on Project Renewal and our indirect spend initiative. Through the end of Q3, we are on plan, having realized approximately $160 million in cumulative savings. These costs -- these cost savings have enabled the brand investment that you saw from us this quarter, which in turn is beginning to drive accelerated core sales growth in our priority businesses and markets. We intend to continue to invest heavily in the fourth quarter to drive accelerated performance and position ourselves for sustainable growth in 2014.","I'm going to finish this morning by taking a few minutes to talk about the balance sheet. We spend a lot of our time communicating the progress against strengthening capabilities to deliver the Growth Game Plan. We have been equally focused on strengthening the balance sheet and managing an efficient capital structure. As Mike mentioned, our board has approved a $350 million accelerated share repurchase program to be entered into this quarter. This program will be funded with current year free cash flow and proceeds from the divestiture of our Hardware business.","During the third quarter, we also renegotiated our accounts receivable securitization program, increasing its size from $200 million to $350 million, extending it to 2 years from 1, and on better terms. This, along with our revolving credit facility and absence of long-term maturities until 2015, leave us in a very strong liquidity position. Our debt-to-equity, EBITDA multiple and interest coverage ratios are also very healthy.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Mike for some additional comments.","Michael B. Polk","Thanks, Doug. So let's now turn to our 2013 outlook. As communicated this morning, we've reaffirmed our full year guidance of core sales growth of 2% to 4%, normalized operating income margin expansion of up to 20 basis points, normalized EPS of $1.80 to $1.84 and operating cash flow in the range of $575 million to $625 million.","Our full year guidance assumes sustained momentum in Tools and Baby, solid growth in Home Solutions, a return to growth in Commercial Products and Writing results roughly in line with the year-to-date performance.","Our guidance also assumes we increase advertising and promotion support in Q4, funded in large part by continued reductions in overheads, positive price realization and strengthened productivity.","There are 2 factors that could influence where we fall in our 2013 full year guidance range. The first factor relates to the delivery of Renewal savings and other margin-enhancing actions that will enable the planned increase in Q4 brand investment. While we're not satisfied with the gross margin in Q3, due largely to mix, for the first quarter in the last 4, we delivered positive price realization and expect that to accelerate in Q4, given pricing actions we've taken across the portfolio. We're right on track to deliver the planned Project Renewal savings that Doug just said, and we expect to sequentially strengthen our productivity delivery in Q4. As a result, we're on track to step up A&P and investment in our consumer research in Q4 versus prior year by about the same amount as we did in Q3.","The second factor influencing where we fall in our full year guidance range is the timing of the Office Depot-OfficeMax merger. Recent press reports suggest their merger will be completed over the next few weeks. As previously discussed, the combination of Office Depot and OfficeMax will result in a retail footprint consolidation in the U.S., and yield a onetime trade-inventory-reduction-driven revenue and earnings hit for Newell as retail inventories are rebalanced.","Our 2013 guidance assumes this will not affect 2013 results. While we have no visibility to their actual plan for integration, if the retail consolidation were to be fully completed in 1 year, our best estimate at this time would be that their consolidation would result in a onetime drag on Newell's total company global growth of 30 to 50 basis points and a onetime drag on EPS of $0.02 to $0.04 or 1% to 2%.","When we shared our long-term strategic guidance early in 2012 at CAGNY, that guidance excluded any impacts associated with M&A, new below-the-line actions like today's ASR and did not consider big external events like the merger of the 2 of our top 10 global customers.","While we'll not discuss 2014 full year guidance until we announce year end results in January, we're developing plans to manage the impact of the Depot-Max transition in 2014 in the context of our long-term guidance for the strategic stage of the Growth Game Plan.","Today's announcement of the $350 million accelerated share repurchase will enable us to absorb the onetime EPS impact of the Depot-Max merger and the retained cost impact associated with our 2013 disposals, leaving some room for us to potentially deliver just above the high side of our long-term EPS guidance range for the strategic stage of the Growth Game Plan of 5% to 8% EPS growth.","As we build our plans for 2014, we expect to step up advertising and promotion investment, again fueled in part by growth in line with the long-term guidance for the strategic stage of the Growth Game Plan; gross margin increases driven by pricing and productivity ahead of inflation; and continued reductions in SG&A less A&P or overheads, driven by Project Renewal.","Again, we'll not issue 2014 guidance until the end of January, given our plans for 2014 are still in development.","With respect to this year, we continue to believe the middle of our 2013 full year guidance range is the best estimate for our current year delivery in core sales, normalized EPS and operating cash flow. The middle of our full year normalized EPS guidance would yield full year EPS of $1.82, and imply Q4 normalized EPS of $0.45.","To the extent we have visibility to overdeliver against the middle of the full year normalized EPS range, we would instead choose to deploy the earnings back into A&P and consumer research to position ourselves for accelerated performance in 2014 and beyond.","Let me close by reminding you that we've now delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of consistent and competitive results. We're delivering these results while simultaneously driving change, change that is transforming our company from a holding company to a highly focused, results-oriented operating company. We're all pleased that the biggest and most disruptive change is now behind us, especially in the demand creation functions of marketing, insight, design and customer development. We've gotten here faster than I thought we would, as a result of the determination and grit of our people. They've driven the new operating model into action and they've begun to make the change count. We're moving quickly now to drive our new capabilities to full throttle. The more research we do, the more convinced and excited we are that we have a very strong set of brands with real upside potential. Project Renewal has and will continue to unlock our capacity for investment, creating new funding for our capability agenda, which will in turn create new possibilities for our brands.","We're entering the phase of the Growth Game Plan where we begin to reap the benefits of our transformation. Some of what we've done will have fast impact. We can accelerate plans, add new activity or amplify existing plans and ideas by strengthening investment. Tools, Commercial Products and Writing will continue to be the beneficiaries of these types of choices.","We're pacing investments in a disciplined, thoughtful way with funding flowing to the most compelling, attractive ideas that are consistent with our priorities. Our strategic initiatives will take a little longer, but will create more lasting value and have greater impact. Today, we're putting the building blocks in place for what will be a strengthened future growth funnel by doubling our investment in consumer research, by supporting new talent like our new VP of Innovation, Nate Young, who's helping marketing, insight, design and supply chain teams ideate through a process they call Innovation Now; and by consolidating our creative and media relationships to fewer, bigger, world-class partnerships that will help strengthen and develop our brands in innovation.","These emerging capabilities and new processes have generated over 1,500 idea fragments since their first inception 3 months ago. And if just 1% of them become $10 million ideas, we'll have generated a new funnel of growth valued at $150 million.","Money flows to ideas and people. And we're now building a pipeline of investable ideas. And we have built a group of investable teams. That's the power of our new operating model with focused capabilities in development and delivery. That's the power of our people. And that's the power of the Growth Game Plan in action.","With that, let's open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So I wanted to get a sense for, I guess, how Q3 margin progressed relative to your expectations. I imagine you didn't necessarily foresee the level of gross margin weakness. And SG&A came down pretty substantially, right? So I just want to get a sense for what kind of short-term trade-offs on growth investments maybe you needed to make in the quarter, if any? And I guess that in the context of the fact that A&P was up 50 basis points, so were there trade-offs you needed to make in the quarter to get to where you wanted to be on the EPS line?","Michael B. Polk","No, actually. And we, our money -- we could've invested more, quite frankly, but we didn't have things ready to invest behind. So we had -- we've been very disciplined, Chris, about not putting money until ideas are ready. We had some -- we have Paper Mate advertisements that's now on-air as of the middle of September. It will be on-air through the balance of the year. But we put that advertising back through another round of change in about the middle of July because it didn't meet our thresholds for performance. As you recall, I've said that we're not going to put money behind things that are not ready to be invested in. And while the advertising was good, it wasn't great. And we needed to put it through another twist. We could've spent more on Paper Mate in Q3 if we had chosen to. We didn't need to beat by $0.03. But the material wasn't ready. So that was a key choice that we made in the quarter. I will say that while I'm pleased that we've gotten to positive price realization in gross margin in the third quarter, and that's the first quarter in the last 4 that we've seen that, I wasn't -- we could've delivered better gross margin had the mix been slightly stronger. And so with Baby growth and with Home Solutions growth at the level that they're at, we mixed to negative, perhaps a little bit more so than we anticipated. But that didn't drive any investment choices, to be quite honest. I mean, we would've -- if the Paper Mate advertising would have been ready, we would've put it on-air earlier. You'll see significant investment in Writing advertising in Q4 as a result of that timing issue.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then just quickly on the ASR. So I guess, it's great, by the way. $350 million ASR is great. But it's only, I guess, $180 million over the deal proceeds you guys are getting in. So it still leaves you guys a pretty substantial amount of flexibility on cash. Just can you talk about that in the context of how you're viewing tack-ons and other potential uses?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So a good question, Chris. I mean, we've been quite clear that we want to get the change agenda bed down. So we don't believe that bolt-ons today are the right idea for the company as we get the change agenda sorted. I think that becomes an increasingly attractive option over time. And as we've said, late 2014 into 2015, we might consider bolt-ons as a way of strengthening our agenda within our core segments. And it won't envision anything that has sort of extended the shoulders of our portfolio. But there's nothing cooking there, but we certainly are open to using cash that strategically. We felt like this was an appropriate and balanced approach to providing value to our investors as we continue to transform the company. And we've said we're going to partner with our investors as we transform. And we've been consistent in doing that in a steady and sequential way. And I think this choice reflects that commitment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Mike, I know you said you're not giving guidance for 2014, but I think there are enough metrics thrown out there that I have some kind of idea on 2014. Just to make sure I'm understanding that you're kind of talking about 8% to 9% EPS growth is possible. And the reason I ask that is if we kind of take the ASR and Office Depot-OfficeMax, that's plus 3% already. So I mean are you comfortable with kind of the metrics of if you're growing top line 4%, that you're only growing bottom line core by 6%? Or is -- and does that imply kind of another year of reinvestment is needed to really get this thing going?","Michael B. Polk","So the place I'd start, if you're trying to understand how we think, is to go back to the CAGNY 2012 or even more recently, the Barclays Back-to-School Conference, where we laid out the 3 stages of the Growth Game Plan. And we've put metrics connected to each of those. I think those are the, that's the right starting place for any conversation about our business. And in fact, every time I have a discussion with my team, that's where we start. These are the commitments. We said 2014, at Barclays, is right smack in the middle of the strategic stage of the Growth Game Plan. So the guidance we've communicated there back in 2012, and it's still consistent today, was 3% to 4% core sales growth and 5% to 8% normalized EPS growth. That guidance assumed no M&A activities, either disposals or acquisitions by us. It assumed no incremental below-the-line activity, other than what had been authorized at that point in time, which was the $300 million 2011 open market repurchase. And it assumed no big external events. It sort of assumed the status quo on the external. So the macro's flat. And it certainly didn't anticipate 2 of our top 10 customers consolidating. So the things that are different, as you look to build your view of our results in '14, and certainly influences the way we think, what's different? Well, Depot-Max are consolidating. And I don't view that as a strategic issue for us. I actually view that as a strategic opportunity for us long term, but it creates an event in the moment of their consolidation that we have to deal with. That's new news. So we've got to deal with that. We didn't anticipate at that time disposing our Hardware and Teach platforms, which leaves us with a retained cost issue, which was never in the guidance, which we have to deal with. And then of course, the ASR was not in the equation at that point, which is a positive. And those 3 things, those 3 moving parts, are really the things you've got to calibrate as you build your models and then we have to think through as we sustain our commitment to the underlying assumptions that were -- that underpins the strategic stage of the Growth Game Plan, which were that in the strategic stage, we would take the cost out, the radical restructuring of our overhead structure, and shift that benefit in large part to A&P. And that's what we're in the middle of doing. That's what you see in our Q3 results. You see a 125-basis-point reduction in overheads and a 50-basis-point increase in A&P. And while we'd like to continue to put more in that, we're managing into A&P, we're managing the trade-offs in the current moment. And we're investing as much as we think it's prudent to invest while delivering competitive returns. In 2014, we will step up A&P again substantially. And we need to. We want to, because we want to take that overhead benefit of Renewal restructuring and put it to work for our brands. So as you build your framework and your model for 2014, you should do it in that context. And we're thinking about it in that context. That should enable us, given the size of the ASB, to potentially deliver EPS near or above the high end of the range. And I don't know -- we have to work through the details of that. We're not prepared to give you a specific number. You said 8% to 9%. That's generally in the range. And we need to also work through the core guidance given the product line exits we'll be doing in Europe and the risk associated with the retail inventory liquidation onetime event with Depot-Max. All of that stuff goes into the crucible. We sort of let it simmer for a while as we cook a plan. And we'll come out with guidance at the end of January. But you're right. I've given you all the variables we're thinking about. And I did that purposely so that you could think about it while we're thinking about it.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Great. And Doug, just a couple of other variables. Can you maybe quantify the pull-forward on Home Solutions? And does that impact fourth quarter? And then also on the ASB, don't we, just from accounting standpoint, reflect that for the fourth quarter? I mean, isn't it fully reflected immediately?","Douglas L. Martin","It's, to the second point first, yes. There'll be some impact in the fourth quarter, but it's very, very small. It depends on when we actually execute the agreement to go ahead and begin, and then the amount of shares we get at the very beginning. So I would say that's a very, very small impact on the fourth quarter. And to your first question, we're not going to give -- I'm not going to give, I guess, a specific number on what shifted from Q3 to -- Q4 to Q3 on the Black Friday promotions. But it was -- it moved their revenue number a little bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, number one, does the ASR change your thinking on the dividend? Or is that still a priority, in terms of growing that in line with cash flow?","Michael B. Polk","Look, Chris asked a good question, don't you have plenty of capacity left? Yes, we do. We will -- we've articulated what our guidance is on dividend payout ratios. And we said 30% to 35% would put us in the competitive zone versus our peer group. It's not quite as high as fast-moving consumer goods, but it's competitive. And we've moved a long ways over the last couple of years. You should expect us to sustain that and to grow and increase our dividend. Of course, this is the board's call, but you should expect us to recommend to the board that we will continue to do that with EPS growth. And I think that's a good assumption to make. And it's an important one for you guys to make in the context of your modeling of free cash flow.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then second question, on the consolidation in the office superstores, kind of how should we think about that? Obviously, there's been inventory drawdown as you lead towards the closing. But as you think about 2014, is it your sense that there's going to be sort of this consistent or persistent headwind, either as they move to rationalize stores or further consolidate their inventory? Or how should we think about that? Is this the kind of thing where we get through 2013 and boom, the headwind goes away? Or does it stay with us for some time?","Michael B. Polk","So I think, and I was trying to, I was -- in my commentary, I was suggesting that it stays with us for a while. I think it's through 2014. Of course, it will be all dependent on how they execute their integration plan. And we just don't have a line of sight to that yet. And we won't until they complete their merger. But they're clearly working on it. And as soon as they're through and have approval of the deal, they'll share that with us. They have been -- and there's plenty of press reports out there about the number of store closings that will occur. And I think that's the biggest driver of the retail inventory consolidation, will be the number of stores they close. And if you look at that data, you begin to -- you can triangulate on the numbers that we shared with you. The big question, Wendy, is over what timeframe do they execute this. Is it focused in a 6-month window? Is it spread out over an 18-month window? If it's spread out over an 18-month window, then we'll have a slower impact. And it's more manageable for us. If it's in a very focused window, it will create an event that we'll try to share with you that might impact our ability to deliver sort of a steady flow of EPS and growth. We'll be as transparent as we can with you. I actually view this not as a strategic issue for us. This is something we're going to have to deal with. We need to keep our finger on the pulse of it. And we need to continue to invest in our Writing business for the strategic long term. The worst thing we could do in this environment is pull back investment or think about the category differently than we do. It's a strategically very, very attractive category, on trend, particularly in the emerging markets as people move from the low end of the social pyramid to the middle class. And they tend to access education more actively. Writing is right in the heart, it's an education tool business in those geographies. So it's very, very strategically attractive to us. And we're going to manage through this moment in time, in this disruption connected to the Depot-Max integration with that in mind.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then I just have one final one, which is just in terms of your stated target of expanding or growing your advertising spending, I mean, as you work through your plans and see how much you're spending and the kind of payback you're getting, do you have a number in mind in terms of, hey, we kind of want to migrate to 3.5% of sales, 4% of sales on advertising? Because I'm curious, I mean, you've been very careful not to give us a timeframe for the company to reach the 15% sort of operating margin target. And we're kind of 1.5 years after your analyst meeting. I'm wondering kind of whether you can give us a target for that?","Michael B. Polk","Nice try. Not yet. Look, I'm going to look at the advertising investment without a targeted investment level in mind, because I want to see if it's working. Some of the categories we're investing behind, like Tools, I want to see if we get a yield or we can drive equity perception on the brands and get pricing leverage out of it, or that we drive takeaway with it. So we've put $10 million behind the Tools business. That's the biggest investment we've ever made in Tools in Q3, ever, in strategic marketing funds. And so we're going to -- Richard Davies has research in his bloodstream. He's very objective about this stuff. And he's going to measure it. And we're going to learn from it. And he and Rich Mathews are going to decide whether that's a good thing for us to invest in, or not, to drive profitable growth. So I don't know what the answer is, to be honest with you, with respect to what the A&P level ought to be. I know we have an appetite to spend more. I can tell you that. But we're not going to do it in an undisciplined way, because we've made a commitment to steadily improve operating income margin, which we're on target to do, maybe even do a little bit better than we thought we would at the beginning of the year. And we're going to want to do again next year and the year after and the year after. So if you do the math, eventually, we cross over that 15% threshold. And I'll decide maybe between now and CAGNY whether we want to give you a date. Nancy's kicking me under the table saying, \"No, we don't.\"","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First, I want to ask about Commercial Products. So 2 things. One is in this healthcare dynamic. And I know you said you know, kind of position for things to be better next quarter. So can you talk a little about why there is or isn't a structural issue in the healthcare market that you're worried about, will be one. And then, two, if you could talk about performance in the balance of the Commercial Products business? I think Executive Series was launching this quarter and just sort of other dynamics across that portfolio there?","Michael B. Polk","Look, we love our Rubbermaid Commercial Products business. This is a great business. And we're investing in it, both on the development side increasingly, and in the selling side. And we have tons of opportunity, both in our home markets and as we extend the footprint into Latin America and into Asia, particular interest in China. There are a lot of local competitors, but there's no strategic competitors in the categories that we work in. There's some in some of the adjacencies, but very few. So if we apply the best capabilities we have against this category, we can build this category quite strategically and do so in a very profitable way. So I remain very, very excited about this. It is the first one on our list of priorities, Commercial Products, Tools and then Writing. And so I'm not at all fussed about the Q3 outcome. We see and have every reason to believe that the core of the portfolio continues to grow quite nicely and on the full year, will deliver good numbers. In the medical carts, or in the healthcare vertical, we're not having an issue with our core business, cleaning, refuse, all of those products are doing just fine. When we talk about our medical carts business, we're talking about high-ticket items. If a hospital's going to buy into our line, they're buying 250 carts. And each cart could be $3,000 to $5,000 because of the technology built into them. So these tend to not be choices made by the buying department. They tend to be made either in the IT group or made by somebody that controls the capital budget for the hospital. And that's where the pressure is in the healthcare vertical, not in the everyday procurement, the more consumable side of our portfolio. And I think this issue is one we have to accept and deal with until there's a little bit more clarity for these health networks in the context of all the changes going on in the U.S. And so it's in that slice of our business where there's going to be some overhang. It's not -- it's less than 10% of the total business in the U.S. So it's not a huge piece of the portfolio. Actually, right around 10% of the total business in the U.S. So it's that piece of the business that might have some overhang on it. The rest of our business, it's off to the races, it's core, and it's profitable and it's interesting.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So Mike, was the decline, though, in this high-ticket cart significant enough this quarter, like it's something we should be thinking about for the next couple of quarters? Because it's tough to imagine there's a ton of visibility on the healthcare environment in the U.S. near term. I'm just surprised that 10% of sales will be this much of a drag? Or if there was something else in the other businesses, just a timing issue or something from the quarter?","Michael B. Polk","I think the way to think about that piece of our Commercial Products business is that you shouldn't expect a lot of growth there. We'll probably be treading water for a while until that clarity occurs. There may be some step-backs. It's not a very profitable portion of our business. That's the other thing to know, because we're -- we have a fairly high SG&A base as we're scaling it. So it doesn't really have any flow-through, huge flow-through negatives to margin. It'd sort of be immaterial on EPS. But on growth, it's sort of an opportunity that we've been leveraging that loses a little leverage for us going forward. But the rest of the portfolio should be unaffected. We should get core growth on the 90% that I was referring to. But I wouldn't worry about it in EPS. It's just sort of -- there's an opportunity cost connected to not being able to grow it as much as we had hoped. And I think that you're right, Lauren. I wouldn't build a plan based on our medical cart system growth in 2000 -- that was dependent on that in 2014.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just last, on Tools, because you didn't mention Lenox at all. So just curious or assuming that, that's continued to be soft in China and the U.S. and just the macro [indiscernible]?","Michael B. Polk","It actually -- no, I didn't mention it, but thanks for serving up that pitch to me. Actually, Lenox had a good quarter and is positioned to have a good quarter going into Q4. So we're actually looking better on that business in the second half than we were in the first. So we've got a little bit of momentum rebuilding there. So that isn't an issue.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is that China and U.S., Mike?","Michael B. Polk","I'm sorry?","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sorry, is that in U.S. and China?","Michael B. Polk","Both.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","How important is gross margin to the delivery of the Game Plan? Only because it seems like, at least for the time being, there's going to be sort of a natural mix drag given what's going on with Fine Writing and obviously, also with the Writing business broadly and then the outsized growth in the, obviously, in the Baby care business?","Michael B. Polk","I mean, it's obviously very important. And I think gross margin's the lifeblood of any business, it's not just ours. So gross margin percent increases are really quite essential, particularly as we move through '14 into '15, as we lose the leverage in overhead reduction. So it is critical that our activity systems sharpen. And we consistently deliver gross margin percentage increases quarter in and quarter out. There are some mix issues in our business that we should accept willingly, our Baby business, for example. There are 3 factors to -- that you have to look at to determine what a great business is. One is growth potential. One is gross margin mix and operating income margin mix impact. And the other is how much fixed investment you have tied up in the business, what's the return on net assets? Baby happens to be one of those businesses which has a great return on net assets because we have no factories. And we don't take -- we have very, very short supply value chain. So our inventory levels are quite low. So the return on net assets on that business is very high. But in order to get that, you have to accept lower gross margins, because the supply partner takes a piece of the margin. And that's a mix negative I'm perfectly happy, and you should be perfectly happy, for us to accept. And I'll just give you some reference point. If you go back to 2011, we've probably grown EBITDA in that business $50 million. If you think we can get 9x on that business, that's $450 million, $500 million of value creation, despite accepting the mix negative to our total overall performance. So you want us to grow that business. We create a ton of value for your investors, our investors. And we should accept that the negative mix effect to gross margin. Now not all businesses look like that business. And so I don't aim off at all what I said upfront. We need to get gross margin percentage positive. We need to get positive price realization every quarter. I'm pleased that we've gotten positive price realization in the third quarter for the first quarter in the last 4. And we expect that to accelerate as we go into Q4. Meri needs to, through the supply chain that we're building, deliver increased productivity contribution to the overall gross margin delivery. And we need our selling organizations to maximize the mix as they look to drive our growth. And we need to bring margin accretive innovation to the table through Mark Tarchetti's group and the development teams. And so all of those things go into delivering the outcome you're wondering whether we're committed to, which of course we are.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. So will gross margin, it will definitely improve sequentially, but will it be up year-over-year and then maybe will you have gross margin expansion in 2014?","Michael B. Polk","We need gross margin expansion in 2014. And we will deliver gross margin expansion in 2014.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But the fourth quarter is probably going to be down year-over-year again?","Michael B. Polk","No.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","No? Good. And then can we just -- can you get, Doug, can you just walk us through the gross margin bridge? I'm a little bit confused, because I know it was 40 bps negative mix, but what was the balance of that?","Douglas L. Martin","Well, there was a little bit of pricing, as Mike mentioned, Bill, in that piece as well, and mix, inflation and productivity largely offset in the quarter.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just like lastly, on Europe, can you just take the other restructuring charge there? Because I think the business is still below corporate average or well below corporate average in terms of operating margin. So is the goal in Europe to get that operating margin up to the corporate average or even higher, especially if you want to use that money to fund emerging markets growth?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. We want -- there's no need for another restructuring program. We've got plenty of room in Project Renewal. And it was always oriented towards funding what we need to do in Europe. We want to get our absolute productivity -- our absolute profitability up in Europe. And I'm happy for the operating income margin to go up as well. It's really important for absolute productivity to go up, particularly U.S. GAAP absolute productivity, because remember, we have a tax-efficient model in Europe. And we get a mix positive in Europe if we're able to do that -- so on our tax rate. So you get a flow-through of profitability to EPS at a much higher rate than you would in, for example, in the U.S. So it's really critical that we get our European profitability up. We intend to do that. And we are doing that, quite frankly.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And then a quick last one. I mean, will you use acquisitions as a way to enhance your gross margins, like anything you buy is going to be gross margin-accretive to the overall business? I know it's a year off, but it's good to look for [indiscernible].","Michael B. Polk","Okay. Yes. So it's a little ways off, Bill, to kind of give you the criteria we would use. It depends on the business, quite frankly, because there's some very high gross margin but high SG&A businesses that would be dilutive at operating income margin. And so I'm reluctant to kind of peg the margin number in the middle of the P&L. What I'm most interested in is whether we get leverage all the way through to operating income margin. And I'd want it to be cash-accretive. And I'd want it to be strategically consistent with gaps we might have in our existing portfolio. Again, I don't envision us going to the shoulders of the portfolio. If we did any M&A, it would be in the core.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Really, on Tools, I know Wendy went a little bit over that, but can you talk a little bit about the Tools margin? It's one of the lowest that I've seen. And I know that you put $10 million of investment in there. And I think you said you're going to do the same in the fourth quarter. When will we see the margin enhancement there?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. No, we're going to invest in A&P in the fourth quarter, but it actually is going to shift from Tools to different businesses, so to be more balanced. You'll see operating -- you should see operating income margins step up in Q4 on Tools. And you'll see that continue as we profit from scale. What we're doing, Budd, is we're managing our A&P investment very dynamically. When you change the company from a holding company to an operating company, you have the flexibility to do that dynamic resource management and move money around. So we invested behind the ideas in Q3. And the ideas were big in North America and in Latin America on Tools, the launch of the extended line in Brazil and the commitment to build National Tradesmen Day out as a core platform in September. So you have the convergence of those 2 big bets. And you would -- if we showed you the full P&L for Tools, you'd see A&P pull back in Q4 and us leverage our selling systems as the driver of continued growth.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so will the growth actually accelerate in Q4 as well over the 5.7% core? Or -- and how should we think about that for Tools in the fourth quarter and maybe into 2014?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. We haven't given -- we don't guide on growth, Budd, by quarter. We don't guide on anything by quarter, and we don't guide on growth by segment. But one thing to think about with respect to Tools is that given the launch in Brazil of that extended line, there was a pipeline benefit in Q3 that doesn't repeat in Q4. So whether we're able to sustain that growth rate in Q4 is a -- I wouldn't plan on that, but should we have solid growth? Yes.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just talk a little bit more about EMEA, what you're planning to do there. I congratulate you on that, but give us maybe a little bit more color, maybe you went over so quickly, I couldn't quite keep up with it.","Michael B. Polk","No problem, Budd. I think you kept up with it, but I'll go back to it and see if you can mine some extra data out of me. We're pulling out of certain country category sales as an enabler to be able to release the infrastructure cost in Europe. And that's particularly true in our HiQ businesses like baby gear, where that ties up a lot of warehouse space. So as you think about what I said, we took out a bunch of distribution centers. We took out a bunch of different customer service centers. And so by focusing on the unprofitable portions of our baby gear business, we obviously improved the margin delivery in Baby, but we also enabled the fixed cost to come out on, connected to the infrastructure. Now the 50-country territory sales that we'll exit are not high-revenue sales for us, but they carry cost with them. There's all kinds of intangible costs with respect to invoice processing, transactional, cost connected to serving those markets in the way we do. And so it makes no economic sense to stay in some of these markets, and because they're not attractive and they're not strategic in the context of the Growth Game Plan, it makes sense to accept the revenue loss and assume that we get administrative benefits out of that through some of the restructuring we're doing on that side of the equation. It's really important for us to do all this for 2 reasons. One, those costs in part will be reinvested into what we describe as the most strategic and attractive sales in Europe. There's probably about 20 to 30 country-category sales that are investable in Europe that we can grow if we put the proper A&P behind these businesses. And we will use some of the proceeds to do that. After having done that, we expect to be able to increase absolute profitability and margin contribution to the total company. So this is a pretty strategic and important set of choices we're making. It will enable a more sustainable European business, while at the same time, contributing to the investment we want to make for market share growth in our home markets and the extension of a select portion of our portfolio into the faster-growing emerging markets.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I congratulate you on that. I've only heard about Europe being attacked like this for, maybe 20 years, from the company. So if you get it done, this is going to be great. So I look forward to learning more about it and seeing the results.","Michael B. Polk","Great. Happy to take you through it in more detail at some point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'm wondering if you would discuss a little bit what you learned about the Hilmor launch in 2013, and what kind of rollout that might suggest for next year?","Michael B. Polk","Yes, Connie, things are going right where we -- right on track with where we'd hoped they'd be at this point. This is a pretty seasonal business. So we come into the core season as we enter Q1, core buying season as we enter Q1. The vast majority of these tools are used -- these are HVAC tools. The vast majority of these tools have leverage through the air conditioning season, but the buying season for that is January, February, March. So we come into that season, obviously, having been out there and in distribution for a bit of time, in a very good position to be able to leverage the Hilmor brand through all the trade events that will occur in that window. We're really pleased with the feedback we're getting about the product. At some point, we'll find a forum to share some of the verbatims from some of these technicians on the products themselves. And that's really important to us long term. I do not envision us extending that product line outside of the U.S. in 2014. And I think that was the heart of your question. We expect to kind of keep the business focused and learn, with another year of investment here. There's some innovation work going on to extend the portfolio next year in the U.S., and we'll think about when we extend that footprint beyond the U.S., as we come through next year. But this is a stay-in-the-home market play for the moment, with an ambition to go more broadly over time.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, just 2 more, I think, short questions. On the ASR, should we assume that it will be completed within the course of 2014? Or do you think it would be done over the next few months? And secondly, what kind of return did you see on the Rubbermaid Home Solutions merchandising events? And will you spread that marketing practice to other categories?","Douglas L. Martin","So Connie, this is Doug. I'll handle the first part of that, and then Mike will jump in on the Rubbermaid piece. The ASR is -- we expect to execute that in the next week or so and then execute, as in sign on the dotted line with the banks on that. And we expect to have that implemented over the -- in the first part of 2014, before the first half is over.","Michael B. Polk","Connie, on your question with respect to the Furious 5 merchandising events, as we called them, which were 5 drive periods on, largely on Rubbermaid Consumer Products. We were very pleased with the outcome. It obviously contributed to a strong performance, particularly on the food and beverage portions of the Rubbermaid Consumer portfolio. And those are highly attractive businesses to us. Gross margins are positively -- they are accretive, certainly, to Rubbermaid Consumer, and they're strong and in line with the company average, which is unique for that overall portfolio. So this is the attractive portion of their portfolio. It's also the on-trend portion of that portfolio, given some of the issues that are out there regarding disposable storage containers and the concerns that many environmental groups have with them. So this is a very positive space for us. We continue to plan to invest in it. And next year, you'll see continued investment. In this business, we have to be very careful how we manage that. So we've been buying frequency of events, but we have to be very careful on letting price points get away from us on merchandising. So we've set up a framework and sort of guardrails for the selling teams to ensure that they don't, as they increase frequency of merchandising, don't dip price points outside of our pricing principles. And that's really an important thing for our sales leaders to manage. And we are increasingly doing the kind of research you need to do to understand what those thresholds look like through Richard Davies' new consumer insights group.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Doug, just wanted a clarification there, where you talk about the ASR being executed, you're talking about the banks going in and actually buying the stock back, right? Not when you get credit for it?","Douglas L. Martin","That's correct. We expect to have that happen over the first part of next year, first half of next year.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then one, what I hope is a quick question here, as we look at you guys making a bigger push in emerging markets, obviously, there's been a lot of volatility, some slowdown, et cetera. Is that anything we need to be worried about? Or is it something where you guys are just building that business up so that sort of the volatility in some of the economic activity really doesn't have much of an impact on the launches?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. There's 2 parts to that answer. One is on the growth side. No, I think given where we start from and what we're building, the GDP data that you see doesn't really -- maybe 10 years from now, when we've scaled in a big way, this will be a variable that somebody's talking to you guys about. But it's not that critical to our overall success from a top line perspective. That said, some of the currency volatility does impact transaction, have a transaction ForEx effect, depending on what our sourcing strategies are in gross margin. And we talked about currency being negative in gross margin. It is, in part, related to that. And this is something we have to actively manage. It doesn't change our strategic intent. It doesn't change our ambition or our inclination to invest to strategically build our brands. We just have to manage it and cover that cost through that process. And that's the kind of expectations we make of our leaders of the segments, that they deliver the growth, they play for the strategic outcome we're looking for, while managing the transaction ForEx impact in their gross margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to get a little bit more detail on the restructuring. Clearly, the detail that you gave in Europe was very helpful. But can we expand that to total Newell? Can you talk about like what's been done to date, how many distribution centers, service centers, manufacturing facilities you've exited as part of Project Renewal?","Michael B. Polk","We haven't put that together, but I think that's actually a good idea for us to do. And maybe we should get that organized for CAGNY. We don't look at it that way. We look at it by work stream. So if you recall, we talked about Project Renewal, the next phase of Project Renewal having a series of work streams connected to it. And we sort of organized our thinking around that. But I think it's a good idea. I have mentioned publicly some of the impacts on the top leadership tier of our organization. And we've really flattened the structure of the company through this process and come a long way in doing that. There's a little bit more work to do, but the vast majority of that is now behind us. But I think that's a good request. And I think we should think about how to capture that, maybe at CAGNY.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sounds good. The other question I had is with Baby, now that it's been recharacterized and out of Incubate, has anything changed in terms of the way that you think about the business as far as investment levels?","Michael B. Polk","Okay. Yes, I had talked about investable ideas and investable teams, and given the progress we've made on margin in that business, and I mean operating income margin, so take a look at that segment's profitability, this becomes an interesting business to invest in. And we're growing on growth in the year-ago period. It's an interesting category in that it's product innovation-driven and selling-driven. And while we have an incredibly strong brand in Graco, we haven't put a lot of A&P behind it. We need to think through about -- think through over time, how -- whether the algorithm for growth that we've delivered is one that is -- that we can sustain without putting A&P into the business. And we'll explore that. But our passion for this business has increased over the last couple of years as we've gotten the business sorted, and that we've got a very good leadership team, both in development and delivery on this business. We've got -- we've strengthened our relationship with our supply partners. I had dinner with them just a week ago. And our customer coverage models and our partnering relationships have strengthened as well, substantially under Kristie Juster's leadership. So I talked about investable businesses and investable teams. And this is one of them. And I have some appetite to sustain this, given what I -- given the answer I gave to Bill, because with the low fixed investment in assets and the low working capital on this business, we can create a ton of value if we grow it. So yes, it's interesting. It doesn't change some of the structural issues I've raised in the past with it, with respect to its potential in emerging markets. Those markets are not developing at the speed you might think, because of the fact that you need regulatory catalysts for that to occur. So the emerging market opportunity, while strategically out there, still is probably a little bit further into the distance. So that makes it less strategically attractive in the context of our overall agenda. But because we've demonstrated the ability to capture share in our home markets so aggressively over the last 2 years, there's opportunity to do more of that. And you should expect us to continue to play for that portion of the market, share growth in our home markets.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Just one quick follow-up on that. Is there opportunity for Baby & Parenting margins to get closer to corporate average? Or is there something inherently specific about Baby & Parenting that will hold its margins down relative to your ability to grow other product segments?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. I think the big issue is that our supply partner takes a portion of those margins, right? So because we don't have the fixed assets and we don't have the inventory, they do. And they charge us for that. They cover that cost in the way that we get billed for the sourced volume we do. And that shows up in gross margin. And you should think of that as probably anywhere from 700 to 1,000 basis points of cost that we absorb in our P&L. So if we had our own fixed asset base, that would be flowing to our P&L directly, but we don't.","Douglas L. Martin","There are a portion of those costs, Olivia, too, though that they cover on our behalf that we categorize in SG&A, too.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So I think there's -- yes, this is an attractive business. Again, I'd look at this one through the lens of return on net assets as opposed to margin accretion. And ideally, I'd love to get more margin into the business, but -- and we should be able to do that steadily, as we have up until now. But it's not mission-critical for this one to be above fleet average, to me, given that grown-up is well above fleet average.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. I know this call has been going on for a while here. So I guess I wanted to go back, first, to price realization. I think this is something you guys were looking for in the second quarter and didn't get. And it sounds like you got some this quarter and hoping for a little more in the fourth quarter. Is that a situation where you saw some of your competitors match your list price increases? Or is that easing up some of the merchandising activity that you saw last quarter?","Michael B. Polk","It's a blend of both. I mean, it's different by category. And we end up with a price mix effect that flows through to this, depending on segment contribution quarter in, quarter out. But we're pleased, again, with the fact that we deliver positive price. And when we talk about positive price, we're talking about invoice price net of customer investment, that gets us to our price contribution to gross margin. We expect to accelerate price in Q4 as a result of continued progress on invoice pricing flow-through and us continuing to manage the customer investment as effectively as we possibly can.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just secondly, in terms of the Writing business, obviously, you're going to have a pretty big impact from the Depot-Max merger at some point. If you just put that to the side for a second and just look at the office superstore channel, obviously that's been weak for some time and continues to be weak. Are those sales lost? Or are you recapturing those sales at Wal-Mart or Target or other channels, for example?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. We have very big growth outside of that channel. And you see channel shifting happening. So we've seen very good growth in places that you wouldn't traditionally think of as sources for Writing instruments. And I think that will continue to happen, that channel shifting, as the office superstores sort through their strategic agenda and the balance of how much of their business is focused against commercial selling of writing instruments versus retail selling of writing instruments.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A lot of detail on the call today. I just wanted to ask you more of a kind of a holistic question on the U.S. retail environment, what you're seeing, if you could comment through October in terms of sell-through, how retailers in the form of your businesses are positioned inventory-wise. That'd be great, just because we've seen a lot of mixed headlines out there, UPS, I think put out some cautious commentary out there today.","Michael B. Polk","No, I haven't seen the UPS. They're right down, literally right down the street from us. We don't see -- right now, other than the dynamics that are playing out in the office superstore channel, which is really related to their business model and changes they're making in their business model, we don't see major dynamics out there in the rest of the portfolio or in the rest of the retail landscape. There are always, and I mean always, issues out there with respect to inventory positions at different customers. But there's nothing out there that I would highlight as being something strategic. There's constant rebalancing that goes on. If an event doesn't yield as much sell-through as you thought it would, somebody's going to pull back. But we don't see any indications of that in our numbers, that there's some holistic strategic shift in inventory management. And we look at it quite closely, obviously, because it has a pretty immediate revenue impact for us, if there were. The exception to that has to do with the office superstores and the challenges they're facing this year.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer period. If we were unable to get to your question, please call the Investor Relations team at (770) 418-7075. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Polk for any concluding remarks.","Michael B. Polk","Look, as always, I'd like to thank you for the challenging questions and the involvement in our business. We feel pleased about the progress we're making. And as always, I feel like there's still plenty of work to go do. So with that, we look forward to talking to you at the end of January to provide a perspective on the full year results, and also to provide 2014 guidance.","Operator","Today's call will be available on the web at newellrubbermaid.com and on digital replay at (855) 859-2056 domestically and (404) 537-3406 internationally, with an access code of 74470822, starting 2 hours following the end of today's call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","A live webcast for this call is available at newellbrands.com on the Investor Relations home page under Events and Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download.","I would now like to turn the call over to Nancy O'Donnell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O'Donnell, you may begin.","Nancy O'Donnell - Newell Brands, Inc.","Great, thank you. Welcome, everyone, to Newell Brands first quarter conference call. I'm Nancy O'Donnell, and with me today are Mike Polk, our CEO, and our Chief Financial Officer, Ralph Nicoletti.","During the call today, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the comparable GAAP numbers can be found in our earnings release and on the Investor Relations area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Please recognize that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to update any such statements made today. If you review our most recent 10-Q filing and our other SEC filings, you will find a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations in such forward-looking statements.","With that, let me turn it over to Mike for his comments.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call.","We have a lot of ground to cover this morning, including our first quarter results, the expansion of our Accelerated Transformation Plan, and the signing of a definitive agreement to sell The Waddington Group. So let's get started.","First on the quarter, I'll let Ralph to go through the details. But in summary, our Q1 results were roughly in line with what where we told you we would be after factoring in the incremental news that Toys \"R\" Us [TRU], our largest baby customer and a top-10 global customer for the total company, announced a complete liquidation of its U.S. stores, an escalation from its previous announcement that only about a quarter of its stores would be closed.","We stopped shipping TRU in March, and they quickly initiated their liquidation process.","As a result, we lost about $25 million of core sales in the quarter and $0.015 of EPS beyond what we had guided.","Net sales were over $3 billion, roughly in line with our expectations, as ForEx partially offset a largely baby-driven core sales shortfall. Gross margin came in a little better than expected despite increased inflation in resins and transportation versus plan, as we began to benefit from positive price in a number of businesses.","Our normalized EPS of $0.34 was in line with our assumption for Q1 before the negative impact of Toys \"R\" Us and before we recognized the positive impact of a tax benefit, which was factored into our guidance on the tax rate for the full year.","In the U.S., our aggregate market growth grew about 1%, and we experienced share growth in home fragrance, baby, food, beverages, and writing, with share declines on appliances and outdoor rec equipment. So the quarter was roughly in line with our previous outlook adjusted for the TRU bankruptcy.","In what is turning out to be one of the more challenging periods for many of us, 2018 has started off where 2017 left off, with significant U.S. retailer disruptions in both our Baby and Writing businesses and general challenges with inventory reductions and trade term negotiations across the broader U.S. landscape. We're taking decisive action to focus our portfolio, change our go-to-market programs in key channels, and evolve our organization to focus on the businesses, customers, and channels best positioned to leverage our advantaged capabilities in brand building, innovation, design, and e-commerce.","The world is changing much faster than anyone anticipated, and we need a faster path to value creation. Speed and agility will flow from focus: focus on our portfolio; focus on our operations; focus on the sharpened performance in creating commercial value from our consumer ideas; and focus on taking the actions necessary to fuel our advantages.","We're clear that job one is to strengthen the operational and financial performance on our continuing businesses. Our strategy is unchanged: drive category growth and consolidate market share through leading brands; leading innovation in product design; and a scaled commercial business system designed to efficiently and effectively reach consumers where they shop, with a huge future opportunity to deploy the portfolio internationally.","We're equally clear that the fundamental approach we use to build brands, develop innovations, and reach consumers through our customers is right. It's been tested, validated, and proven to work. The evidence is most visible in the market share progression we've experienced over the last five years in the categories where we've applied this formula.","That said, we can apply this approach with greater nimbleness and responsiveness and in the context of a renewed view of our retail landscape, with a sharpened set of category strategies and with resources reallocated and focused on the activities that will best drive market share consolidation, increase margins, and create shareholder value.","There are also things we can do differently both organizationally and in the way we work. We can strengthen connectedness across our organization. We can work faster. We can partner better. And by doing so, we can work more effectively and at lower cost. We will undoubtedly evolve our organization and the way we work over the coming months, as we adapt designs and processes to the new portfolio and renew our focus on the core operations of the company.","As always, the work to strengthen our organization's effectiveness should be measured through the outcomes we deliver, to reignite our core performance, reduce cost and increase margins, build our capabilities, and create shareholder value.","In this context, today we announced the expansion of the Accelerated Transformation Plan. Our new board, together with the management team, has conducted a comprehensive review of our businesses and the strategy for the company. Following this review, the board supported the decision to explore strategic alternatives for eight businesses, comprising about 35% of the company's net sales. These eight businesses include three industrial and commercial product assets, Waddington, Consumer & Commercial Solutions, and Process Solutions, as well as five non-core consumer businesses, Team Sports, Beauty, U.S. Playing Cards, Jostens, and Pure Fishing.","Although these assets are strong businesses with great teams and a promising future, they do not fit our global branded consumer goods business model or feature prominently in our overall investment priorities. They can and will, however, play a more strategic role for others.","Our decision to add Jostens and Pure Fishing to the original announcement was based on our belief that, by doing so, we could accelerate and maximize shareholder value creation by leveraging the divergence between our current depressed share price on the one hand and strong multiples being paid on the other. Both businesses have leading brands and have been performing well, and as a result, enter the process from a position of strength. All of these assets should command competitive multiples.","This morning's announcement, the sale of Waddington, validates that belief. We've signed a definitive agreement to sell Waddington for about $2.3 billion in gross proceeds, and we expect to generate approximately $2.2 billion after tax. This is a 12 times multiple on adjusted EBITDA. We're very pleased with this outcome because it reflects the impact of the management team and key corporate leaders on improving the operations of Waddington during our two years of ownership.","We've integrated what was an acquisition-driven roll-up portfolio, invested in building out the management team with greater supply chain and productivity expertise, invested in Waddington's fast-growing Eco platform and other innovations, and executed a successful profit turnaround in Waddington's European business. This organic profit development has yielded significant shareholder value, which can now be put to work on behalf of the business and shareholders.","We're confident that we can deliver and drive similar value creation through the remainder of our divestitures. In aggregate, we expect to generate approximately $10 billion of after-tax proceeds that can be used in combination with operating cash flow over the next two years to significantly reduce our leverage ratio to well within investment-grade range and to repurchase over 40% of our outstanding shares if we were to execute those repurchases at today's stock price.","We expect to allocate about 55% of the after-tax proceeds to share repurchase, and we expect to apply 45% of our after-tax proceeds to deleveraging our balance sheet. We will maintain our commitment to investment-grade credit rating. We also intend to maintain the current per share dividend through 2019 and grow it within our 30% to 35% payout ratio target range thereafter.","We expect the divestiture process to be completed by the end of 2019. We believe the quite substantial cash proceeds we expect to generate applied to derisk the balance sheet and to significantly reduce shares outstanding should drive meaningful value creation for our shareholders over the near to medium term.","Once completed, the Accelerated Transformation Plan will result in a simpler, faster, and stronger Newell Brands. The new portfolio will comprise seven consumer-facing divisions, which generated about $9 billion in revenue in 2017 and are expected to generate about $9.5 billion by 2020, with normalized operating margins greater than 15%, an increase of roughly 300 basis points versus the 2017 pro forma.","We plan to move as quickly as possible to offset about $150 million of retained costs associated with the divestitures and to recover about $50 million of synergies sold with the businesses, which we will achieve by right-sizing our corporate infrastructure and rationalizing the transactional back office to align with the company's simpler and smaller footprint.","This new portfolio is well-positioned to deliver competitive results. Approximately 80% of sales for the continuing businesses hold number one market share positions in the U.S. Approximately 70% of the new portfolio sales will be U.S.-based, with the balance generated in international markets, with plenty of opportunity for geographic expansion off scaled positions in Europe and Latin America.","The new portfolio will maintain our scale advantage and efficiency benefits, with the top 10 brands accounting for over 60% of sales and the top 10 customers accounting for roughly two-thirds of our sales in the U.S. This customer route-to-market homogeneity should improve our scale and efficiency.","Importantly, approximately 20% of the company's U.S. sales and 15% of the global sales will be generated from the rapidly growing and margin-accretive e-commerce channel, reducing the future fixed cost burden expected from continued brick-and-mortar retailer consolidation and maximizing the growth and margin potential of the company.","The reshaping of the portfolio will significantly simplify our operations, as we expect to divest 66% of our factories, 55% of our distribution centers, 58% of our customers, 45% of our brands, 39% of our head count, 51% of our over 500,000 SKUs, and nearly all exposure to private label. We will also dramatically reduce our resin exposure, and more than 90% of our sales will be just on two ERP systems by the end of 2019, as compared to well over 30 today.","This significant simplification will provide much greater visibility into the underlying business and allow even greater scrutiny of the cost base, positioning us to identify and unlock future value through strengthened cost in working capital. Management and the new board are committed to drive the Accelerated Transformation Plan into action and reignite performance on the continuing business, as we build a leading consumer goods company that delivers strong results and significant value for our shareholders.","Let me pass to Ralph for a very quick review of Q1. I'll then return to discuss our outlook for the balance of the year and make a few comments on the recent external activity that's occurred subsequent to the resolution of the proxy contest. Over to you, Ralph.","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone.","Reported net sales were $3 billion, a 7.6% decline versus last year, largely attributable to the negative impact from divestitures net of acquisitions and lower core sales. FX contributed a 2-point benefit.","As a reminder, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard using the modified retrospective transition method, which was roughly a 1.5-point headwind. We have also adopted the simpler constant currency methodology for calculating core sales in response to requests from many of you and in line with industry practice. Core sales guidance excludes the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions until their first anniversary, and completed divestitures.","Our core sales declined 3.5% during the first quarter, primarily driven by the temporary but meaningful disruption in the Baby and Writing businesses. The March announcement by Toys \"R\" Us of their reorganization and subsequent liquidation primarily drove the shortfall versus our expectations for the quarter. As Mike noted, we expect to see an even more significant impact in the second quarter before seeing improved trends in the back half of the year, as we gain business which switched to other customers.","Reported gross margin declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 33.3%, while normalized gross margin was down 120 basis points year-over-year to 33.3%, primarily due to the headwinds from increased commodity and transportation costs and unfavorable mix, mainly from Writing.","Reported SG&A expense of $880 million represented 29.2% of sales as compared to last year's ratio of 28.5%. Normalized SG&A expense was $744 million or 24.6% of sales compared with $780 million in Q1 of 2017, reflecting the benefit of cost synergies, partially offset by investment in e-commerce.","Reported operating margin was 3.9% of sales compared with 4.7% in the prior year. Normalized operating margin was 8.7% versus 10.6% in the prior year. Net interest expense of $116 million was below last year's level of $122 million, primarily reflecting a lower debt balance versus year ago.","During the quarter, reported tax was a benefit of $51 million compared with a 19.2% tax rate in the prior year. The normalized tax rate was a benefit of 11.5% versus a 28% tax rate in the previous year. In the current quarter, we realized a net discrete tax benefit associated with the integration of various legal entities. For the full year of 2018, we continue to forecast a tax rate of 20% to 21%.","We ended the quarter with 487 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.","Reported earnings per share were $0.11 as compared to $1.31 in the prior year. As a reminder, in the year-ago period we realized a $784 million gain on the Tools divestiture. Normalized earnings per share were $0.34, in line with last year, which included about a $0.02 per share benefit from divested businesses.","Now turning to our segment results, net sales in our Live segment came in at $1.1 billion, rising 0.4% relative to the year-ago period. Core sales decreased 3.1%, as low single-digit growth in the Appliance & Cookware business was more than offset by high single-digit declines in the Baby business, which was negatively impacted by the previously discussed bankruptcy of its major customer, Toys \"R\" Us. We expect a headwind from the TRU bankruptcy and resulting store liquidation to be even more pronounced in the second quarter.","Net sales for the Learn segment were $495 million, down 13% year over year. Core sales fell 14.3%, due to the reduced top line for the Writing and Jostens divisions, with the latter lapping a difficult year-ago comparison, which included the benefit from a new Cubs contract. The Writing business was down double digits, as it continued to face headwinds from significant destocking in the office superstore and distributive trade channels. As we have previously indicated, we expect Q2 to be a tough quarter for the Writing business, as it laps pipeline fill on Elmer's and we continue to work with retailers to quickly get to their significantly reduced inventory targets.","Net sales for the Work segment were $641 million, reflecting a 4.4% year-over-year improvement. Core sales grew 5.5%, driven by strength in both Safety & Security and Waddington.","Net sales for the Play segment were $617 million, a decline of 1.8% versus prior year. Core sales contracted 2.6%, as strong growth in Team Sports was more than offset by weaker performance in the Outdoor & Recreation division, reflecting previously communicated distribution losses on airbeds and camping items, partially offset by strong growth in beverageware.","Net sales for the Other segment were $193 million, declining 50% year over year, primarily due to divestitures that were completed in 2017. Core sales declined 4.1%, as growth in the Home & Family division was more than offset by timing-related softness in Process Solutions.","Now moving on to cash flow, during the quarter operating cash flow was a use of $402 million compared with a use of $264 million in the prior year. The year-over-year contraction was primarily driven by higher cash taxes, including the $135 million payment of the remaining taxes on the gain on the Tools divestiture. We project full-year cash from operations in the $1.15 billion to $1.45 billion guidance range, assuming continued ownership of all businesses for the entire year.","Clearly, with today's announcement of the Waddington transaction, we are off to a good start with the divestiture program. While we are committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, our divestiture program will enable us to reduce leverage and repurchase shares.","As of next quarter, we expect to qualify for discontinued operations treatment in our reported financials, and we'll update our guidance for that discontinued operations treatment at that time.","I'll now turn the call back to Mike.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Thanks, Ralph.","This morning the company reaffirmed our full-year net sales, normalized EPS, and operating cash flow guidance. We continue to guide assuming ownership of all assets for the full year so that investors have clarity as to the underlying performance of the business.","The company, within that guidance, expects to absorb a $0.07 to $0.10 negative impact to normalized EPS, driven by the TRU liquidation, with the most significant impact in the second quarter. The company now expects first half core sales growth to decline low to mid-single-digit percent relating to the negative impact of the TRU liquidation, the comparisons against the prior-year Elmer's Slime pipeline build, and the company's drive to rapidly achieve revised retailer inventory targets established by new leadership and new ownership in the office superstore and distributive trade channels.","Two factors could influence the delivery of this guidance. The first is the impact of the TRU inventory liquidation process and the potential cross-customer competitive dynamics unleashed. TRU started with nearly $200 million of baby gear inventory across the industry, as best we can estimate. To date, we've not experienced significant volatility in retail pricing. However, discount levels at TRU have only been in the 20% to 25% range. We currently expect TRU's liquidation process to extend through the end of June on our business. We are working with our other Baby customers to capture more than our fair share of the business forfeited by TRU through new ranging and programming.","The second factor influencing delivery has to do with the first half drive to reset inventories in the office superstore and distributive trade channels to revised retailer targets. We're making excellent progress and expect to exit the first half of 2018 well on our way to the revised targets set by new leadership and new ownership. The four leading customers in these channels represent nearly 25% of our global invoice sales on Writing. We've chosen to accelerate the delivery of the revised inventory targets into the first half of 2018 in order to get the Writing business back into a normal rhythm during and after back-to-school.","Clearly, there are other factors that are quite important to the success of the company and the delivery of our results, including the sustained performance of our e-commerce business. E-commerce is on track for another strong year, and we expect the business to accelerate through the year, as the lost sales through TRU baby registry's web platform are recovered by other retailer-dot-com and pure play dot-com players and through our own GracoBaby.com web store.","Before opening the call for questions, I do want to address the most recent publication from Starboard Value. I don't want to spend too much time here given all the news we have to discuss, but I would like to make sure you're working with the facts and you know that we're aligned on the important material. Much of what has been proposed is consistent with what we are actioning in the Accelerated Transformation Plan or is already in flight within our cost programs, but let me just level-set on some of the facts.","No, we don't have five planes. We have two. No, we don't have our own pilots. They work for EJM [Executive Jet Management], a subsidiary of NetJets. No, we don't have five headquarters. We have one 40,000 square foot floor in a building in Hoboken, New Jersey, where we pay $16 per square foot after incentives.","No, we don't have 500 employees at VP or above. We have 239, a reduction of 48% since the Jarden acquisition was completed. No, we don't have 900 director-level employees. We have about 500, a 35% reduction since the acquisition. No, we don't have $120 million in transformation office personnel costs. We had about 40% of that number in 2017, and will have substantially less in 2018. And no, those people did not spend $16 million on travel and entertainment last year. They spent on average $10,000 per head, well below benchmark.","No, our HR costs are not high. They're at benchmark, as are our legal costs. The costs not at benchmark yet are IT and finance, and they will not get there until we implement our shared services platform, which is planned for 2020.","No, there is not corporate excess or largess. And no, I don't use a driver. I drive myself to work every day, same as I did every day for five years I worked in Atlanta, same as my dad did for 38 years at the company he worked for, same as I would expect my kids to do for the rest of their lives. If I'm in New Jersey, you can see me around 5:45 in the morning at Starbucks in my home town. And by 6:20, I'm at the 495 merge battling Lincoln Tunnel traffic into Hoboken.","On savings ideas, it's worth saying that we're open to any and all ideas, so bring them on. Just a couple of facts, no, our procurement organization is not decentralized. It's been centralized since mid-2016. And we've consolidated buying power and rebid $4.6 billion of spend in about 90 categories since then, saving $200 million. And yes, we are working supplier payment terms in our contracts as well. And yes, we are redesigning products for savings with a 50 engineer large product redesign team. They've executed thousands of projects over the last three years, saving tens of millions of dollars. We'll happily add new ideas to the list if Starboard or anyone else has them. There's no pride of authorship.","Thank you for highlighting the mop example on costs. The teams identified that as well. And the Quickie Mexico factory referenced in the document was closed in Q4 2017, with that particular mop outsourced to China. There is no Quickie manufacturing plant in New Jersey. That was a Quickie office facility that was closed when the business was integrated with CCS. Those folks are now based in North Carolina.","No, travel and entertainment expense is not 1.5% of sales. It was 1% of sales, or 33% lower than claimed, and about the midpoint of peers. Yes, we agree, more opportunity exists here. Yes, scaled travel and expense management systems can reduce costs. In fact, we went to a single travel partner in 2017, Egencia, and a single corporate card program. And we have two expense management systems, Concur, as Starboard suggested, and XM.","Some of the business and savings examples and organizational examples are worth mentioning as well. No, R&D and brand marketing are not centralized. They are organized by division and mostly collocated with the division commercial operations. They are center-led, so that we apply common practices and processes across the different divisions for scale and efficiency.","No, there is no central team working on innovations. Division leaders and division cross-functional teams work on innovations side by side with the people accountable for innovation development. One group has accountability for development and the other commercialization. Both groups participate jointly in the monthly gate-keeping meetings that are run in the divisions, not centrally.","Design on the other hand is centralized as a community of practice, but no, there are not hundreds of people in Kalamazoo. There are about 150. These people are doing early prototyping work on the fit, form, finish, and function of our core product propositions and our innovations. We did that to save money and build capabilities because, for the most part, design expertise was outsourced or did not exist when we started.","The centralized design teams in Kalamazoo are something to be proud of, as is our enterprise-wide e-commerce division. These are two of the advantaged capabilities that enable us to win market share as we have versus our subscale competition.","No, e-commerce does not make pricing decisions independent of divisions. The division trade marketing teams set the pricing strategies for the brands in each geography and establish the merchandising and distribution objectives by product family. The e-commerce team develops and executes the tactics through their different customers to deliver the strategies and objectives set by the divisions. The divisions set the price principles and the e-commerce teams get the price executed. Yes, sometimes in execution we have price equilibrium problems between e-commerce and other retail channels, just as we do between different brick-and-mortar channels like club and mass.","Let me end with just a few comments on Yankee Candle. Our Yankee Candle business is a multichannel business. About 25% of our revenue is generated in our own retail stores. Purchases in the category and of our brands are largely impulse-driven, so promotion activity is very high, particularly in our own stores, where we often promote at half price or lower in order to draw foot traffic into the store. This drives the average retail price in our own retail stores at or below the price paid every day at Walmart. The materials presented are a bit misleading because they compare a non-promoted price in our own stores to a promoted price at Walmart.","Perhaps more importantly, Yankee Candle is a brand that works perfectly in Walmart. To assert brand management in our practice and that Yankee Candle does not belong in the hands of a Walmart shopper, in my opinion, suggests a lack of understanding of the brand positioning of both Yankee Candle and Walmart. Yankee Candle is not a luxury brand. It is a mom, family, home comfort positioning, always has had that positioning, even back in 2005 and 2006 when I was on the board.","We did not enter Walmart half-baked. We test choices like these with consumers before we do it. We would not have entered Walmart if we were going to damage the Yankee equity because we're a brand and innovation-led company. Brands like Olay, Estee Lauder, Dove, Ben & Jerry's, Samsung, and KitchenAid are all sold at Walmart quite successfully without any damage to the brand. I know because I had responsibility for two of those brands in the U.S. in a prior life. I think Yankee Candle will be just fine. And by the way, it's off to a very good start.","So we don't have time nor would it be productive to do a point-by-point rebuttal. I think there are a number of important points in the paper that we will consider, and as I said, we're open to any and all ideas, so bring them on.","I think the paper misses one big point and that is where we started from with the Jarden acquisition: 55 P&L units; greater than 0.5 million SKUs; 106 factories; 39 ERP systems; 58 shared service sites; 5,500 IT applications with the overhead to support each one. There is significant cost and efficiency opportunity in those numbers, and we're all over it through our synergy and savings program.","But perhaps more importantly, as I suggested up front, we clearly agree that there's a tremendous value creation opportunity in front of us at Newell. We agree that the Newell Brands portfolio be comprised of a tremendous portfolio of leading brands. The two legacy companies contributed to create that portfolio and will be roughly 50:50 represented legacy Newell and legacy Jarden. We agree with the potential to strengthen the financial and operating performance of the company, and we're on it. And we're glad to see that all parties are finally aligned behind the Accelerated Transformation Plan we initially announced back in January and have now expanded.","As I've repeatedly said, there's always more work to do and we can always do better. We're in the thick of it right now with the challenges on Baby, the reset in Writing, and the scope of the change agenda we're driving.","I recognize the opportunity in the organization. There are things we can do differently, both organizationally and the way we work. We can strengthen connectedness across the organization. We can partner better. But I'd like you to be clear that change of the kind we're driving comes with people costs that are not financial. You fracture relationships, which weakens people's connection to the company. It takes time to rebuild those connections and the excitement about the company's future.","The last five months have been quite difficult for our people, with outside forces driving a wedge between with those prepared to embrace the future and those perhaps not fully ready to commit. I'm happy the proxy contest is settled. I believe it's time to clear the way for our people in management to focus on execution and to pivot to the future.","I'm personally looking forward to spending much more of my time focused on the operations of the company. I can't wait to get back to working with our people on building brands and building categories, partnering with customers and suppliers to help them and us create value, engaging with our teams to help them solve problems, and working unproductive costs out of the system to fuel our advantages and drive margins.","I'm also looking forward to building new relationships and drawing the expertise of what I expect will be a highly engaged and enthusiastic Board of Directors. I'm very pleased with the composition of the board. We will have great perspective in the room. And based on my conversations with them, I believe they're going to be great advisors and partners, and of course, fulfill their oversight in governance duties as well.","Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to recognize our employees for their resilience and commitment. The last several months have not been easy, and I'd like to sincerely thank each and every employee for their patience, dedication, and perseverance. I hope today's announcement has brought clarity to the organization as well as to the investment community.","With that, let's go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will hear first from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Hey, the first question I guess, Mike, you've now got a largely reconstituted board, a lot of fresh sets of eyes here, and it sounds like they're fully behind the expanded divestiture plan. But beyond that, what new ideas or course corrections have they advocated, or is it still too early at this point?","And then if I could squeeze in a second one, your revised core sales growth guidance still does assume some growth in the second half. If you could, help us understand what the drivers of that are, particularly since a lot of the headwinds you guys are facing right now are largely out of your control. For example, does that assume any additional destocking or customer disruptions in the second half? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","So, Joe, let me start with your second question first, and I'll come back to the first one. The vast majority of the challenges we'll have in Baby and Writing are going to be second quarter focused. Baby obviously started in the first quarter. Writing, we've come through a series of events, and that also contributed to the underlying weakness in Q1, but we had that forecasted. The TRU liquidation was not in our plan, as you know.","In Q2, we're going to experience pretty significant dynamics. As I mentioned, you've got TRU that's going to be liquidating its inventory. If you think about it, what that does is it draws consumers into their franchise. Their POS will go up as they liquidate their inventory, but other retailers won't be purchasing in that environment because they're taking \u2013 because of the values that TRU will provide, they're taking purchases out of the market. We also had in our plans business built through the TRU business system in Q2. So you have the double-barreled effect of us not being able to sell anything to TRU in the U.S. and TRU's liquidation activities taking sales away from some of our other Baby customers.","We're working aggressively to mitigate that, looking to build our share position in the other major retailers in the U.S. It's been a non-stop conversation actually since TRU announced their 182-store closure plan and obviously accelerated from mid-March on. And we're making good progress there, expanding, ranging, and building out incremental programming into those retailers.","We expect that liquidation activity to really wind down by the end of June. It may bleed a little bit into July. But then Baby \u2013 as long as not too many consumers purchase their gear earlier than they normally would, which would be typically from six months of pregnancy onward, there is the risk that people get into the market earlier because of the price points on liquidation. But assuming that they don't, we get a return to normalcy on Baby in Q3 and Q4. And we've got very good activity and very good relationships and we're making good progress on ranging and programming at these other customers. So I do think that the Baby Gear business begins to recover through the back half of the year. I wouldn't say Q3 will be a gang-buster, but it will be a step in the right direction.","On Writing, we expect a similar profile through the back half of the year, with much of \u2013 we're absolutely accelerating the liquidation into these new targets as best we can in the first half of the year while also setting up the back-to-school season, which is a little bit tricky. The Writing issues may bleed a little bit more into Q3 than Baby. But once we come through the back-to-school merchandising period, I think we get back into a rhythm of normalcy on Writing, which obviously has been in arrhythmia since Q3 of 2017.","So those are the two businesses that are requiring a lot of attention. Clearly, as I've said before, we have a much stronger innovation funnel building on the rest of the portfolio.","As you recall, all the way back to the beginning, I told you that it was 18 months to 24 months gestation period on innovation development, and the middle of 2018 would be the period where innovations start to ramp. That's clearly the case on appliances. That's clearly the case on outdoor equipment. And we have opportunity in the back half of the year on both of those businesses connected to that activity level.","With respect to the board, look, I think this board's going to be extraordinary. I think they've got us \u2013 there's a lot of points of view in the room. They're comfortable expressing them, and we're comfortable receiving the feedback. And so that should lead to a really positive and interesting dynamic, with good debates and new ideas that we'll be able to consider as we think about the agenda we're driving.","So I'm encouraged by the connections that have been established so far, by the energy level of the directors, and by the possibilities of the new board for the management team and for the company. So I think it's going to be an exciting place for us to pressure-test some of our ideas and for those folks with all that experience to provide us counsel and guidance.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thank you, Mike.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, Mike, I understand it's been an extraordinary period over the past few months, but just trying to make sure we understand. Are we now at a d\u00e9tente? Because you just walked through refuting or rebutting a document from what are, I think, soon to be new board members. And so I guess the question is, can things change further from here, or is this the plan in place?","And also, just a side housekeeping question on the $10 billion of after-tax savings or after-tax proceeds from the divestitures, what is the before-tax? What is the expectation with tax leakage and what that is? Is that $11 billion? Is that $12 billion? Any color there would be great.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. So the board has formed and has come together and is beginning to get into a rhythm of operating as a group. I'm sure there will be new ideas that people have to offer, and I'm sure there will be things that the board is going to want to challenge in the way we're thinking about things, and we're completely receptive to that.","What I've seen in the meetings that have occurred, either directly or on the phone, I think when different ideas are offered, they've been offered in a very constructive way. And I can't say it any other way other than we're completely receptive to the perspectives that are being shared because I think they're being shared with the interest of the company in mind. And when that's the approach, I'm all ears. And so I'm encouraged by what I see up until now.","I intended in my commentary to not actually be disparaging in any way about the Starboard material. I just wanted to correct the record because I think we are largely aligned on the substance of the Accelerated Transformation Plan. And I'm all ears on any ideas they've got with respect to how we strengthen the organization or strengthen the culture. I just want them to \u2013 I would love to offer up to all of our investors to make sure you understand the facts and the baseline and where we started from and where we are in the journey. And if we're not thinking about things in a way that you think might be valuable for us to embrace, bring it on, as long as it's in the interest of the company and its future.","And with respect to the board and the engagements I've had with them so far, that's clearly where they come from. And I suspect that in our conversations with investors that that's clearly where the vast majority of our investors come from; that they're offering advice because they want to help because they've got an investment in this company and they want to see value created, which we have shared an aligned interest around.","So I don't think there's a divergence on many fronts. To the degree that there are investors out there that have a different view on management, et cetera, that's fine. They should express that. Management needs to be accountable for the outcomes. And I'm certain that this board will hold us accountable, and I welcome that accountability. So I don't think there's really any issue out there, although I think some folks in the press want to try to create one because it's good reading material.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. And in terms of the total expected sale price for the divestitures?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Oh, yeah. I don't want to give you that because I don't want to \u2013 it's going to be dependent on, to your point, on the tax dynamics. And I don't want to go through that up front because, obviously, these are live negotiations, so I don't want somebody leveraging that. But you saw from the deal we did today that there's very little tax leakage because we did a lot of work on structuring that helps set up a gross-to-net proceeds dynamic that was very, very favorable. And I think some of the concerns that are out there about how do you go from $6 billion to $10 billion with two assets added to the mix are in part driven by some miscalculations with respect to the tax leakage.","As I've said repeatedly, one of the opportunities in the moment is tax reform. That helps, but we have a lot of experience in tax structuring activities. So those two things \u2013 that certainly is a contributing factor to how you bridge to $10 billion.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mike, a few questions. Hopefully I can peck through these quickly on the 2020 outlook. Can you comment on the decision to increase the asset sales going from the $6 billion to $10 billion, and what changed? Why did that become a much better idea just a couple months after you guys had announced the initial $6 billion? That would be question number one.","Question number two, on the pro forma $9.5 billion in sales looking out to 2020, what is the assumed underlying growth rates on those businesses from today?","And then the last piece, Mike, on the margins, which you said greater than 15%, I know you're careful about what you say, but that's not very different than where the margins are now, where the margins were for Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden prior to the deal. And I'm just trying to get my head around \u2013 and we didn't spend a lot of time on this call on the cost synergy piece, which has been sizable, at least as initially framed, up to $1 billion, and I'm just trying to figure out where that is in that 15% number. So thank you for all that.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. Let me \u2013 if I miss something, Kevin, in my response, make sure to call me out and I'll make sure I answer it as best I can. So let's start with the margin question on the end. One of the things that we've done in providing the pro forma data which you see \u2013 if you go to the web deck, you'll see a pro forma schedule for 2017. Two of your questions, one on growth rate and one on margin dynamics, on growth rate, you can back into the growth rate. We've assumed no ForEx benefit or a cost. So you can look at the underlying growth rate between what we've articulated for 2020, the rough number, and what we've established for 2017 pro forma in the web deck.","On margins, the important thing to remember is as we come through Q2 into Q3, assuming we get traction on all these assets, which we are very confident we will, we'll probably move into a period where we embrace disc-ops treatment. And disc-ops accounting requires us to take all of the retained cost and all of the corporate cost that can't be allocated as a direct overhead cost and put them back into the retained and continuing businesses.","So what you see in 2017 pro forma is the company burdened by costs that today are spread across the total landscape landing on the pro forma P&L. And so obviously, we're going to get those costs out. That's why I said what I said in the script. But you've got a new base established that you have to work off of to get to the other outcome, the outcome we've articulated.","And you're right, I'm going to be conservative in the way I look at things, but I do want you to remember that you have to think about things that will work against us from a cost perspective in that window. You should assume that we continue to see inflation through that period. You see that picking up in the current year on resin, on transportation, on sourced finished goods, and that will continue year by year by year. We've also assumed that we're going to increase our people's salaries in line with an appropriate merit increase. There's a cost that comes into the P&L connected to that.","And so obviously, you've got different dynamics playing out there. Obviously, there are underlying benefits like gross productivity. There are underlying benefits like positive price if we believe we can get that, and then you've got the synergy work all working towards a cumulative outcome.","But the reason it steps back and the reason I've said greater than 15% has to do with the need we will have to get the retained costs out of the system. Now you had some other questions between those two.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Mike \u2013 the one piece, Mike, was just the decision to increase the asset sales from the $6 billion to $10 billion, and that was done consistent with Mr. Icahn's suggestion and his group. What changed, in your view, in terms of the plan that you guys initially had that made that a much better idea to get rid of Jostens and Pure Fishing than you initially thought?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","I think \u2013 I've made the point about focus. I think that clearly is true in the world we're in, getting our management team focused on the assets we intend to build going forward. While both of those businesses are really interesting businesses, in some ways neither benefits as much as the ones we've chosen to keep from the capabilities we've invested to create in innovation and design and in e-commerce. While Fishing has a bit of an international footprint in the Nordic and in parts of Europe, it is less of a big global opportunity than some of our other businesses, and certainly Jostens is geographically constrained.","So our choice on those assets really was more about timing than anything else. We believe that they're performing well. We likely would have bartered those assets for something different into the portfolio from 2021 onward, and we've just chosen to accelerate that activity and create value for shareholders in a different way, given their environment, the environment we're in with our depressed share price, with tax reform \u2013 potentially temporary tax reform in place to minimize leakage.","It's the intersection of those themes that drove us to choose to go now, get this company reset for the future, pass as much value as we can back to shareholders in the near term while we're going through this change program, and get 100% of the management team focused on the activities that will build the future of the company.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, Mike. Good luck.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, good morning. Hi. Mike, I had a question on your divestitures. I'm curious how aggressive you're being with these in general. And then would you explore strategic options or divestitures for some of your other businesses? And then I'm also wondering if you'd be willing to hold on to some of the businesses if you don't receive an appropriate multiple.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Let me be clear. We're looking to deliver competitive multiples. We're not in a rush to do anything, and we have pretty high expectations that we'll be able to deliver competitive multiples. So if we find ourselves in a position where we don't feel like that makes sense, that something doesn't make sense, the board will very likely say keep your powder dry and wait for another moment.","With respect to your question about balance of the portfolio, we feel strongly about the balance of the portfolio. These businesses are really well positioned to leverage our capabilities that we've built in innovation, design, and e-commerce. They have broad geographic footprints with the potential to broaden them further. They've got leading positions. As you recall, I said 80% of the brands \u2013 80% of the revenue in the U.S. has number one share positions in these categories. And so we feel terrific about that.","I would never say never with respect to thinking about potential assets. We've been very consistent in that point of view all the way back to 2011, but I can't envision over the next number of years playing anything substantially different out than this. There are some interesting options available to us in the core of our business with respect to organic development. We're playing those stories through. But again, you never say never, and that's been consistently how we've approached M&A as a company for the last seven years.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And, Mike, if I could just ask one more because I think it is really important. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your culture and employee morale. A lot is going on at your company, to say the least. So I really want to hear from you your conviction level that your employees are motivated enough to carry out your transformation plan. And then how are you retaining the talent you need and incentivizing them to carry out this plan? Thanks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Bonnie, it's an excellent question. It's a really important question, and it's why I made the point about creating this space for management to get back to doing what we are accountable for doing. Any change agenda as broad sweeping as this one that takes out significant head count like this one has already, and will in the near future as we reset our corporate infrastructure for the size of the company we will have, comes with costs. And I don't mean financial costs, I mean people costs, employee morale costs.","When you do change management of this scope, you fracture relationships. You break a social contract between people and their company. And it's not as much about the folks that leave as it is about the uncertainty that's created for the folks that are staying. And it's really important for us to engage and listen actively and work to help people understand where we're headed and the company we're trying to build. And that takes a lot of time. It's an important part of what leaders are accountable for, and it's an important part of what I'm accountable for.","There is no doubt that in the moment we're in right now, employee morale and uncertainty is quite high. That's why it was important to get today's announcement out there. As disruptive and jarring as it might be for folks at Jostens and Pure Fishing, it provides certainty for the balance of the company and clarity for the balance of the company as to where our focus and energy is going to pivot towards. So that's an important first step.","But it goes way beyond that. And it's going to require the entire leadership team to get externally focused and into the business so that we can listen and actively engage and address concerns people have. Part of that has to do with retaining talent, so you're right. And you can count on us to focus on doing that in the appropriate way. And part of that has to do with us listening actively to the feedback we're being given.","Later this year, we'll implement what's called an engagement survey that will reach out to every employee in the company, in the remaining company, and that will be probably about 24,000 employees. So unlike Glassdoor, where you get 150 data points, we're going to get 24,000 data points. And we'll be able to cut the data by factory, by location, by tenure, by gender, by ethnicity if people offer that perspective up, and by age if people offer that perspective up. And we'll be able to get a read on where people are.","We have an 81-question questionnaire that we've used repeatedly at Newell Rubbermaid that we'll use again so that we can benchmark our scores against prior scores. We get verbatims. We collect verbatims from all 24,000 people in every language in the world. Last time we did this, which was before the Jarden acquisition, I read every single verbatim. And I will do it again because there's lots of texture that comes through that feedback.","So I think, Bonnie, it would be disingenuous of me to tell you that we've established a culture and that it's positive. But clearly, our intention is to build a positive performance culture at Newell Brands, one that recognizes the importance of accountability, one that recognizes the importance of building an own-grown organization, where we're not as dependent on talent in from the outside. But we are building an organization that's self-sustaining, that's dependent on an ecosystem that values individual development and growth from within.","That has to get going and there's a lot of work to do to breathe life into it, and it's not going to happen overnight. It happens over a period of time. There is no culture switch you can flip. Culture is earned over a period of time. And you can count on me personally to think about that as the most important aspect of my legacy in this company going forward. And we've got a lot of work to do there.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Now we'll hear from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. So, Mike, I was hoping to touch more on your longer-term portfolio. I was hoping for a couple more stats you can provide there. So maybe just first, how are you thinking about category growth for what's remaining? And as you look at your remaining portfolio, how much exposure do you think you'll still have to challenging parts of the U.S. retail backdrop? Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Rupesh, good question. Category growth should grow and has historically grown in these businesses in line with GDP. That growth rate over time may increase as we deploy the portfolio internationally because there are higher growth rates in these categories outside of the developed world. And so as we increasingly head in that direction, which is clearly a long-term goal of the company, you should see category growth rates over time accelerate.","In many ways, we own the category growth rate because we have the leadership positions in these businesses. And so if we're doing our work, if we're spending the right level of money, if we're bringing innovative ideas to market that expand the relevance of the category or premiumize the category, we'll see growth rates accelerate. So in some ways, we have an obligation to drive that as the leaders.","But I think the way to build a plan is to look at GDP growth and then decide whether there's an overhang in the U.S. related to retailer consolidation. I think as we look at the path forward, there will be that overhang, but we're taking action in the first half of the year to deal with the most acute aspects of our exposure, dealing with these new retailer-driven targets for inventory levels in the distributive trade and the office superstore channels. That actually is helpful to us long term to take that hit now, get that inventory down to whatever their target levels are, and then move forward from there.","If you look at our exposures and you look at the opportunity we have in e-commerce, we have a big e-commerce business in this new company, 15% of our revenue globally e-based, 20% of our revenue in the U.S. e-based in the new model. So we are going to get a growth mix and margin mix benefit to the P&L from that presence. That will more than offset the exposure we have in distressed retail formats. And the biggest areas there are in specialty and department and in the Writing channels that I've described to you and in our own Yankee Candle retail format, where we will continue to exit retail as leases become obsolete.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you. Good morning. I have one question related to sales but in three parts, please. One is I was hoping you can clarify the comment about the $200 million excess inventory at TRU. And is it all of your products or the whole industry inventory?","The second part of the question is overall, your whole business, how much of the inventory reductions at retailers is actually destocking or lost shelf space?","And lastly, the third part of the question, should we expect any stock-outs from your ERP transition or mostly will it be back office related? Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","So on the $200 million inventory number I provided, that is our estimate. We don't have knowledge of that per se. That's our estimate of the inventory level that Toys \"R\" Us had of Baby Gear product across the entire industry when they declared bankruptcy \u2013 or when they declared their liquidation. Our exposure in that channel is obviously less than that but pretty much in line with our market share at TRU, which was in the high 30s. So that's where we started.","Obviously, we're sitting here in the middle of April, late April, actually early May now, and they've been liquidating from the point that they announced, so inventory levels have come down quite a bit. So my comment about TRU inventories related to the fact that every sale that happens there as they liquidate those inventories has no new revenue, no sell-in behind it. And to the degree that they're taking more than their fair share of the market into their stores or as part of the liquidation process because of lower price points, that's taking purchases away from the other Baby Gear customers that are out there. And therefore, they are not issuing replenishment orders as they might normally do because their POS is being impacted by the liquidation. So that's the moment we're in on that aspect of things.","We also built a plan that assumed only 182 stores were going to come out this year as opposed to 800 in the U.S. So we have a Q2, Q3, Q4 hole in our customer business plans to fill. We think Q3-Q4, that hole will be filled by other retailers because, by that point, the liquidation process will be over. And just as consumers buy product when they're pregnant and there's nothing going on with the birth rates, and typically they buy from six months onward, and 70% of the category sales are first-time expectant moms. So there will be demand in Q3 and Q4 that TRU will not be satisfying that other retailers now will be. And we want to make sure we capture more than our fair share of that demand. So we do think things recover.","So on Baby, that's what I would say. Andrea, could you give me the other two questions you had as well? I was so absorbed in Baby, I lost them.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Before we go, just to clarify with what you just said, so you're saying that your flat to low single-digit guidance now for core sales growth actually implies that you're not going to have additional \u2013 you're going to have these 180 stores to 800 being absorbed by the other retailers as you progress the year.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","After we get out of Q2, early Q3, that's how this will play out because the market is not going to shrink. People are getting pregnant. 70% of the category sales, they need car seats, they need strollers. They're going to buy somewhere. So they're either going to buy at Walmart or Target, at buybuy BABY, at Amazon, or off of our own web platform.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But do you believe that you have the same market share of high 30s on these other retailers? That's actually my next question.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","We're going to make sure we do. We're the leader in the U.S. That's the whole point about being out there and working to capture more than our fair share. In some places we do. Most of the big places we do. In one place in particular we don't, and we're thinking about how to make sure we get that faster than other people can.","One of the advantages we have, and I say this when we talk about the company strategically, is that we've got the advantage of scale versus subscale competitors that tend to be single-category-based. And so as we compete against other folks, we have more resource to be able to deploy in moments like this than other people do. So we're going to cover that landscape and we're going to look to make sure we build our market share through this process.","But your point is right. Share is not the same everywhere. And our share in Baby Gear was higher at BRU than it is in aggregate in the general market by about 20 \u2013 30 basis points. So we're going to want to make sure we capture that and then some. And we should have the firepower to do that as a company of our stature, with the ideas we're bringing to market, and as a company with the resources we've got.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And the other two parts of the same question is that if you believe that the inventory reductions at retailers is actually only inventory reductions, or are you actually suffering some shelf space issues? And the other part was the stock-outs that you may encounter with the new ERP. Is that something you are considering or that's not part of the plan?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Let me be clear about ERP transitions. We have one major ERP move going on. We just did \u2013 we went to SAP on Appliances & Cookware in Latin America, and we will go to SAP on Appliances & Cookware in North America in the third quarter. Other than that, most of our ERP transition work is behind us now. So the massive reduction in ERP systems actually doesn't have anything to do with ERP implementation. It has to do with us selling assets that brought the complexity of ERP systems, of those 39 ERP systems to the company. So that's sold simplification is the way I would characterize that. So, other than this major transition in A&C and a couple of little...","Ralph J. Nicoletti - Newell Brands, Inc.","Smaller ones...","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","...smaller ones we've got to do next year, the ERP transition is behind us. That's why I say that as we get to the end game here by the end of 2019, we'll have the kind of visibility and information management tools to be able to identify new opportunities for productivity, new opportunities for working capital optimization, because simplification doesn't come through some protracted ERP implementation plan. It comes through the simplification of the portfolio.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And that the second part is, just on the shelf space, how is your shelf space and distribution points behaving ex-TRU? How are you now looking at this across all the businesses, please?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","I'll give you the answer I give to my teams, which is I'm not happy, not because we've declined. We've got good shelf presence, but there's huge opportunity for us to apply category management skills in these categories to broaden our presence. There are really unproductive SKUs in many places that are competitive SKUs that we ought to be able to dislodge by making the business case for that with our retail partners.","So I'm never happy with distribution, ever, on the core, and I'll never proclaim success. There'll never be a banner across the bow of the aircraft carrier that says mission accomplished. There's a ton of distribution opportunities available to us in the core in the U.S. And that's before you consider outside the U.S. opportunities.","We're challenged in some cases by the physical cube of our products, which we've got to get creative around. I'm not happy in Appliances & Cookware, for example. I think we need a broader physical presence. We need the right portfolio, visible at retail, such that people can see the full price continuum from entry point to premium, as they can on e-commerce today. And so we've got to figure out how to do that, and the answer may be some sort of multichannel solution.","But the thing that I'm most excited about in the moment is getting back to challenges like that one as opposed to what I've been spending my time on for the last number of months. That's where I can add more value is in the business, partnering with the divisions, thinking through some of these interesting challenges that have tremendous revenue and profit connected to them. That's where I can create the most value. And that's where I'm going, assuming the degrees of freedom widen here as we move forward.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And it's marginally getting worse or starting to get better, how that process is?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","We've made major progress on distribution over the last six years. If you went back and look at our total distribution points in 2012-2013 and look at where we are now, we're way better than we were. I'm just always dissatisfied with where we are, and I think we can do even better.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But most recently as you progressed from the fourth quarter into the first and then as you go into the balance of the year, how do you see the TDPs [Total Distribution Points] from a broad perspective, in the non-tracked channels of course because we can see the tracked ones?","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","I don't have any problem with our current distribution opportunities. We're looking for more. Obviously, there are puts and takes every year with respect to line reviews, et cetera. The places where we've got the most momentum right now would be in Home Fragrance and in Writing. And the place where we have the least momentum right now would be in recreational equipment, where we continue to spar with one of our leading retailers on their private label brand on that interface. So there's always a continuum of outcomes, but nothing structural or strategic to offer to you other than a general sense of dissatisfaction.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","We have time for one more question, and that question will come from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. Just a couple of clarification things. First on consumption, clearly there's a lot of noise in your numbers with the retail liquidations, inventory adjustments, et cetera. So can you give a sense of what your consumption actually looks like?","And then on Writing, you talked about getting ahead of the revised targets from retailers and Writing distributors, but I guess what's the rationale for fast-tracking that other than obviously being a good customer? Because I would have thought that as back-to-school approaches that you'd want to have more inventory on shelf, not less. And what are your competitors doing? Are they also trying to accelerate on delivery to those targets? Thank you.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","I don't know what our competitors are doing. I want to get to that point because I want to have our whole business model function on sell-out as opposed to sell-in and the disconnect between the two. This will not compromise at all our presence at back-to-school. We should have a strong back-to-school. There's no exceptions to that.","But getting this issue behind us so that we are growing in line with our sell-out I think is important because too much of our conversations with you guys and with others are focused on this divergence that's occurred between sell-in and sell-out. And so I want the entire organization pivoting to a sell-out-based marketing and selling model. Part of that is getting our trade programs designed and aligned in the right way. And so one of the gets we get in return for the give on speed on inventories is the new trade program in those channels that variablizes our investment.","And so there are reasons to do this in this way. And I won't go any deeper than that, but there are reasons to do this in this way that are in our interest from a margin development perspective going forward and from a working capital perspective going forward. So we're going to get this behind us as best we can in the first half and then get the business on turn as best we can going forward. What was your other question, Olivia?","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It was just around consumption.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","Consumption, as I mentioned, the markets grew about 1% on a sales-weighted market growth basis in the first quarter. Our shares were up about 10 basis points across the aggregate. We had share growth if the categories I mentioned in the script. And we were somewhere around 1%-ish, 1.5% POS growth in the quarter.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","All right, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Mike Polk for closing remarks.","Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.","I'll just end where I started. I think the most important message I can send at this point in time is to our people. I am grateful for the persistence and the determination and the focus you've exhibited through a very trying period of time for the company. And I appreciate everything you're doing to keep the business moving through this period where management and myself were a little bit disengaged and focused externally.","I'm sure some of you will be happy to note that we'll get back into the business, and I will particularly get back into the business, and maybe some of you won't be so happy about that. But that is where I'm headed. I'm headed back to visit with you guys and to get out and engage on the business issues and, for a period of time, turn my back a bit on the outside markets. And I look forward to doing that, you have no idea. Talk to you soon. Thank you.","Operator","A replay of today's call will be available today at our website at newellbrands.com.

This is Nancy O'Donnell, joining me on the call today are Mike Polk, President and CEO; and Doug Martin, Executive VP and CFO. During today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, core sales and normalized EPS. Please note that Newell has provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and in the IR portion of our website, as well as on our IR app. As we normally do, we also have provided risk factors regarding forward-looking statements in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. While forward-looking statements are based on our best currently available information, such statements include assumptions of future events that are subject to risks. Actual results may differ materially. We do not undertake to update any of these forward-looking statements.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Polk.","Michael B. Polk","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. This morning we reported a strong set of Q2 results across all key metrics, of course sales grew 4.6%, ahead of our expectations, as a result of strong growth in Writing, Tools, and Commercial Products. Combined, these businesses delivered core sales growth of 10%. Normalized gross margins increased 80 basis points to 40.3%, driven by increased productivity, positive pricing, and positive mix. Normalized operating margin increased 90 basis points to 15.8%, despite increased advertising investment of nearly 100 basis points, as we more than doubled our Q2 2013 advertising investment behind new brand campaigns and innovation. We delivered normalized net income growth of 12.6% and operating cash flow growth of nearly 52%. We returned over $160 million to shareholders in Q2, almost double what we did last year, having increased our quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share and bought back 3.9 million shares. And we delivered normalized earnings per share of $0.59, up 18% versus prior year and $0.04 ahead of consensus.","We closed the first half 2014 with good momentum, particularly on Writing, Commercial Products and Tools. Writing core sales increased 8.5%, in the first half, driven by market share growth in both geographies and better than expected back-to-school selling, in anticipation of heavy third quarter advertising, marketing and merchandising programs. Commercial products core sales have increased by 0.3% in the first half, as a result of strong volume growth in Rubbermaid Commercial Products in all regions, and the return to growth of Rubbermaid Healthcare in North America in Q2. Tools core sales increased 7.8% in the first half, driven by strong volume growth on Irwin, across all regions, and very good growth of Lenox in North America. These strong results in Writing, Commercial Products and Tools have helped us absorb the impact of foreign exchange headwinds, the disruption of the Baby & Parenting recall, the consequences of our strategic choices to enter certain -- exit certain product lines in Europe and reposition the Rubbermaid consumer business for profitable growth. Through the first 6 months core sales increased 2.8%, despite about 45 basis points of product line exits in Europe. Normalized operating income margins expanded 40 basis points, despite a nearly 80 basis point increase in advertising. And normalized EPS increased to $0.94, up 10.6% versus prior year. We're pleased with the momentum building in the business, having just transitioned to our new operating model 1 year ago. Since that change a year ago, we've begun to see growth accelerate. For the 12 months ending Q2 2014, our core growth rate has accelerated 60 basis points versus the prior 12-month period to 3.3%. While this is good progress, we're quite clear, there is more opportunity in front of us than behind.","Our Project Renewal savings program is right on track, and we're set to release incremental savings in the second half of 2014. These savings are being reinvested in the business for growth, just as our strengthened brand and innovation initiatives are hitting the market. With a focused effort of our new delivery organization, our global supply chain team and our operating segments are together identifying significant new opportunities in procurements, overheads, distribution and manufacturing network optimization, and complexity reduction. With the focused efforts of our new development organization, we're already seeing the quality of our innovation improve with new products like Sharpie Clear View highlighters, Paper Mate Mix and Match mechanical pencils, Graco 4EVER Car Seats and Irwin impact Performance Series accessories. We are producing new, more effective advertising, which has been validated in test, and is now in market, driving increased point of sale and market share gains across multiple geographies. And we've launched new campaigns on Sharpie, Paper Mate, InkJoy, Expo and Irwin, and in the second half, we'll launch new campaigns on Graco, Mr. Sketch, and Calphalon, the first advertising in years for these brands. Clearly, we are proud of our second quarter and first half performance.","With that, let me hand the call over to Doug, to go through a more detailed review of Q2 results, and then I'll return to provide some perspective on the balance of the year and our agreement to acquire Ignite Holdings and its Contigo and Avex brands.","Douglas L. Martin","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to provide additional details on the results of a very good second quarter for Newell. Q2 reported net sales were $1.52 billion, a 3.1% increase versus last year. Core sales, which exclude the impact of net unfavorable FX, increased 4.6%. Strong volume growth in our Writing, Tools and Commercial Products businesses, along with broad-based positive pricing across the business, was partially offset by weaker results in the Baby and Home Solutions segment and by planned EMEA product line exits. Reported gross margin was 40% and normalized gross margin was 40.3%, up 80 basis points over last year. This gross margin performance, our best in the nearly 27 years that I've been with company, reflects good productivity, pricing and mix, which more than offset inflation and unfavorable currency.","Normalized SG&A expense was $372.8 million or 24.5% of sales, down 10 basis points versus the prior year. As planned, we increased advertising spend by 100 basis points in the quarter to support InkJoy TV advertising in the U.S., Latin America, and Asia, as well as the launch of our 50 ways to use Sharpie campaign in anticipation of back-to-school in North America. We will continue to increase advertising investment in the back half behind our writing brands, as well as campaigns on Graco, Irwin and Calphalon. Normalized operating margin was 15.8%, up 90 basis points, reflecting gross margin expansion and operating cost leverage, partially offset by increased strategic investment in our brands and capabilities. Reported operating margin was 14% compared with 12.6% in the prior year. Interest expense of $15 million was flat year-over-year, and our normalized tax rate was 27.2% compared with 26.6% a year ago. We still expect the full-year normalized tax rate to be between 24% and 25%.","Normalized earnings per share, which exclude restructuring and restructuring related costs and certain other onetime costs, was $0.59, a $0.09 or 18% increase to last year. Second quarter reported earnings per share were $0.54, compared with $0.37 last year. The improvement in normalized EPS was driven by sales growth, gross margin expansion, a swing to a gain in net operating expense from a loss last year and lower share count, partially offset by negative currency. Based on current spike of [ph] work rates, we estimate the negative impact of translational FX to be between $0.03 and $0.04 for the back half of 2014. For the full year, total negative impact of both transactional and translational FX is expected to be between $0.12 and $0.14.","Operating cash flow is $96.2 million in Q2, a $32.9 million increase over the prior year. This is driven largely by working capital improvements. We returned $161.2 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $46.9 million of dividends and a $114.3 million and repurchased 3.9 million shares. We stepped up our repurchase activity during the quarter to take advantage of what we believe to be an attractive price. The lower number of shares outstanding versus last year contributed about $0.03 to EPS growth in the quarter, most of that $0.03 is attributable to last year's accelerated share repurchase plan and the repurchase activity during the quarter contributed about 1\/3 of a penny. As of the end of Q2, we have $141 million available under our $300 million authorization, and for the full year, we are now miling an annualized average share count of approximately 279 million shares.","And finally, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We have $143 million of cash on hand, and approximately $800 million in liquidity. As previously disclosed, we intend to finance the Ignite acquisition with a combination of available cash and low cost short-term borrowings. Our debt-to-equity, EBITDA multiple and interest coverage ratios continue to be strong, giving us continued financial flexibility for further share repurchases or acquisitions, should we choose to pursue these options.","I'll now move on to segment results. Starting with Writing, reported net sales grew 5.2% to $502.6 million. Core sales increased 8.9%. Our Latin America writing business delivered strong double-digit core sales growth, fueled by pricing and the continued success of InkJoy. In North America, core sales grew strong mid-single digits, as we were successful at shipping in a portion of our back-to-school offering earlier, in anticipation of our Q3 advertising campaigns and a strong back-to-school season. The Q2 normalized operating margin in our Writing segment was 26.6%, a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong productivity, pricing and cost management, partially offset by increased advertising spend.","The Home Solutions segment net sales fell by 2.6% to $388.9 million. Core sales decreased 1.8% due to a decline of Rubbermaid consumer where we are deemphasizing some low margin businesses and in the core, which is comping prior year load-ins and sizable window treatments. Partially offsetting this decline was good growth in Calphalon, driven by distribution gains. Home Solutions' normalized operating margin was 12.4%, a 110 basis points decline versus the prior year, reflecting the delevaraging impact of lower sales volume and input cost inflation, partially offset by productivity and reduced overhead expense.","The Tools segment delivered net sales of $222.3 million, a 12.3% increase. Core sales grew 12.9%, led by double-digit growth in Latin America and EMEA, with mid- single-digit growth in North America and APAC. If you adjust for the prior year pullforward of sales into Q1 related to the SAP Brazil implementation, Tool segment core sales grew 10.1% in the second quarter. We continue to have good success in Brazil with Irwin, which launched the second wave of its Brazilian tools expansion in the new product categories this quarter. We are also seeing strength in the Linux business in North America and EMEA.","Operating margin in the Tool segment was 13.5%, a 430 basis point improvement versus last year. This increase was driven by greater operating leverage from the stronger sales growth and gross margin expansion behind pricing, improved mix, as well as reduced launched brands supporting Brazil versus last year. Reported net sales in the Commercial Product segment increased 9.8% to $223.5 million. Core sales increased 9.9%. Rubbermaid Commercial benefited from favorable pricing and good volume growth in North America and Latin America. The Healthcare business also contributed to the core sales improvement, as we are now comping against a more representative sales pace.","Commercial product's operating margin was 16.2%, a 540 basis point increase to last year, thanks to leverage from higher sales and improved gross margin.","Our Baby segment reported $183.7 million in net sales, a 6.4% decrease. Core sales fell 6.7%, due to weakness at Aprica in Japan, which is facing increased competitive pressure, and also from planned product line exits in EMEA. Partially offsetting the decline was low single-digit growth in North America, as we are seeing a rebound from the recall related softness earlier this year. Graco has a terrific pipeline and innovation hitting the market in the back half, supported by strong advertising and promotion campaigns. We remain confident that the Baby segment will return to healthier sales trends in the back half. Baby's Q2 normalized operating margin was 6.9%, down 520 basis points to last year, largely due to the deleveraging impact of lower sales, a weaker yen and inflation, partially offset by pricing.","Looking at Q2 sales by geography. North America grew 3.4%, with strong results from Tools, Commercial Products and Writing offset by Home Solutions. In EMEA, core sales declined 80 basis points, driven by planned product line exits of $6 million, primarily in Writing and Baby. If adjusted, for the impact of these exits, EMEA's underlying growth rate was a positive 2.5%, due primarily to growth in our Tools and Writing businesses. EMEA's operating margin results improved significantly, as we are seeing strong results from the outstanding dedication and effort of our EMEA team, delivering on the transformation initiatives. In Latin America, core sales grew 48.6% due to strong pricing and volume gains. Adjusted for last year's SAP Brazil pull forward, Latin America would have generated core sales growth of approximately 14%. Finally, Asia core sales showed a decline of 7.9%, largely driven by Aprica.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike.","Michael B. Polk","Thanks, Doug. So now let's turn to our 2014 outlook. This morning we reaffirmed guidance. Core sales growth of 3% to 4%, normalized operating income margin expansion of up to 40 basis points; normalized EPS of $1.94 to $2, which represents growth of 6% to 9%; and operating cash flow in the range of $600 million to $650 million. Our full-year guidance assumes sustained strong growth in Tools and Commercial Products, excellent sellout and market share growth on Writing, but with a more modest second half core sales growth, as well staged back-to-school retailer inventory positions are sold down. Our return to growth on Baby & Parenting, behind strong innovation and marketing programs, continued repositioning of the Rubbermaid consumer business within Home Solutions, resulting in flat to slight growth in the second half of the year. There are 3 factors that can influence where we fall in our 2014 full-year guidance ranges. The first factor is the planned reignition of growth on our Baby business in the second half of 2014. Despite the continued exit of select Baby product launch in Europe, we expect to deliver solid second half growth in the combined North American and European regions, driven by strong innovation and marketing investment in North America.","Our guidance assumes stabilization of our business in Japan, where we have more work to do in response to a reinvigorated and strengthened competitor. I'll be in Japan next week to see the team and agree a plan of action for the next 12 to 18 months. Our guidance assumes low single-digit global growth in the second half on Baby, with sequentially improving results from Q3 to Q4.","The second factor is foreign exchange. In Q1 we communicated that the full-year transaction and translation ForEx impact on EPS would be negative $0.10 to $0.12 versus prior year, about $0.05 to $0.06 worse than what was reflected in our original guidance, largely due to the Venezuela devaluation. Transaction ForEx has worsened by another $0.02 since that time. This change is now reflected in our full-year guidance, yielding a negative foreign exchange year-over-year EPS impact of $0.12 to $0.14.","The third factor is the impact of our increased second half marketing support on Writing point of sales growth in market share. Our 2014 full year guidance assumes strong sellout during the July to August back-to-school drive period and typical replenishment ordering in in September, on Writing. We are well positioned against this assumption, but we'll not have clarity until late Q3. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we do expect about $15 million of Q2 net sales and $0.02 of Q2 EPS related to the writing over delivery in anticipation of the Q3 back-to-school drive period, to reverse out in Q3.","All that said, in light of our very strong Q2 and first half results, and despite $0.07 to $0.08 worse foreign exchange versus our original full-year guidance, and the first half disruption on our Baby business, we now believe we can deliver normalized EPS closer to the high end of our full-year guidance range, in line with our view that the underlying EPS over delivery in Q2 was $0.02 per share.","Let me now turn to our recently announced agreement to acquire Ignite Holdings. As you know from last week's press release, we hope to complete the deal sometime late in Q3. Although the transaction will have a minimal impact on our 2014 results, largely because of timing, we're extremely excited about what Ignite brings to us. The acquisition of the Contigo and Avex brands is very attractive, because it strengthens one of our core businesses, Home Solutions. It provides immediate access to a fast growing on trend segment in the market. It has leading brands that are differentiated via design and product functionality that is patent protected. It allows us to leverage our broad-reaching business system to bring value to Ignite, since its home markets are our home markets. It is growth accretive, margin accretive, and EPS accretive in year 1, and last but not least, it will provide a large cash tax benefit that subsidizes a meaningful portion of the purchase price.","Let me go a little deeper on the strategic rationale for the deal. Ignite is the leading designer and marketer of on-the-go thermal and hydration beverage containers in North America. The business is growing at a historical compound annual growth rate of greater than 35%. And they expect to have net sales of approximately $125 million in 2014. The durable beverage container category is large, fast-growing, and on trend. This greater than $1 billion U.S. market is growing double-digits, because the products in this category support consumers increasingly active on the go lifestyle, gives consumers an affordable way the save significant money by avoiding the purchase of disposable water bottles or coffee shop coffee and provide consumers a more sustainable alternative to the estimated 20 billion disposable water bottles, over 20 billion paper coffee cups and nearly 25 billion styrofoam coffee cups thrown out every year in the U.S. In today's world, these trends are more and more relevant, and with well-designed products that deliver great functionality, the on-the-go thermal and hydration beverage container category has tremendous headroom for growth.","Importantly, Contigo and Avex are well positioned to build clear market share leadership, because they own unique and differentiated intellectual property that creates a product performance advantage versus the competitive set. Though we cannot build any plans until the deal closes, we can envision the future where we leverage our customer development organization's scale and reach in Ignite's core geographies to accelerate the development of the category and broaden Contigo and Avex distribution. That we invest a portion of Ignite's profitability and leverage our marketing capability to accelerate the development of the Contigo and Avex brands.","That we apply Ignite's expertise and IP in this market to strengthen Rubbermaid's participation in category, and perhaps, most importantly, we welcome the incredibly talented people that have built this success story into our organizations to help us replicate it in new markets beyond North America. That's the future we envision for Ignite and Newell, and we think it'll be very bright. We will use our Analyst Day on September 24 in New York to cover our entire development agenda, and we will also take the opportunity to provide more detail on the acquisition of Ignite, which we hope to have completed by that time.","So let me now close with a couple of reflections. We delivered an outstanding Q2 and a solid first half of 2014, despite all the external challenges thrown our way earlier in the year, and the ongoing issues with foreign exchange in Venezuela. We have achieved a very competitive set of results, with a higher level of change than most companies even contemplate, let alone drive to action. Our team has once again done an outstanding job of simultaneously driving delivery, while driving change. We're investing behind the core activity systems critical to our business success, establishing a company that unlocks the full potential of our $6 billion business, rather than simply our individual brands or operating units. We're building what we believe will be world-class capabilities in design, marketing and insights, supply chain and customer development. And we've begun to apply these capabilities to strengthen our brands and accelerate our performance.","We've deployed cash back into the business to unlock the craft's capacity for growth, making Newell leaner and more efficient, investing a portion of those release costs into our brands for accelerated growth and allowing a portion to flow through to operating margin increases. We strengthened our portfolio by exiting or divesting nearly $350 million of growth margin in EPS diluted businesses, and now announcing an agreement to acquire a growth margin in EPS accretive business. We've put our cash to work, repurchasing nearly $0.75 billion of our own shares over the last 3 years, while simultaneously increasing the annualized dividend from $0.20 per share in early 2011 to $0.68 per share today. We're passing value back to shareholders as we create a new future for our company. And we've generated a very competitive return for our investors through this period, increasing the market capitalization of the company from just over $3 billion in late Q3 2011 to over $8.5 billion today.","We are rightly proud of our progress, but more importantly, we are excited by our future, as we're certain that we are just now approaching the starting line and there is a much bigger value creation story to be delivered from this point forward. We're convinced that we're firmly on track to both strengthen the company and create that upside. That's the power of the Growth Game Plan.","With that, let me pass the line to Nancy to set up Q&A.","Nancy O'Donnell","Thanks, Mike. We are aware of the fact that there are several CPG companies reporting today, and so we're going to make an effort to close out our call in a timely manner. [Operator Instructions] And we are ready our first question, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nik Modi.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just -- my quick question on -- clearly, you guys are looking for pretty strong back-to-school season, just given some of the activity this quarter. And it seems that this quarter, the overall consumer environment has really deteriorated. So just wanted to get your thoughts on back-to-school in general. But also Wal-Mart has been very clear that they're planning to be very aggressive on price during the back-to-school season. So I'm just trying to understand how that's going to affect you. Are you co-funding any promotions? Or are you just going to get the benefit of Wal-Mart kind of taking down its own margins to get the traffic?","Michael B. Polk","Thanks, Nick. 2 comments. First of all, I think, Nancy's message was directed to me to be pithy in my answers this time. I'll try to be focused. Look our joint customer business plan with Wal-Mart is something we've been working on all year. And we are quite pleased with how it's set up for back-to-school, as we are with our other customers. We take that process really seriously, and it's a very granular and detailed series of conversations that get us to our merchandising plans. And we're quite pleased with the structure we've got set up, and we don't see anything unusual in the way we are funding that activity this year relative to other years. So I deal with that question in that way. We have very, very strong advertising and marketing plans in Q3, starting really in about the middle of July. So maybe the last week we started to go on air with heavyweights, right through the beginning of September. So that is certainly a change in our investment profile versus last year. And in fact, from an advertising standpoint, in Q3, we will spend, as a company, more on advertising than we spent in all of 2013. So we are serious about investing behind our brands. We're clearly doing that in a differentiated way versus our competitive set, we expected to yield the outcome that we expect with respect to POS, sales growth and share increases. That's key to us delivering our full-year number, and we put it all out there to try to make that happen. And we saw evidence in Q2 that, in fact, that's working. That approach is working.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can you give us an idea of what you think the key is to strengthening the Home Solutions business?","Michael B. Polk","The key to strengthening the Home Solutions businesses is grounded in the repositioning of Rubbermaid consumer. And we're in the midst of a pretty significant shift in what we believe our focus should be, strengthening our food and beverage business, strengthening our -- some other components of the business, but pulling back on the less differentiated elements of the product line. And we're going to continue to experience the challenges of that change through this year. It was always contemplated for this year, and it's really important to us for our future to get Rubbermaid into a cadence of profitably growing. And so Connie, it's at the heart of -- it's one of our biggest brand challenges, and we've got a whole pipeline of ideas that we will execute over the next 12 to 18 months on that business, to include leveraging some of the Ignite IP to enable Rubbermaid to participate in the fast growing beverage container market, as I suggested during the earlier comments. We'll get into this in much greater detail at the Analyst Day on the 24, where Mark and Richard and Chuck will -- and the brand teams will walk through where they're headed with Rubbermaid.","Operator","And your next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to ask you about gross margin SG&A progression through the quarter and just the sustainability of the margin improvement. Because, clearly, you're running ahead of your full year target so for. And pricing and productivity tend to be pretty sticky. And your advertising's already up pretty dramatically in Q2. So can you talk about margin progression in the second half?","Michael B. Polk","I'll give you my kind of view on gross margin. I'm never really comfortable with where we are in gross margin. I just think there is lot of -- we have a lot of opportunities still in front of us. So I'm very pleased with the outcome in the first half of the year, and with the progress in Q2. And part of the surge to greater than 40%, which has always been sort of one of these historical mile markers that we were holding out there, the surge above 40% on the normalized basis is, in part, due to mix. So as Baby recovers, we'll see some drawdown on that, as a result of Baby momentum. And so I don't think 40% yet is a sustainable level of gross margins. So as you think about your models, don't plan that in. However, it gives us the encouragement that 40% is just a mile marker. And as we continue to tackle the opportunities in the business to release cost, as I suggested that the supply-chain and the operating segments were identifying, we'll have more and more opportunity. So while 40% is not sustainable at this point, it certainly suggests that it will be at some point in our future. And we're incredibly focused on this, because gross margin percentage is the life blood of any consumer goods businesses. And so we need to sustain steady progress through the year. As you know, we've made it part of the short-term incentive program for our management team, and that keeps it sharply in focus.","Operator","And your next question comes from Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So look, obviously, fundamentals were pretty good. I wonder if you'll go into some, I guess, less fundamental stuff for Venezuela for a second, LatAm was up 40%. How much -- can you take a shot at quantifying, one, how much pricing in Venezuela, like inflationary pricing, helped you? And then, can you talk a little bit about the fair price rules? And the fact that your 1% of sales and 3% to 4% of profit, like how are you thinking about that going forward? And what kind of an impact might that stuff be?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So we took pricing across Latin America, not just in Venezuela, to deal with in part of transaction ForEx issues across the whole region. And we took to pricing, and as we have been taking pricing in Venezuela to deal with issues there, as you know. Chris, I can't -- I don't want to get into the specifics of exactly how Venezuela pricing contributed to the overall outcome for writing, but it wasn't unsubstantial, it was a meaningful part of Latin writing growth. And it may not be sustainable at that level, going forward. So that's another variable that needs to be considered as you think about gross margin progression. All that said, we are -- we have -- very clear about where we stand, relative to the margin cap loss and Doug can provide a little more detail about what's going on there in our discussions. But we still believe we will have some pricing capacity going forward.","Douglas L. Martin","Yes, Chris. We've -- we're obviously, working with -- working within the rules to evaluate where our pricing structure stands by product line and by channel and customer. There's very likely to be some upward and downward adjustments to our pricing, going forward. Not overly concerned about where that may land right now. So clearly confident there. But -- and I guess, I would say, we're also seeing a little more fluidness in the currency market. So we got some additional cash out that we've been waiting for under the old rate, and we have also got some approvals of some cash back for the first time under SICAD I, because our school product segment came up in the essentials market. So we actually put in a little more inventory, and will -- there'll be little more inventory in the balance sheet at the end of the year, so that we've got that in place for the next year.","Michael B. Polk","I think, the one thing I would say Chris is, in our guidance we've contemplated a more of the same posture. We haven't gotten any indication that we would need to take a different point of view at this point, unlike, as I read some of the earnings releases up until this point. Unlike some of the other things that I've read for some other folks, we haven't had that type of conversation. We will move prices up and prices down to make sure we stay in compliance. And we may not have as much pricing leverage going forward, but we don't see any -- at this point, we don't see any material event.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can we talk about the advertising spending increase? I just want to make sure, just for modeling purposes, I have the base rate. So when you guys talk about a 90% increase? Is it a 90% increase of that sort of 2.7% of sales or $154 million from last year? And then I have a follow-up.","Michael B. Polk","No, you're working off a Bill, you're working of a AMP when you quote 2.7%. So you need to be working off a component of that. So you -- don't do the math on 90% of the 2.7%. Do it on 90% of increase on probably less than 50% of that ratio. Okay?","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Got you. Because it seems like, even if that's the case, I mean that's like an incremental sort of $50 million in the P&L. So are you just at a point where the SG&A savings program, the reductions are reflecting so you can invest it back, or are you assuming that the uptick in sales growth is going to -- because, obviously, you kept to your guidance and it took us to the high end of the range.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So we're making good progress on overheads, and we're really scrutinizing the P portion of A&P to make sure that it's a wise spend. So there's an element of this that's overhead driven, there is an element of this that's gross margin increase driven and there is an element of this that is driven by shifts within A&P. So we're going to make sure our money is working hard for us. So we're 1.5, 2 years into the new organization, a year into the new operating model. We're still learning as to what works and what doesn't. And we're moving money around to make sure that we're getting a growth yield for the investments, and we'll continue to learn. Some of what we're doing this year won't work, and we'll adjust it next year. One thing I want to make clear is, in Q3, because we've held our guidance on operating income margin progression. In Q3, you will see us invest beyond the capacity of the margin increase as we get through gross margin. So we've held the range of up to 40 basis points on the full year of operating income margin progression, and here we are through the mid-year period at 40 basis points. So I would just be aware that we're going to spend to strategically support the outcomes, we believe are important in Q3, specifically, which is obviously a very critical drive period.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, how do you know if it's working or not and how adaptive, the spending?","Michael B. Polk","It's very adaptive, because we're an operating company now. So, Doug, me, Mark, Bill, Richard, and the VPs of marketing sitting down in the room, and deciding what's working and what's not. And what the segment presidents suggest to buy -- adjust where we're going to spend it. And nothing's static. We're living in a dynamic resource management environment in an operating company. In a holding company, that would've been impossible to do because all the resources were pushed out. If we want to adjust, we adjust. So if think, we've got -- Mr. Sketch's advertising, which I don't know if you've seen, it's just extraordinary. If that's going to yield a pot, we'll shift money midstream to that. So that's the beauty of operating the way we are today. So it's a very flexible model in that sense. And we want to be nimble, we're a relatively small company at $6 billion. We want to leverage that for competitive advantage. Against in what's the power that $6 billion company, but the flexible nature of an operating company to dynamically deploy the resources against the best opportunities. And we're doing that.","Operator","And your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Let me ask a little bit about commercial products. So outside of Healthcare flattening out and turning positive, it does seem like, perhaps, you hit an inflection point in the balance of the business with some of the investments you've made in selling and new product development, finally kicking in. Is that a fair interpretation of results? And if so, how sustainable is it. Is it a matter of contract kicking in the selling cycle? I just want some color there.","Michael B. Polk","Yes, it's a combination of things. So as you know, we've invested in selling resources on Tools and on Commercial Products in Latin America in late 2012 into 2013. Those feet on the street are yielding growth. And that is -- suggests, I think, we're at the early stages of that impact, still. In North America, I'm not sure we've talked about that -- this part of things that explicitly. But we also reoriented our Customer Development Organization when we took all the top heavy elements out and focused our selling activities in North America as 1 company, released a bunch of money that we invested back into more feet on the street in our distributive sales organization. And that clearly is helping us in commercial products and on Lenox, in North America, where that's -- that is where a lot of selling activity happens. So we're getting a growth yield on those investments. Now importantly, on Tools we've got a big innovation agenda in Latin America, where we initiated 1 wave of extending the Tool Belt, as we call it. In Brazil, last year we executed the second wave. The first wave is now being broadened across Latin America. The portfolio is being broadened across Latin America. And on Commercial Products, we've had a fair amount of innovation, Executive Series, which we've exposed to you, is yielding great traction right now, as we push Rubbermaid Commercial Products into 5-star hotels. And so it's a combination of things. It's both selling and innovation. I wouldn't say it's a big advertising investment on these business, it's more winning on the ground through our sales organization and better innovation.","Operator","And your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'll go back to the margin question. And, obviously, there's a huge amount of variability across your segments in terms of your operating margin. But if I look even just on an annual basis over the last 5 years, almost all of your margin expansion, your total margin expansion, has come from the Writing segment. So I guess, question #1 is the writing profitability nearly 27%. That number specifically, do you think that is sustainable or even expandable? And when you look at the other segments, where you really haven't seen any margin expansion on the sustainable basis over last few years, do you think there is more restructuring? Is that cost cutting? Is it just product mix within this segment's and a gross margin issue? Because I'm trying to get comfortable that, come the analyst meeting, you're going to be able to say, yes, margin expansion is going to be broader and across the segments as opposed to concentrated in that 1 segment.","Michael B. Polk","Yes, it's a good question. So we, obviously, believe it is, but the unlock comes with further work on costs. The nice thing we've seen on both tools and commercial products, we put the cost, we added cost in for selling investment that I was just referring to. Last year we accepted margin step backs, for the sake of scaling the business. And we're starting to see the return for that investment now with the growth rates. And as we hold those fixed costs flat, they'll flow through to our margin. But we have more work to do, clearly. Renewals not done, we're identifying new opportunities. Our overhead structures are still too heavy, as a company, even though we've made great progress. And we're quite clear that we have a lot more work to do on cost, and a lot more work to do to make the company lean and efficient in front of us. And that will release the fuel for growth and a portion of that will flow through the margin, more broadly than it has to date. I feel good about progress we've made this year, on Commercial Products and Tools, and I would expect that to continue, going forward. We stepped back on Baby where we've also, up until this period in time, we've made significant progress on Baby margins more than doubling that business's profitability, and we're dealing with the consequences of the recall and some other issues. And then in Europe, if you look at our European operating income margin, we are well into double-digits now on Europe. And very, very pleased having come from no margin, in that geography, to a very consequential margin structure that also flows through the EPS at a higher rate because of our efficient tax structure in Europe. So I think we're making good progress, but Wendy, the challenge is right on, we're not where we want to be or where we have the potential to be, which is why I always say there is still way more in front of us than behind.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And just with regard to Europe specifically, can you remind us of what's the product mix within that region? Because I know that's an important driver of the margins as well.","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So Writing and Tools, obviously, very important to us in that region, and we have exited a series of unprofitable Baby businesses and a portion of the Fine Writing business that was less profitable. So as we pivot our portfolio to what we formally called Whacky, which was brands like Paper Mate or Reynolds or Berol or Sharpie. We end up with a mix benefit that flows through to the P&L or Dymo, we end up with a mix benefit that flows through the P&L. And obviously, we are playing our portfolio to win and maximize the contribution of Europe to our overall company's performance. And Europe right now is playing a role of fueling the growth in both our home markets of North America and the Latin expansion that we're investing beyond.","Operator","And your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The core sales growth was, obviously, strong in the quarter and a difficult environment in general. I'm just wondering how much of a role, you think, the higher marketing in Q2 had in that topline result, or if you take the topline boost from marketing really still yet to come in the back half of the year, and as you look into 2015, particularly given the Q3 ad spend focus you mentioned? And then the success you've had in Latin America and at least the selling success on the writing side, does that increase your confidence on the topline payback from higher marketing?","Michael B. Polk","We, I think, Dara, it's a good question. We don't -- we have yet to see the full value for the investments we started to make in really middle of Q2 from May onwards. We see it in the share numbers. We see it in the sellout numbers. And it's certainly sort of the lubricant that enabled a strong sell in to back-to-school. Importantly, we see very good growth on Tools and Commercial Products, which again, I think, is selling and innovation driven, rather than investment driven. Q3 will be the real test, whether we get a return on this. And if we do, we should see a relatively good sell in September after the events. And we should see a more broader impact, as we start to invest on brands like Graco in Q3 and brands like Calphalon in Q4. And so we have not seen -- we have not yet seen the sustainable growth acceleration to 4-plus percent type of growth rates. That's still in front of us, Q2 was encouraging. Part of Q2, as we said, was related to the over delivery of the sell in, connected to the strong Q3 plans we've got. But it's encouraging to see some of the results we're delivering, in the context of all the portfolio strengthening moves we're making. Remember, we're exiting roughly $25 million of business in Europe. We are repositioning Rubbermaid Consumer, which is effectively a step back in that business. We've been pulling back on Calphalon Electrics, because we believe the core of that brand is in Cookware and not in Electrics. And that's yielding some valuable margin improvement for that business, but also we'd continue to grow on Calphalon, despite those pullbacks. So you've got these down elevators that are in our core numbers, because we don't separate them out. That gives us encouragement that the forward-looking growth rates have potential to accelerate. But it's going to take the investment we're putting in, and we will get a read on that in the back half of the year, as to whether that strengthens our ability to deliver sustained growth at greater than 4%.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to sort of, I guess, look at the flip side of Chris's question, which is, with Latin America driving so much of the core sales growth, it does sort of hide the fact that the rest of the world will particularly be stripped out the Q2 writing benefit, wasn't quite as strong as the overall number would appear. So can you talk to us a little bit about how we should see the rest of the world progressing as we go through the year, sort of trying to strip the Q2 writing benefit out. And what's the glide path on Asia getting better on the Baby care business and also Europe as well?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. We feel terrific about Europe's contribution ex-exits we're getting close to flat on our performance there. I think you should expect more of the same in the back half of the year on Europe, as we continue to exit the less profitable portions of that portfolio. In Asia, we're not investing a lot of energy in those markets yet. In China and then Southeast Asia, there is terrific opportunity there, but we're really playing for, as we've said strategically, we're going to focus on Latin America first and then go east to Asia. That's more of a late '15, 2016 timeframe, as we think about those geographies. So we want to try to hold our own there, although we're prepared to accept some declines in those markets rather than dilute the investment profile in North America and in Latin America. We have a long road to go still, much more upside in Latin America. And we continue -- we will continue to play for that. Our growth algorithm, if you recall, pivoted on 2 things: building our share position in our home markets and extending our geographic footprint, first to Latin America and then to Asia. And that's the algorithm we're executing. As we move forward into 2015, as we head closer to providing guidance, we'll bring in China a bit of a brighter light on how we think that story will evolve, by geography. Your specific question on Japan Baby -- we'll -- we have work to do there. So we're dealing with a different competitor and competitive environment than what we've dealt with for the last 2.5 years. A more assertive competitor, not just on price but through innovation. And so we have to up our game in Japan, and that's not a quick light switch, that's something that's going to take sequential investment, and will take some time for us to turn. So we expect that to be a challenge for a period of time. But it's all hands on deck. And as I said, I'm going over on Monday to sit with the team. Richard will be there, Bill will be with me, Laurel Hurd, who is the President of Baby, will be there as well. And we'll be working with the local team to figure out how to get back the momentum that we have lost in Japan.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Since we're talking about Baby, I guess I'll start there. Looks like 2Q was a little bit softer than we thought. Was curious what that looked like versus your internal expectations. And then Mike, you sound a little less sanguine on the back half, obviously, more competition in Japan. But has there been any sort of hangover from the recall at Graco? And then 1 other one if I could sneak it in on Healthcare, sounds like its returning to growth this quarter. Was that an anomaly, or do you think that's really a start of a trend?","Michael B. Polk","So on Baby, we had slight growth in North America in the second quarter, which is important after a tough first quarter during the recall. There is still a lot of moving parts in the business in Q2 on Baby, and especially in the context of the infantry call in early July. So it's been a volatile quarter or 2 for that business in North America. We have an incredibly strong pipeline of activity coming on Baby in North America, for the balance of the year, and for the first time in a long, long time, we'll be advertising the brand, in the back half of the year. So we believe those activities, in concert with the terrific customer relationships we've got, will return the North American business to nice growth in the back half of the year. Europe we'll continue to exit, so I think that will continue to step back. We're very, very happy with the progress we've made on Baby strategically, and we expect that to get back on into a rhythm of constructive performance. On Healthcare, we're encouraged by Healthcare. I think there was a period of time where hospitals were really holding tight on their capital budgets. We see a little bit of loosening there. Do I think we return to the 30%, 40% type of growth rates that we had in 2012 into 2013, no. But we expect, in the back half of the year, to have a nice growth on Healthcare as we continue to develop that business. We've taken our first step to take our Healthcare platform into a new country in Brazil, where we've launched an initiative, a hospital network down there, to see whether we can, in a sustainable way, deliver an extended Healthcare platform beyond North America. And we'll see how that plays out.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Gere, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You know what? Main questions have been answered, so I'll just ask -- I'll talk to Nancy offline with a few other questions.","Michael B. Polk","Okay, Jason.","Operator","And your next question comes from Budd Bugatch from Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And most of my questions have been answered, just let me ask for a little bit more color on project for Newell and maybe what savings have been done today and where they're focused and where Project Renewal now remains for the balance of this project?","Douglas L. Martin","Sure. Budd, this is Doug. We're right on track, actually we're ahead of plan on Project Renewal. We've delivered well over $200 million worth of savings on the program to date, for both renewal 1 and renewal 2. And by the end of the year, we'll be in the range that we said from a savings perspective, with another 6 months to go. So we feel very good about the progress we're making, and we are also thankful we have it. Because you know we've run into some FX challenges over last couple of years, and so that's been very helpful for us. And we've also been able to invest back into the business. So right on track.","Michael B. Polk","And just 1 to build on that. So I think there is a lot more cost opportunity in front of us, as you know, I have said publicly, we'll spent 50, 60 basis points per year in restructuring, going forward beyond renewal. So I want to make sure people don't lose sight of that in their models, as they think about how we developed the business. We're going to have more, as we get into this cost opportunity space there's just more and more opportunity every day. So I just want to make sure I put that marker out there and remind folks of that.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And what kind of costs are you doing in your renewal. Just right now, I mean, are they product line exits? How are you looking at that?","Michael B. Polk","It's mostly overhead related change, at this point. Some fixed costs in Europe around consolidating our distribution network and our customer service network. But it's mostly overhead related and infrastructure related, as we build out stronger global functions in the 4 areas that we said would be our winning capabilities: design and R&D, marketing and insights, customer development and the supply chain.","Operator","And your final question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I just want to circle back to Ignite and the acquisition there. And just kind of, from a philosophical standpoint, why was everything you've done behind the scenes, creating a new R&D facility, putting money behind all the new products. Why couldn't you have entered these categories on your own? I mean, why pay what was probably the healthy multiple for this type of business? And then what does it kind of say about future acquisitions that you're looking at? And where are the areas where this is a necessary step?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. That's a great question. We're -- the strategic rationale for -- one of the pieces of strategic rationale for this deal is, that it accelerates our ability to participate in what's 1 of the fastest-growing segments of the housewares category. We were doing our own development work in this space. But these companies, these smaller companies have been out there for 10 years, kind of building their capabilities in this area and had established presence. It would have taken us probably 18 months to 2 years to really scale our activity. So this jumpstarts our participation, that's 1 piece of the puzzle. The other thing that excited us about Ignite, is that they got a couple of pieces of intellectual property that we think are very valuable in this category, and enable the creation of differentiated products, relative to the competitive set. So we've got a fast growing category. The deal accelerates our participation and it gives us access to IP, which we can leverage across our business. And so those are the things that converge to make this interesting. Now that alone wouldn't have been enough to, of course, it's growth accretive, margin accretive, EPS accretive. And by the way, the multiple when you adjust for the cash tax benefit is quite attractive. So I think this is 1 that kind of met all of our criteria. To be honest with you, I'm not sure we'll find as many that check every box, but this one happened to do it.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So just a follow-up. Are there other areas, I mean, is it more on the consumer side where you're looking for these type of things to accelerate? Or is it across the whole spectrum of businesses?","Michael B. Polk","Yes. So, Bill, what we've said is we want to complement our organic agenda that's captured in the Growth Game Plan, with ideas that the strategic acquisitions that enables us to scale our 5 core categories. So we're not interested in 6 business or extending the shoulders of our portfolio. We're interested in winning in the core and strengthening our portfolio in the core. Now the vast majority of our investments and our activity are going to be focused through the launch of the Growth Game Plan on organic growth and development. However, we're going to -- when we see a good opportunity to accelerate our participation that creates a lot of value for shareholders, we're going to go forward and apply some of our capital that way. The best acquisition, obviously, we've made in years has been the buyback of our own stock, over the last 3 years. And so that's -- that fact is not lost on us. So we'll be discriminating in the choices we make, because we don't want -- because we continue to believe that there is -- that we're undervalued, and we have a line of sight to the opportunity connected to the cost agenda. That is quite clear now and compelling. And so we'll find -- we'll strike the right balance between all of these choices, as we think about capital allocation to maximize value. Our interests, as a management team, are aligned with our investors' interests in that respect.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Polk for closing remarks.","Michael B. Polk","I'll just make a couple and, I think, we've probably lost those vast majority of the folks that were listening. But we're very pleased with Q2, strong set of results. We've delivered a solid set of first half results that give us the confidence to suggest that, despite the headwinds associated with a much worse foreign exchange environment than we anticipated coming in the year and despite the issues created by the external events connected to Baby in the first quarter, we can now suggest that our EPS will deliver towards the high end of the range. Strategically, we feel like we're making good great progress, driving the Growth Game Plan into action, and that's beginning to impact the rate of growth in the business. And importantly, we're putting our capital to work to complement a strong organic agenda defined by the Growth Game Plan with external development now, with the announced acquisition of Ignite. We feel terrific about the team, done an incredible job, driving delivery while simultaneously driving change. And that gives us the confidence that we're on track to create a brighter future for our company. That's all I'd say. I think I'd welcome everybody to come on September 24 to our Analyst Day in New York, where we'll do a deep dive on our development agenda and the Ignite acquisition, which hopefully will be completed by that point in time. Thanks so much. Have a great day.","Operator","Today's call will be available on the web at newellrubbermaid.com.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After a brief discussion by management, we will open up the call for questions. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at newellbrands.com on the Investor Relations home page under Events & Presentations. A slide presentation is also available for download.","I will now turn the call over to Nancy ODonnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. ODonnell, you may begin.","Nancy ODonnell","Thank you, Derrick. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newell Brands' first quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to point out that our comments today include forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on assumptions and estimates, which could be materially different from actual results. Please take note of Newell's cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release, and in our most recent SEC filings. Newell undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement made today.","Also, please note that we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are provided because management believes that they provide insights which enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures with the most comparable measures in accordance with GAAP is available in our earnings release and on the IR portion of our website.","Our call today will be led by Newell Brands' Chief Executive Officer, Mike Polk; and John Stipancich, our Chief Financial Officer.","I'll turn the call over now to Mike.","Michael Polk","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our inaugural Newell Brands results call. This morning, we reported a very strong set of first quarter results. Before getting into the numbers, I want to make sure you're clear on a few things. Our Q1 results include only the legacy Newell Rubbermaid business. Our normalized EPS results were not impacted by any Jarden transaction-related costs. Our financial results exclude contributions from our Venezuelan operations in the current year, but include the contribution of our Venezuelan operations in the year-ago period.","With that as context, let's get into the Q1 highlights. We've had an outstanding start to the year. Core sales grew 5.6%. Net sales grew 4%. Our growth was driven by strengthened innovation and increased brand support, with advertising and promotion investment up nearly 15%, or 40 basis points. Despite the increase in brand support, normalized operating margin increased 100 basis points, driven by 160 basis point reduction in overheads related to Project Renewal. Normalized EPS was $0.40, $0.02 ahead of consensus and 11.1% ahead of prior year.","We achieved double-digit earnings growth, despite having to overcome about a $0.04 negative impact related to foreign currency. On a currency neutral basis, normalized earnings per share increased $0.08, or 25%. Excluding the roughly $0.02 contribution from our Venezuelan operations to year-ago earnings, 2016 Q1 normalized EPS increased 17.6%.","Our first quarter growth was broad based, with core sales growth in all five segments in all four regions. We had particularly strong results in North America, where core sales grew 5.8%, as a result of exceptional results on Writing, Tools and Baby. Globally, our Win Bigger businesses grew core sales 7.4%, driven by strong double-digit growth in our Writing & Creative Expression business, and over 8% core sales growth on our Food & Beverage business.","While not considered in Newell Brands' first quarter results, Jarden's organic growth was in line with their fourth quarter performance of about 2% and in line with our expectations for the first quarter. Jarden's net sales grew over 16%. And, as expected, the businesses delivered strong adjusted EBITDA growth related to the Jostens and Waddington acquisitions. So a strong start to the year, and we have clear momentum in our business as we come together to create Newell Brands.","Let me hand the call over to John to go through the Newell Brands' results in more detail, and then I'll return to provide perspective on our revised outlook for 2016.","John Stipancich","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. First quarter reported net sales were $1.31 billion, a 4% increase versus last year. Core sales, which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, increased 5.6%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 240 basis points to reported net sales. Foreign currency cost us 230 basis points, and the deconsolidation of Venezuela had a negative impact of 170 basis points. Our strong core sales performance was led by Baby, Writing and Tools, with all five of our segments growing core sales in the quarter.","Reported gross margin was 38.5%, and normalized gross margin was 38.6%, down 20 basis points over last year. The decline was primarily the result of unfavorable currency, the deconsolidation of Venezuela and the negative mix impact from the gross margin structure of our Elmer's acquisition, which more than offset productivity and lower input costs.","Normalized SG&A expense was $335.9 million, or 25.5% of sales, down 120 basis points versus prior year. Our 160 basis point reduction of overheads fueled a 40 basis point increase in advertising and promotion, with the balance of the overhead savings flowing to the bottom line.","We invested incremental A&P in Writing, Home Solutions, Tools and Commercial Products. We continued heavy media campaigns to support Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens, Sharpie markers and the Graco 4Ever and Aprica Fladea car seats, with a noticeable step-up in Home Solutions to support the launch of Rubbermaid FreshWorks, our latest food storage innovation.","Normalized operating margin was 13.1%, up 100 basis points from last year, reflecting the benefits of Project Renewal and other cost savings initiatives, partially offset by an increase in strategic investment and continuing, though moderating, FX headwinds. Reported operating margin was 9.5%, compared with 7.8% in the prior year.","Interest expense of $29.4 million increased $10.2 million year-over-year. In addition, we recorded a loss of $45.9 million related to termination of the bridge loan associated with backup financing for the Jarden acquisition. The $10.2 million increase in interest expense includes $4 million of incremental net interest expense we incurred on long-term debt and other financing arrangements to fund the transaction. Because of the unique nonrecurring nature of these two charges, we removed them from our normalized results. The remaining $6.2 million of incremental interest expense primarily relates to the financing for our acquisition of Elmer's, which we completed last fall.","Our normalized tax rate was 27.2%, effectively flat to last year's rate. Normalized EPS, which excludes restructuring and other project costs, was $0.40, an 11.1% increase to last year, despite the loss of a little under $0.02 contribution from Venezuela last year.","As Mike mentioned, backing out last year's Venezuela earnings contribution, normalized EPS grew 17.6% in the quarter. On a reported basis, first quarter EPS was $0.15, compared to $0.20 last year, with the largest driver of the decline being the Jarden transaction and financing costs, which I mentioned a few minutes ago.","Looking at our segment results, starting with Writing, reported first quarter net sales increased 10.8% to $378.8 million. Core sales increased 8.8%, with double-digit growth in North America, as well as in Latin America. We continue to drive strong POS in the U.S., thanks to the combined impact of increased A&P and robust merchandising efforts.","Q1 normalized operating margin in our Writing segment was 22.8%, a 150 basis point decline from last year, which was mostly the result of the seasonality of Elmer's, with its relatively low sales contribution in the first quarter compared to its incremental fixed cost contribution.","Net sales in our Home Solutions segment grew 2.1% to $372.1 million. Core sales increased 3.6%, due to strong growth in the Rubbermaid food storage and beverage ware businesses. This more than offset our continued exit of portions of the low margin Consumer Storage business.","Home Solutions' normalized operating margin was 10.2%, a 40 basis point decline from 2015, as our step-up in advertising and promotion more than offset the benefits of productivity and lower input costs.","Our Tool segment delivered net sales of $179.7 million, a 40 basis point decline. Core sales grew 4%. Tools turned in solid performance in North America, Asia, and EMEA, partially offset by continuing challenges in Brazil. Normalized operating margin in the Tools segment was 10.8%, a 150 basis point decline, which was driven by increased investment in advertising and promotion and continuing FX challenges in Brazil, more than offsetting productivity and pricing.","Reported net sales in our Commercial Products segment declined 5.8% to $174.5 million. Core sales increased 90 basis points, driven by pricing and volume growth in EMEA and Asia, with relatively flat performance in North America and Latin America, primarily due to the timing of sales. Recall that Commercial Products turned in almost 10% core growth in the first quarter of 2015, making this a challenging comp. Commercial Products normalized operating margin was 13%, a 350 basis point increase to last year, due to pricing, productivity and input cost benefits and overhead savings from Project Renewal.","Finally, our Baby segment reported $209.8 million in net sales, a 9.2% increase compared to last year. Core sales grew 9.3%. We continue to benefit from positive momentum in the U.S. and Japan, driven by new, innovative products. Baby's normalized operating margin was 11%, up 460 basis points to last year, largely due to improvements in gross margin attributable to productivity, together with lower investment in advertising and promotion as a result of timing of spend.","Looking at our Q1 core sales by geography, as Mike mentioned, all four of our regions grew core sales, with North America leading the pack at 5.8%. In EMEA, core sales grew 3.6%. Latin America, core sales grew 5.5%, with our Writing business delivering double-digit growth, more than overcoming challenges in the Tools business in Brazil. And finally, Asia Pacific core sales grew 7.4%.","With respect to cash, we used $270.9 million in operating cash last quarter compared with the use of $154.3 million in the prior year. Now, we had a number of unique items in the first quarter, including a $58 million tax payment associated with our gain on the sale of Endicia last year, about $92 million of payments associated with locked-in benchmark Treasury rates late last year and early this year in connection with our $8 billion public debt issuance last month, and about $32 million of higher incentive compensation paid in March, relating to our performance in 2015.","We returned $53.3 million to shareholders in Q1 in the form of dividends, and our share repurchases were limited to restricted stock vesting, as we suspended the repurchase of shares midway through the fourth quarter of last year in light of the Jarden transaction.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.","Michael Polk","Thanks, John. Let's now turn to the balance of 2016. As you know, Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden came together as Newell Brands on April 15, 2016. Both companies entered into the transaction with terrific momentum. We delivered these strong results, while simultaneously completing the most transformative transaction in our respective histories.","Newell Brands will be one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world, with pro forma 2016 revenue of about $16 billion. We have a strong portfolio of household brands that reach consumers every day where they live, learn, work and play. Newell Brands more than doubles our size in key strategic retailers and geographies. And we expect scale to enable strong, sustained growth through broadened channel cross-sell, accelerated international deployment and strengthened category leadership as we extend the best capabilities from both companies across the full portfolio.","Our growth will be fueled by making the new company leaner and more efficient and by focusing our investments on the businesses with the greatest potential. Over the next three to four years, we expect to unlock the financial capacity for growth, margin development and cash flow yield through the delivery of at least $500 million in cost synergies and $300 million in Project Renewal savings.","Over 80% of the combined $800 million in cost synergies and savings will flow to margin, with the balance being reinvested in capabilities and brand support.","By 2018, we expect to have built a very profitable company, with annual EBITDA of nearly $3.5 billion, and EBITDA margins of over 20%. The company will be very cash generative. Between 2016 and 2018, we expect to generate $5.5 billion to $6 billion in cumulative operating cash flow.","After capital investment and dividends, we expect to have about $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion of unallocated free cash flow available for debt repayment. This assumes no material improvement in working capital, reduction in the blended tax rate or any divestitures.","Our first priority for capital allocation will be to put the cash to work deleveraging the company to our target leverage ratio range of three to 3.5 times. By the end of 2018, we expect to have used about $2 billion to $2.4 billion of the available unallocated free cash flow to pay down our $1.5 billion term loan and most of the $900 million of fixed debt maturities available in that time period.","Assuming run rate synergies of $500 million, we expect to enter our leverage ratio range by the end of 2017. Assuming phased synergies, we expect to enter our target leverage ratio range by the middle of 2018. This view on deleveraging, of course, is contingent upon our delivery of our underlying business plans.","This morning, we established Newell Brands guidance for 2016. We expect full-year core sales growth in 2016 of 3% to 4%. We define core sales to include the negative impact of product line exits, but exclude the impact of: foreign exchange; acquisitions, until their first anniversary; and divestitures, from the point of decision to sell the asset.","Our guidance assumes legacy Jarden core sales are counted as part of Newell Brands core sales from April 15, 2016 forward, and are also in the same year-ago comparison period. Our guidance also assumes that The Waddington Group and Jostens become part of core sales, starting in August 2016 and November 2016, respectively.","Our Newell Brands full-year guidance assumes 2% to 4% core sales growth in the legacy Jarden businesses for quarters two through four, and 4% to 5% core sales growth on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses for the full year. The core sales growth guidance on the legacy Jarden business is roughly equivalent to the Jarden long-standing organic growth guidance of 3% to 5%, since their definition of organic sales excluded the negative impact of product line exits and included the positive impact of tuck-in acquisitions.","Over the next two to three years, we expect to exit product lines with roughly $250 million to $300 million of revenue across both businesses. Our Newell Brands 2016 core sales growth guidance contemplates some portion of these product line exits occurring in 2016. We expect to cover any lost normalized operating income, which we expect to be minimal, within our normalized EPS guidance.","We expect 2016 full-year normalized EPS of $2.75 to $2.90. This guidance assumes a weighted average annual share count of 430 million shares, roughly 270 million shares for the first 15 weeks of the year and 497 million shares for the balance of the year.","Importantly, because of the share count differential by quarter, with Q1 and Q2 lower than our run rate, our full-year normalized EPS guidance will be greater than the sum of the normalized EPS for each quarter.","Our 2016 normalized EPS guidance range has the following assumptions built in: $50 million to $80 million of cost synergies; a blended effective tax rate of 29% to 30%; and beginning in the second quarter of 2016, Newell Brands will exclude the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, including the Jarden acquisition, from our calculation of normalized EPS.","There are two key factors that could influence the delivery of the 2016 full-year guidance. The first is business unit execution of their business plans. Both companies are on track to deliver at the midpoint of the legacy ranges that underpin the Newell Brands' full year core sales growth guidance. That means legacy Jarden at 3% core sales growth, and legacy Newell Rubbermaid at 4.5% core sales growth.","The second factor that could influence full year guidance is the Project Renewal savings built into the legacy Newell Rubbermaid plans and the delivery of cost synergies associated with the combination. Through the end of the first quarter, Project Renewal program-to-date cost savings totaled $395 million, and we delivered $35 million in savings in the first quarter.","We're in full flight on Project Renewal and are well on our way to deliver over $100 million in savings that are built into our 2016 business plans. Our work on cost synergies related to the combination is also in full flight. We have a clear line of sight to the 2016 cost synergies of $50 million to $80 million assumed in our normalized EPS guidance range.","While you should not expect us to provide quarterly guidance going forward, I will provide some detail today that should help you think through the math on normalized EPS for Q2 2016 and Q1 2017. In the second quarter of 2016, the share count will not reflect the run rate for the balance of the year. The Q2 share count will be a blend of 270 million shares for the first 15 days of the quarter, and 497 million shares for the balance of the quarter, netting to a weighted average share count of approximately 460 million shares.","In the first quarter 2017, while there will be a step-up in our year-over-year income related to legacy Jarden, growth on legacy Newell, cost synergies and Project Renewal savings, these benefits will be more than offset by a substantial year-over-year interest expense increase related to the transaction, the dilutive effect of nearly 230 million share increase in share count versus the prior year, and by the fact that Q1 is a seasonally smaller quarter for the legacy Jarden business.","Despite the Q1 2017 dilution of normalized EPS versus Q1 2016, we expect the creation of Newell Brands to deliver at least high single-digit accretion over the company's first 12 months.","So to close, we've had a great start to the year: 5.6% core sales growth; 11.1% normalized earnings per share growth; 25% earnings per share growth on a currency neutral basis; and we start 2016 right where we expected to be on both businesses in the first quarter.","We've established new guidance for Newell Brands, with core sales growth of between 3% to 4%, and normalized earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.90. This earning range represents strong double-digit accretion in 2016 and at least high single-digit accretion on a forward-looking 12 month basis.","We've established clear capital allocation priorities, with debt repayment as our most important priority after capital investment and dividends. We have a clear line of sight to achieving our stated leverage ratio targets within two to three years, at the latest. And after we get back into our target leverage range, our highly cash generative business will be put to work, complementing what is a strong organic agenda with value-creating investment of unallocated capital.","Our two organizations are coming together quite well. And I look forward to next week, when the leaders from across Newell Brands will meet to start the journey toward unleashing the power of our new company. We're a $16 billion consumer goods companies, with leading brands that reach consumers every day where they live, learn, work and play; brands that compete in large, growing, global categories that are unconsolidated and, as a result, offer tremendous market share consolidation potential.","The creation of Newell Brands more than doubles our scale in key retailers and geographies. And scale will enable sustained strong levels of growth, especially when coupled with the broader application of our brand development, design and innovation capabilities. $800 million in savings and cost synergies will provide the fuel for top line and earnings growth and for further investment in our capabilities and our people.","As I've said since the announcement of the transaction in December, we were two strong companies with very competitive performance and value-creation track records that have now come together to create one great company. Together, we'll be stronger. Together, we'll be bigger and grow faster than our competitors. Together, we are Newell Brands.","And with that, like to open it up, questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operation Instructions] Your first question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Michael Polk","Hey, Bill.","William Chappell","Good morning. I guess first question on the synergy potential and especially in the first year, I mean, I understand it's early days, but $50 million to $80 million, I would imagine you could get a big chunk of that just from public company costs and senior management going away.","Michael Polk","Yep.","William Chappell","What kind of makes that up and how quickly can you get stuff, like purchasing synergies and supply chain and other things, or is that more kind of 2017?","Michael Polk","No, we should see benefits right away in purchasing. So let me kind of unpack those numbers for you. So you're right. The low end of that range is within an arm's reach, just based on corporate duplication synergies, particularly at the executive level. So the low end is fairly conservative, I'd agree. But the line of sight is there to getting to that range solidly. And obviously, we're going to press to go as far as we possibly can in that range and beyond that range, if it's accessible. We've hit the ground running on the corporate duplication work, obviously, with Martin, Ian and Jim moving into new roles. And we've begun the work in other corporate roles as well, with changes happening very quickly and more changes to come over the next number of weeks.","The procurement teams are geared up and running. So this week actually, we had a procurement \u2013 we're doing the call today from Norwalk. In the Norwalk office today, we had a Newell Brands global summit on procurement savings, ATK leading that work as an outside influencer, but the teams from across all the businesses together in this office working this week to line out the roadmap category-by-category. So we're sprinting on procurement benefits as well. So we have a clear line of sight to those synergy numbers, and we're quite hopeful that we can do better.","William Chappell","Great. And then, just second question, maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in Brazil, both from your business and from Jarden's business and kind of the outlook expected this year.","Michael Polk","Yeah, our Brazilian business has struggled, our Tools business in Brazil in particular, and it's, by far, the biggest component of the new Newell Brands. You're talking about a business that's over $100 million there. And it's been a struggle, in particular, given currency movements, to maintain margins. So we've priced significantly in Brazil and have lost volume momentum there. So this is an ongoing struggle. It's all built into our guidance, but I think this is going to be a tough year for our Tools business in Brazil. We've had like challenges on the Jarden side of our business.","That said, both companies have done well in Latin America in the first quarter, despite, in the case of legacy Newell, the absence of Venezuela in the numbers and the challenges in Brazil. Newell's core growth in Brazil was actually down materially in the first quarter. So despite that, delivered 5.5% growth. And Jarden's had some similar challenges there. I will say within the Jarden numbers, one of the standout performances in the first quarter was JCS. So despite having a footprint that intersects with those dynamics that I was describing in Brazil, the business, in aggregate, did quite well.","William Chappell","Great. I'll turn it over. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Polk","Hi, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey. Good morning. So post-close, as you guys have been able to take a closer look at the Jarden business the last few weeks here, any kind of positive or negative surprises on your side as you look at it? What kind of shape do you think the portfolio is in, from a core sales growth standpoint, and as you look at the innovation pipeline? And also, then, on the synergy front, any updated thoughts on if you might integrate these companies from a supply chain or manufacturing standpoint more than you were originally assuming in the synergies you've laid out and, if you do, what type of synergy level that could unlock? Thanks.","Michael Polk","Sure. So, obviously, as you would imagine, we've been engaged, Bill and Mark in particular, Russ Torres, Rich Sansone, really engaged in getting up to speed on the Jarden businesses over the last number of months to the degree that we could, and since the 15th, in much greater depth. And the teams, in fact, all the teams from across Newell, and legacy Newell and legacy Jarden, are together next week for the week. And we're really going to dive on each other's businesses. So we're going to share. And we're going to learn. We're going to connect. We're going to get into this in a lot greater detail as we try to build out one integrated company leadership team. So that's very exciting. And it'll be fun on the social side, but, more importantly, we'll get into the details of the business.","Jarden's had some really good momentum. As I mentioned, JCS had good growth in the first quarter on great growth year ago period, double-digit growth year ago and very good growth in the first quarter on top of that; Yankee, again, double-digit growth a year ago period, great growth in the first quarter on top of that. So we've got some decent momentum in some of the most important assets that are in the Jarden portfolio. And as you can tell from our numbers, you've got similar momentum in our most strategically-critical businesses like Writing.","So we feel terrific. We're right where we expected to be in the combination. And we're excited by the possibilities. We're going to go through the work over the summer of establishing portfolio priorities, just like we did when we got to Newell Rubbermaid. And obviously, JCS and Yankee will be priority businesses for us going forward, with Writing and with Food & Beverage and the likely suspects that you're familiar with from the former Newell businesses, but we'll go through that rigorous process of establishing portfolio priorities through the summer.","We've got a board meeting in a couple of weeks where we'll expose our approach to the board. And then, by the August board meeting, we'll be ready to lock in our portfolio prioritization choices and you should expect resources to align to those priorities. And we'll invest heavily on the businesses with the greatest potential, the greatest right to win. And we'll ask the other businesses to win differently, to win in different ways than by leveraging the big investments in brand development and design and in innovation that we'll place on our priority businesses.","So you should expect that logic that drove the choices within Newell Rubbermaid to drive the choices in the combined Newell Brands. You know, that said, all businesses have to grow. All businesses have to grow ahead of their markets' growth as the engine that powers the company. And it's really critical for our teams to embrace that. And based on what I've seen, I think that's going to be a really easy thing for us to land as an integrated company. The values, the operational intensity that underpins things that we've done over the last few years, are clearly in place on the Jarden businesses. So I'm quite optimistic about there not being any cultural or social issues with us getting aligned on how we intend to operate.","With respect to synergies, obviously, synergy is going to flow to margin. The work on Rubbermaid that's still left to do, the $300 million of savings we hope to get, roughly $300 million, half of that will flow into investment. Where we put those investment bets, I'm quite agnostic about that. The fact that the savings that we would invest back are coming from legacy Newell Rubbermaid doesn't mean that the spending will happen there.","So we're going to make sure that our strategy yields a set of outcomes that are greater than the sum of the parts. So we're going to take money and put it on the businesses with the greatest right to win. So I feel great about where we are these really early stages. Everybody's sprinting. We're excited by the possibilities and energized by the work ahead.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","And moving forward, your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael Polk","Morning.","Lauren Lieberman","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the exit. I think in the release it sounded like it could be a combination from both legacy companies.","Michael Polk","Yes.","Lauren Lieberman","And then with what it is specific to Jarden are those things that you think you'll \u2013 is this the same thing as sort of fix the businesses, and would you address Western Europe or Baby in your own portfolio? Thanks.","Michael Polk","Yeah. So, as you know, our inclination is to get into these businesses and choose to fix them rather than either sell them or exit them. In certain cases within our last five year history at Newell Rubbermaid, we made the choice to exit, as we did in Europe. It was a critical enabler. The exits we took on in Europe were critical enablers to us getting the cost structure down, particularly in our distribution and transportation networks. And, as you know, the profitability went from less than $10 million in Europe in 2009 to over $100 million in Europe as a result of some of those choices. And, of course, those savings come out because of those integrated choices on exits and on reprioritizing portfolio choices.","We're going to likely face into similar dynamics within the Jarden business. And while it's premature to specifically call out businesses that we would exit, because our inclination is to first go fix, over the summer and as we get more opportunity to connect with you, we'll bring and shine a brighter light on the specifics that underpin the headline.","It was important for us to lay that out for you so that you understood the core sales growth guidance and didn't misread the dynamics that are embed within it. So we'll see how this all plays out. There certainly are some assets on the Newell Rubbermaid side that we'd consider exiting as well. And if we got to the point where we'd make that choice, the first question we'd ask is could we sell them rather than exit them. But given that it's early and we wanted to set core sales guidance expectations, we felt it appropriate to articulate the boundaries around the product line exits that we may choose to implement.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. And then, if I could just ask one more question on Tools; talked about A&P being up and my recollection is that both that business and Commercial Products are places where you've kind of flirted with and committed some A&P dollars, with mixed results in terms of the actual return. So was there anything in particular that you stepped up advertising behind? Is it a new initiative or is it something where you have done before and seen the positive return?","Michael Polk","This is an open question for us, particularly on Tools. On Commercial Products, we've pulled back the spending to roughly 3%, 3.5% of revenue. And I think that's where you should expect us to keep it, unless we have some big news there that we want to punctuate. As you know, we've learned that doing anathematic advertising didn't work; that we were better to advertise new items in the news. And that's where our advertising on Tools has been focused as we've launched new items in the back half of 2015 that have flowed into 2016, but we're going to continue to ask questions about this, because particularly in the light of the broader portfolio, because they're businesses like Yankee. They're businesses like the Appliance business. There's some other aspects of the Jarden portfolio that we feel could benefit from increased A&P support.","So as we go through the process of making the portfolio choices across the total portfolio, some of those priorities that we had placed in legacy Newell may change, as we broaden our perspective on the businesses with the greatest potential. And so some of that money that might have historically been spent on Tools could very well ease, find their way to being spent on Yankee or on Appliance launches or on any number of other businesses that have interesting things going on.","So I think you should keep an open mind as to how we go through the process over the next few weeks and months, towards probably a late-summer articulation of those priorities to the broader market. And you will see us reallocate resources based on them, both human capital and money.","Lauren Lieberman","That's great. Thank you. And, John, just housekeeping, what's the interest expense level for the full year that we should be using?","John Stipancich","So overall, for us, I think I'll give you in terms of a rate is a little over about 4.04% overall on a pre-tax basis; in terms of dollars, about $400 million.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS.","Michael Polk","Hey, Steve.","Stephen Powers","Hey, Mike. How are you? So a great start on the Newell side. Maybe just a little more color, if you could, on what to expect on just over the balance of the year in terms of quarterly cadence, likewise on the Jarden side. Is there any key puts or takes to call out? If you could also quantify the amortization benefit of backing out those expenses from legacy Newell, that would help, unless I missed it.","And then really, my broader question, and you've touched upon it a little bit, is just to ask you if you could talk a bit more about the process by which you're going to put together your plans looking out to fiscal 2017 and beyond. I know you're going to meet next week and get in front of the board by August. But could you just talk a little bit more about: who's involved; and the timing of likely decisions; the timing of communication, whether internally, externally; and really what your biggest priorities are in putting the plans together? Is it incremental cost synergies, revenue synergies, portfolio choices, getting the organization right? I'd just love to know more about how you're thinking about things as you embark on solidifying a combined company strategy over the long-term.","Michael Polk","Yeah, right. So, Steve, there are three kind of questions there. I'll deal with the first one, which is on, I think your question was focused on the Jarden businesses, but I'll give you my perspective on both, with respect to the flow of growth through the year. And then I'll let John answer the questions on amortization, and then I'll come back on process.","So, as you know, Jarden's Q1s is really a pretty light quarter with respect to its overall impact on the total trajectory of the business. The year-ago numbers, if you look at the year-ago numbers that they're bridging: first quarter a year ago, I think had 4.8% organic growth; second quarter 7%; and then 6% in the third quarter; and about 2% in the fourth quarter. And so the year-ago comparators are tougher in the first three quarters than they are in the balance of the year.","That said, growth on the Jarden businesses should pick up through the year, as they historically have. And, as I've said, we've got good momentum and obviously a little bit of an easier comp in Q4 than we do in the early part of the year. Q4, obviously, most important quarter for Jarden, and I think we're well positioned and the teams are well positioned to nail the activities that have to be executed in that window to deliver the outcomes. Of course, weather is always a variable in the fourth quarter for their businesses. And so we won't count on anything other than normal weather conditions. But I think we're in a good position to land right in the middle of that guidance range we've articulated.","On the Newell side, we've got terrific momentum. I think particularly in the Writing business, where ex-Venezuela a year ago, our growth was probably around 6.5%-ish and to nail 8.8% in the first quarter without the benefit of Venezuela is a sign of building momentum. We've launched all of our new items earlier in the year than we did last year. We've got interesting momentum now building on the Rubbermaid brand behind the launch of FreshWorks and Fasten&Go. And we've got a great launch coming in the back half of the year, so the year has the potential to be the renaissance year for the Rubbermaid brand, so we're excited about that.","We've got ongoing momentum on Beverages. Baby put in another terrific quarter, with over 9% core growth. And Tools came in stronger, quite frankly, than we expected. Commercial was probably a little softer than we expected. It's timing-related, but an aggregate of 5.6% growth in the first quarter is great, probably one of our strongest quarters in a long, long time. And given the underlying momentum being driven by new products and strengthened investment behind the brands, we're encouraged that that should be able to continue.","We've guided to the middle of the guidance range on Newell Rubbermaid. And we'll see. If things continue as they did in Q1, maybe there's some upside to that, but we'll have to see how the full year plays out. It's a little too early to get too excited, although I'd much rather start the way we did than not.","So in aggregate, we're feeling pretty darn good about where we're at. Our expectations for the Jarden performance in the first quarter were virtually right in line with them. The complexion, obviously, within any of these businesses, by business, how the numbers aggregate out is always a little bit different than you expect. But that's sort of the normal and natural flow.","John, with respect to amortization...","John Stipancich","Sure. So, Steve, to answer your question on the Newell side, the pickup in terms of normalized earnings associated with the normalization of the amortization of intangibles on a full year basis is about $38 million. If you take the 8.5 months this year, assuming that we're going to start it at that time period, it's about $24 million this year. And those are both pre-tax numbers.","Stephen Powers","Perfect. Thanks.","Michael Polk","Sure. And then on process with respect to portfolio choices, we are together next week to come together as the leadership team, and the folks that'll be there are the business unit leaders, their finance leaders, a number of their leadership teams' team members. And it is in part social, to get to know each other, both sides of the family and also to get into the businesses. So each business will go through a business review that all of the other businesses will learn from, as well as management. And then Bill and Mark and the teams will do a much deeper dive on the Jarden businesses towards the end of the week.","That information, that work, that thinking, will all inform the portfolio choice activities that we'll go through, through the summer. This is an analytic process. It's not subjective. So we're going to look at market mapping globally. And we've begun this work. We're going to look at market and category growth rates globally. We'll look at the strength of brands by geography. We've got that research in flight already, to understand where brands have leverage. And the intersection of people's thinking on the businesses with the broad analytic macro view of geography, category and channel dynamics, plus brand strength, and the competitive strength, will inform where we place our bets. And obviously, margins and financial attractiveness contribute to that whole bit of analysis.","So there'll be lots of folks inputting. There'll be a few folks that are doing the analytical rigor through the summer. End of June, my team will get together for a week, my direct team, to talk about the results, to talk about the path forward. And that strategic work will be refined through July to the August board meeting, and then we'll probably come public with bits of that in early September and then all of our choices for 2017 will be informed by that piece of work. So you should expect us to be reallocating resources to the businesses with the highest potential as part of our 2017 planning process.","Stephen Powers","Perfect. Thank you for the perspective.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","Michael Polk","Hey, John.","John Faucher","Thanks. Good morning. One of the concerns that I do hear from investors is a question of sort of whether the cultures can merge and how you take something, again, you guys have more of an operating culture versus a holding company culture, and can you talk a little bit about what you've learned from that standpoint and how you feel that that sort of meshing of the two cultures within the organizations is going to play out?","Michael Polk","I would say, John, that our cultures are more similar than you might think. Our business models were quite different, but when I engage with Jarden folks \u2013 we went out last night after getting ready for this call to the little pub around the corner, we were watching the draft. And there was a group of Newell people and a group of Jarden people there, and it was the same dynamic. It was as if this group had been together for a long time. You know, this is a pretty operationally-intense group of leaders that I've met so far. And so I don't think that's going to be the issue. The business models are different, so I think socializing the changes associated with that in the places where we choose to make change, I think shouldn't be underestimated, but it won't be governed by culture.","Expectations are high for the combined entity. And so we all have to raise the bar. The performance that we've delivered over the last number of years, while it's been pretty darn good relative to the industry \u2013 and if you look at Martin and the team's track record on value creation, it's way at the top of the league table, but the combination, we've said that we're going to be stronger together than either of us were apart. And that's the rationale for the deal.","So expectations are high. Our performance needs to rise. Our expectations of each other need to be really high. And we need to align around that. I think that's probably one of the most important bits of change management that has to happen quickly, that looking backwards and judging performances cannot be a forward-looking basis for what great looks like. Great has to look better than what we've done as individual companies in the past. And so, we're going to raise the bar on each other. And we're going to establish great clarity around what outcomes we're looking for.","Growth is the engine that powers this company, and it has to be going forward. We're going to get great margin development through the synergies and by maximizing the mix through portfolio, the portfolio choices we work. But growth is undoubtedly the engine that's going to fire this company going forward. And we've guided 3% to 4%, which I think will be competitive results, given the exits we'll likely embrace. But going forward, I think we can consistently deliver at the high end of that range, once we get through this transitional period.","And we need to put the building blocks in place as a company to deliver that, to sustain that, and maybe even beyond that going forward. And so that's the change management piece of work that needs to happen. That's the messaging that needs to be embraced. And people need to make the choice as to whether they're ready to enlist and line up behind that ambition, which I think, based on what I see, it's going to be no problem. It's going to be very exciting. It's going to be also a lot of fun.","John Faucher","Great. And then, one follow-up would be on the sort of the top line synergy question in terms of you guys haven't really talked about that. Is it still too early to get a handle where you can drive more of the top line synergies or is that beginning to come into focus?","Michael Polk","No, we're pretty clear about where those opportunities are. We talked about some of them outside. Depending on the rate of exits, some of that maybe get masked in those numbers, but we haven't built really any of that into the guidance we've provided at this point. So to the degree that we can get that quickly, we'll get some upsides to the numbers or maybe we get to the high end of the range if we get the revenue synergies to start to track.","You think about the revenue synergies, there are three buckets: cross-sell, the opportunity for cross sell; the opportunity for accelerated international deployment; and the opportunity to lead at the category level by applying the best of both companies' capabilities to the category growth agenda. Those three are listed in the relative speed with which they are accessible. So channel cross-sell's accessible to us pretty much immediately. It's just a question of getting customer alignment around taking assets from one business and putting them into channels that other businesses have access to.","The most telegraphic example of that is the commentary we've shared on Beverages taking Contigo and Avex and Rubbermaid and thinking about which portions of that portfolio are most relevant to the outdoor channel and leveraging Coleman's selling systems and giving Coleman credit for selling the assets, quite frankly. But letting them sell down their vertical brands like, particularly Avex and Contigo I would guess, and maybe bubba.","And so, that's an example of one thing that's available to us. And there are many, many, many others like that. Those things come early. International cross-sell probably takes us six to nine months, maybe a little longer to get activated.","And then, just like the work that happened at Newell Rubbermaid, it took us 18 to 24 months to get a growth yield on the application of Newell's brand development design and innovation model. And where we apply that model within the Jarden portfolio, I would expect it takes that long to get impact as well. So there's a sequence to these three different buckets of revenue synergies, with channel cross-sell offering the greatest opportunity in the near-term.","John Faucher","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Michael Polk","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","Mike, can we come back to the Jarden side of the business? So the 2% organic sales growth in the quarter, you said was in line with what you had expected. It was probably a shade below market expectation. Can you specifically talk a little bit about some of the factors, understanding that it's a light seasonal quarter for Jarden? But talk a little bit specifically about some of the factors that are driving the slowdown. The comp did get considerably easier this quarter relative to last.","Michael Polk","Sure.","Kevin Grundy","And then maybe specifically talk a little bit about your line of sight here in terms of why things do get better to do the midpoint or the 3%, if you will, as comps do get tougher over the next couple quarters. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Michael Polk","Yeah. Yeah, no problem. So you're right. The Q4 growth rate that they had to comp, Q4 2014 growth rate, was about 11.4%. Q1 growth rate that the legacy Jarden business had to comp was about 4.7%. One of the big reasons this gets easier going forward is because of the uncertainty, the veil of uncertainty that comes with a transaction like this that was overhanging the Jarden team in the first quarter, goes away. We become human, accessible and involved. And so, don't underestimate the impact of that on a business's ability to execute.","So that's certainly an overhang in Q1. And that's why we were quite conservative in both businesses, quite conservative in the way they thought about underlying performance.","We've got momentum where it counts on the Jarden business right now. You've got momentum in Yankee, got momentum in JCS. Within some of the other segments or groups, you've got businesses that are looking quite interesting at the moment. You have some other factors that overhang the first quarter, like the impact of a different kind of weather experience in the winter sports area. And that's just the reality of Mother Nature that we've got to deal with. And so, that clearly has some impact on some of the businesses. And while I won't get into very specific business unit numbers today, you can expect us going forward, as we get into this, to punctuate the specifics for you on a forward-looking basis.","So why do things accelerate going forward? Things accelerate going forward because the uncertainty and the overhang on the organization connected to the combination of Newell and Jarden is behind us. We build enthusiasm behind the combination and the potential for Newell Brands. We engage and get into the details of their business, and think about how we optimize the deployment of resources across the total portfolio, so we plus-up the winners and keep leaning our shoulders into them with more resource. We don't give up much, I don't think, in certain other areas within Newell Rubbermaid, if we were to shift resources around and lean our shoulder into a couple of Jarden businesses.","And then, we get on with fixing some of the business that are underperforming. And while I won't get into the specifics within the Jarden portfolio of that, because it's just a little bit premature to be talking about that sort of stuff publicly, we're going to get in. We do profit interventions when they're required. We did it on Baby. We did it on Europe within Newell Rubbermaid. We were very public that we were doing it. And you can count on us to articulate those when we're ready to.","Think about the Baby business. The Baby business was declining 10% in the first half of 2011, and then it was flat on the full year. And we got that business back to 10% compounded growth in 2012, 2013. Last year, we grew 6%-plus in that business; last two quarters, around 9%.","So when you get involved and get into the details and you unpack issues, you can fix them. And so, there's a couple of businesses like that that require some intervention on the Jarden side and there are a couple businesses on the Newell side that we're involved with. We've talked about Tools and it's starting to yield the outcomes we hoped. And we'll keep our eye and apply the pressure and get involved and help resolve some of the issues, wherever they exist. And so it's the combination of those things that give us the confidence that we can get right smack dab in the middle of the guidance range for the full year.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up, Mike, is on working capital. And you've been very clear that your guidance doesn't assume any improvements there, either on the Newell side or on the Jarden side, but when you screen the group, both Newell and Jarden come in bottom quartile relative to the consumer staples group. Now, some of this may be structural, but you also mentioned, too, it's a bigger focus, so operating cash flow will be a component of executive comp this year. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity? I know there's been a race to the finish line to get the deal done, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity and whether that will be something you'll put a number on, at some point in the future? Thanks.","Michael Polk","Let me start where you ended. Yes, we'll put a number on it in the future. You look at the inventory days, you say, man, there's an opportunity in both companies. There is a structural difference, so you cannot benchmark companies that source finished goods against companies that are 100% self-manufactured. You're never going to get the inventory days to kind match up. So you're naturally going to be longer. And the reason that obviously makes sense is you don't have the fixed assets in your manufacturing base. So you accept a longer working capital hit on inventory days for the sake of avoiding a fixed asset base. So they're always going to be longer.","Do they need to be as long as they are? Absolutely not, there's absolutely no reason that we can't do better than we have up until now on the Newell Rubbermaid side. Forecasting our business and having the confidence to call the upside in managing the flow of product along the entire value chain into inventories. So we've got work going on with respect to complexity reduction, which will be an enabler to getting inventories down, but we haven't really leaned our shoulder into that yet.","I think we have an opportunity to extend payables as well on both sides, and we're going to focus on that as part of our procurement work. So we have a lot of levers to pull on working capital. Cash matters a ton. It always has, but it really does over the next couple of years.","And it always should, because cash going forward, once you get delevered, becomes the complementary investment tool we've got to strengthen our aggregate performance, on top of what we hope to be a very strong organic performance. And so it matters a ton. We're going to do this. This is the bit that we haven't focused on as much as we could, and we're going to get it right. And we'll put some numbers around it, so you can hold us accountable for profit.","Kevin Grundy","Very good. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Michael Polk","Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz","Hey, Mike. Good morning.","Michael Polk","Hey, Bill.","William Schmitz","Hey, can you just talk about some of the milestones and dates for some of the typical merger integration stumbling blocks? So when you'll have the pro forma management structure, the GB structures, maybe the employment contracts to make sure you keep some of the key people, and then when are you going to decide who is going to cover the key accounts and who is going to have to leave, and then lastly, just when you will have the full systems cutover?","Michael Polk","Yeah. Well, structure follows strategy. So the strategy work on portfolio through the summer is really an important first step in getting to having a discussion about organization design, route to market, all those things. So I think you should not expect us to move over the summer on choices like that. Top leadership team, coming together. There was a question before on supply chain. We're in the market looking for a supply chain leader for the total company. We hope to get that done over the next couple of months. And we're forming and storming the teams now. With respect to our business unit leaders, I feel pretty good about their engagement, so I don't think there's huge risk there.","And with respect to the org design, again, it'll flow from the portfolio choices, which we'll come out of the August board meeting and then we'll make some decisions on how exactly we apply the agreements we get there and what choices we make. I wouldn't expect us to do it all in one swing. I think you should think about us applying some of the work, getting experience with what are a set of pretty intuitive combinations you would expect from us, and then learning from that and moving sequentially. I think one of the most important things we've got to do is leverage our scale in channels and geographies and customers. That'll inform some of the things we think about as well.","William Schmitz","So, okay. And how about the systems cutover?","Michael Polk","Yeah, systems, we've got 32 different ERP systems within legacy Jarden, so this is going to be a very important part of our overall integration work. There's a whole work stream around this. I think we'll end up providing great visibility to you over time of all the work streams. I'm very happy exposing where the work's happening. It's a little early to do that, but you should expecting us to be getting to balancing the kind of cash investment required against the return, but getting to a streamlined level of ERP systems, such that information flow happens more systemically, as opposed to having human intervention drive the flow of information.","And we very successfully did that at Newell. We went live on SAP in Asia Pacific in the first quarter, actually in April, or at least to four or five countries in Asia Pacific, and we'll sequentially fill out the rest of the map over the balance of this year. And Newell will effectively be done; Russia and Turkey, two outliers, but, on balance, 99% on the same ERP system. So we'll begin to take that one on as well as part of our agenda. We have not counted on any cost synergies yet from that work. And this will be an area that likely falls into the second tranche of savings beyond the first $500 million.","William Schmitz","Gotcha, because I think like right now you have a daily sales dashboard at Newell. Do you have the same thing for Jarden?","Michael Polk","Yeah, it's called 1-800 \u2013 I don't need one. First of all, I shouldn't be doing that. I've got to confess to you, that's probably not what a CEO should be doing, but I do like it. I'm a junkie for the data because numbers have always been words to me. But we don't have that today at Jarden, but we have a really sophisticated, connected process, where, if I wanted it, I could probably get it. But that dashboard doesn't exist today in that dynamic a way. But it didn't exist at Newell Rubbermaid when we started, either. We built it. So...","William Schmitz","Okay. Yeah, and just one last quick one. I mean...","Michael Polk","Yeah.","William Schmitz","I think the Jarden employees are reasonably more highly compensated than some of the legacy Newell guys, so are you willing to sort of pay up to keep the critical people and sort of what does that mean for the broader company?","Michael Polk","Yeah, we've kept everything the same on the Jarden side in 2016. When the grants come for leaders coming out of the May board meeting, it'll be exactly what they would have expected had the transaction not occurred. And you just have to accept that there are differences. Over time, we'll figure out how to bring the companies together. And our principles are going to be very simple. We're going to pay people at the 50th percentile pay and when we need extraordinary talent in key roles, critical roles, tend to get paid more. And that's fine. I don't have any issues with that.","But our principles are that we pay at the 50th percentile. And for extraordinary talent in critical roles, we'll go higher than that, but, of course, you can make a lot of money here if you perform. And the whole comp philosophy for the company is that you can double-up basically if you just outperform your objectives. And so people can make a lot of money on Newell Rubbermaid side if they nail their numbers. And that's the philosophy we'll embed. We want to embed a pay-per-performance culture. I don't think it's really that dissimilar, because this has certainly been a pay-per-performance culture on the Jarden side as well. The mechanisms are different. And so we'll over time get that sorted.","William Schmitz","Okay, great. Thanks. Have a good weekend.","Operator","And moving on, we'll hear next from Wendy Nicholson of Citi.","Michael Polk","Hey, Wendy.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Good morning. Hello.","Michael Polk","How are you?","Wendy Nicholson","Good. I have a couple questions. First, on the Writing business, this is two quarters in a row where we've seen the margin come down. And I know you called out the Elmer's seasonality as well as currency headwinds, but can you just kind of remind us your outlook for the full year? Do you think operating margins for the Writing segment, kind of net of the China expansion, which \u2013 oh, by the way, can you comment if that's still on track?","Michael Polk","Yeah.","Wendy Nicholson","Are margins for the Writing segment kind of going to be where they were last year or do you think they'll be down for the full year?","Michael Polk","Yeah, so I'll deal with both of those. Let me deal with the second question first. So China's on track for a Q4 launch; start a marketing around back-to-school, which is in February of 2017, but pipeline and route to market work in the fourth quarter of 2016, which is where we've always had it planned. And very excited about the prospects of Sharpie and Paper Mate into one big market, which is in Shanghai. So really looking forward to that and I'm excited about the potential of our Writing business in China over time.","So that's fine and progressing and Kristie and Vic Misawa; Kristie Juster, who is the President of Writing segment; and Vic Misawa, who is the SVP of Writing Brand Development, are working hand-in-hand to get the launch to occur. So that's right on track.","But with respect to writing margins, we're going to continue to invest in Writing. I'll make sure Nancy gets back to you on what exactly the Elmer's impact has been on margin for the Writing segment. It's pretty material. And the other thing that you have to remember is that in our public numbers, we have Venezuela in the year-ago period. And in the current period, we don't. The Venezuelan margins were higher than fleet average margins.","So I wouldn't want you to think about this as us being willing to accept margin declines. These are structural mix-related issues in the year-over-year numbers. We hold people accountable for margin development on a pegged rate basis. So while we report at actual rates, peoples' incentive structures are based in constant currency. And we're doing fine in that respect, although I will tell you that as we extend the shoulders of the business into new geographies, there's going to be an A&P investment requirement that'll dilute operating margins for a period of time. But you know how we operate. We're happy to do that for a period of time, if we're getting the growth yield. And we'll pull that money out and move it somewhere else at some point in the future. You saw on the Baby business in terms of the operating margin development of Baby in the first quarter.","There's also a currency-related impact, given how we source componentry related to the end dollar that's impacting gross margins. We don't want to price for that. So there's some inside baseball things that contribute to that that are sort of external factor-related that we don't always choose to price to recover. So I'm not stressed about writing margins at all.","We've got a big project going on in writing complexity that will enhance gross margins going forward. And I think that's probably something that we should illuminate for you guys over the next six to nine months. But we've talked about writing complexity, but to understand the manufacturing footprint, the changes we're making there, might bring some color to the margin development forward-looking story.","Wendy Nicholson","Okay. That all sounds fair, but that sort of concept of complexity, if you will, leads me to my second question, which is kind of a follow-up to the discussion about the product line exits. And I guess number one, I didn't hear you clarify of the, let's call it, $300 million, how much is in the core business verses how much is Jarden. Have you done that?","Michael Polk","Yeah, no, we've got a pretty good perspective. I'd say the majority will be on the Jarden side, but it's not an unsubstantial amount that potentially could be on Newell Rubbermaid's side. So you know we're continuing to do the work on Consumer Storage.","Wendy Nicholson","Yes.","Michael Polk","So we're not done with that yet. There are some aspects of our Baby business that could benefit us to pull back on, so there's bits and pieces. There's some things in Consumer Cleaning within the Rubbermaid brand, as we get Rubbermaid more focused around food storage, food preservation, food on-the-go. We have to go through the full work of understanding how costs get allocated to business to understand the real underlying profitability and cash impact of these businesses. But those are all areas that we're going to intensely focus on to understand whether certain aspects of the Rubbermaid business might be better served exiting, and Baby as well. So still some opportunity in Baby Europe in particular.","Wendy Nicholson","But my...","Michael Polk","So these are things we'd go after. And on the Jarden side, I just don't want to declare too early, until we get into this a little bit more deeply into this with them, but there are perspectives we've got coming out of the first couple of weeks and the couple of months prior to that, that are worth reflecting on.","Wendy Nicholson","Well, and that's my sort of last question, my sort of philosophical question, which is you've said very clearly that you've got a ton of work and it sounds like you've got specific plans and timing for completing that work and articulating it to us and all of that kind of stuff.","Michael Polk","Yes.","Wendy Nicholson","So I'm a little surprised that you would tell us a number at all at this point, because I would think that, if anything, that number, let's call it, $200 million of product line exits from Jarden, is at risk of going up significantly. And I am curious as to why you chose to give us that number today, because I would imagine the product line impact in the second quarter is going to be relatively minimal, and it just seems like it's a number that could be awfully premature.","Michael Polk","Well, it's a fair question. It's a good question. So, as you undoubtedly know about us, we don't just sort of pull numbers out. We build them from bottom up. And so we have a pretty clear sense of what we do. I just think it would be premature to declare that. These are businesses that are probably unsellable. That doesn't mean there aren't other businesses that you might think about from a portfolio management perspective going forward. So it's just one piece of the puzzle. And then, as I said, our inclination is to try to fix businesses.","So this doesn't mean these are the only business that are margin challenged. So then the question becomes why share that this early? Because I want to set guidance expectations on core sales growth, and because of how we define core sales growth versus how organic sales growth was defined, it's important for us to pivot from the 3% to 5% organic guidance to the 2% to 4% core guidance on the Jarden businesses, and explain that and give you the reasons why we're doing that, in that that's because organic sales excluded the impact of product line exits and core sales includes the impact of product line exits.","So being explicit in saying that we were exiting $250 million to $300 million of business over the next two to three years, gives you a better ability to understand the core sales assumptions and not get freaked out about the fact that we might be guiding down on Jarden. We're not at all doing that. What we're doing is saying we're going to get to one approach to guiding underlying performance in the business, which is the core sales number. And that's the mechanism by which we do it. So fair question, though, Wendy. And I appreciate it, respect it, and you can count on us to get quite specific shortly.","Wendy Nicholson","Sounds great, terrific. Thanks, Mike.","Michael Polk","Okay.","Operator","Next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Michael Polk","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Altobello","Hey, guys. Good morning. So first question, Mike, and obviously it's still early. You guys have only owned Jarden now for, I guess, two weeks here, but as you look at the organization and the structure there and you think about the plan that you guys are going to present to the board in the coming summer, how similar is the playbook that you guys have in place for Jarden compared to what you had five years ago when you first got to Newell?","Michael Polk","Well, it's a little bit different in that the Newell Rubbermaid business wasn't growing when we started. So you've got a different scenario, where you've got both Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden legacy businesses growing nicely. So the context is a little bit different. The application of the capabilities agenda is going to be really exciting. I think the work that the legacy Jarden folks have done on direct-to-consumer e-commerce is really exciting. I just got an e-mail from Hope Margala's team on Yankee Candle. And I called my daughters right away, because you can customize a Yankee Candle jar with pictures of your family for Mother's Day. And I was like, girls, if we want to get it delivered by Mother's Day, we got to do it this weekend. And that's just brilliant. And we don't do that. We weren't thinking that creatively on our direct-to-consumer e-commerce front. And so there's some stuff on that side that is so applicable.","One of the first things I did was I built online a customized Rawlings baseball mitt and I just got it two weeks ago. And it was so exciting. My wife saw it. My wife, doesn't even know anything about baseball, wants a baseball mitt customized for her. So I mean, there's some really exciting things that Jarden has done that we haven't been that creative about on the Newell Rubbermaid side, so we have tremendous opportunity to apply that capability.","On the other side, we have a terrific design and innovation machine going now on Newell Rubbermaid. 5.6% core sales growth is a big number when 75% of your revenue is in the U.S. and U.S. GDP growth is 0.5%. Now, why are we growing 5.6%? It's because we've got these innovations that are coming through the funnel and hitting the marketplace with impact. We can apply that capability to many aspects of the Jarden portfolio. And you should expect us to apply that.","Now, that's the Newell playbook working for Jarden, and the Jarden playbook working for Newell. So the best of both capabilities applied across the total portfolio is what we're going to go do with a real passion around brands and growth. This idea that growth is the engine that fires this company is really important for people to embrace. And we mean growth through brilliant commercial execution and through brilliant brand development, and we're going to do both of those.","And I think when we're done and we look back with the benefit of three or four or five or six, seven years, we'll say, man, we really did do what we said by taking the best of both talent pools and the best of both capabilities and applying them as broadly as they are relevant across the portfolio.","And we're more sophisticated than this. It does not mean that every capability is applicable to every business. And that's fine. And it doesn't disable the scale leverage that we've got through the combination, when you accept that. It's just smart management. And so you should expect us to push hard to make the company leaner and meaner, to scale functions for efficiency in the business partnering areas, and to scale functions for impact across the total enterprise for growth, but we're going to maintain intimacy at the point of demand creation, which is where the selling happens and where the consumer engages with our brands. And if you step back from design types of concepts and focus on principles, that's the type of thing that'll inform choices on specific design choices. And that's what's going to drive us.","This is a company, when we get the brand research back from this summer, I suspect, and when we expose it to you, you're going to be blown away by the quality of the brands in this portfolio. I was within Newell Rubbermaid, relative to brands I'd worked on before.","And I've worked on great brands; worked on Oreo. I've worked on Dove, I worked on Axe. I worked on RITZ. I've worked on Maxwell House. I've worked on great brands; Kraft. But these brands are really way stronger than people perceive them to be. And I suspect that when we get the brand equity work back on brands like Oster, and brands like Yankee, and brands like Rawlings, brands like Coleman, you'll see these great assets; some of them, perhaps, latent and underleveraged, but great assets, just like we saw in Newell Rubbermaid.","Graco; Graco is, by far, the highest equity score of any brand I've worked on; higher than Dove. So my energy level is really high because I am so excited by unlocking the possibilities here with the teams. And I'm really excited by the prospects of us applying the best of what both companies have to offer across the total portfolio.","Joseph Altobello","Got it. It's very helpful. And just one last housekeeping question for Stip; in terms of the tax rate, the 29% to 30% this year, is that a good tax rate to use going forward or is there more of an opportunity to get that down to more the legacy Newell tax rate?","John Stipancich","Yeah, so we didn't built in anything in our synergies, Joe, for getting the tax rate down, but you should expect us to run like hell to get a better rate based upon historically what we've done on the Newell side, so I would tell you there's certainly some upside. And we've already started the work, trying to figure out how to bring some of the Jarden stuff into our structure and so forth and try to maximize the structure for the new entity.","Michael Polk","That said, Joe, I wouldn't take the old guidance that we had on Newell Rubbermaid for around 23%-ish rate. I think we'll find the opportunities, like John said, there are going to be plenty of them, but I would assume that we're going to get them gradually, as opposed to overnight.","Joseph Altobello","Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Michael Polk","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thank you. First, on the Jarden organic sales, you guys were pretty explicit that the 2% to 4% is the 2016 target, but can you talk about what you think? Do you think you get back to the stand-alone target of 3% to 5%? Is that the right run rate on a go-forward basis from 2017 on? And then, in terms of the businesses that are slated for sale, are you going to start characterizing the Jarden businesses into sort of the win bigger versus incubate categories to give us visibility into how you think about different businesses like you did when you first came to Newell?","Michael Polk","Yeah, so let me start with the last part. I think you should count on us to articulate for you portfolio roles. Coming into the fall, we'll be in a position to probably talk to that. We won't use the same language. This is a whole new company for both sides. And so we'll brand it maybe a little bit differently, but it will be the same basic where to play choices. And we'll realign, obviously, the portfolio choices to the new portfolio. So, yes, is the answer on that piece of the question.","Your question on 2017 guidance, we haven't guided 2017 growth. I will tell you, though, that the $250 to $300 million of exits that we've talked about were over two to three years. And if you do the math on that, you'd see that those exits will govern the opportunity to break out on the high end probably through 2017. So what is the right long-term guidance? We haven't gotten to that yet. I want to go through the work over the summer. We'll pull together an integrated forward-looking model that gives you that long-term guidance.","You can capture some of that through the comments I was making through 2018 on cash and capital allocation. You can back into some numbers, if you chose to. But I wouldn't want to begin to start to articulate the acceleration stage metrics. It's just too early.","Olivia Tong","Got it. And then on A&P, up 40 basis points, still very strong improvement, but perhaps maybe not as aggressive as you were last year. So is this just a function of the base getting bigger or is there some timing of initiatives and how do you think about the spend for the remainder of the year?","Michael Polk","Actually, it depends on how we allocate A&P across the total portfolio, but if Newell Rubbermaid had been a stand-alone company this year, we would have increased A&P bps at least as much as we increased them last year in 2015. So I guided to 5.5%, if you remember, in the fall. A&P ratio, we delivered about 5%. So it would have been another 50 bps in the full year and I think you should assume that's a good number in your base case assumptions about the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses. If we do choose to spend some of the Renewal savings back on brands like Yankee or Oster, we'll let you know, so that you can adjust your models.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thanks, Mike.","Michael Polk","Yeah.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason Gere","Okay. Thanks. Hey, and I'll actually make this really quick because I think every question has been kind of discussed, so I will actually turn it back over to you, Mike. And congratulations on the quarter and look forward to talking to you soon.","Michael Polk","Great. Thanks, Jason.","Michael Polk","Well, on behalf of everybody in Newell Brands, the 60,000 employees of Newell Brands, we appreciate all the support and the good and challenging and fair questions, and we look forward to engaging with you the next opportunity. Thanks again.","Operator","A replay of today's call will be available later today on our website, newellbrands.com. This concludes our conference. You may now disconnect."]}}
