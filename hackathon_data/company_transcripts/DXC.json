Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jonathan Ford, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jonathan Ford","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased you're joining us for DXC Technology's Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. Our speakers on today's call will be Mike Salvino, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer. The call is being webcast at dxc.com\/investorrelations. And the webcast includes slides that will accompany the discussion today. After the call, we will post these slides on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Slide 2, informs our participants that DXC Technology's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release. On Slide 3, you'll see that certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","I'd also like to take this opportunity to announce that Shailesh Murali, DXC's current Head of M&A and Strategy will also be leading Investor Relations moving forward. Finally, I would like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call, except as required by law.","And now I'd like to introduce DXC Technology's President and CEO, Mike Salvino. Mike?","Mike Salvino","Jonathan, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining the call today. My style is one of the focus and clarity, which is what we plan to provide during this call. I'll begin by covering a few highlights from my observations on the business, then I'll hand the call over to Paul to discuss the second quarter results and full-year outlook. After that, I'll walk through DXC's strategy moving forward, specifically the enterprise technology stack. Next, we will cover the results of the strategic review of our assets. Then I'll close by providing additional color on our priorities.","Over the past two months, I've met with 40 of our largest customers, each of our strategic partners and more than 80,000 of our people around the world. DXC has experienced and loyal global talent base that I've had the opportunity to meet many of these people since taking the role and I've been extremely impressed with the quality of our talent. Our global operations talent, the people who work with our customers every day, are very loyal to DXC and to our customers. I personally met numerous people who have been with the Company for more than 30 years. DXC has a significant scale and global reach across technology offerings. For example, we have over $2 billion of cloud and security revenue. We also have $1.4 billion of revenue in data analytics and digital engineering. Building on that point, DXC has a loyal customer base that includes many of the largest companies in the world where we run their mission-critical systems. We have the opportunities in many of these accounts to increase share of wallet.","As I've taken a fresh look at DXC's businesses, I've been very pleased with our core capabilities. This includes ITO and applications as well as digital solutions. We have a strong foundation to build on. I've also been very pleased with DXC's differentiated solutions in IP and key industries such as automotive, insurance, healthcare and travel and transportation.","Finally, I've been impressed with the Company's track record of enhancing capabilities through targeted strategic acquisitions, including innovative assets like Luxoft, and recently Bluleader and Virtual Clarity. Bluleader will enhance our SAP application capabilities, and Virtual Clarity will strengthen our capabilities in delivering cloud assessments and transformation roadmaps to our customers. I've also seen several areas for improvement that DXC needs to address to enable growth. First, our delivery teams were not able to execute the more complicated phase of operational cost improvements, this includes areas like pyramid optimization, the broader deployment of DXC's automation program called Bionix, along with operational excellence leveraging Six Sigma principles. We need to focus more on our people and strengthening our employee value proposition. Our people need to be clear about their career path at DXC, the opportunities to work with new clients, and also the opportunities for rescaling and retraining.","Being clear about these items will help create an environment where people are acknowledged, recognized and rewarded, which will improve employee satisfaction and increase retention. We also need to focus more on selling integrated solutions. We have an opportunity to shift from providing individual services for many of our customers to integrated industry solutions, leveraging multiple DXC offerings and capabilities.","Next, execution challenges from recent delivery actions have negatively impacted some of our large customers, which results in lower margins, delayed revenue and bookings as customers have placed the additional work on hold. We have recovery plans underway for these accounts, but we need to do a better job running operations. By doing this, we will earn the right to expand our footprint with customers.","The current operating model is complex, resulting in unclear accountabilities as well as slow decision making. We will be simplifying this structure with greater emphasis on our regions and industries. Finally, DXC provides mission-critical services to many of our customers, particularly an ITO. With this business has been underemphasized, we have the opportunity to invest and strengthen this business. Doing this well will provide a foundation for future growth with our existing customers. Overall, I believe that each of these points is fixable and we're already on the case. I've made five senior hires to augment our leadership team focused on each of these challenges. Mary will focus on our people as our CHRO. Kristin, will focus on simplifying our operating model as VP of Corporate Operations. Vinod will focus on global delivery innovation specifically pure amity, scaling technology and Six Sigma to deliver enhanced service to our customers as EVP of Global Delivery Transformation. Steven David will focus on running our accounts to make sure we are listening to the voice of the customer when we are providing services in two of our largest regions of the Americas, and U.K., EMEA.","Again, we believe there is an exciting path forward to run these businesses - business more effectively, while also unlocking value. On the left side, running the business involves a stronger focus on customers, people, and operational execution. On customers, we will invest to stabilize key accounts and ensure that our delivery is meeting our clients' expectations. Doing this we'll ensure that we earn the right to walk the halls and help them with additional work as they think through their strategies.","On people, we will make investments to acknowledge recognize and reward our people, which will strengthen our employee value proposition. As I discussed, we have started adding outstanding talent to our DXC leadership team and we will continue to add in the areas of account management, sales, and delivery. On operational execution, we will invest to enhance delivery. We will simplify the way we work together to drive increased accountability and going forward, we will also re-emphasize our ITO business which is critical to our success.","On the right side of the slide, unlocking value includes a clear outlook, execution of a new strategy as well as evaluating strategic goals. We will execute a focused strategy around what I call the enterprise technology stack, we will sell industry solutions and focus on our existing customers. We will also be pursuing strategic alternatives for three businesses that do not fit in our focused strategy. These businesses comprised roughly of 25% of our current revenue. Additionally, we will continue to pursue a balanced capital allocation approach while maintaining our investment-grade credit profile.","Paul will now cover our second quarter results, and update around our second-half outlook.","Paul Saleh","Well, thank you, Mike, and greetings everyone. As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. In the second quarter, we had restructuring cost of $32 million pre-tax or $0.11 per diluted share, primarily related to workforce optimization. Also in the quarter, we had $53 million pre-tax or $0.18 per diluted share of integration and transaction-related costs.","In the second quarter, amortization of acquired intangible was $151 million pre-tax or $0.45 per diluted share. Also in the quarter, we recorded a goodwill impairment, which was triggered by the decline in our market capitalization. As part of the reconciliation of the balance sheet carrying value of our reported units to market values, we recorded a $2.9 billion non-cash impairment charge or $11.10 per diluted share. During the second quarter, we received $666 million from HPE for the arbitration award related to the capital lease dispute. We excluded $632 million or $2.43 per diluted share from our results and this represents the damaged portions of the award. In the quarter, we had a $29 million tax adjustment related to a reconciliation of prior restructuring charges specific to a period back in the fiscal '13, or $0.11 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, our non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $492 million and our non-GAAP EPS was a $1.38. Now this includes $0.10 of benefit from the interest portion of the HPE arbitration award and a $0.04 of expense related to payments made to Mike Lawrie in connection with his retirement.","Now, let me turn to our second quarter results in more detail. Revenue in the second quarter was $4.85 billion on a GAAP basis. All revenue comparisons I'll discuss will be in constant currency. In the second quarter, revenue was down 0.8% year-over-year, driven by the impact of the continued acceleration of cloud migrations. Digital revenue in the second quarter was $1.51 billion, up 52% year-over-year including Luxoft, and up 30% excluding Luxoft. Traditional revenue was $2.4 billion, down 18.5% which was a few points off from what we had anticipated. Industry IP and BPS revenue was $908 million, up 0.3%. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $529 million and our adjusted EBIT margin was 10.9%. In the quarter, continued delays in our delivery cost actions, as well as cost overruns on a few European transformation contracts, contributed to lower than expected profit performance.","In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 26.4%, reflecting our global mix of income and the benefit of ongoing tax planning initiatives. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.8 times, as we've seen further delays on several large deals. Digital book-to-bill was 1.2 times, traditional book-to-bill was 0.6 times and Industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 0.7 times.","Now, let's turn to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.29 billion, up 10.5% year-over-year. Excluding Luxoft, GBS revenue was up 0.4% year-over-year. GBS segment profit was $359 million and profit margin for that segment was 15.7%. Now our GBS margin reflects the investment we're making in hiring and training digital talent, as well as the slower pace of cost takeout in complex countries. GBS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9 times, primarily driven by lower than expected bookings in industry IP and BPS. Our GIS revenue was $2.57 billion, down 9.1% year-over-year. GIS segment profit was $243 million and profit margins were 9.5%. GIS margin reflects the impact of stranded costs related to the decline in our traditional ITO business, as well as a slowdown in our delivery cost takeout actions as we work with select customers to improve service. GIS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.7 times, reflected delayed deals and lower than expected conversion of pipeline opportunities.","Now, let me turn to other financial results in the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $739 million or about 204% of adjusted net income. Now, this reflects improved working capital management and expanded use of our receivable facility by $235 million in the quarter. Now, this facility is a true sale non-recourse facility. Our capex was $342 million in the quarter or 7.1% of revenue. During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of shares and paid $56 million in dividends. In total, we returned $306 million in capital to our shareholders.","We have limited opportunities to repurchase more shares during the quarter because of the CEO transition and ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives for several of our businesses. We now expect to be more opportunistic in returning capital to our shareholders, but we will maintain a very close look at our investment credit profile. Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion and at the end of the quarter, our total debt was $9.2 billion, and including capitalized leases, so our net debt to total capital ratio was 34.9%.","Now, let me turn and provide more details on our new financial targets for the fiscal year. We're now targeting revenue in the range of $19.5 billion to $19.8 billion. This revised revenue guidance is driven by three primary factors. First, we've had seen additional delays in several large deals that we expected to close during the second quarter and that was particularly in the Americas and the U.K. We also lost a few deals during the quarter that were previously included in our second half revenue plans. And as a result, now, we expect about $275 million less revenue this year. Second, due to execution at existing customers, we now expect $250 million less revenue this year. $75 million of that amount is due to certain customers placing revenue opportunities on hold. This was due to recent delivery execution issues. Now we have recovery plans underway to improve service levels on these accounts. We also adjusted our revenue outlook by $175 million to reflect potential disruptions given the announcement that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for three of our businesses. Now third, we now expect a $100 million less revenue in our traditional infrastructure and application businesses. We're investing in our ITO business to mitigate these declines and capitalize on the pipeline of opportunities with an aggressive focus on modernization of customer environments. Now the revised revenue outlook of $19.5 billion to $19.8 billion for the year, assume a slight increase in the second half revenue compared with the first half.","Turning to EPS; we are now targeting adjusted EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.75 per share. Let me cover some of the key drivers of this revised outlook. First, the reduced revenue forecast will translate to roughly $275 million less EBIT for this year or $0.73 per share including the impact of potential disruptions related to the strategic alternatives announcements. Second, we now expect $170 million less benefit from cost takeout actions this year or $0.47 per share.","Now as we move into this more complex phase of operational improvements, including the broader deployment of Bionix, we've seen a need for greater customer engagement as well as a more experienced talent which is impacting the pace of our cost takeout. We've also experienced delays in several global initiatives such as delivery center consolidation, maintenance optimization and enterprise license rationalization, and those translate into an additional $0.10 per share in EPS. We continue to believe that these cost actions are achievable, but it is taking longer to execute than we had originally planned. Third, we expect $70 million or $0.20 of EPS from higher than expected cost overruns on a few large complex customer transformation programs. This is concentrated to a few European contracts, and we expect to resolve this issue - these issues within this fiscal year. Fourth, our revised EPS outlook includes a $100 million or $0.28 per share of additional second half investments to strengthen our operations in core infrastructure services and to augment talent in key areas such as account management and industry sales. This investment also includes our recovery plans on key accounts.","The revised EPS target of $5.25 to $5.75 per share assumes a range of $2.13 to $2.63 versus $3.12 in the first half of the year. And our EBIT margin between 9.5% and 10.5% for the second half of the year versus the 12.1% in the first half. Our cash flow target for the full year is now 80% or more of adjusted net income, and this reflects more conservative working capital assumptions for the second half as well as the timing of a contract settlement payment that we expect to make this year, but we will recover that amount in fiscal 21 from insurance coverage.","Now, I'll turn back the call to Mike to discuss our strategic priorities and planned actions.","Mike Salvino","Thanks, Paul. We are clearly not pleased with this revised guidance and the poor execution against our cost plans. We are taking steps to improve our performance with a focus on customers, People, and operational execution. We also believe that we will be able to unlock value due to a focused strategy.","Going forward, DXC will run as one company focused on the enterprise technology stack versus the traditional business and a digital business. Customers will see one DXC, not two. So the left of this slide is what I refer to is the enterprise technology stack. The enterprise technology stack mimics the strategic thinking of how our customers view their technology journey and it starts with ITO. This is the foundation and DXC has an installed base that is second to none. The next level includes cloud with security services, which reflects the fact that customers are buying those services bundled.","Moving up the stack, the application layer is critical where we rationalize and modernize and manage customer workloads. Then we can leverage analytics capabilities to harvest data and ultimately provide engineering services to generate business insights for our customers. We cannot deliver the technology stack on its own. We have to also provide deep industry expertise and we will do this by providing integrated industry solutions to our customers.","Let me share with you some of the feedback I've heard from our customers, which is on the right side of this slide. DXC runs mission-critical systems and operations for our customers. They expect these to be run silently and effectively. Many of our customers need to upgrade these systems and they want to partner with someone they can trust. This trust requires a deep understanding of their environments with demonstrated experience executing at scale. Also, our customers recognize that not all the workloads are going to migrate to the cloud. They need a provider who can support on-premise assets as well as private and public cloud environments.","Security is also a top concern and customers expect us to bring deep expertise to them in this area. Our customers are looking to scale their digital capabilities that include analytics that produces business insights and they want to grow with the service provider who has scale. Overall the key message is that DXC is missing opportunities with our customers. We need to show visible reinvestment to strengthen customer confidence, capture these opportunities moving forward and position DXC for growth. With that in mind, we've conducted a review of our portfolio to understand how well DXC's current businesses aligned against the enterprise technology stack and our focused strategy.","First, I was very pleased to see that DXC has capabilities at scale against each layer of the enterprise technology stack. We have 5.4 billion in ITO revenue, $2.1 billion in cloud and security, $5.4 billion in applications and Industry IP, and $1.4 billion in data analytics and engineering services, including the Luxoft business and roughly $500 million of Advisory revenue.","Now, I'd like to discuss the outcome of the review of DXC's current businesses. We have evaluated each of our businesses against the following criteria, one importance to the enterprise technology stack; two, the ability to create Industry solutions; three, what our customers wanted; and four, the potential to unlock value. Out of that analysis, we decided to pursue strategic alternatives for three businesses, the U.S. State and local Health and human services business or horizontal BPS business and our workplace and mobility business. Combined, these businesses represent about 25% of DXC's total revenue. These businesses are strong. Our workplace and our U.S. state and local health and human services businesses are market leaders, and we have meaningful IP in our horizontal BPS business.","When I say strategic alternatives that could involve a range of actions to unlock value including potential divestitures to strategic or financial buyers, a spin-off or other transactions. Throughout this process, we will remain closely engaged with our customers and our people, ensuring we are meeting our commitments to both.","Paul will now provide some color on our longer-term financial expectations based on these plans.","Paul Saleh","By executing on those strategic alternatives Mike just discussed will create a more focused portfolio, strengthen DXC's ability to grow and unlock value. Now excluding those three businesses by fiscal '22, we would expect the Company to have more than $15 billion of revenue, with at least half of the revenue coming from digital offerings. We also expect margins to be at 12% or more even after accounting for investments. This margin level is consistent with global industry peers. We're also taking a conservative view on cash flow conversion while continuing to perform above industry benchmarks. We also assume that we will be able to generate net capital proceeds of roughly $5 billion from these three businesses. We expect to deploy $4.25 billion or more to repurchase shares and pay dividends over the next 10 quarters.","Now, this represents about 50% of our current market cap. We also expect to reduce our debt by more than $2.5 billion as we will continue to pursue a balanced capital allocation approach and protect our investment-grade credit profile with the target debt to EBITDA of 2 times or less. In fiscal '22, we expect that at least $7 per share of adjusted EPS and at least $5.25 of EPS after restructuring, transaction and integration costs. This outlook reflects our plan to moderate these costs over the next couple of years.","I'll now turn the call back to Mike.","Mike Salvino","Thanks, Paul. So in conclusion, here is why I'm excited to lead DXC at this particular point in time. As someone who has lived in the IT services industry for over 30 years, and has seen all the different ways service firms can compete, it's very clear to me that DXC has a unique opportunity due to three factors. One, DXC has significant scope and scale along with mission-critical positions at large customers. Two, DXC's in recent history have reduced its cost structure in an industry where being cost-efficient boosts your ability to compete. Three, customers are facing transformation challenges across the enterprise technology stack, and they are in need of DXC's deep ITO capabilities and experience.","Customers need a partner like DXC to help them modernize their IT - ITO layer, optimize their data architectures, and make it all secure and orchestrated across the public, private and hybrid clouds. This will now be our main thrust in DXC's focused strategy to leverage our IPO expertise to help customers across the enterprise technology stack. We're equipped with a much-improved cost structure and we're going to raise the bar by investing in our people and in our customer service, plus we're going to move away from that are not core to transforming the enterprise technology stack, and focus on the that are inter-goal to, our focused strategy and our customers' needs.","With that, operator, please open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Let's take our first question from Rod Bourgeois at DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Rod Bourgeois","Okay, guys. So I have a question for Mike about strategy and a quick follow-up for Paul. So, Mike, you're stressing in your comments that your strategy will reemphasize your infrastructure outsourcing business. So my question is, why today is that a sound strategy to focus on ITO in light of the erosion that's occurring in that business?","Mike Salvino","Rod, good to hear from you. And look, the bottom line is, - the way I see it is, we've got a unique position of strength in the ITO layer, all right? We also have un-emphasized the ITO. By emphasizing again what I clearly heard from customers and through my industry expertise and experience is that when you deliver for your customers, simply put you get more business. You get the ability to move up the stack, not just stay in the ITO layer. So what this strategy is all about is an and strategy. It's both digital along with ITO and applications. The other thing is because of this underperformance what you heard Paul say is that we've had work put on hold. We've had growth put on hold. And the market is not going away, right, meaning, I understand that - looking it's decreasing but we also said and validated that not all the workloads are going to go to the cloud. 70% of today's workloads will continue to be on-prem or in the private clouds in 2023.","So, look Rod - I put all that together and basically said look, our focused strategy needs to be around the enterprise technology stack. Anything that is going to lend itself to not allow us to focus on that, we should put in the strategic alternative bucket. But the bottom line is the and strategy will help us grow.","Rod Bourgeois","All right. And then just Mike, in the revenue breakdown numbers, it sort of implies that the revenue challenges in - particular in the GIS business is very heavily attributable to execution. You clearly also had some secular headwinds. What's your take on how much of the problem in the GIS business is secular versus execution?","Mike Salvino","So, I think - look, our focus with the re-emphasis Rod will be on moderation of, you know that negative revenue decline. I think the majority of that is execution from what I've seen. Certainly, there is some market movements away, that's what we were studying. But I think the majority of that is execution because the market is declining roughly around 5% to maybe 10%, and were a much higher than that.","Rod Bourgeois","Okay, all right. And then Paul, I appreciate the fiscal '22 P&L estimate. I'd like to get some more color on how you've modeled, particularly on the revenue side out to '22? So what's the trajectory look like in fiscal '21? And then for fiscal '22, are you viewing that level of revenue estimate as a conservative number at this stage or is that a revenue estimate that you're expected case scenario more color on how you've modeled out to get to that P&L would be helpful.","Paul Saleh","That's very - thank you for the question. As Mike mentioned, we're going to be making investments and re-emphasizing the traditional business. But also particularly the - an ITO business as well as the application business. And as a result of that in our outlook for fiscal '22, we are assuming a moderation in the decline in those businesses to maybe high-single-digit. And for the rest of the businesses across the stack to continue to grow at or above market rates, which we have already been showing through our results.","So that's basically what the assumptions are on the near-term. And we are confident that the outlook that we are putting here is, you're going to be able to achieve. In fact, our internal plan actually would be to try to do better than that, that's why you have the pluses that are showing up across that page. And as far as you're - the trajectory right now, as Mike mentioned, we aren't just really going to be looking at strategic alternatives for 25% of the revenue of the Company, the three businesses. And there is we have a whole lot of work ahead of us right now and we'll learn more over the coming months.","So, one thing we can say to you is that we know where we're headed in the near-term, we know where we're going by fiscal '22. So in due time, we will provide you with some of the, - a greater visibility into how fiscal '21 will be shaping up.","Rod Bourgeois","All right. Thank you, guys.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now take our next question from Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller","All right. Thanks, guys. We heard on the call just now about investments being made which is great to hear, obviously, Mike after your review. But we're also still hearing you guys talk about cost cuts that I guess came from the prior plans, and how some of that was coming at a different pace. I guess, I'm just curious why you are even bothering on a net basis. Shouldn't we just be talking about investments now in the business given that you really do you have a target of a margin profile that it is now in the low double digits, and potentially could even be lower? I think investors would probably be okay with that if it meant a revenue payback that would lead to some inflection.","So could you just talk about where we are on a net basis? Are you investing now a lot more than you're cutting and costs? And is that the right margin profile that low double-digit 12% range. And then I just have one follow.","Mike Salvino","Okay. So let me, take it from there and Paul can also way in. But look, we are definitely going to invest more for the rest of 2020 then the cost takeout. The problem is there still opportunities rate for us to get costs. So I want to make sure that we are gearing up to go after those. When I look at pyramid optimization, the Bionix tool right that we have is a strong tool, but it needs to be scaled across the regions. And then when I look at operational excellence. I want to make sure we've got an organization that is refining the cost structure, all right, mot as cutting as much as we have, all right.","The second thing is, on the investments, the investments are very targeted towards our customers, towards our people and also the operational execution. So when I say that operational execution piece that's where I'm coming back to building teams and augmenting the capabilities that are to continue to come after that. I mean, I said in my comments that part of the things, and I'm excited about is, you got to continue to look at that cost structure to compete in this space. And I think with our new focused strategy, all right around the enterprise technology stack, I think we're focused on the right areas with the right cost structure with the right customers. And we should be able to grow. But I would definitely leave you it's a lot more investment than it is cost.","Darrin Peller","Okay.","Mike Salvino","The other thing I would say on the numbers is when you listen to Paul, those numbers are relatively flat across the board on revenue and on EPS.","Darrin Peller","Right, okay. Let me just touch that [indiscernible].","Paul Saleh","Yes. No. Darrin answer for your question, I think you said about the - were you asking about the margins for fiscal '22 or just near term?","Darrin Peller","More - really more longer-term in terms of whether that 12% is the right number in your minds versus what we - versus potentially even lower.","Paul Saleh","Yes. We put a 12% plus on the page for a reason because not only, as Mike mentioned, we have opportunity to continue to extract greater efficiencies from the business over the next few years and particularly with building the team to help execute on that. And then why we felt also the 12% does it. You don't see it, but some of the businesses that we're looking at for strategic alternatives, the one that we have mentioned there dilutive to our margins because particularly two of them fully loaded margins that are above the corporate average. So that's one thing. And then you will see that in the long term also, our EPS also is going up.","Darrin Peller","All right. That actually is really - that's really helpful. Thanks. Just - but the one quick follow-up is around those strategic alternatives. Just help us understand maybe a parameter around timing and then the growth profile of those assets that the $5 billion in total perhaps? And then just thinking about the assumptions, you're talking about $15 billion of revenue by '22. And I guess as a follow on to the prior questions, is that assuming - it sounds like that's assuming you can maintain flat revenues of everything that you divest, everything that you don't divest. Is that fair?","Paul Saleh","Yes. No. I think the first one is about those businesses; we don't provide a lot of - not going to provide details about each one of those businesses. Timing, I would say within the next 12 months, that's how what we're getting is a lot of effort, to hedge for our teams. And so we're going to get going as soon as tomorrow and we are lined up to go get that thing done. And firstly from revenue growth, I think as well mentioned to Rod a minutes ago, that is we've assumed that overall, we'll be able to grow. And we have also assumed the additional - some acquisition over that timeframe, maybe about consistent with what we've done before 1% to 2% growth coming from acquisitions. So that's part of the capital allocation over that timeframe.","Darrin Peller","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We will now take the next question from Lisa Ellis at MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks, guys. Another follow-up on the strategic alternatives, good to see you kind of moving down this pathway. With the $5 billion you're expecting in proceeds, could you just talk a little bit about how you weigh the decision of using the proceeds for share repurchases and debt reduction, and kind of maintain the financial health of DXC versus say another Luxoft or making another larger acquisition or investing more aggressively in returning to growth? How did you kind of weigh those two? Thank you.","Paul Saleh","We weighed all of these factors, and then Mike and I have been quite a bit of time.","Mike Salvino","Yes. So - and that's why we said, right, a balanced approach, right? I mean, Paul is looking at debt. He is - we're both looking at returning value to shareholders. But I'm looking at that stack, Lisa, and saying there is opportunities, and hopefully, you guys saw some of the flavors of it in terms of Bluleader, and Virtual Clarity. I love the Virtual Clarity. Virtual Clarity asset is specifically focused looking at the IPO layer, putting together strategies and starting to move clients in a very structured program management way up the stack. So when we start looking at the proceeds, obviously, it will be balanced, all right, but we will continue to do what I call tactical tuck-ins, all while we're maintaining, right, our investment grade.","Lisa Ellis","Okay. And then, maybe my follow-up; just with you Mike. As you look out over the next say 90-day - three months to six months, what are the areas that you personally are focused on? You mentioned you've been out working with a lot of clients, with a lot of partners like sort of, how are you - what are your personal top three or four priorities? Thanks.","Mike Salvino","The mine is around customers, people and operational execution. I mean I've said it so many times to our people over the last 40 days. So when I think customers, right, we have an opportunity, right to delight customers. And we need to listen to them even a little bit more about what do they want because some of these contracts we need to adjust, just from a standpoint these contracts have been around five, 10, 15 years. So I want to make sure we're listening to the voice of the customers. So you'll see me do quite a bit around account management.","The second is the people; write-off [ph] and say, you lose the people, you lose the business, all right. And from that standpoint, that employee value proposition in my first [indiscernible]; that's key, right, in terms of our people. And then the operational execution is what I mentioned before. I'm an operator, all right, by heart. So I'm looking at the pyramids. I'm looking at the technology that we use, right, because anytime you put in technology, you take out the manual hand-offs, you avoid a break. And that's what I'd like to make sure we get done. And then the last one is around just some of the inefficiencies around operational execution. So simply put, customers, people, and operational execution, Lisa.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific, thank you. And thanks for you've clearly been moving pretty decisively here over the last couple of months. I appreciate that. Thanks a lot, guys.","Mike Salvino","Thank you, Lisa.","Operator","I'll take our next question from Bryan [ph] at Cowen. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys, good afternoon. Wanted to ask on the bookings, the - some of the color on the deal delays. Can you give us a sense of what kind of client thesis were? And then has it predominantly been all execution issues or are there some client-side factors going on? I'm really curious for what is still left in the pipeline, how soon do you think the proposed recovery plans can take shape?","Mike Salvino","So on the deals, right, I highlighted for you guys that in some of our largest accounts, right, we've been put on hold and that matters. And so I believe we can get those back. There's nothing better than when you actually fix a client to be in better than they were before to potentially get more business.","Go ahead, Paul.","Paul Saleh","Yes. And then I'll add. Remember we talked about $1 billion worth of deal that had slipped from first quarter to the second quarter, of those for example, 30%. we were able to book. They came in through the quarter and 30%. We lost and we didn't lose because we didn't have a strong offering, those were competitive takeouts from somebody else and we saw a different response from those people at the price that we would not willing to match. And then deals are moving to the right more because some of the customers are not ready to make decisions. So we've seen deals 30% move to maybe more than the fourth quarter, and some in the second half than we had originally anticipated being in the - for this year are slipping into fiscal '21, - early part of fiscal '21 right now.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So it sounds like a pretty - a wide mix here. As far as the traditional business, the cannibalization strategy that's been in action. Can you give us a sense on how that trade-off is occurring? Any early success cases that you're seeing here? Is it still too early to determine?","Paul Saleh","I think you're seeing some of that showing up even in the digital revenue going up about 30%, and we are seeing positive momentum. If I look at our entire pipeline across the board is up 20 plus percent qualified pipeline. So I think it's - we're seeing early signs of it, but it just masks also by some of the other things that we have highlighted meaning that some of the delivery execution issues that we encountered and the impact it has had near term on the business.","Mike Salvino","Yes. So, Bryan, the thing that's been interesting is, the debate, right that the market has this thing is, all of a sudden, there's ITO business is going to go away. I mean - I should I keep looking and saying here the specific facts I got 70% of today's workload will be content will be still around on-prem by 2023. And when I talk to our customers, they're looking at those apps, they are looking at the data. Not everything is going to move to the cloud, all right. And that's still good IT modernization business that we need to go get, right, and is ours for the taking.","The second thing is when I look at the decline, I've seen numbers anywhere between 3% per year for the next three years. I've seen the market be down 5% to 10%. And my point is, with our emphasis on ITO, we should be able to get our fair share. And when you look at what we've done in digital, that's why I said, it's the end strategy. If that digital business continues to grow aligned with the market and we're able to moderate, all right, what we've done in ITO, this business is going to grow.","Now, I plan on looking at it for the rest of 2020 to make sure we've got everything in place to get that done and it will take just a little bit of time, but that's where my head that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","I'll take the next question from Joseph Foresi at Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Joseph Foresi","I just was wondering kind of 2% or 3% questions here. First, Mike, on the. The shortfall in the quarter and the lumpiness in the business was it, one particular client? Why all of the execution? I know there has been some kind of bumps in the road, leading up to this quarter. But I'm wondering why it all happened sort of this quarter and what the feedback is? Was it a number of different accounts, are they going to competitors, I'm just kind of curious around the timing associated with that?","Mike Salvino","Okay. So first of all look, I mean, when you look at the beginning, I mentioned our cost profile. right, we were very focused on cost-to-date in 2020 in terms of the accounts when you push on that. I don't see the accounts has been widespread but we're definitely focused on investing in roughly 20 - 30 accounts, all right. And I take a different lens on what good looks like. I want these clients, all right, to be very delighted about our service. That's how you get more work so. I sit there and go, look, you know, I want to take a different focus on these things and make sure that assuming we do the ITO layer, we can move up the enterprise stag.","What was your next question?","Joseph Foresi","Yes. I'm just curious, was it like a couple of - a batch of accounts that went to competitors or was it mixed execution?","Mike Salvino","No.","Joseph Foresi","I'm just trying to get a sense of like what cost has caused by the delays and how we should think about it?","Mike Salvino","This is not accounts, go into competitors, okay. This is us looking at our clients, all right, dealing with their movement from the IPO layer to the cloud. All right. And in terms of us, what I call refocusing an IPO or not focusing, de-emphasizing an ITO, right, it's created some service level issues. All right. When that happens, the clients obviously aren't happy, okay. And they put us on hold in terms of additional work. And like I said in my customer comments, customers want to grow with people they've trust - and they have trusted us for years. So the fact that we've de-emphasized this business a bit, all right, we've got to get back in there and basically sure up that relationship, again, and then that will help us grow. So that's the logic there.","Joseph Foresi","Got it, okay. And then secondly just on the outlook that you provided, do you feel like you've taken derisk the numbers to some degree and you feel like you've got a good handle and are able to guide appropriately? And what would give us sort of some level of confidence that, that's taking place at this point? Because sometimes, I mean we bought that are on the business a long time, sometimes [indiscernible] bleed out, right?","Mike Salvino","Yes, I get it. I mean, look, we undertook a very detailed process and along with that, right, I put my experience on top of it. And I've got confidence around, right. Our strategy in our numbers. The saying that Paul highlighted for you that I would highlight again is the plus signs on the numbers in FY '22 in terms of our detailed model. Along with, I think we've taken a conservative approach in 2020, as it relates to revenue and margin.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. My very last one and you'll be able to answer is better than anybody. You worked at Accenture, you've seen their execution, you've seen what they've done. Do you feel like DXC can compete against them? And if so, what closes that gap that you saw over there that you're missing here? Thanks.","Mike Salvino","So look, I'm thrilled to be a part of DXC, all right. And when I look at the enterprise, technology stack strategy. I'm looking forward to competing in this space. Right. We've got scope and scale that gives me confidence right that we can win. and along with that, you know when I think about right, our team and where we're going, it's the right thing. So, I look at my playbook in terms of what I brought to the table. And I went back to customers, people and operational execution, all right. And from that standpoint, that's not an Accenture playbook, right. That's a playbook that I've developed along with the team I'm starting to bring in over a number of years. And I think if you get close to the customers, all right, if you win the hearts and minds of people and you operate, businesses will totally grow. So I appreciate the question but thrilled to be a part of DXC and what strategy we just laid out.","Jonathan Ford","Thank you. And operator, at this point, we will go ahead and close the call.","Operator","Perfect, thank you. This now concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect."],"8118":["DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC) Q4 2019 Results Conference Call May 23, 2019  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Jonathan Ford - Head, IR","Mike Lawrie - Chairman, President and CEO","Paul Saleh - CFO","Conference Call Participants","James Friedman - Susquehanna","Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson","Bryan Bergin - Cowen and Company","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research","Rod Bourgeois - DeepDive Equity Research","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the DXC Technology Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Ford, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jonathan Ford","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone.","I'm pleased you're joining us for DXC Technology's fourth quarter and year-end fiscal 2019 earnings call. Our speakers on today's call will be Mike Lawrie, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer. The call is being webcast at dxc.com\/investorrelations and webcast includes slides to accompany the discussion today.","Slide two informs our participants that DXC Technology's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release.","On slide three, you'll see that certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. I would like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call, except as required by law.","I\u2019d now like to introduce DXC Technology's Chairman, President and CEO, Mike Lawrie.","Mike Lawrie","Okay. Jonathan, thanks very much. Welcome, everyone. Thanks for taking time today.","As is my habit here, I've got four, five points, I'll go through those, go into a little more detail and then turn it over to Paul. And then we'll have plenty of time for Q&A.","First, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.19. For fiscal 2019, non-GAAP EPS was $8.34. Adjusted EBIT was $827 million in the quarter and the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%. For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion and the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%. We generated $917 million of adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter; and for fiscal 2019, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion.","Revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.28 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 1% year-over-year, and was up 1.7%, sequentially. And for fiscal 2019, revenue was $20.75 billion, and we had a book-to-bill of 1.1x in the quarter and 1x for the year.","In constant currency, digital revenue grew 22% year-over-year, and 11.6% sequentially in the quarter. For fiscal 2019, digital revenue grew 15.8%. In the fourth quarter, industry IP and BPS revenue was down 1.4% year-over-year and was roughly flat sequentially. And for fiscal 2019, industry IP and BPS revenue was down 0.3%. And in the fourth quarter, our digital book-to-bill was 1.8x and our industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 0.9x.","On my fourth point, we continue to make strategic investments in digital assets and capabilities, including the accelerated hiring efforts I talked about before. We also expect to complete the acquisition of Luxoft by the end of June.","Now, I'll go into each of these points in a little more detail, and then I'll cover our targets for fiscal 2020 and turn it over to Paul.","As I said, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.19 and the effective tax rate was 24.3%. For fiscal 2019, non-GAAP EPS was $8.34 and the effective tax rate for the full year was 23.2%. Fourth quarter adjusted EBIT was $827 million and the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%, roughly flat year-over-year and down 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting the investments in digital talent that we\u2019ve previously discussed, as well as the upfront savings we\u2019re providing to clients to help accelerate their digital transformations.","For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion, and the adjusted EBIT margin was $15.8%, an improvement of 200 basis points. The margin improvement reflects ongoing execution against our key cost-saving levers, and the savings were in line with our fiscal \u201819 targets that we've discussed before. GBS segment profit margin was 20.4%, which was up 100 basis points year-over-year and 220 basis points sequentially. This reflects ongoing workforce optimization as well as the seasonality in the business. And for fiscal 2019, GBS margin was 18.9%, and this was up 240 basis points from the prior year.","In GIS, segment profit margin was 14.1%, this was down 50 basis points year-over-year and down 340 basis points sequentially, reflecting the investments I just discussed, and the milestone achievement payments that I highlighted last quarter. And for fiscal 2019, GIS margin was 15.8% and this was up 270 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $917 million or 155% of adjusted net income, reflecting improvements in working capital. And for fiscal 2019, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion or 90% of adjusted net income.","Now, turning to revenue. Revenue in the fourth quarter, as I said, was $5.28 billion on a GAAP bases. In constant currency, revenue was down 1% year-over-year and was up 1.7% sequentially. Bookings were up 18.9% year-over-year and 2.5% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.","Digital growth continues to offset more of the decline in our traditional business. And sequentially, digital revenue in the fourth quarter more than offset the decline in the traditional business. Now, this balance between digital growth and traditional decline will continue to be lumpy as we go through the next year. But, this is the revenue dynamic that we talked about before that will ultimately support long-term growth for the Company.","For fiscal 2019, revenue was $20.75 billion on a GAAP basis and book-to-bill was 1x. In the fourth quarter, GBS revenue was $2.2 billion, and this was down 3.1% year-over-year in constant currency and up 0.9% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects headwinds in the traditional applications business including the completion of several contracts in addition to the impact of accelerated cloud adoption. One of the drivers of increased cloud adoption is the ability to lift and shift existing workloads, which often eliminates the services associated with rationalizing and refactoring applications.","GBS bookings in the quarter were up 40% year-over-year and up 27% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.3x. And for fiscal 2019, GBS revenue was $8.68 billion, and a book-to-bill of 1.1x.","In the fourth quarter, GIS revenue was $3.09 billion, which was up 0.6% year-over-year in constant country and up 2.3% sequentially, driven by strong growth in our workplace and mobility business. Overall, GIS bookings of $2.97 billion were up 3.7% year-over-year, and represent a book-to-bill of 1x. And for fiscal 2019, GIS revenue was $12.07 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9x.","Now, turning to digital and our IP and BPS results. In constant currency, digital revenue was up 22% year-over-year, and it was up 11.6% sequentially. Digital bookings continue to be very strong with a 1.8x book-to-bill in the quarter, driven by continued strength in our cloud infrastructure and digital workplace bookings. And for fiscal 2019, digital revenue grew 15.8%. Digital growth in the quarter was driven by enterprise and cloud applications, cloud infrastructure, and as I said digital workplace. All three businesses grew more than 20% year-over-year. The strong demand we're seeing for these capabilities is also reflected in our digital bookings and pipeline, both of which are up more than 50% year-over-year.","We\u2019re partnering with many of our clients to help generate savings to fund large digital transformations. In many cases, we provide these savings through lower operating costs on traditional services, which initially reduces revenue and profit on the account. In return, we secure commitments from the client to expand DXC\u2019s wallet share and future digital spend, which allows us to grow revenue and profit over time.","A good example where we're leveraging our installed base to accelerate digital transformation is a contract we signed during the fourth quarter with a major global airline. Now, building on our long-standing relationship with the client, we signed seven-year transformation deal that provides upfront savings for the clients to reduce operating costs and in return, the client is committed to leverage those savings to fund digital transformation work with DXC. And this results in initial reduction in revenue and profit on the account but drives top-line and bottom-line growth over the full lifecycle of the contract.","Now, let me talk about the offering families within digital. In constant currency, cloud infrastructure grew 25% in the quarter and was up 8.9% sequential, driven by the accelerated cloud adoption I just talked about. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.5x including the large airline deal as well as deals with the Australian tax office and a large European financial services institution. And for fiscal 2019, cloud infrastructure grew 22% in constant currency.","Enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 20% year-over-year and 13.3% sequentially. Bookings in the quarter were strong with the book-to-bill of 1.4x. Wins in the quarter included a next generation SAP deal with a South American utility provider and a CRM transformation program, leveraging Salesforce.com for a large oil and gas company. And for fiscal 2019, enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 10.1% in constant currency.","Analytics revenue was down 4.9% year-over-year in constant currency and was up 3.2% sequentially. We're seeing good bookings momentum in this business, particularly in the automotive sector. DXC\u2019s robotic drive solution streamlined data analysis and algorithmic training to reduce the time and cost to develop autonomous vehicles. These solutions are very complementary to Luxoft\u2019s automotive offerings. And we believe the combined company has a compelling value proposition in the space. Bookings in the quarter were up 67% year-over-year from book-to-bill of 1.3x.","We\u2019ve continued to build on this momentum and recently signed a deal recently signed a deal with BMW Group, leveraging DXC's robotic drive solutions. We\u2019re supporting BMW's autonomous vehicle development program, gathering massive amounts of road travel data from the global BMW test fleet. Using DXC's digital solution, BMW\u2019s R&D teams will achieve significantly faster, autonomous drive development cycles.","Now not all areas of digital have done as well. Our security business was down 1.3% year-over-year in constant currency and down 1.5% sequentially as growth in Asia and Southern Europe partially offset the decline in the UK and Northern Europe. Book-to-bill in the quarter was strong at 1.2x. In constant currency, Industry IP is BPS revenue was down 1.4% year-over-year and was roughly flat sequentially. Industry IP and BPS was down point 3%, roughly flat for fiscal 2019.","We continue to ramp revenue on some of the large insurance BPS contracts that I talked about before. This is offsetting declines we're seeing in some of our more generic BPS business, particularly in the UK and Europe where a few clients in-sourced the work. Bookings in the fourth quarter were up 59% year-over-year, including a large deal with The California Department of Health Care Service. ","Now, turning quickly to point four. We continue to make significant investments in our digital talent, including accelerated hiring in our fastest growing capabilities, expansion of our digital transformation centers and capabilities, and the ongoing build out of our joint practices with partners such as AWS, and Microsoft Azure.","During the fourth quarter, we hired an additional 2,000 people in our digital capabilities with an emphasis on software engineers, dev ops engineers, SAP consultants, data scientists and security engineers. We're making these investments to continue scaling the digital go-to-market model I've previously discussed. For example, DXC has entered into an engineering relationship with DreamWorks Animation to develop a cloud-based pipeline for digital content creation. We're jointly shaping the solution with DreamWorks, leveraging our cloud, security and analytics solutions.","DXC will also expand our access to digital talent through the Luxoft acquisition. We'll leverage Luxoft\u2019s established presence in key markets such Eastern Europe to attract digital talent and will apply Luxoft\u2019s talent acquisition and management platform in support of DXC\u2019s broader digital capabilities. We expect to complete the Luxoft acquisition by the end of June. And as I discussed, this acquisition builds on DXC's unique value proposition as an end-to-end mainstream IT and digital services market leader and strengthens the Company's ability to design and deploy transformative digital solutions for clients at scale.","The addition of Luxoft will bring clients new capabilities in digital engineering, additional depth in key verticals and an expanded portfolio of digital offerings. And while we continue to operate Luxoft as a separate entity to protect its strong brand established recruiting engine, DXC will undertake several changes to quickly apply Luxoft\u2019s strengths and capabilities to our broader business and help drive growth.","First, we're combining the existing industry expertise from both companies to create market-leading verticals in automotive and financial services. These two verticals will serve more than 20 major automotive OEMs and more than half of the top financial institutions in the America and Europe. DXC and Luxoft go-to-market teams will also work together to innovate and cross-sell solutions in other industry sectors where the company has a significant base of global business including insurance and healthcare.","Now, to my fifth point before I turn it over to Paul for fiscal 2020. We expect revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, reflecting the impact of currency as well as the revenue dynamic between digital and traditional, I previously discussed. This target assumes that Luxoft closes, as I said, at the end of June. And we're targeting non-GAAP EPS of $7.75 to $8.50, and adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income.","Now, let me turn this over to Paul. Paul?","Paul Saleh","Thank you, Mike. And greetings, everyone.","As usual, I will start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.","In the current quarter, we had restructuring costs of $47 million on a pre-tax basis or $0.13 per diluted share after-tax. These costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expenses associated with facilities and data center rationalization.","Now, also in the quarter, we had $96 million on a pre-tax basis or $0.24 per diluted share after-tax. The transaction, separation and integration related costs associated with recent acquisition such as Molina, as well as activities related to the Luxoft acquisition. For the full year, restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs amounted to $866 million on a pre-tax basis, or $2.31 per diluted share after tax, driven by the cost of exiting more resources in complex countries, and the higher than expected costs of exiting the shared IT environment with HPE. In addition, we had additional transactions costs associated with our digital acquisitions.","In the fourth quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $138 million on a pre-tax basis, or $0.37 per diluted share after-tax. For the full-year, amortization of acquired intangibles was $539 million on a pre-tax basis, or $1.42 per diluted share after-tax. Also in the quarter, our annual re-measurement of pension assets and liabilities resulted in an accounting charge of $143 million.","As of year-end, we had pension assets of $11.3 billion and pension liabilities of $11 billion for an overfunded pension position of $327 million. Excluding the impact of these special items non-GAAP income from -- before taxes from continuing operations was $778 million for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS was $2.19.","For the full-year, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $3.06 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $8.34.","Now move on to our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail. GAAP revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.28 billion and $20.75 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $827 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%, relatively flat year-over-year and down 50 basis points sequentially. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter reflects additional investments we are making in our digital business, including additional digital transformation centers, acquiring new digital talents and enhancements to Platform DXC and Bionix.","For fiscal 2019 adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion; adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%, up 200 basis points compared with the prior year. The year-over-year margin improvement reflects continued progress on our cost takeout plans, in line with our targets for the year.","Throughout fiscal \u201819, we accelerated the redeployment of our Bionix automation program, which combined with our other workforce optimization levers, allowed us to reduce our labor base by roughly 10,000 people or 7% on a net basis, as we continue to shift the balance of our workforce to a digital capabilities.","In supply chain, we're consolidating our supplier base, managing demand, leveraging our scale to renegotiate and restructure agreements, and shifting more of our work to strategic vendors.","Turning to facilities. We eliminated an additional 4.6 million square feet this year, and we also rationalized nine data centers. Since the merger, we have reduced our facility\u2019s footprint by more than 30%.","So, in summary, we delivered over $500 million of in-year savings, which is roughly in line with our full-year target. And as we previously discussed, we reinvested roughly half of those savings throughout fiscal \u201819, and primarily those investment went into digital capabilities.","In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24.3% and for the full year, the non-GAAP tax rate was 23.2%, reflecting the net benefit of certain tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions.","In the fourth quarter, bookings were up $5.8 million for a book-to-bill of 1.1 time, and for the full year, bookings were $20.7 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.","Now, let's turn to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.19 billion in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, GBS segment profit was $447 million and profit margin was 20.4%. The improvement in profitability reflects ongoing workforce optimization and the seasonality of that business. For the full-year, GBS revenue was $8.7 billion, segment profit was $1.6 billion, margin was 18.9%, booking were $9.3 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.1.","GIS revenue was $3.09 billion in the fourth quarter. GIS segment profit in the fourth quarter was $436 million and the profit margin was 14.1%. Now, the profit margin reflects investments we're making in Platform DXC, Bionix as well as digital talent acceleration. GIS margin also reflects the timing of exiting resources in some of our complex markets.","Now, for the full-year, GIS revenue was $12.1 billion, segment profit was $1.9 billion, margin was 15.8% and bookings were $11.5 billion for a book-to-bill of 09 times.","Turning to other financial highlights. Adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $917 million, that\u2019s a 155% of adjusted net income, reflecting tighter working capital management. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion or 90% of adjusted net income, which is in line with our original target for the full year.","Now, our cash flow performance continues to exclude the impact of our receivables facility, even though these transactions represent an outright sale of receivables with no recourse to DXC. Our CapEx was $316 million in the quarter or 6% of revenue; and for the full year, CapEx was $1.15 billion or 5.5% of revenue.","Cash at the end of the fourth quarter and at the end of the year was $2.9 billion. Our total debt was $7.4 billion, including capitalized leases for a net debt to capitalization ratio of 23.6%.","During the quarter, we paid $51million in dividends and repurchased $91 million of shares for a total of $142 million in capital returned to shareholders. And for the fiscal year, we returned $1.55 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of $210 million in dividends and $1.34 billion in share repurchase.","Now, let me close by covering our fiscal \u201820 target, which assumes that the Luxoft transaction will close by the end of June. We're targeting revenue for the fiscal year to be in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, and that includes roughly $250 million of currency headwinds from a stronger dollar compared with fiscal \u201819. The revenue target reflects the impact of accelerated cloud adoptions in our traditional platform and application businesses. We're working with our clients to accelerate their digital transformation efforts by offering upfront savings on traditional services we provide. Near-term, these actions reduce revenue and profit on those accounts, but in return, we expect to gain a greater share of their IT spend in digital, which should translate into a higher revenue and profits over time.","Our fiscal \u201820 target for EPS is $7.75 to $8.50, reflecting the incremental investments we are making in our digital business, as well as the near-term impacts of our efforts to accelerate clients\u2019 digital transformations.","Now, the EPS target also assumes a higher tax rate for fiscal \u201820 of 26% to 28%, reflecting a changing mix of tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions, and delays in the implementation of our tax planning strategies. Now, that is pending further clarification of U.S. tax reform regulations. Now, these delays, however, do not impact our long-term targets for tax of 22% to 25%.","I also would like to mention that we are working diligently to complete the filing of our 10-K by May 30th. However, because of certain audit procedures regarding updates to the U.S. tax reform regulations, we may file the 10-K in early June, within the extension period allowed by the SEC.","And lastly, our adjusted free cash flow target for fiscal \u201820 is 90% of adjusted net income.","Now, I'll turn the call back to the operator for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from James Friedman from Susquehanna.","James Friedman","Hi. Thank you. It\u2019s Jamie at Susquehanna, and good results here. Paul, I just wanted to ask about the EPS guidance. I see that you are adjusting your tax assumptions fairly considerably from where we were. But, how should we be thinking about the margin cadence from here? Yes. So, what should we be thinking about margin going forward?","Paul Saleh","First of all, the 26% to 28% is higher than we had anticipated coming into fiscal \u201820, as I mentioned, just because of the uncertainty relating to some of these regulations or clarification. And as a result, once they are clarified, we'll be able to implement our tax strategies. Until then, we're taking a little bit more risk and not optimizing our taxes.","In terms of the margin progression, I think, we'll see a dip in the first quarter. This is usually -- if I look at it compared to the prior year, but we'll see also the impact of some of the acceleration of the cloud transformation, digital transformation that we're doing with our clients and the savings that we\u2019re giving them upfront, we'll see that impact on the revenue upfront that will also impact our margins, particularly on the GIS side. But we should see at least a point improvement every quarter from the first quarter on out until the end of the year. And again, this is assuming Luxoft comes to us in the second -- starting in the second quarter, and there's not going to be much of a contribution from the -- just a 10% or so contribution for the margin on the Luxoft business.","James Friedman","And with regard to Luxoft, I realize you're saying end of June, but what is contemplated in terms of the revenue contribution for the year?","Paul Saleh","I think about $700 million right now, and I would just really expect it to be relatively equal per quarter, somewhere around the $225 million to $230 million.","James Friedman","Okay. And then, last one. Mike, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the increase in digital hiring. Where are you in that journey? I know it seems like you made some great hires. But, yes, how are you doing on the staffing side, so you can fulfill that side of the demand?","Mike Lawrie","I think the hiring issue is behind us. So, I think we've demonstrated here we can hire. We've made a pretty significant commitment to these DTCs. We're planning to hire probably 1,500 people or so per quarter. I don't expect any problems with that. As we go forward, some of the skills may remix a little bit. In other words, we may need some additional analytic skills and less in some other areas, so we'll continue to combine that. We're also really comfortable with this whole process we've put in place where customers come to these centers. We ideate with them, they get assigned to statements of work or proof-of-concepts. So, I really feel very good about what we've been able to get done here on the digital skills. So we're not having problems finding people, recruiting people, or on-boarding them and they\u2019re beginning to really contribute positively to the business as we go forward. We saw some of that in the growth that we reported. We're also continuing to reskill hundreds of current DXC employees. So, we're able to -- as we continue to move people off of the offerings where we have revenue run-off, we're increasingly retraining and reskilling, so we can deploy them on other opportunities.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Lisa Ellis, MoffettNathanson.","Lisa Ellis","Can you talk a little bit about -- I know you just both spoke about how you're now proactively making some of these investments with your clients, offering them some savings on the base work you're doing up front in order to gain and win their digital spending. Clearly, with some success with the growth rates you're now seeing in digital, could you just give an illustration of what this sort of profile looks like with one of your large clients, like meaning how much is revenue down initially? How long does that last? At what point does it flatten out? Does it eventually go positive, just to get a little bit more color? Thanks. ","Mike Lawrie","Sure. Let me provide a little color for you. I won't use any specific names here, but an example would be a proposal I was working on this week, as a matter of fact, where we would extend somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 million in operational savings in year, so this will be in year, $30 million of operational savings. And in return, we would be the service provider that would move applications to the cloud, we would provide some additional analytics, we would provide some additional cybersecurity and some additional, what I\u2019d call, operational optimization. That would be worth somewhere in the neighborhood after we get through the first 6 months to 12 months, probably $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue.","So, what we're doing, we're getting more and more comfortable with this model, is to provide those operational savings and then the customer commits to specific projects and workload. Now, some of the revenue from those new projects are admittedly delayed a little bit, could be 90 days, could be 120 days, could be a little longer than that, butwe're comfortable now that we're starting to get this model, get this into more of a standard process, and we're really encouraged by the receptivity on the part of our clients to this approach. So, they can basically fund these digital programs through the operational savings that we give. And all we've got to be willing to do is to live with a little deferred recognition of some of the revenue and profitability. When we can grow these, then our view is we can take a lot of this traditional business and use that as an asset to fund future growth in the account and reposition DXC as not only a great operator of infrastructure but also a trusted digital partner.","Lisa Ellis","And is that also -- is that allowing you to sole source the digital work then too, because you're doing this more proactively?","Mike Lawrie","Yes. So, what we're doing is, we're getting commitments on revenue spend around digital, commitments, okay? Now, that could be different projects which doesn't say, okay you are going to provide the cloud migration or you\u2019re not going to do this. But what it does do is it says we will commit to spend x amount of money with you in other digital projects.","Lisa Ellis","Got it. Okay. And then just one last one\u2026","Mike Lawrie","And Lisa, one other thing. A lot of this is done with our partners as well. So, increasingly, we are going to these clients and say we will do this together with our partners, which gives us a lot more credibility, but it helps us from a skill standpoint to really get access to a broader set of skills. So I tell you, we've been talking about this thing, I've been talking about this thing for a year and a half on saying here is we're starting to see some real traction and beginning to scale this. And that's what I think this next year is going to be all about scaling this.","Lisa Ellis","One last one for me. I saw the other 8-K that you added Mike Salvino to your Board, who is very deep into BPO space. Can you just comment then on sort of how you're thinking about the Industry IP and BPS business? Is that an area where you might look to, maybe, make an acquisition of one of the stand-alone players in that space to be fit up or vice versa, sort of just an update on how you're thinking about that.","Mike Lawrie","Yes. I'll make a comment on the acquisitions. But yes, the BPS space, particularly, particularly in the healthcare business, as you know, we did acquire Molina this past year, which gave us some additional states and some real capabilities within the healthcare BPS space. As you know, we've had some very significant wins that we are now in the process of scaling around insurance BPS. So Mike not only brings that skill set to the Board, but I think he also brings to the Board a person who has gone through some of these transformations where you see significant run off in your legacy business and how to reinvent that business and drive it in a new direction. And it's very helpful to have that expertise and someone who is actually lived through that. So, we are very pleased that Mike joined the Board.","Operator","And next, we'll take a question from Bryan Bergin with Cowen and Company.","Bryan Bergin","Just wondering -- on seeing the outlook, any changes here to your medium-term outlook on any -- your revenue on margin? And then as you think about the ramp in the upfront savings program, does that extend where you expected your revenue stabilization point or the timing of that to happen?","Mike Lawrie","Well, actually, I mean, these are rough numbers. So, these are not audited by Deloitte. But the -- fundamentally, we crossed over this quarter. So our sequential growth in digital was greater than our sequential decline in the traditional business. So that happened this quarter. And on a year-over-year basis, we -- I think this quarter now it's just like $30 million or $40 million, which fundamentally is at that point. Now, what I'm saying is as we go through next year that will be lumpy. And the reason that is lumpy is each quarter slightly differ. Some quarters you have a little more revenue run or you have a discontinuance or you have a price down, so it is -- you can't say, okay, gee, crossed here in the fourth quarter. Therefore, it's over. No, no, this is great. We have narrowed this gap dramatically, dramatically in the last year, last year and a half. Now we're going to see some ups and downs as we go through the typical seasonality and the unique quarter layout of the revenue stream. Does that makes sense, Bryan?","Bryan Bergin","Yes, it did. Did any changes the way you've articulated in the past on those targets?","Mike Lawrie","No.","Bryan Bergin","Okay. And then, just as far as free cash flow generation in '20, reverting your target there, how should we be thinking about capital allocation progression and share repurchases at current levels?","Mike Lawrie","We will continue to be very opportunistic in the market and we do have -- as we have shown in the past, the opportunity to deploy capital to buy back shares as well as to reinvest in the business as we have done in the last year.","Operator","Rayna Kumar from Evercore ISI has our next question.","Rayna Kumar","As you aggressively ramp up digital skill sets, can you help quantify that wage inflation that you might be seeing with this new skill sets?","Mike Lawrie","What you said? I'm sorry. I missed the last part of it.","Rayna Kumar","Could you quantify wage inflation as you continue to ramp up on digital skill sets?","Mike Lawrie","Okay. We haven't seen that much wage inflation. A lot of these digital skills are people who are much earlier in their career. We're also augmenting this with graduate programs. We are experimenting with some very unique things. For example, we are helping to pay tuition costs of some students, graduate students, and then they agreed to stay with us for three years after graduation. This is a way. And then we've actually worked with the universities on curriculum around some of these digital, particularly data scientists skills, analytic skills, and some other very important skills to our business going forward. And we are really having quite a bit of success attracting some of these newer and early in-career kind of people, because they're really doing some really, really interesting projects. I'd tell you, we have this little video tape that we show on this BMW autonomous driving program. We play in effort to about two minutes and they get exactly what we are talking about. So to answer your question, no, we're not seeing a lot of wage inflation.","Rayna Kumar","Got it. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up from the margin question that was asked previously. Could you quantify how much you expect EBIT margin, adjusted EBIT margin to be down in the first quarter? And then just the commentary surrounding the margin progression throughout the year? Is that one point increase sequential or year-over-year?","Paul Saleh","I think, it's sequential. And the first quarter will be probably closer to a 14 type of percent on an EBIT margin perspective down from the fourth quarter where we were at 15.7%.","Operator","Our next question will come from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.","Darrin Peller","Thanks, guys. Can you hear me, okay? It just said that line is open\u2026","Mike Lawrie","We can hear loud and clear.","Darrin Peller","Thanks, Mike. Just when considering guidance, we're calculating around, I think, it's negative 1% constant currency organic for what's embedded in your outlook for the year revenues. I mean, it's clearly better than negative 3% or so constant currency last year, but just in the backdrop of what seems to be pretty good visibility you're seeing now and digital expertise and strong in your book-to-bill 1.1x. I mean is there just any element of one-time items that you're comparing against you want to call out or easier -- any conservatism maybe we should think about? And then, also, maybe if you can give us a little color on the underlying pieces, whether it's the digital growth rate expected to be BPS and Industry IP or the legacy would be great?","Mike Lawrie","No. I think the -- nothing unusual except as I mentioned to you, we are accelerating the program of giving and working with our customers to get them upfront savings, so that we can get a greater share of their IT spend overall on Digital. And so, that's why you see the upfront decline a little bit in the -- more pronounced in the first quarter and then we expect to just really start to recover some of that throughout the year. And we have some seasonality, as you may recall, from Q4 to Q1. That's been usually -- and if you -- to last year, for example, alone it was about $300 million. So this first quarter will be a little bit higher than that given again the plans that of that we're working on to accelerate those digital transformation. But after that, as I mentioned, we see a progression, incremental revenue throughout the year and then you top that off with the Luxoft that comes on board for Q2, Q3 and Q4. And then, from a margin perspective, as I mentioned earlier, it is a progression sequentially of about a point from where we would print in the first quarter.","Darrin Peller","Just a quick follow-up on the Industry IP and BPNS side, I mean it seems like the digital side is taking -- is doing as well as you expected. That side of the business, the Industry IP and BPNS is, I think it's a tad lighter than we thought it would be. I'm so just curious to hear, are there certain verticals that you're really going to be able to help accelerate? Is there something going on there, that's a little surprising to the downside or maybe just more color on what you see there? Thanks, again, guys.","Mike Lawrie","Yes. Let me take a shot at this. We have invested over the last, I don't know, a year, 18 months on what we call a Digital Insurance Platform. And, fundamentally, this is taking different components that we had in our IP portfolio as well as some of the IP from our partners and we put that into what we're referring to as a Digital Insurance Platform. We have now sold this to a couple a large insurance companies. As a matter of fact, I was just in India last week and went through this whole approach with a couple of customers that we're visiting one of our centers in India. We are expecting that to begin to get some traction this coming fiscal year. It really has only been in the market three to four months. So the lead times on these things are quite lengthy, because they're significant transformation projects. So, we are getting more and more encouraged that that investment will get into -- begin to pay off. But to be quite candid with you, I don't have model that. We don't know how -- I don't have enough customer wins and enough experience in implementing this new platform to be able to give you -- I don't have an insight, so I can't then share of what -- how that's going to play out this year. We've also done some of the same things with our healthcare platforms and there also we're beginning to see some traction, but I just don't have enough visibility yet to see that. So we have been disappointed by the IP performance over the last year. As I said, it's roughly flat. We're really hoping to get a couple of points of growth that is definitely holding us back a little bit, but we have made the investment and we're going to continue to invest and we've got the platforms now, we'll see how this begins to play out...","Paul Saleh","Yes. Mike, I can add the -- one of the things that is actually showing up in the numbers for this year is that there were a couple of contracts where this customer decided to in-source work that we [Multiple Speakers]. Yes. And that's also -- that's why that segment is not showing the growth that we would otherwise had expected. But, that should hopefully be something going forward that will be behind us.","Mike Lawrie","Operator, we\u2019ll do one more.","Operator","One more? Thank you. That question will come from Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research.","Rod Bourgeois","So, I\u2019m wondering if you have substantial room in your fiscal \u201820 earnings guidance to invest significantly in digital and your plans for wallet share expansion. So I guess specifically I wanted to ask if you can quantify the magnitude of digital investment that you're planning for fiscal \u201820. And also if you could provide some dimensioning of the amount of investment you're making in these upfront client savings deals, presumably with the idea of expanding wallet share. Is there any way to quantify how much investments being made there?","Mike Lawrie","No. I got it. No problem. Pull, may add to this. Roughly, these aren't exact numbers, but roughly within this model, I think of this is probably a $100 million or incremental to what we have spent in the past and thinking of that as probably $0.25, $0.35 per share, roughly.","Rod Bourgeois","Okay.","Paul Saleh","And I think...","Rod Bourgeois","And fairly level loaded through the year?","Mike Lawrie","Yes. I would say, we're making these investments now. We continue to invest in Platform DXC. So, yes, I mean we're continuing with these investors. The two biggest investments we're making from an IP standpoint is Platform DXC, which we view as critical to wow digital workload, digital projects to be able to be integrated into mainstream IP. Now, we brand this differently, branded Platform DXC, the customers are working with rebranded ex-company platform. So that -- because it's not a proprietary platform, it's very open and it's built on our partners' technology like ServiceNow and others. So, we continue to invest in that and we continue to invest in taking our own digital offerings and integrating them into Platform DXC and then we continue to make a pretty significant investment in Bionix. We got very good yield out of Bionix. As you know, Bionix is advanced analytics, it's lean as well as the tooling that goes along with that. So those are the two sort of generic investments. We're making the cut across our whole portfolio and then the investments that I mentioned we are making in digital, particularly in skills acquisition and in some cases hiring a head for the demand.","One of the things, Rod, is that, in this digital world, it's not like the old ITO world, where you want to contract and you had a transition time of six months or eight months and skills were a monthly or 60 days later, it wasn't the end of the world. A lot of these digital projects are very perishable. People wanted to work, there's -- it's measured in weeks, not months and that's why we're building more of a bench in these DTCs to be able to respond. The other issue is, the large digital projects are not prescribed offerings. It really results as a part of an ideation process, minimally viable product or a proof-of-concept, which also requires people to actually run that process and then they get assigned to the actual project. So Digital, Platform DXC, Bionix and then the investments like I talked about in the healthcare and insurance make up the bulk of that. But we are investing more. We are investing more, because we see the opportunity and the growth and we're getting more comfortable with the model as we go forward.","Rod Bourgeois","All right. Hey, Mike, let me answer your question from a different angle. It's encouraging to hear the progress in hiring digital talent. As you approach the market for digital talent, can you explain your unique value proposition to attract new talent to DXC? When you're coming at this market from a different position than the other players, and I wonder if you have a way to articulate what's unique about your talent value proposition?","Mike Lawrie","Yes. That's a very good question. What we do Rod is, we differentiate around a couple of variable. One is, we have an incredible client base, incredible client base. Two, we are working on some extremely innovative projects like the BMW project. We have an unbelievable relationship with our partners. So these kids have access to not only what we're doing in DXC and our clients, but they also have access to learn and grow through partners like Microsoft and AWS and others. And then, finally, these recruits, if you will, see what we are doing with Luxoft and how we're entering that space from a digital engineering standpoint and then our global footprint, which gives them an opportunity to grow from a career path standpoint. Those are fairly compelling value propositions. And, as I said, we are not having a lot of difficulty in recruiting.","I'll just make one other comment, since this was the last question. I just was down at couple of our centers. I tell you, it's like entering a new world. I did a Town Hall Meeting in our New Orleans digital delivery center -- transformation center. I mean, I just wanted -- it's such a diverse group of people. I looked out in the audience who are probably 300, 400 people down there now. Just all kinds of backgrounds and there's -- the attitude is so different. I'd walk around these ideation rooms, there are with whiteboards and clients and talking about new opportunities and innovation. I mean, it's -- the tools that we have to help them with that, it's just -- it's like a whole different world, which is just so exciting. And as we continue to drive more of this digital revenue that becomes more and more what the company looks like. And if you combine that with our unbelievable capabilities operationally with our ITO business, our application business, it really is a great opportunity to co-create with the clients.","Jonathan Ford","And operator, we will close the call now. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8117":["DXC Technology (NYSE:DXC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call February  7, 2019  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Jonathan Ford - Head, IR","Mike Lawrie - Chairman, President & CEO","Paul Saleh - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald","Rod Bourgeois - DeepDive Equity Research","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research","James Friedman - Susquehanna","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the DXC Technology Third Quarter Conference Call. A reminder that today's call is being recorded.","And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Ford, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jonathan Ford","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased you're joining us for DXC Technology's third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. Our speakers on today's call will be Mike Lawrie, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer. The call is being webcast at dxc.com\/investorrelations and we've posted slides to our website, which will accompany the discussion today.","Slide 2 informs our participants that DXC Technology's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures.","These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release as well as in our supplemental slides. Both documents are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.","On Slide 3, you'll see that certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. I would like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call, except as required by law.","And now, I'd like to introduce DXC Technology's Chairman, President and CEO, Mike Lawrie.","Mike Lawrie","Okay. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, I have my four, five points to make and then I'll turn this over to Paul and then we'll have plenty of time for any of your questions.","First, non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter was $2.23. Adjusted EBIT was $840 million and adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2% and we generated $503 million of adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter. In terms of revenue in the third quarter, revenue was $5.178 billion on a GAAP basis. The constant currency, revenue was down 2.6% year-over-year and was up 4.3% sequentially. Bookings were up 3% year-over-year and 22% up sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.","The third point around digital, in constant currency, our digital revenue grew 16.9% year-over-year and 9.5% sequentially, driven by strong bookings in the first half of the year, particularly in cloud. Digital bookings in the quarter were up 85% year-over-year for a book-to-bill of 2.1x. Bookings were very strong across all digital offering families and cloud had a 3.3x book-to-bill in the quarter. Industry IP and BPS revenue was up 2.6% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, and the industry IP-BPS book-to-bill was 0.8x.","Fourth, we continue to make strategic investments in digital assets and capabilities. As you know, we recently announced our plan to acquire Luxoft, a global at-scale digital innovator with differentiated offerings and platforms, deep vertical expertise and a world-class digital talent workforce. Luxoft has over $900 million in revenue and has been growing at strong double-digit rates. We also announced our plan to acquire the Services division of EG, one of the leading integrators of Microsoft Dynamics 365 in Northern Europe.","And then finally for fiscal 2019, we continue to target revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion and we're raising our non-GAAP EPS target to a range of $8.15 to $8.30.","So let me just go into little more detail on each of those points before I turn it over to Paul. As I said, the third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.23. The effective tax rate was 20.4%. Third quarter adjusted EBIT was $840 million and the adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, up 160 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially. This margin improvement reflects continued execution of the levers that we have previously discussed.","GBS segment profit margin was 18.2%, which was down 10 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially. This reflects the investments we're making to accelerate digital hiring and expand our digital transformation capabilities. In GIS segment, profit margin was 17.5%, up 320 basis points year-over-year and 120 basis points sequentially.","The GIS margin expansion was driven by our ongoing global deployment of Bionix, delivery center rationalization and the benefit of some final milestone achievements on a few of our contracts. And adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $503 million or 81% of adjusted net income.","Now, let me go to revenue. As I said, revenue in the third quarter was $5.178 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 2.6% year-over-year and was up 4.3% sequentially. Bookings were up 3% year-over-year and 22% up sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.1x. Since the end of October, we've hired over 1,000 digital employees.","As we previously discussed, we centralized digital hiring efforts with a strong focus on our digital transformation centers. These roles include AWS and Azure architects, data scientists and DevOps engineers and others. We've also identified an additional 2,000 current DXC employees to be re-skilled in digital technologies. We're rapidly correcting the hiring delays that we discussed in the second quarter and will continue to accelerate hiring and training efforts in support of our fastest-growing capabilities.","Now, we also believe that the Luxoft acquisition will allow DXC to accelerate its digital hiring efforts and reduce the time to fulfill digital demand for clients. Luxoft's established digital delivery footprint will also improve the client proximity for many of DXC's digital capabilities. In the third quarter, GBS revenue was $2.17 billion, down 4% year-over-year in constant currency and up 3.7% sequentially.","The year-over-year decline was driven by the ongoing headwinds in legacy application services as well as the completion of several large transformation projects we've previously discussed. GBS bookings in the quarter were up 3.1% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1x.","GIS revenue in the quarter was $3 billion. GIS revenue was down 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency and was up 4.8% sequentially. The sequential revenue growth reflects the good progress made in our digital business, including cloud infrastructure, cyber security and our digital workplace offering. Overall, GIS bookings were up 38% sequentially and the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.1x. This reflects continued strength in our cloud and digital workplace offerings and the bookings associated with them.","Now, let me turn to digital industry IP and BPS. In constant currency, digital revenue was up 16.9% year-over-year. Digital bookings continue to be very strong with a 2-to-1, 2.1x book-to-bill driven by our cloud infrastructure and as I said our digital workplace offerings. Our digital pipeline is also up more than 90% year-over-year, which reflects the strong demand we're seeing for digital solutions. For example, we signed a large deal with a European automotive manufacturer that includes analytics, multi-platform cloud and security.","The solution includes deep learning and simulation platforms designed to accelerate the R&D for autonomous vehicles. We're the only provider who could demonstrate the ability to deliver these infrastructure and analytics capabilities at-scale.","In constant currency, our cloud infrastructure business grew 32% in the quarter and was up 13.4% sequentially, again reflecting the strength of our cloud bookings during the first half of the year. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 3.3x, including expanded deals with a major European bank and the automotive manufacturer I just highlighted.","Our security business grew 4.5% year-over-year in constant currency and 11% sequentially, driven by strong growth in Northern Europe and Asia. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.4x, including a deal with a large financial services provider, where DXC is partnering with CrowdStrike to provide managed endpoint threat detection and response services. We're also seeing increased demand for our operational technology security solutions in the manufacturing and energy sectors.","Enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 2.7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Bookings in the quarter were strong and the book-to-bill was 1.4x. Wins in the quarter included a ServiceNow deal with a major US food manufacturer. The solution leverages platform DXC and will migrate their existing IT services management processes on to a ServiceNow platform.","We also won SAP S\/4HANA deals with a European satellite operator and a multinational technology company. In constant currency, industry IP and BPS revenue was 2.6% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, reflecting the acquisition of Molina Medicaid health solutions, which expanded our business supporting state agencies in the administration of Medicaid programs and adds to our overall healthcare IP portfolio.","Now, moving to my fourth point, we continue to make investments in digital assets and capabilities. As we discussed in November, we acquired argodesign, a digital design consultancy based in Austin. Argodesign will enhance DXC's capabilities in interface design and user experience, which are key elements in developing and delivering digital transformation solutions at-scale. During the third quarter, we also completed the acquisitions of BusinessNow and TESM, which will further expand our industry-leading ServiceNow practice.","As we said, we recently announced the planned acquisition of Luxoft Holding. We believe this transaction will create significant value through revenue synergies and access to a broader pool of digital talent. Luxoft strengthens DXC's portfolio of digital offerings with proven capabilities in high-growth areas, including analytics and business intelligence, user experience, IoT and blockchain.","Luxoft also has a very strong outsourced engineering business. Luxoft has highly skilled digital workforce of more than 13,000 people and as I said earlier an established digital recruiting engine. More than 80% of Luxoft's workforce has a Masters degree or Ph.D. and their engineering talent is primarily housed in Central and Eastern European delivery centers. This market provides a significant source of digital talent.","We're estimating $200 million to $300 million -- $300 million to $400 million of incremental revenue for the combined company by fiscal year '22. We believe there's an opportunity to expand wallet share with each company's respective clients. Further, we'll be able to expand Luxoft's existing platforms into additional geographies and industries.","Luxoft's digital talent acquisition capabilities will also accelerate DXC's ability to capitalize on digital demand from our clients. And we remain on track to close the Luxoft transaction by the end of June. And in January, we announced a plan to acquire Microsoft Dynamics practice of EG. The combination of EG with DXC Eclipse will extend DXC's leadership as a global Dynamics 365 systems integrator and will greatly enhance the scale of DXC's capabilities in the Nordic region.","And then my final point before I turn it over to Paul is we expect additional sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We're still targeting revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, although we are currently trending toward the lower half of that range, given some of the currency headwinds that we see. We're increasing our non-GAAP EPS targets to a range of $8.15 to $8.30, reflecting our accelerated pace of share repurchases and a lower tax rate than originally planned.","So I'll turn it over to Paul and then we'll be back for questions.","Paul Saleh","Thank you, Mike, and greetings, everyone. As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. In the quarter, we had restructuring costs of $76 million on a pretax basis or $0.21 per diluted share. These costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs, particularly in complex countries and also expenses associated with facilities and data center rationalization.","Also, in the quarter, we had $107 million pretax or $0.29 per diluted share of transaction separation and integration-related costs, including the acquisition of Molina. Year-to-date restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs amounted to $723 million pretax or $1.94 per diluted share.","In the third quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $134 million pretax or $0.35 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $786 million and non-GAAP EPS was $2.23.","Now, before I turn to our third quarter results in more detail, I'd like to point out a correction that we included in the non-GAAP section of our press release regarding adjusted free cash flow. In the second quarter, DXC expanded the use of its receivable facility and should have excluded the benefit of that expansion from adjusted free cash flow.","Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow has now been revised to accurately reflect the net impact of the receivables facility and that resulted in a $223 million net cumulative reduction year-to-date. As a result of that correction, adjusted free cash flow for the first nine months was $1.2 billion or 68% of adjusted net income.","Now, let me move on to our third quarter results in more detail. GAAP revenue in the third quarter was $5.178 billion, a sequential increase of 4.3%. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $840 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, reflecting the progress we're making in our margin improvement plans. For the fiscal year, we remain on track to deliver our $575 million cost takeout target.","During the quarter, we continued to optimize our workforce and drive procurement efficiencies. We reduced our headcount by roughly 3,000 people during the quarter and that is excluding sub [ph] and the Molina acquisition.","Year-over-year, total headcount [indiscernible] over 14,000 driven by ongoing productivity efforts, including our Bionix automation program. In supply chain, we're driving procurement efficiencies, including increased use of consumption-based purchase agreements for infrastructure and software. We also have expanded our category management capabilities to better leverage our strategic suppliers and consolidate vendors.","Turning to real estate, we eliminated an additional 1.5 million square feet during the quarter. And we've also closed seven data centers and are on track to exit two to three additional data centers this fiscal year. We're also reinvesting in the business this fiscal year, including the acceleration of digital hiring, continued deployment of Bionix, expansion of our digital transformation centers and the continued build-out of key offerings, including AWS and Microsoft Azure solutions.","In the quarter, our non-GAAP EPS tax rate was 20.4%, reflecting our global mix of income and the timing of certain changes in tax attributes in key foreign jurisdictions. For the full year, we now expect the tax rate to be at the lower end of our previous range of 24% to 28% and that implies a tax rate of slightly above 30% in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, revenue was $15.5 billion, adjusted EBIT was $2.4 billion [indiscernible] was 15.8% and booking were $14.9 billion for a book-to-bill of 1 time.","Turning to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.17 billion in the third quarter, a sequential increase of 3.7%. In the third quarter, GBS segment profit was $395 million and profit margins was 18.2% and that is including the investment we're making in expanding our digital capabilities. Year-to-date, GBS revenue was $6.5 billion, segment profit was $1.2 billion, margin was 18.5% and bookings were $6.4 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.","GIS revenue was $3.01 billion in the quarter, up 4.8% in constant currency sequentially. GIS segment profit in the third quarter was $528 million. Profit margin was 17.5%. Now, the segment profit margin for GIS reflect the impact of actions we're taking to drive greater operating efficiencies, including delivery and data center rationalization as well as the benefit of final milestone achievement on a few contracts. Year-to-date, GIS revenue was $9 billion, segment profit was $1.5 billion, margin was 16.4% and booking were $8.5 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.9 times.","Now, let me turn to other financial highlights. Adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter was $503 million or 81% of adjusted net income. As I previously covered, year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow performance is impacted by an increase of five to six days in day sales outstanding, driven primarily by extended payment terms on large traditional contracts.","Now, we have efforts underway to improve our working capital performance and to incentivize our [indiscernible] be even more focused on collections. However, given the time remaining this fiscal year, we're revising our adjusted free cash flow target for the year to 70% to 80% of adjusted net income.","Our CapEx was $153 million in the quarter or 3% of revenue, including the benefit of asset dispositions. Year-to-date CapEx was $829 million or 5.4% of revenue. Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.5 billion. Our total debt was $7.56 billion, including capital leases for a net debt to total capital ratio of 26.9%. Following the announcement of the Luxoft acquisition, all three rating agencies reaffirmed DXC's rating and outlook.","Now, during the third quarter, we paid $54 million in dividends and we've repurchased $797 million in shares for a total of $851 million in capital returned to shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned $1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of in-cash dividend and $1.2 billion in share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to return capital to shareholders, but at a more moderate pace.","In closing, we continue to target revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion. Although, given our current -- the currency headwinds that we're seeing, we're trending toward the lower half of that range. We've raised our EPS target range to $8.15 to $8.30, reflecting the pace of share repurchases and a tax rate that's trending toward the lower end of our targeted range.","I'll now hand the call back to the operator for our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator"," [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Jim Schneider at Goldman Sachs.","Jim Schneider","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Mike or Paul, I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about the labor fill-in. It sounds like that digital hiring is progressing well, but can you maybe talk about at what point, is it one, two or three quarters out, you feel like you'll be in a position to kind of fully get staffed and get traction on all the digital work that you've already booked? And maybe talk about kind of when you kind of get normalized run rate to where you want it to be?","Mike Lawrie","Yeah. I think we will get there probably in the early part of next fiscal year, think of that as the first half. We've made -- we've talked about this at the end of the second quarter. We clearly fell behind in the hiring. And we've made a big investment in the processes and our tools and frankly much better planning at the account level. I can't tell you what little discipline does because that gives us a much better demand signal. And then we are able to turn the hiring machine and the processes on to get that done.","The other thing to tell is we, Jim, have centralized a lot of this digital hiring. So we've put a very thorough skills taxonomy together and we're hiring these people into our digital delivery centers and then we're deploying those people as the projects get firmed up and signed by the customer. That's a whole different process than trying to do this account by account. We're also seeing a significant improvement in the quality of the people and the skills that we're bringing in.","So I think to net this out, I think we'll get to more of a steady state in terms of hiring sort of the first half of next fiscal year, but we'll continue to remix the workforce. I mean, Paul talked about 14,000 reduction, it's true, but on the other side of that is we've hired thousands of people into these new businesses.","And that remix of the workforce both re-skilling of existing as well as bringing new people in that's going to continue for a long time. So I think these digital delivery centers, I think that's helped us. We're getting better candidates. The tools to processes, the discipline and frankly people see that we're attracting, they see really good career opportunities in digital as they look out over the next medium to longer-term.","And one of the point, it's probably longer answer than you're looking for, but I mean Luxoft has really helped in terms of their brand and their reputation in the digital space as well. So I think this was a strong signal that we were serious about really jump-starting or catapulting us and our skills into a slightly different space than where we were prior to the second quarter.","Paul, I don't know if you want to add anything?","Paul Saleh","No, Mike, I think you captured it. Also, as we do this, the demand -- actually, our bookings are growing 89% on a year-over-year basis and also our pipeline is growing rapidly.","Jim Schneider","That's good color. So I wanted to follow up on what you just kind of left of with, which is bookings. Clearly, good to see that recovery there. Can you maybe talk a little bit about, although we know the GIS bookings can always be very lumpy, can you sustain that same level of booking spend we saw this quarter into the next couple of quarters based on your current visibility? Maybe talk about the pipeline, especially very near-term. And then anything you can say relative to any potential new logos or how much you see kind of digital playing into the near-term bookings environment?","Mike Lawrie","Yeah. I -- listen. The big deals in GIS are lumpy. That's not going to change. I mean, are we working on a lot of big deals? Yes, we are. When exactly they're going to close? I don't know, that gets a little lumpy. I think it can continue in the fourth quarter and even into the first quarter based on what we see in the pipeline. But the more important trend is underneath that. And that is what I'll call shorter duration project work. I think I've mentioned this before, but we now are compensating many of people in our delivery organization for what we call delivery-led growth.","These are shorter-term projects, where we can sign people very quickly and generate incremental revenue. Our digital projects are largely of shorter duration. They usually start out smaller and then tend to expand and scale over time. So the dynamics of our bookings are changing as our business model and portfolio begins to shift our total reliance on big deals, big TCV deals. That reliance is beginning to diminish as we move the portfolio to a much higher number, higher volume of digital projects. We consider that good. When we looked into Luxoft's book of business, it's the exact same profile that we're beginning to experience in our business. So that I think bodes well as we go forward.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Joseph Foresi at Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. So I had kind of a -- well, to be as straightforward as I can be, Mike, you've been known as somebody who has been very good at unlocking shareholder value. As you look at the balance between potentially doing more acquisitions, divestitures or other ways of unlocking shareholder value, maybe you can give us some insight into what your thought process is around that over the short and long-term? Are you more likely to be in the digital market to continue to buy stuff, divestitures, taking on acquisition for cost cutting?","Mike Lawrie","Yeah. I think we're always looking for ways to enhance shareholder value, you know that, you said that. We have all options on the table all the time. Candidly, I don't see a lot of divestitures as I look out because we have really remixed the portfolio quite dramatically over the last couple of years. I do think we'll see some more smaller tuck-in type acquisitions, particularly in the digital space.","So as -- assuming we get the Luxoft transaction completed, there's a whole series of smaller opportunities that can be added to that business model. We continue to look for areas, where we can strengthen our IP portfolio, like we did with Molina in healthcare. We're continuing to look at other practices to strengthen our really very strong position in Microsoft Dynamics 365 as well as ServiceNow, where we've made significant investments.","So I'd say that part of our capital allocation model that we've talked about will continue. And then, of course, the mix of returning share -- returning money to our shareholders as we've done, we've returned over a $1 billion, we obviously thought our stock was a very good buy and have continued to plow money into that as well. So I don't see any major changes in the capital allocation model as we go forward.","We got to tighten up, as Paul said, on our working capital management, particularly our day sales outstanding and -- that's difficult because there's a pretty strong push to try to extend those terms particularly on these large ITO contracts. That's another thing.","As we look out longer, we see working capital moving in our favor. The shorter-term projects have a propensity to pay in a much quicker cycle than many of these large ITO contracts. So that's how we're thinking about it going forward is we've got a capital allocation model, we're going to stick with that, we're very pleased with the Luxoft transaction, we think it's a quality acquisition at a fair price and I think there'll be things that we'll be able to add on to that platform as we go forward. Does that answer your question?","Joseph Foresi","It does. And then just a second one from me. On the digital, as you start to play catch-up, maybe you can help us understand what advantage you have in trying to displace an Accenture? Or is this merely a massive shift that everyone can participate in? I'm just trying to get your thoughts around sort of what the crucial piece of the puzzle is as we try to accelerate it.","Mike Lawrie","Yeah, that's a good question. That's a -- listen, that's a good question. First of all, I think the market is expanding very rapidly and I think there is plenty of room for everyone to play. And if you look at the results of many of the players in this space, they're all relatively strong. The thing that I think really came to life for me was -- and this came around, Luxoft in particular, is the different space that they are in.","They are much more in, what I'll call, the business executive space, taking on digital projects that candidly, one, DXC didn't see and in many cases weren't really considered because of the brand reputation we have around being able to run infrastructures and big application sets, those kinds of things. That is really going to change. And then the underlying thing that's so important is all of these smaller digital projects ultimately have to get, they have to get integrated into mainstream IT in order to really see the transformative benefits of these digital projects.","And that's what our unique value proposition is and we're staying with that along with our partners and our partners bring a lot to the table here. And again, the Luxoft acquisition, many of our partners work with Luxoft and our clients are all, all on a digital journey. Different places in that journey, but all on that digital journey. So as I said many, many times, this is a generational shift and there is plenty of addressable market for everyone to participate in right now.","Operator","Moving next to Rod Bourgeois at DeepDive Equity Research.","Rod Bourgeois","Hey, guys. Hey. It appears that your digital investments have caused your GBS margin expansion to somewhat taper off here. I'm wondering, if you can dimension how much extra digital investment you're now making perhaps compared to where you were a year ago? And if you could also help gauge how much of that digital investment is prone to be kind of the new normal of investment versus an extraordinary investment that you're making now as you ramp up this digital talent engine?","Mike Lawrie","Well, listen, we talked about the margin and not much as we're 30 basis points or something like that. So yes, Rod to answer your question, we are making a slightly larger investment in the hiring of these digital skills than we have before. And that became very apparent to us as we exited the second quarter some of those issues. So we have ramped that up. I would call this a new normal. I think we will get to more, as I said earlier on a previous question, we'll get to much more of a steady-state as we continue to remix our workforce.","So in many cases what you're seeing here is you're continuing to see an expansion of some of the margins in GIS because frankly that's where a lot of the remix is taking place and you're seeing a slight deterioration in the GBS margins.","Overall, the margins for the Company continue to expand. So I think it's a broader picture. It's going to be a remix. I don't think we'll continue what this sort of extraordinary effort to bootstrap ourselves in the digital hiring, but I honestly hope we have the demand going forward long-term that we continue to do that.","And in many cases, we're hiring teams of people, not just individuals because a lot of these digital projects require scrum leaders, they require data scientists, they require software engineers. So more and more as we remix this business portfolio, these aren't individual skills that get applied, there are teams that get applied to a digital business solution. And that's a different way of managing your workforce as well.","Rod Bourgeois","Got it. And then, hey, on the demand side in the part of your business that's project-based and more reliant on discretionary spending, are you seeing any change in demand pattern, any hesitation on client decision-making or pullback in capital spending at all?","Mike Lawrie","I am not. I mean, the digital demand remains pretty strong. There isn't a -- I just got back from a -- one of my trips and met with quite a few CEOs, I mean, everyone knows they got to do this. Again, our value proposition is we come in and we help clients figure out how to reduce the operating expenses of their existing IP estate. Okay? And there isn't a CEO that I've met that is not interested in it.","And this isn't just high in the sky. I mean, this is things like platform DXC, which is our architecture with our partners, it's Bionix, it's all of those things that we can do. And then we go to our clients and say we want to be able to participate in many of these digital projects. And we usually start out with a simple, what we call, ideation process, where we get the client and us together, that's why we've made this investment in the Digital Transformation Center.","So we go and we problem solve. And that usually results in some sort of statement of work or project that may not be huge, some of these are measured in hundreds of thousands of dollars, not millions. But you go in, you rapidly prototype that, you demonstrate that it works and then you take the next step and you begin to scale. And that's how we see more and more of that occurring every day, every week, every month.","And frankly, I think it's a much healthier business mix as we move forward. But yes, that does involve some investment in these digital delivery centers and people and teams and so on and so forth, but that's not going to impact the overall margin profile of the Company as we go forward.","Operator","And we will go next to Jason Kupferberg at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Kupferberg","Good afternoon, guys. So certainly nice to see the re-acceleration in the digital revenue growth. So that 17% number, where do we go from here? Are you expecting some further near-term acceleration just as the hiring scales?","Mike Lawrie","Yeah. I -- listen, I'm really pretty pleased with the progress we made this quarter in terms of sequential revenue growth, continued very good strong performance in digital, while continuing to drive margin expansion. I'm very pleased with that. But I want to do even more. So I'm not really going to be happy until I see the digital business growing 20%, 21%, 23%. I think it can happen.","Now, I think it will continue to require us to go to market differently, source these opportunities differently, as I just explained with Rod's question, and then continue to hire into that demand. As I said, we use this annual build revenue as sort of a metric internally, it's not ready for prime time yet in terms of audibility, but we use it internally. And we have seen an acceleration of this as we've gone through this year. I mean, the first -- we got off to a fairly slow start in the first quarter, we picked up some steam in the second quarter.","Third quarter is the first quarter we've actually made our internal objectives around our digital sales. So we're beginning to see that pick up steam. Now, we got caught short as we fully admitted, we got caught a little short because the demand got out a little bit in front of our ability to then source the people. And as I said, sourcing people is not individuals, it's more teams. And sometimes you can't get started with these projects until it's a whole team. Doesn't do any good to have just the data scientists show up for analytics, if you also require software engineering as well. So that's the gap that we are closing.","But I think the demand is there. This is a generational shift. We're making acquisitions. We're making investments. We're beginning to see that revenue tick up a little bit. We're beginning to see the sales tick up. So those are encouraging signs. But I can promise you, it's not going to be a straight line here as we go forward, there's always going to be some twists and turns in the road, but we're really comfortable with the business model that's beginning to emerge.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. So just to follow up on the supply side of that. So beyond the 1,000 plus, I think you said you already hired since the end of October. If you think about what you still need to hire as you try and complete the backfill process, I think you said through the first half of fiscal '20, how much of that additional hiring to come is going to essentially be kind of retraining some existing DXC personnel versus net new headcount?","Mike Lawrie","I'd say just over the next couple of months, I'd like to hire another couple thousand people in digital and we want to retrain a couple thousand. So right now, I'd say it's somewhat of a even mix between reskilling as well as hiring. And then I think the other thing that we'll have a little better insight on is once we get the Luxoft transaction closed and we begin to understand that hiring platform and how that works, that will also bring a new dimension to our digital skills.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Just wanted to ask about the new adjusted free cash flow guidance of 70% to 80% of adjusted income. I think previous guidance before was 90% plus conversion going towards 100%. So just want to understand the differences now from the model today versus previous and then how do we get back to 90% plus free cash flow conversion in the future?","Paul Saleh","Yeah. I think we -- what it is just the day sales outstanding. We saw an increase in DSOs of about five to six days. That represent roughly about probably $300 million plus in the sense of cash usage that we need to go and attack. I think it's just -- again, the fourth quarter is always also the year-end, calendar year-end is usually not the best -- everybody hangs on to their cash for their balance sheet purposes.","But having said all of these things, we must do a much better job at working capital and we have just really marshaled the entire organization, all of my CFOs around the world are now just really on point to just really drive collection and particularly past due also. We were expecting to have done a little bit better job on past due receivables and we saw little bit of a pause here, but it's on us and we're going out and trying to get that rectified ASAP. Longer-term, it doesn't change the guidance that we have given and the targets of 90% or 100% by the 2022.","Mike Lawrie","In short this is more operational than it is model issue. And we did see -- we had a lot of volatility in the market as you guys well know in December. And what we did see is people holding on to their cash a little more tightly, if you will. We did the same thing by the way from a payable standpoint. So again, I think this is more operational around day sales outstanding. That's fixable. It doesn't change the model long-term.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, looking at Molina and some of the other acquisitions that have been completed or about to be completed, how will that fold into the model? And will that help revenue a little bit in the fourth quarter and beyond? Thanks.","Paul Saleh","I think not much in the fourth quarter. Some of it showed up in the third quarter. I think all of it was very consistent with the model that we gave you before that acquisition, again, aside from Luxoft, which was a little bit off to the side right now, it was about a 1% to 2% of our top line coming from this acquisition. Molina contributed about $50 million, but it was part of what we had given you in terms of what we were expecting to do in the second quarter and we came in a little bit better overall for the business and from a revenue standpoint in the third quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research.","Darrin Peller","Hey. Thanks guys. Just when we look at the digital trends that obviously are accelerating as you talked about, can you just give us some more color on the sourcing of that with regard to the partnership model that we've talked a lot about it and as you guys have talked a lot about in the past, I'm curious to hear how that's been trending recently in terms of the additive to the digital bookings we're seeing and now the conversion to revenue?","Mike Lawrie","Yeah. Our sales bookings -- we track a couple of things with our partners, but I don't want to get overly complex here. but sort of sales WIP, meaning where we are partnering directly and go-to-market together, sell through stuff that we actually sell-through or they sell through us or we sell through them and then co-sell too. And in every one of those categories, this year is a first year I've seen it, where we're beginning to see an increase and it's playing out.","So we will sit down with the Microsoft and we'll sit down with an AWS or we'll sit down with an AT&T and we will select accounts, where we're going to work together in that account. And what we're finding is when we do partner more deeply like that, when I say partner, I'm talking about joint proposals, not two separate proposals that get stapled together in the lobby before we make the presentation. I'm talking about an integrated proposal. And we're seeing win rates go up dramatically, and I mean dramatically, like 20 points when we do that. Now, that is not only obvious to us, but it's also becoming clearer and clearer to our partners.","Our partners do source incremental opportunities that we can go after. And already, already, just in working within the regulatory framework of what we could do with Luxoft, I see all kinds of opportunities. I mean, we've identified through the -- just some joint work that we've been able to do again within the construct of what we can do from a regulatory standpoint, hundreds of millions of dollars of opportunities that we never saw before.","So yes, I think the partners and I think some of the acquisitions that we are doing, some of the things we've done with PwC that we've talked about in the past, all these are contributing to us seeing more opportunities. And that's driving then the hiring, not only of our services people and -- but also our sales because we're increasing our sales force at the same time because you need the sales force now to begin to qualify and help put all these proposals together.","So we are increasing that. We talk about digital skills and certification and all the other programs that we have with our partners to retrain DXC people, but we're -- at the same time, we are hiring, we're increasing our sales force. This is the first time we've done this in years because we see the opportunity to deploy them around meaningful opportunities.","Darrin Peller","All right. That's great to hear. And just quickly, you mentioned Luxoft again. But look, I mean, have you had any chance to speak to either your clients or Luxoft clients further since your announcement in terms of just feedback and how they feel about it? Thanks again guys.","Mike Lawrie","Yeah, I have, I've spent quite a bit of time doing that as a matter of fact. They view it as very positive. They see the business rationale behind it. We're trying to keep this as separate as possible for obvious reasons. Most -- I got to tell you, I mean, the -- it's more -- it's done quite a bit to change the brand perception of DXC that we're really serious about this. I went out to the Consumer Electronics Show out in Las Vegas, I never have been there in five years and I was just amazed at the customer feedback and the projects that we are working on with Luxoft. So yes, we've gotten positive feedback from our partners. We've gotten positive feedback from Luxoft clients and certainly our clients.","Now, having said that, there's a wait-and-see, there's not that much we can do right now. So right now, it's more talk than it is actual action. But we will certainly get into that once we get the transaction closed. And we are in the process now of planning all the revenue synergies and all the other things that go along with getting prepared to close the transaction.","Jonathan Ford","And operator, we'll take one more call. And then, we'll close -- sorry, one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. And that's from James Friedman at Susquehanna.","James Friedman","Hi. Thanks for sneaking me and it's Jamie. I just wanted to ask about the Q4 assumptions. So Paul or Mike, if I look at the midpoint of the implication on the Q4, it's $120 million plus above consensus. I realize you're talking about some FX challenges, but even at the midpoint of the lower half, you're still above. And my question is, how should we be thinking about cadence? You talked a lot about milestones, like both of you used that word a couple of times in your prepared remarks. Are there milestones in the Q4 that you're anticipating that will some of the revenue?","Mike Lawrie","No. What I'm looking at to be quite candid is continued sequential growth. That's what I'm interested in. I want to continue to see this business grow sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Then underneath that, I'm looking very carefully at where we are with our digital revenue, what that pipeline looks like, what the sales performance is and then I'm also looking very carefully at the runoff and price downs and when those price downs occur in our ITO market.","So it's a fairly, not complex, but it's a reasonably involved formula. And at the end of the day, the most important thing I'm trying to drive across the Company is continued sequential growth and continued strong digital performance underneath that. Now, our IP portfolio is also beginning to grow. That is not growing as much as it needs to grow, but it is beginning to grow. So Jamie, that's what I'm looking for is continued sequential growth as we go forward.","James Friedman","Just ask one follow-up on this slide 11, you don't have to look at it, you know what I'm talking about. But the CapEx as a percentage of revenue, that was a big theme especially in the CSC days. 3% seems low, but since our conversation is about the free cash flow, I was just wondering, like how should we be thinking about that going forward because I'm just wondering what the sustainable run rate of that is? Thank you.","Paul Saleh","We indicated, if you remember, that our goal was to be in the 5%, 7% longer-term as a percentage of revenue. This quarter was a little bit more unusual because we had the -- some asset dispositions that helped to offset the CapEx, but I would say to you somewhere in the 5%, 6%, it would be a good number to use.","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the program back to our speakers.","Mike Lawrie","Okay. Thank you, guys. Thank you.","Jonathan Ford","We'll close the call now. Thank you, operator.","Operator","Thank you. And once again, that does conclude today's conference. Again, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today."],"8111":["DXC Technology Co. (NYSE:DXC) Q1 2018 Earnings Call August  8, 2017  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Jonathan Ford - DXC Technology Co.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","Paul N. Saleh - DXC Technology Co.","Analysts","Arvind Anil Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Operator","Please stand by, we are about to begin. Good day and welcome to the DXC Technology First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jonathan Ford, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jonathan Ford - DXC Technology Co.","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased you are joining us for DXC Technology's first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call and webcast. Our speakers on today's call will be Mike Lawrie, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer. The call is being webcast at dxc.com\/investorrelations and we've posted some slides to our website, which will accompany our discussion today.","Slide 2 explains that the discussion will include comparisons of our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 to our pro forma combined company results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The pro forma results are based on the historical quarterly statements of operations of each of CSC and the legacy Enterprise Services business of HPE or HPES, giving effect to the merger as if it had been consummated on April 2, 2016.","As a consequence of CSC and HPES having different fiscal year-end dates, the pro forma financials represent the combination of CSC on a fiscal year ending March 31 and HPES on a fiscal year ending January 31. On that basis, last year's first quarter results consist of CSC's quarter ending July 1, 2016 and HPES's quarter ending April 30, 2016.","Slide 3 informs our participants that DXC Technology's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release as well as in our supplemental slides. Both documents are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.","On slide 4, you'll see that certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call.","A discussion of risks and uncertainties is included in our registration statements on Form S-4 and Form 10. Our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. I would like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call, except of course as required by law.","And now, I would like to introduce DXC Technology's Chairman, President and CEO, Mike Lawrie. Mike?","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","Okay, Jonathan. Thank you very much. As is my custom here I've got four or five key points, which I'll cover and then develop in a little more detail, and then turn this over to Paul, and then we'll have time for Q&A.","First point is our first quarter non-GAAP EPS was a $1.59. EBIT adjusted for restructuring, integration and amortization of intangibles was $679 million. Adjusted EBIT margin on that basis was 11.5% and we generated $595 million of adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter.","Second point. Revenue in the first quarter was $5.913 billion on a GAAP basis, and excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, revenue was down 4.2% year-over-year in constant currency, we had a book-to-bill of 1.1x. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, our digital revenue grew 13.4% year-over-year in constant currency and on a similar basis our industry IP and BPS revenue was down 3.2% reflecting the completion of a large phase of our UK NHS contract in July of last year.","And in the first quarter, our digital book-to-bill was 1.8x reflecting our customers' accelerating shift to digital and our industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 0.7 reflecting the timing of contract awards. And fourth point is during the quarter, we completed key merger integration milestones. We're executing our synergy plan and are on track to meet our targets of $1 billion of year-one cost savings, as well as $1.5 billion of run-rate cost savings exiting the year.","And then finally for fiscal 2018, we continue to target revenue of $24 billion or $24.5 billion in constant currency, and our target for non-GAAP EPS remains $6.50 to $7 with an adjusted free cash flow target of 100% or more of adjusted net income.","Now, let me just go into a little detail on each of those points. As I said, our first quarter non-GAAP EPS was $1.59 reflecting our cost synergy realization, a tax rate of 23%, and an FX gain from the conversion of foreign legal entities into local currency. First quarter EBIT adjusted for restructuring, integration, amortization of intangibles was $679 million. And adjusted EBIT margin on that basis was 11.5%, up 665 basis points year-over-year, and sequentially margin was up 375 basis points. The improvement in our EBIT margin reflects cost actions that we took consistent with the synergy plans outlined at our Investor Day in March. And let me just spend a moment detailing some of those actions.","On day one, we've harmonized our corporate policies, our 401(k) and benefit plans, as well as severance policies across the company. We also implemented a consistent global expense and travel policy. We implemented workforce optimization plans and are rapidly consolidating redundant roles across all functions while increasing spans of control with fewer management layers.","In our delivery and support organizations, we have removed four management layers, and across the company, spans of control have improved 20% and we reduced the number of VPs and Directors by 40%, while at the same time, heavily reinvesting in our next-generation skills. We further continue to drive delivery workforce improvements through standardization of processes, automation and operational data mining, and we've implemented a single integrated delivery model across all capabilities. This enables a more agile customer support model, while driving savings through consolidated management roles and larger pools of teams with domain expertise and we're winding overhead costs to top quartile benchmarks and scaling leveraged support models for all the key functions.","In our supply chain, we're leveraging our new scale to drive greater efficiencies in our procurement spend and we're also consolidating vendors and focusing on demand management to reduce volumes. And additionally we're making significant reductions in professional services and travel expenses. DXC is also rationalizing facility spend by streamlining our locations and data center footprint, consolidating in area sites and exiting subscale facilities. We rationalized 89 first quarter and closed 58 of them for a reduction of 1.2 million square feet. Now collectively, these cost actions generate approximately $140 million in Q1 savings, which puts us on track for the fiscal 2018 synergy targets that we discussed at our Investor Day in March. And as I said, our adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $595 million or 129% of adjusted net income.","Now let me turn to revenue. Now revenue in the first quarter was $5.913 billion on a GAAP basis, and in my comments to follow all year-over-year and sequential comparisons exclude the impact of purchase price accounting. The revenue was down 4.2% year-over-year in constant currency and was flat sequentially on a GAAP basis. Total bookings in the first quarter were $6.3 billion representing a book-to-bill of 1.1x.","Now, let me just turn briefly to the results of our three reporting segments; GBS, GIS and USPS. Global Business Services or GBS includes our consulting business, our enterprise cloud applications business, application services, analytics and industry IP and BPS solutions. Global Infrastructure Service or GIS, includes our cloud, workload platforms, and infrastructure technology services business, in addition to our workplace and mobility and security solutions. And U.S. Public Sector, or USPS, includes our work with the Navy, the Marine Corps, federal healthcare, national security, Defense, state and local government and civilian agencies.","Now in the first quarter, GBS's revenue was $2.3 billion. GBS's revenue was down 3.8% year-over-year in constant currency and relatively flat sequentially on a GAAP basis. The year-over-year decline was driven by application services, with roughly half that decline coming from the completion of two large government contracts in the UK. And the other half was a result of small projects and other small non-standard add-on work that were impacted by the integration and launch of DXC.","In the first quarter, we grew enterprise cloud apps, consulting and analytics which partially offset the softness in the application services business. GBS bookings of $2.4 billion grew 24% year-over-year, representing a book-to-bill of 1.1x, as compared to 1.0x last year. The GBS segment margin was 12.4%. This was up 130 basis points year-over-year and up 25 points sequentially, reflecting again the impact of our cost takeout actions.","In the first quarter, GIS revenue was $3 billion. GIS revenue was down 4.7% year-over-year in constant currency and down 1.6% sequentially on a GAAP basis. This revenue decline was driven by continued run-off in the traditional data center businesses, but the decline on these services slowed to 5% versus 12% per year during fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2017. Also bookings for cloud, workload platforms and ITO were up year-over-year 22% and the GIS bookings of $3.7 billion represented a book-to-bill of 1.2x compared with 1x last year. And the GIS segment margin was 9.8%, up 810 basis points year-over-year and up 260 basis points sequentially. Again, reflecting the cost actions we undertook both within the first quarter and actions leading into the merger. These actions include, as I said, optimizing our workforce, standardizing processes and utilizing operational data mining to drive automation.","In the first quarter, USPS revenue was $677 million. USPS revenue was down 3.5% year-over-year and up 6.8% sequentially. USPS bookings of $184 million represented a book-to-bill of 0.3 compared with 0.9. Our USPS bookings reflect the typical lumpiness of contract award timing in the industry, and also the pull forward of several large deals into the five month period preceding the merger.","Also within the national security segment, we have a contract worth several hundred million dollars that was scheduled to close in the first quarter, but will now most likely close in Q2. If you account for that, the book-to-bill would have been around 1 and the pipeline in USPS is up 11% year-over-year and 52% sequentially. The USPS segment margin was 11.4%, which was up 10 basis points year-over-year and up 150 basis points sequentially.","And DXC continued to expand its client base by adding 421 new logos in the first quarter, with almost 90% of these coming from outside the Americas, and 25 of those deals were greater than $1 million in contract value.","I'll just continue with my third point around digital. Our digital and industry and IP and BPS results again, these are all year-over-year and sequential comparisons exclude the impact of purchase price accounting. And on that basis, our digital revenue was up 13.4% year-over-year in constant currency. And our digital book-to-bill was 1.0x in the quarter. Digital cuts across all three of DXC's reporting segments of GBS, GIS and USPS, and it includes enterprise cloud apps, consulting, security, analytics and cloud.","Enterprise cloud apps and consulting revenue was up 6.3% year-over-year in constant currency. Bookings in this business were up 46% year-over-year representing a book-to-bill of 1.4x. The enterprise cloud apps team is continuing to drive this momentum by launching 13 new quick starts. And as you might recall, these are standardized simplified DXC offerings across SAP, Oracle ServiceNow, Microsoft, Workday and Salesforce. Our alliance with PWC also continues to show positive momentum, with a qualified pipeline now of over $1.3 billion. And we continue to gain share in the ServiceNow market including a recent win with a major healthcare company, which was our largest ServiceNow win to-date.","Cloud revenue was up 26.2% year-over-year in constant currency and bookings were up 140% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 3.4x. The drivers of the growth in bookings included a large strategic transformation renewal with a major consumer package goods company that included DXC's virtual private cloud services and also we had a major new logo win in Europe. And also a long-time valued client, Molson Coors Brewing Company signed a multi-million dollar cloud transformation agreement with DXC.","Analytics was up 34% year-over-year in constant currency with bookings up year-over-year 14% and a book-to-bill of 0.8x. Security revenue was roughly flat year-over-year in constant currency with a book-to-bill in the first quarter of 1.3x. We've growing momentum in the pipeline as customers anticipate the need to meet evolving regulatory requirements and deal with the recent ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya.","Industry IP and BPS includes our IP offerings in healthcare, insurance, travel and transportation and banking as well as our industry business process services business. Industry IP and BPS was down 3.2% year-over-year in constant currency and our industry IP revenue was down 11.7% year-over-year in constant currency, reflecting the completion of a large phase of our NHS contract in July of last year.","However, bookings were up 60% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 0.9x. And our BPS revenue was up 9.5% year-over-year in constant currency with a book-to-bill of 0.3. Revenue growth was driven by the continued ramp up of our large insurance contract such as MetLife and the book-to-bill in the quarter was lower due to a significant contract signing that shifted past quarter end.","Now as I discussed at Investor Day, we're focused on helping clients drive efficiency in their traditional IT and allowing them to reinvest those savings into digital transformation including our digital solutions and services. This model which drives value for and from our base of 6,000 clients continues to gain traction.","In regard to driving efficiencies in our clients cost structures, we're redesigning the way we execute service delivery through a combination of lean, automation, analytics and robotics. These efforts allow us to replace manual tasks with automated scripts in ITO run environments and replace agents with self service tools and capabilities in help desk. This allows us to accelerate digital outcomes for our clients.","Let me just take a moment to illustrate this with a recent win we had in cloud and infrastructure transformation with a leading insurance company. Our client was targeting a 20% reduction in spend as part of a larger cost transformation. And they also wanted to consolidate down from 20 application providers. Now we've won the mandate by bringing together a digital business team that straddle cloud, security, applications and innovation.","We created a transformation roadmap that would modernize their infrastructure, while enabling them to seamlessly integrate new services from numerous providers and support workloads across platforms. Now through this work, we're transforming from a declining traditional ITO business to a more efficient and effective digital business that will allow us to grow the account overall and we anticipate similar opportunities to drive digital change across many of our clients. In the quarter, we're also leading these digital transformations in close collaboration with our partners. In the quarter, we expanded our alliance with Amazon Web Service to offer enterprise clients integrated solution offers. We're training and certifying thousands of consultants and developers in these new solutions.","We're working with Mphasis to accelerate app transformation and modernization for our clients and this collaboration builds on complementary vertical expertise and strong portfolios in next generation IT and automation capabilities. We have a new initiative with AT&T to help clients improve efficiency, productivity and security for cloud based networks across their enterprise. And as part of this initiative, DXC became the first services company to launch a third-party virtual network function based on AT&T FlexWare.","We also extended our current portfolio of offerings for Microsoft Azure with a hybrid cloud solution from our data centers based on the Microsoft Azure stack. And this offering is complemented by a comprehensive set of managed services and backed by a significant expansion in our Azure training.","And to expand our automation capabilities, we are leveraging tools such as VMware DynamicOps, Red Hat Ansible, Arago and IPsoft to automate both simple and complex traditional IT tasks. We're also partnering with companies like Blue Prism for call center and operator automation.","During the quarter, we continued to seek opportunities to grow our offerings and enhance our capabilities. We recently announced the acquisition of Tribridge combined with Eclipse, which we acquired last year as part of UXC, this acquisition makes DXC the largest independent integrator of Microsoft Dynamics globally.","Tribridge is our first acquisition since the formation of DXC Technology and our combined capabilities allow us to offer clients complete end-to-end solutions that build on DXC's strong partnership with Microsoft. And we're also simultaneously committed to making key strategic investments to grow our revenue in subsequent years post-integration. As an example, DXC investment in Virtual Clarity, a leading provider of IT and service transformation, give us exclusive access to more than 200 professionals with significant skills in digital cloud transformation.","Now turning to my 4 point for a wrap-up here and turn it over to Paul, we achieved several key merger integration milestones in the first quarter. We completed the organizational design and talent selection process. We're now fully executing on the Build-Sell-Deliver operating model we discussed at Investor Day. We've implement the first phase of our synergy plan, we're on track to meet our targets of the $1 billion of year 1 cost savings as well as $1.5 billion run rate cost savings exiting fiscal 2018.","Within our build organization, we continued to simplify and rationalize our offering portfolio, focusing on nine offering families and moving from more than 500 separate offerings to now fewer than 300 offerings. And within the sell and deliver organizations, we implemented the new coverage model and successfully transitioned our key accounts with minimal disruption. And as a services business our people are a key pillar of our strategy. While we level set our workforce and solidify our operating model, it's critical that we have the right mix of people with the right skills to serve our clients and to drive innovation and to compete in a very dynamic workplace.","We're investing to enhance and increase the skills, knowledge and capabilities of our global workforce. Over 2,000 go to market leaders have successfully completed our in-depth sales training and certification program, covering all of our offering families and through DXC University, we're fostering ongoing learning and education in essential digital skills, and we're continuing to hire new digital skills and bring them into the company as we continue to remix our workforce. We're also creating a new digital platform to identify and engage new pools of talent in near real-time.","At our Investor Day, I talked about the jump in the number of unincorporated talent now in the services workforce. And to take advantage of this trend, we created the DXC dynamic talent cloud, a smart crowd sourcing platform that enables us to bring new people and skills to DXC as we need them and we're leveraging this platform to fulfill non-standard service requests and established tasks such as testing.","And just to wrap this up, I think in reviewing the progress in the first quarter, DXC is off to a solid start on our comprehensive integration plan. We finalized and established our operating model, we executed on our synergy and capital allocation plans and invested in our people and offerings in line with the framework that we laid out at our Investor Day. And as we said or as I said for fiscal 2018, we're continuing to expect revenue to be in the $24 billion to $24.5 billion in constant currency and we're targeting non-GAAP EPS of $6.50 to $7 and adjusted free cash flow to be greater than a 100% of our adjusted net income.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Paul and then I'll be back to handle any questions. Paul?","Paul N. Saleh - DXC Technology Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Mike, and greetings, everyone. Before I review our first quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to clarify the basis of our financial presentation. First, the pro forma results for Q1 of last year conform with the methodology used in our registration statements on Form S-4 and Form 10, and they are presented as if the merger took effect on April 2 of last year.","As a consequence of CSC and HPES having different fiscal year ends, the pro forma financials represent the combination of CSC on a fiscal year ending March 31 and HPES on a fiscal year end January 31. And on that basis, last year's first quarter results consist of CSC's quarter ending July 1, and HPES's quarter ending April 30, 2016.","Also prior year pro forma non-GAAP results assume a flat quarterly tax rate of 27.5%. Fiscal 2018 first quarter results reflect revenue adjustments for purchase price accounting, whereas the prior year pro forma does not. Non-GAAP results exclude restructuring, integration and amortization of intangibles consistent with CSC's non-GAAP methods from prior years. And finally, segment results now include Global Business Services, our Global Infrastructure Services and U.S. Public Sector.","Now, let me cover some items that are included in our GAAP results this quarter. In the current quarter, we had restructuring costs of $190 million pre-tax or $0.50 per diluted share. These costs represent severance costs related to workforce optimization program and expense associated with facilities and data center rationalization. Also in the quarter, we had $124 million pre-tax or $0.29 per diluted share of integration and transaction costs. Those includes integration planning, and advisory fees associated with the merger and other acquisitions. The first quarter amortization of acquired intangibles was $120 million pre-tax or $0.26 per diluted share.","Now excluding the impact of these special items, adjusted EBIT was $679 million and our non-GAAP EPS was $1.59, which compares with adjusted EBIT of $310 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.61 in the prior year.","Now, let's cover some of our first quarter results. Revenue in the quarter was $5.913 billion on a GAAP basis. Purchase price accounting reduced revenue in the quarter by $120 million, representing a write-down of deferred revenue. For the fiscal year, we expect a revenue reduction of $335 million from purchase price accounting.","Excluding PPA, revenue was down 4.2% year-over-year in constant currency and flat sequentially. EBIT in the quarter was $679 million after adjusting for restructuring, integration and amortization of intangibles. Adjusted EBIT margin on that basis was 11.5%, up from 4.8% in the prior year and up 375 basis points sequentially.","Adjusted EBIT in the quarter included a $75 million FX gain from the conversion of a dollar denominated foreign legal holding entity into local currency. Now, this gain contributed about a 127 basis point to adjusted EBIT margin. Improvement in our adjusted EBIT performance year-over-year reflects cost actions we've taken consistent with the synergy plan outlined at Investor Day.","This includes four major type of actions; policy alignment, workforce optimization, supply chain efficiency, and facilities rationalization. In policy alignment, we've implemented tighter travel policies that reduce travel demand, also harmonize healthcare, health insurance benefit and device management policies across the company.","And collectively these policy actions drove net savings of $10 million in the quarter and that is compared with the run rate exiting our fourth quarter. Workforce optimization drove major savings in the quarter contributing about $60 million of net savings. We increased spans of control across the organization, particularly in deliver where spans is approaching 25 to 28 on average, and we'll also reduce management layers from 11 to 7 in deliver, and from 10 to 6 in our support functions.","We're accelerating our bionics programs to automate manual task, while improving service quality. We've aligned our corporate functions to top quartile benchmarks including a significant shift to nearshore and offshore low cost locations. These efforts are consistent with our plan to optimize our labor footprint.","Our low cost labor mix was 52% at the end of the quarter. We're also executing on supply chain plans to extract greater efficiencies from procurement spend. We implemented a tight gating process with more stringent thresholds, approval requirements, and review criteria. Now this helps ensure compliance with procurement policies, while maintaining a streamlined process to meet demand. We're able to leverage our new scale to drive additional rate reductions for both third-party labor and non-labor expense, and we renegotiated agreements with our top strategic suppliers. Now collectively, we realized over $50 million in net savings in the quarter.","In facilities, we're focused on consolidating in metro locations, exiting sites with low utilization, exiting sites to support labor migration and rationalization of our data center footprints. During the first quarter, we closed 58 sites and consolidated an additional 31 sites for a reduction of 1.2 million square feet, and this represents a 7% reduction in our real estate footprint, and net savings of $25 million. In summary, policy harmonization, workforce optimization, supply chain actions and facilities rationalization drove over $140 million net savings in the first quarter.","Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operation in the first quarter was $1.59 compared with $0.61 in the prior year. In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 23%, reflecting our global mix of income and the discrete benefit of a change in deferred tax assets in some foreign jurisdictions. We still expect non-GAAP tax rate to be 25% to 30% for the full year, which implies a higher tax rate in the remaining quarters. Booking in the quarter was $6.3 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.1 time.","Now turning to our segment results, Global Business Services revenue was $2.3 billion in the quarter, excluding the impact of purchase price accounting of $21 million. GBS revenue was down 3.8% year-over-year in constant currency, and relatively flat sequentially. In the first quarter, GBS segment profit was $282 million and profit margin was 12.4%, up 130 basis point from the prior year and up 25 basis points sequentially as we benefited from cost takeout actions in the business. GBS bookings were $2.4 billion in the quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 times.","Turning now to Global Infrastructure Services, revenue was $3 billion in the quarter, excluding the impact of purchase price accounting of $93 million. GIS revenue was down 4.7% year-over-year in constant currency and down 1.6% sequentially. During the quarter, GIS profit was $290 million and profit margin was 9.8%, up 810 basis points from the prior year and up 260 basis points sequentially, reflecting ongoing cost actions to drive greater operating efficiencies, as well as synergy realizations from the merger. And booking in GIS were $3.7 billion in the quarter for a book-to-bill of 1.2 times, reflecting successful renewals and new work.","Turning now to our U.S. public sector business, revenue was $677 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting of $5 million, USPS revenue was down 3.5% year-over-year and up 6.8% sequentially. Year-over-year revenue decline was due to timing of revenue recognition when compared with Q1 of last year. USPS segment profit was $77 million in the quarter and profit margin on that basis was 11.4%, up 10 basis point from the prior year and up 150 basis points sequentially. Our book-to-bill for USPS were $184 million in the quarter, for a book-to-bill of 0.3 times, reflecting the lumpiness of contract award timing in the public sector.","Turning to other financial highlights for the quarter, adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $595 million, or 129% of adjusted net income. This reflects better working capital management with an increased focus on collections and improved vendor terms. Adjusted free cash flow excludes proceeds from receivables securitization program. Our CapEx was $255 million in the quarter or 4.3% of revenue, reflecting tight controls on capital spending and a continued shift to capital-light strategy.","Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.5 billion. Our total debt was $7.5 billion, and our net debt to capitalization was 24.9%. During the quarter we returned $35 million of capital to our shareholders, $20 million in dividend and $19 million in share repurchase.","Now in closing, let me review our financial targets for fiscal 2018. We continue to target revenue for the fiscal year to be $24 billion to $24.5 billion in constant currency. Our full-year target for non-GAAP EPS remain $6.50 to $7, our EPS target continues to assume a tax rate of 25% to 30% for the full year, which implies a higher tax rate in the remaining quarters. However, we're continuing to work on tax planning strategies to optimize our effective tax rate for the full year. Our adjusted free cash flow target for fiscal 2018 remains a 100% plus of adjusted net income.","And I'll now hand the call back to the operator for our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll now take our first question from Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Caller, please check your mute function. Once again, caller please check your mute function.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","We may want to go to the next question.","Operator","And with no response, we'll now take our next question from Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Arvind Anil Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Very impressive results. Can you help us understand the puts and takes that'll enable you all to come in at the upper end of your guidance range?","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","Well, as we said Arvind, we successfully implemented the synergy plan that we talked about, and we got $140 million of net savings in the quarter. That was a huge contributor. We had a slightly lower tax rate, 23% versus the 27% or 28%. And we had an FX gain with the conversion to local currency. So, that coupled with the fact that we saw a moderation in the revenue decline, particularly in our ITO businesses, I mentioned drove the better EPS performance and also help drive the margin expansion that we talked about.","Arvind Anil Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And just a follow-up on that, you had operational control of HPE Services for about five months, and kind of beyond just this quarter, what has been surprising to you either positively or negatively?","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","No. I think, there's a lot of positives there, a lot of great people with a lot of great skills in HPES, which has been a tremendous infusion to us. Tremendous install base, I mean, the clients are very loyal clients, and very much are looking for our services, not only our traditional services, but also our new digital services and you saw that in our book-to-bills with our digital business and the growth in our digital business. So, I think that has all been real positive and frankly the other positive is by combining these two companies, we have been able to drive significant cost opportunities and you're seeing that show up in the results. So, it's all about people. It's all about our clients. It's about the scale and that scale allows us to drive the efficiencies and leverage that scale to help our clients on their digital transformation journey. And then we've been \u2013 we have a tremendous network of partners. I just mentioned a couple things we've done with Amazon and Microsoft and others. But our partners give us a complete independent approach to our clients and bringing the best solutions to our clients. And I think that is appreciated and is one of the real benefits of the merger.","Arvind Anil Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just one last one, if I could squeeze in. When I look at the IT services space, there are really only two independent companies, you and Accenture that are well over $20 billion in revenue, and when I \u2013 if I put on the head of a software company's CEO, I think you guys are a company that really need to partner with, and form some deep relationships, do you feel that's the driver? Are you finding kind of your conversations with the software product companies a lot easier now that you have this kind of scale? Thank you.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","I think the scale, Arvind, does make it more attractive to many of these partners. But I got to tell you that this is in our DNA. This is in our DNA. We want to utilize the enormous R&D investment that these companies make. We leverage that R&D. We integrate that R&D into offerings like our digital workplace offerings or our analytics offerings or our hybrid cloud offerings, you name it.","So, this is what we're all about is taking the best capability, the industry has to offer, bringing that together to our partners and then delivering that to our clients in an end-to-end solution. And yes, I think the increased scale, Arvind, makes that a very attractive proposition for not only our partners, but also for our own team as well as our clients. Okay, Arvind, that's...","Arvind Anil Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Good luck.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks, good afternoon. Thanks for the update. Just I guess on the book-to-bill that was a pleasant surprise of 1.1, I was curious if that's sustainable, if there was any kind of burst potentially in bookings coming out the gate as a combined co, if there's any callouts beyond the digital health on book-to-bill?","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","No, I think, it was sort of business as usual. I think, the most important observation is that we put two pretty big companies together and launched it, and we didn't see the disruption, we didn't see the disruption in our service delivery, which is critical. And we saw the sales engine continue to go and this against the backdrop of changing our coverage model, also changing our sales composition to a compensation to focus much more on in-year revenue.","So, these were some big fundamental changes that we made and if we look out over the balance of the year, we continue to see a very good pipeline of very large deals. We see a great set of new logos. So, I think this very detailed hands on operational approach to integration allowed us to continue to operate the machine as we pulled this all together.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good. Just quick follow-up, just any change in thinking on the revenue dis-synergies given your comments there, Mike?","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","No, I think we're still in the early innings here of this year. So, I wouldn't make any changes to what we talked about at our Investor Day.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Nice job guys. Thanks. When considering the cadence of earnings for the year, per quarter, I'm pretty sure you guys said in the past, there would be a sequential ramp in EPS and actually driven by the synergy timing as well as the year progressed. You started off higher than us on EPS and I think synergies drove the beat.","Can you just talk to the timing now, is the $140 million of synergies a sign that you could exit the year, keep running at a year, end up more than $1 billion, maybe even exit higher than the $1.5 billion, what you anticipated. And then just give us some color on the expected earnings cadence for the year? Thanks guys.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","Yeah. Listen, I'll let Paul respond to this, I'll give you my perspective. We did have a couple benefits in the quarter, we talked about that. We had an FX gain and we had slightly lower tax rate. So, I think it's important not to get too far out in front here. So it's a very solid quarter, we executed our synergies plan, $140 million is good. So you multiply that out by four and you get a number and there is more synergies that we're going to get incrementally in the second quarter that would be repeated three times and there will be more synergies in the third quarter so on and so forth. So, I think, it's \u2013 I think it will be premature to talk about a change to the targets that we've outlined. I think the important point here is we are executing as we said we're going to execute and this was a good first data point against that plan. And in terms of EPS, I think the EPS is going to largely track the way we laid it out at the Investor Day.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","Paul, anything you want to add to that?","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I mean, Paul, just the timing, if you don't mind.","Paul N. Saleh - DXC Technology Co.","No, I think, it is \u2013 so I would expect the second quarter to maybe look pretty much like this one, maybe a little bit less when you exclude the improvement in our synergies in the second quarter, we'll offset some of the benefit we had in the first quarter from the FX. We had $75 million in our results, but net-net, you're going to continue to see every quarter an expansion in margins across all the businesses and you were going to see basically our EPS pick up particularly you'll see the ramp in the third quarter and fourth quarter.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And just one follow-up on the revenue side now. I mean, the GBS and GIS revenue came in I think better than our expectations. The growth trend seem to be low to mid single digit negative, which is great versus what I think we were expecting for this quarter. The one question is, on the industry IP you called out, I think you said the book to bill was 0.7 and the growth, if remember I correctly, you said was negative, right. You may have mentioned timing, there was a lot of moving parts in the prepared remarks. Can you just give us some color? I mean, that was an area that beyond just digital, which is obviously doing well, I guess, we were wanting to see strength in was again the industry IP part of the business. Can you talk about expectations there?","Paul N. Saleh - DXC Technology Co.","Yeah. The primary driver of the industry IP is our healthcare business and our insurance business. That's where we have a largest software install base and in our healthcare business, we did wrap around a significant completion of the NHS contract, that was the bulk of the decline.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. Okay.","Paul N. Saleh - DXC Technology Co.","The reason I called out the book-to-bill, is we saw reasonably good book-to-bill in the quarter which is very important as we move forward. We're seeing a lot of innovation around our IP capital and assets. I mean, for example, we took I think another one or two trusts live in the UK and we are working on some new contracts with NHS to continue the momentum. That big NHS contract at some point in time is going to end, it did end and now we're rebuilding through smaller transactions. Likewise in our insurance business, we got a great portfolio of insurance assets and we're continuing to drive that. Our Xchanging acquisition last year continues to deliver against the expectations that we set forth.","So, yeah, I think, we're planning to see that industry IP business grow as we go through the year. So that coupled with our digital portfolio is what we think will drive the growth. Our BPS, particularly our industry BPS is showing good growth, I mean, 9.5%. So, I mean, we signed a lot of these deals last year they're coming on stream now. We took another major insurance company live four weeks ago, that is now enabling some other opportunities in the pipeline. So, I think this is again a good first step, it's a data point, and we're largely tracking with what we outlined at the Investor Day.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Makes sense, guys. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, if you talked about the $1 billion in year one synergies, I think, at the Investor Day, you talked about workforce and supply chain being about $700 million of that and Paul thanks for sharing the color on the progress in the first quarter. As we think about the cadence for Q2, can you give us any kind of sense about what to expect there? Is it something that we should be expecting kind of to get to the $250 million range? Or any color there will be helpful.","Paul N. Saleh - DXC Technology Co.","Yeah, I think you're pretty close to the number, we'll see certainly is it somewhere in the $75 million, $80 million of additional actions. And many of them coming in again from the permanent combination of procurement and labor savings. But labor saving is not just workforce optimization. We're looking at converting some of our external labor where it makes sense particularly in certain skill set and particularly in certain geography.","At the same time we're continuing to use automation as an opportunity to just really drive greater efficiencies in our labor force, and that is not just in high cost market, that's also showing up in our low-cost markets. And the other thing that's a great opportunity for us that we're just really starting to embark on is the pyramid. working just making sure that we've had the first phase of management layer elimination, but we have still to continue to attract younger talent in the right location and continue to develop the talent that we have and give them opportunity to expand their capabilities.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","Yeah. I think that's a good answer, Jim. I mean it's not a small deal to remove four layers of management in 90 days. And what we have found, and this goes back to the first question that Arvind asked, is we did find a fair amount of overlap. That was the working thesis behind the merger of the two companies that there were significant synergies there. And I think the key point is we are finding those synergies. We're executing fairly expeditiously against those, while at the same time, while at the same time investing in the future. So we're making a big investment in automation and what we called bionics. So that investment is being made. We're making a big investment in nearshore. So we're taking a look at building a low-cost delivery center in the United States that would support not only our commercial business, but our USPS business.","We had a very strong graduate recruiting program this year. So we're bringing in a lot of kids. We're looking at internships and co-op programs and investing in training and re-skilling of our people. So I don't want anybody to think this is just about taking costs out. I mean, we took quite a few people out in the first quarter, but we also hired 6,000 people in the first quarter, 6,000, okay. And we need to do that to continue to refresh the workforce. So there is a lot of activities here, Jim, and you can see there is a lot to execute against, but we feel pretty comfortable that we have got a handle on the plan and we're going to continue execute.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful color. And then maybe going to the revenue side for a second, I think, Mike, you outlined, well first of all, at your Analyst Day you talked about the traditional down 4% to 7% long-term, industry and BPS up 7% to 10%, and digital up 25% to 30% over the coming years. You talked about some of the reasons for the industry and BPS coming in a little bit below that with the NHS contract runoff, but can you maybe talk about how you build the trajectory of a digital business, go into that kind of mid-20s growth rate over time? Is that going to be a mix of acquisitions plus the new bookings you mentioned in the prepared remarks, or how should we think about getting to that goal?","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","I think it's all the above, Jim. So when we talked about the revenue model, we talked about a dis-synergy and the normal price downs, and frankly we don't see anything that differs from what we talked about Investor Day. And we talked about growing the digital platforms significantly. We look out at our pipelines. We look at the opportunities. We look at the growth in the industry. We think that is certainly within the range that we talked at Investor Day and I explained the industry IP stuff, but we're bullish on that as we look out over the next year or two.","Furthermore, I said that half of this growth would come from organic growth and another half of it would come through acquisitions. Well, in the first quarter we made an important acquisition, Tribridge, which gives us now a very strong position in the growing Microsoft Dynamics marketplace. So we'll see that begin to kick in as we go forward. And we continue to make investments around ServiceNow, and that franchise. So it's a combination of all those factors. One quarter you can say, well gee, this was 2% less and this was 3% more. It is the overall trend line which we see in our pipelines, we see in the growth of market, we see through the visibility of our partner pipelines as well as our own pipelines.","And the acceptance of some of our offerings. So we get more and more confident when we take an offering, we take that in, we get it installed and then we can scale that. Likewise with our automation play, so we started to automate some of our call centers. We started in the United States and now we know what we can drive, what kind of productivity can we drive. Well, then the next step, is you take that to all the call centers on a global basis. So that's the methodical way we are approaching this, to minimize disruption to our client and to do this in a more of a planned orderly way.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Keith Bachman with BMO.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, Mike and Paul. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to return to the bookings again. They were, as I think a previous caller mentioned, very strong. Just to clarify, Paul, there was no PPA adjustments in the bookings, was there?","Paul N. Saleh - DXC Technology Co.","No.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And so Mike, as you look out, as you think about not only the book-to-bill, but also the growth rate of bookings, would you anticipate that you can actually grow those bookings on a year-over-year basis throughout the year?","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","Yeah. That's the objective.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","I mean, we've got...","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Because if that happens, at the Analyst Day, you commented that even the following year, there might be some revenue weakness given putting \u2013 still putting the two companies together. But if you're growing your bookings year-over-year, wouldn't the conclusion be that perhaps that revenue weaknesses will be less than you thought?","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","Well, you got to be careful in the bookings, because the bookings include recompetes, okay? And then the recompete is usually booking at a lower rate.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","So, you have to be very careful about that. Well \u2013 this is why we moved our sales force and the compensation of our sales force fundamentally to in-year revenue, because the in-year revenue over time, and I don't have the confidence yet to report that, because we don't have any history on it yet, I want to see how this plays out a couple of quarters. But we are really refocusing our sales force either into incremental revenue associated with the recompletes, and I took you through the example of the large insurance company where we didn't recompete, we signed up the ITO at a lower rate, but had the opportunity to grow our business primarily through the application side.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","That's what we're doing.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","That's how we re-orient the sales force. But I got to tell you it's still a little early. The other thing we're doing is, we're focusing on more and more smaller deals. So we have 421, whatever the number was new logos, 25 of those were $1 million or more. But that suggest that over 400 of them were less than $1 million.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","So the strategy is to bring in new clients. We have a great set of offerings, get those offerings installed and then begin to grow off of that base. That is a whole different model than just going around looking for big ITO outsourcing deals. And this is very consistent with how our clients are approaching digital transformation. They are not doing big bangs in digital transformation. What our advantage is we can come in and use our install base, our ITO install base and leverage that. In other words, help them free up money that they can reinvest in digital programs.","And all we're asking for is for them to invest in our digital platforms as they continue down their digital transformation and then price ain't where you want it. But the good news is, is we're starting to see that actually happen. I talked about what we did three or four of these in the first quarter. Now if we can scale that on a global basis. Then, yeah, then it's time to talk about, gee, the book-to-bills could lead to revenue growth.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","Okay. Operator, one more call.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Fair enough, and it certainly seems like you are off to a good start. But, Paul, just one last one and I'll cede the floor. Is there any notion, I asked about this at Analyst Day. You provided non-GAAP target hasn't moved $6.50 to $7. Do you feel like you are in a position where you could also give us a GAAP number at some point so we could compare the targets for FY 2018?","Paul N. Saleh - DXC Technology Co.","I think as the year progresses, we may be in a little bit of better position to do that because as you can imagine the PPA is still not complete. We have a quite a bit of work to do you'll see in our filing that we still have to review all of the leases for example, to make sure that they are properly valued. So I think, as things stabilize, I think we'll be able to just provide you with that stuff.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","Yeah. And I just want to also just take the time to compliment Paul and the financial team. I got to tell something. This meaning, the results are good and all that stuff. I mean, there is a lot of work that goes into this. I mean, we had multiple financial systems, that had to all be consolidated, purchase price accounting, capital leases, operating leases, this that going through currencies, legal structures. I mean, these guys have worked their tail off to get to a point where we could close the quarter, report it and learn from it, so that we can streamline our operations going forward. But this was no small feat to get this integrated and launched as we did.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. It sounds like it. Thank you, guys.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take our last question from Ivan Hollman with Morgan Stanley.","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","Hey, Ivan you've got a bad mute button.","Operator","Caller please, check your mute function. And the caller has removed themselves from the queue, would you like to take one more question?","John Michael Lawrie - DXC Technology Co.","No. I think, that's it. I just want to wrap up and just thank everyone for their time and interest in DXC. I also want to thank, Neil. Neil has been with us several years and he will be moving on and welcome Jonathan to the role of Head of IR. So, again, Neil thank you, and Jonathan welcome. And to everyone on the call.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jonathan Ford, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Jonathan Ford","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased you're joining us for DXC Technology's Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. Our speakers on today's call will be Mike Lawrie, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer. The call is being webcast at dxc.com\/investorrelations, and we posted slides to our website, which will accompany the discussion today.","Slide 2 informs our participants that DXC Technology's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release, as well as in our supplemental slides, both documents are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.","On Slide 3, you'll see that certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. I'd like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call except as required by law.","And now I'd like to introduce DXC Technology's Chairman, President and CEO, Mike Lawrie.","Mike Lawrie","Okay, thank you, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking the time with us. As usual, I have four\/five key points which I will develop a little bit and then turn it over to Paul, and then we will open it up to any questions that you have.","First, non-GAAP EPS in the second quarter was $2.02, adjusted EBIT was $799 million, and adjusted EBIT margin was 15.9%, and we generated $604 million of adjusted free cash flow in the second quarter. Revenue in the second quarter was $5.013 billion on a GAAP basis; in constant currency revenue was down 6.2% year-over-year, and roughly $200 million below our expectations for the quarter. The two primary causes were slower ramp-up on a few large digital contracts and a decline in our application and maintenance management business, and I'll talk more about each of these in a moment. The book-to-bill was 0.9x for the quarter.","Third point, in constant currency our digital revenue grew 6.4% year-over-year, and 2.5% sequentially reflecting the slower ramp-up on a few large digital contracts. Bookings in the quarter were up 50% year-over-year for book-to-bill of 1.8x. Our industry IP and BPS revenue was down 2.1% year-over-year and up 1.7% sequentially, and the industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 1.1x. At the end of the second quarter we completed the acquisition of Molina Medicaid Solutions, a Medicaid management information systems business; and we will continue to execute on our margin improvement plan and now expect to deliver $575 million savings this year versus our original target of $400 million, and I'll talk more about our margin improvement plans in a moment.","And finally, we now expect to have $300 million of currency headwinds for the full year and combined with the revenue shortfall this quarter and the delays on digital contracts, we're revising our revenue guidance for the full year to a range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion. And given the progress we're making our cost takeout plans, we're raising our non-GAAP EPS target to a range of $7.95 to $8.20, and we continue to target adjusted free cash flow of 90% or more of adjusted net income. Now let me just briefly go into each of those five points.","Our second quarter non-GAAP EPS as I said was $2.02 and the effective tax rate was 23.5%. Second quarter adjusted EBIT was $799 million, the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.9%, this was up 230 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially. GBS segment profit margin was 18.9%, this was up 290 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially. In GIS, profit margin was 16.3%, and this was up 200 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially. The margin improvement reflects continued execution of the savings lever that we previously discussed, including workforce optimization, supply chain efficiencies and facilities rationalization. And as I said, adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $604 million, or 105% of adjusted net income, and for the year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $925 million or 81% of adjusted net income.","Now onto revenue; as I said, revenue in the second quarter was $5.013 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 6.2% year-over-year, and the book-to-bill was 0.9x. As I mentioned, revenue was roughly $200 million below our expectations for the quarter. First, we saw delays in the ramp-up of a few large digital contracts. Now while we continue to see strong market demand for our digital solutions, it is taking us longer than expected to bring on resources to support the digital growth. Several clients were also behind and scaling their digital transformations; together these delays impacted revenue in the quarter by roughly a $100 million. And to accelerate our higher, we're creating a dedicated digital hiring engine. Since DXC's launch we've had a significant focus on synergy realization and cost takeout, and as a result, we had very limited bench. Now that we've been still the more disciplined cost and labor management process, we're building bench in our fastest growing capabilities to rapidly staff digital contracts and accelerate revenue. On the client side, we're leveraging Bionix to generate savings in other parts of the business that can be used upon accelerated digital transformations.","The second reason for our $200 million revenue miss was the decline in our application maintenance and management business. This business missed expectations by roughly $80 million. The miss was largely driven by reduction in application maintenance spend in several large accounts, particularly in the Americas, including HPE as these clients remix their IT investments. Now adjusting for this miss in the previously disclosed ramp down of integration projects for HPE and HPI, the Americas business was down about 3.5% year-over-year and was up 3% sequentially. Now we're taking steps to improve performance in these businesses, we recently made leadership changes in both, our Americas region and global application services business, and we also added applications sales specialists in the Americas to more effectively identify and pursue add-on projects. And we believe these actions will drive sequential growth in the second half of the year.","In the second quarter, GBS revenue was $2.1 billion, down 7% year-over-year and constant currency. The year-over-year decline was driven by the completion of transformation projects with HPE and the traditional application services business I just discussed. GBS book-to-bill in the quarter was 1x.","GIS revenue in the quarter was $2.9 billion. GIS revenue was down 5.7% year-over-year in constant currency reflecting the expected decline in the traditional business but less offset from cloud growth. Cloud had a very strong bookings in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 2.2x, and was up 37% year-over-year and 99% sequentially. Now giving this bookings, we expect GIS revenue to return to more normal levels moving forward. Overall, GIS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9x.","Now we move on to our digital business and our industry IP and BPS results. In constant currency, digital revenue was up 6.4% year-over-year, again reflecting the slower ramp-up on a few digital contracts that I mentioned earlier. Bookings in the quarter were very strong with a 1.8x book-to-bill driven by our cloud infrastructure and digital workplace offerings. Our digital pipeline is also up more than 80% year-over-year and 50% sequential, which reflects the strong demand we're seeing for these capabilities. Our security business continues to gain traction with 9.8% growth in constant currency year-over-year, and 1.4x book-to-bill. Bookings in the quarter include a risk automation solution for a large Australian bank where we're working with the bank to identify risk in the digital domain and we're developing predictive risk models integrate with the banks existing enterprise risk solutions. We're also investing to more tightly integrate security and operations automation as part of platform DXC. This addresses strong client demand for security orchestration and automated response and solutions.","In digital workplace we grew 25% constant currency with a 4x book-to-bill. Bookings in the quarter included large deals with the UK Administry of Defense and a European energy provider. Enterprise cloud apps in consulting grew 6.6% year-over-year, and was impacted by the client delays that I previously discussed. Bookings in the quarter were strong with a book-to-bill of 1.3x. Now we continue to leverage our QuickStarts offerings to rapidly diagnose client environments and develop large-scale transformation roadmaps. Key wins in the quarter include an Oracle deal with the new South Wales Ministry of Health, a ServiceNow deal with a major aerospace client, and an SAP deal with a large European railway. In constant currency, cloud infrastructure grew 1.9% in the quarter. Lower year-over-year growth reflects a strong second quarter last year, including a large non-recurring deal. Sequentially, we grew 5.6% and bookings in the quarter were up 37% for a book-to-bill of 2.2x including multiple deals larger than $100 million in the U.S., Germany and UAE. In constant currency, cloud infrastructure, as I said was up 1.9% in the quarter.","Now moving to industry IP and BPS; this revenue was down 2.1% year-over-year and constant currency driven primarily by delays in a few healthcare and insurance contracts including deals with health agencies in Queensland and Norway. Second half revenue will also benefit from revenue ramping on some of our BPS life insurance contracts including Brighthouse. We continue to invest in our digital portfolio; for example, in response to the rapidly growing need to accelerate the migration of data and analytics to the cloud, we establish the industry's first analytics migration factory for Microsoft Azure in Bangalore. DXC's dedicated Azure factory and Azure certified teams help clients achieve faster, more efficient cloud migrations which rapidly implementing new applications with innovative tools and integrated pre-billed analytics and AI services. We plan to establish two additional analytics migration factories in Warsaw and Manila by the end of December.","Now my fourth point, last month we completed the acquisition of Molina Medicaid Solutions from Molina Healthcare. This expands our business supporting state agencies in the administration of Medicaid programs and edge to our healthcare IP portfolio. Combining the Molina business with DXC's existing platforms will provide opportunities for us to expand the margins in the business while enhancing the services we can provide to state agencies and Medicaid recipients. We also recently announced the acquisition of argodesign, a digital design consultancy based in Austin. argodesign will enhance DXC's capabilities in inner-phase design and user experience which are key elements in developing and delivering digital transformation solutions at scale. DXC will build on argo's designs -- world-class design talent as part of it's services portfolio to accelerate and lead client digital transformations.","And yesterday, we announced two acquisitions; BusinessNow and TESM which will further expand our industry leading ServiceNow practice. BusinessNow is a global end-to-end, the ServiceNow now partner and TESM is the largest independent ServiceNow partner in the Nordics. These acquisitions will further enable our clients to leverage ServiceNow as a foundation for enterprise wide digital transformation. And working together DXC and ServiceNow deliver a broad range of cloud-based as a service solutions that extend beyond IT service management to risk and compliance, as well as human capital management.","Now as I mentioned, we continue to execute on our margin improvement plan, and now expect to deliver $575 million in savings for the year versus our original target of $400 million. In addition, we believe we can drive 250 basis points to 350 basis points of further margin expansion by fiscal '22 versus our current margin of 15.9%. Our automation program, Bionix, drives significant savings for DXC and our clients, while also improving service levels. Our automated digital workforce is now responsible for resolving more incidence than our largest physical delivery center, and where deployed we're exceeding 99% of our service level agreements and driven a 40% reduction in alpha [ph] or high priority incidence.","Our labor mix in pyramid, we expect to shift roughly 10% of our workforce to near shore and low cost centers and we plan to improve our labor pyramid by 10 points as well. We'll continue executing similar efficiency improvements in our third-party labor spend, as well as actions to reduce non-labor expense. We're standardizing and optimizing specifications to reduce hardware costs and lower maintenance spend, and we also continue to consolidate vendors to increase scale and drive more favorable rates. And in facilities, we will optimize our data center footprint and drive greater asset utilization. We'll also continue to exit low utilization and subscale facilities and we're leveraging our talent cloud to further decrease our needs for fiscal locations. Now we'll provide more detail on each of these levers and our margin expansion plan at our Investor Day on Thursday.","Now just to conclude before I turn this over to Paul, we now, as I said earlier, expect to have $300 million of currency headwind for the full year. And combined with the revenue shortfall this quarter and the delays on some digital contracts, we're revising our revenue guidance for the full year to arrange a $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion. Our cost takeout actions are mitigating the impact of this revenue decline. Given the progress we're making on cost takeout, as I said, we're raising our non-GAAP EPS target to a range of $7.95 to $8.20, and we expect adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul and then come back when we get to the question period. Paul?","Paul Saleh","Thank you, Mike, and greetings, everyone. I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results this quarter.","In the current quarter, we had restructuring costs of $157 million pretax or $0.41 per diluted share. These costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs, particularly in complex countries, and expense associated with facilities and data center rationalization. Also in the quarter, we had $128 million pretax or $0.34 per diluted share of integration, separation and transaction-related costs reflecting the cost of the IT systems separation from legacy THE [ph]. Year-to-date restructuring, integration and transaction costs amounted to $540 million pretax or $1.43 per diluted share. In the second quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $132 million pretax or $0.35 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $749 million, and our non-GAAP EPS was $2.02.","Now let me turn to our second quarter results in more detail. GAAP revenue in the second quarter was $5.013 billion. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $799 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.9% compared with 13.6% in the prior year. Now this year-over-year improvement reflects the progress we're making in executing on our cost takeout and synergy plans.","During the second quarter, we continued to optimize our workforce. We further reduced total headcount by over 2,000 people driven by the ongoing deployment of Bionix, overhead rationalization, and elimination of the stranded cost associated with our USPS business. In supply chain, we are driving additional procurement efficiencies, we're rationalizing our software portfolio, and standardizing around a few partner solutions. We're also benefiting in the quarter from the consolidation of enterprise license agreements, and we're opportunistically and sourcing contract labor for strategic capabilities that align with our long-term demand.","Now turning to real estate; we eliminated an additional 700,000 square feet of office space during the quarter, and we remain on-track to rationalize nine data centers during the fiscal 2019. Now in total, these actions contributed $100 million of incremental synergies during the second quarter. We're now on-track to deliver $575 million of cost takeout for the year versus our original target of $400 million. The incremental savings will help us offset the impact of the revised revenue guidance. Now we remain on-track to reinvest roughly $200 million to $250 million in the business this fiscal year. These investments include the continued deployment of Bionix, expansion of our digital transformation centers and the buildout of our integrated practice with Amazon web services.","In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 23.5%, reflecting our global mix of income and certain tax attributes in key foreign jurisdictions. With the full year, we still expect a tax rate of 24% to 28% as we continue to work through the impact of U.S. tax reform.","Now let's turn to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.11 billion in the second quarter. GBS segment profit was $400 million, and our profit margin was 18.9%, compared with 16% in the prior year. GBS margin improvements reflect cost takeout actions, including productivity gains on our fixed price contracts, consolidation of our vendor base, and the insourcing of contract labor. Year-to-date GBS revenue was $4.3 billion, segment profit was $803 million, margin was 18.6%, and bookings were $4.2 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.","GIS revenue was $2.9 billion in the quarter. GIS segment profit in the second quarter was $473 million, and profit margin was 16.3%, up 200 basis point year-over-year. This profitability improvement reflects the impact of actions we've taken to drive greater operating efficiencies, from the rollout of our Bionix program, as well as the benefit from consolidated suppliers, and lower range on enterprise licenses. Year-to-date, GIS revenue was $5.97 billion, segment profit was $947 million, margin was 15.9%, and bookings were $5.1 billion for book-to-bill of 0.9x.","Turning to other financial highlights for the quarter; adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $604 million or 105% of adjusted net income. Now this is despite an additional pay cycle in the quarter, and the payout of annual bonuses. Adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact from receivable securitization programs. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $925 million or 81% of adjusted net income. Our CapEx was $308 million in the quarter or 6.1% of revenue, and on a year-to-date basis CapEx was $676 million or 6.6% of revenue. Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion, our total debt was $7 billion including capitalized leases for a net debt to total capitalization ratio of 22.5%.","During the quarter, the company issued two bond offerings in Europe to further rebalance it's debt portfolio, and in the quarter [indiscernible] and Moody's reaffirm their rating for DXC and S&P upgraded it's rating outlook to stable. During the quarter, we paid $54 million in dividend, and repurchased $127 million of shares for a total of $181 million in capital returned to shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned $552 million of capital to our shareholders in the form of $105 million in dividend and $447 million in share repurchases. In the second half for the year, we expect to allocate more of our operating cash flow to shareholders through share repurchase.","So in closing, we've revised our revenue target for the year to $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, reflecting $300 million of currency headwinds. The $200 million revenue shortfall in the quarter Mike just discussed, and an additional $300 million from revised phasing of contracts in our digital and applications business. At the same time, we are raising our targeted EPS range to $7.95 to $8.20 reflecting the progress we're making on our cost takeout programs.","I'll now hand the call back to the operator for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna.","James Friedman","I just wanted to do a housekeeping check; Mike, you were going kind of quick there but I thought you had said, and I apologize if I got this wrong, 250 basis points to 350 basis points of margin expansion. I missed the year, but if that's right, Paul, I'm just coming up with a $6 billion EBITDA numbers. Does that sound in the ballpark?","Mike Lawrie","I said by 2022. So, and we'll talk a little bit more about this Jamie at the Investor Day on Thursday; but the timeframe was -- from today we announced 15.9% margin, and I'm saying there is another 250 basis points to 350 basis points of expansion between now and fiscal 2022.","James Friedman","The challenges on the staffing part of digital are not obviously unique to DXC, it's been a theme throughout the industry. But what I'm hearing is that you're eliminating some contract labor and at the same time increasing your internal headcount, am I hearing that right and is that sort of the direction that you will be going at to address the digital opportunity overtime?","Mike Lawrie","It's two-fold. One, yes, we are reducing some of our external labor spend and using internal resources because it is less expensive to do that, that is point one. Point two, the digital resources or digital skills are certainly harder to come by on a global basis, so what we've put in place is a dedicated hiring machine, number one; number two, we are beginning to hire a head of future demand. So we have been running this very tightly for the last 1.5 year as we have built and integrated workforce management system, as we've taken a lot of cost out. And we now recognize with the demand and you saw in the bookings and the sequential growth, there is substantial demand for digital skill, so we're going to begin to hire our head.","The other thing that we're now scaling is our talent cloud which gives us the ability to source digital talent on a global basis and apply that to many of our digital contract. So it's a combination of remixing some of our traditional skills from outside to inside, and then it's a matter of putting a dedicated focus to hire a head of the demand so we can drive earlier recognition of revenue, particularly around our digital opportunities that are growing quite rapidly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Essex","I was wondering if you could touch on the application management side of the business; was there anything Mike if you could address that your customers -- I guess you pointed to mix in the investments that your customers are seeing. Is that insourcing or something else and is it more short-term or long-term duration in nature?","Mike Lawrie","What we are seeing is in some instances, as clients begin to contemplate upgrades to some of their systems, they are scaling act on the maintenance of those existing systems. And that did cause some of the shortfall, I think it was about $80 million, particularly in the U.S. where we're seeing some substantial plans to upgrade some of the big application platforms that our large clients have. And I cited HPE as an example of that. So that was to be honest a little unplanned on our part, we didn't see that as clearly as we exited the first quarter as we saw throughout this quarter. So I don't see that as widespread, I don't see that as continuing in the future but it did impact this quarter, particularly in the United States.","Brian Essex","Maybe just a quick housekeeping; on total revenue performance -- what was the constant currency performance in the quarter and the FX impact?","Paul Saleh","6.2% down on a constant currency basis, and -- what did you ask for the full year?","Brian Essex","Yes, basically\u2026","Paul Saleh","GAAP basis was 8.1%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jelso [ph] with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Unidentified Analyst","My first question here is, maybe you could just talk a little bit about when you're expecting the business to accelerate? I don't want to take anything away from the Analyst Day but I think there is some concern that top line growth is taking a long time to come through and clearly, this quarter's results would mean that maybe it takes a while for the crossover to happen. So maybe you could talk a little bit about that.","Mike Lawrie","We're going to talk in much greater detail about that on Thursday at the Investor Conference, so I don't want to get into a lot of detail here. But I think there is a couple of things going on; one, the -- what I call the mainstream business, this is basically declining at about the rate that we had projected, some quarters it's less, some quarters it's a little more but basically that's absolutely in line. What we are seeing is a slower ramp on our digital, we're seeing very strong demand and bookings and the numbers here support that. But we're also seeing an elongation from when contracts are signed to when we are recognizing the revenue, and that can be as long as three or four months. Some of that is client initiated, and some of it is us as a result of not being able to staff as quickly.","Now as we -- and as I mentioned, we're putting a lot of focus on hiring, so we can staff some of these contracts more quickly. But in general, I would say the revenue from our digital bookings is coming in a little slower than what we had expected when we started this fiscal year out, and that's what showed up in the revenue performance this quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","The slowness in the revenues; do you believe if that's a structural issue and is that an internal structural issue or do you believe that you might be at a competitive disadvantage and you need to kind of close the loop? I'm just looking for a little bit more color given the premium the markets putting on your ability to grow. Thanks.","Mike Lawrie","I think it's always a combination, I think there are some execution issues on our part, particularly in our application, maintenance and management business. For example, the Americas move through a little bit more of a general sales model, I've concluded that that wasn't working and made some changes, so we've gone back to a more specialist orientation to sales in our applications business, that is really an execution issue, that doesn't have anything to do with the market. No, I don't think we're disadvantaged at all, as a matter of fact, I think what we're seeing is an absolute unique value proposition where we're able to take many of these new digital solutions and we are very experienced in being able to integrate that into the existing IT state, both application, as well as infrastructure.","So I don't view that as disadvantage at all, I view it as a compelling differentiator. I do think that enterprises are moving more slowly as they begin to scale some of these digital investments, so yes, I think that is certainly a DXC issue but it's an industry issue. And that coupled with some of the execution issues, particularly application and maintenance business is -- from my advantage point explains the mist [ph] that we talked about today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","Jim Schneider","I was wondering if you could talk Mike a little bit about relative to some of the revenue shortfalls you saw in the quarter. How much of those you view as transitory? And for the ones you do view as transitory, how quickly you would expect those pieces of revenue to recover back to their prior state? Is that something that's going to be one or two quarter thing or is it going to take longer?","Mike Lawrie","I do think we are projecting and we think we'll stage some improvement beginning in the third quarter. So I think we'll see some sequential growth as we go through the second half of this year. But in this business when you miss by $80 million in our application maintenance business in the second quarter, you don't make that up. Now what you do is, you fix the execution as I mentioned around the sales force and some other things, so that weakness doesn't persist in the out-quarters. And then the ability to staff a little more quickly on some of these large digital project then allows you to recognize the revenue a little more quickly.","So I think the answer to this is yes, we expect improvement in the second half of the year but other than the currency headwinds, I mean it's hard to project exactly what that's going to be. Our estimate right now is about $300 million but that could vary a little bit. Does that answer your question, Jim?","Jim Schneider","It does, thank you. And then maybe as my follow-up, I wanted to just ask -- I know we're going to hear a lot more about the 250 basis points to 350 basis points potential increase in margins over three years at the Analyst Day; but can you maybe just kind of give us a sense of -- maybe the single largest contributor to what's driving that because obviously that's substantially higher than where we are today?","Mike Lawrie","What I've been saying overall, it really revolves around the workforce. It revolves around workforce optimization and I'll tell you at Bionix, I keep saying this over and over again but the results are beginning to come through. We are seeing operating leverage in this business. I don't know if you picked up on my script or not but I mean our digital centers now where we're handling, because we're handling more digital calls than our largest physical center. And while we're not only handling higher volumes, we're seeing serious incidents decline, we're seeing productivity up by 40%. So the biggest contributor to the margin expansion over this timeframe is workforce optimization and the continued work around automation and what we call Bionix.","Now in addition, there will be supply chain efficiencies, we've still got 28 million square feet of real estate around the world which we certainly don't need that much; so there will be continued efficiencies in that arena as well. What you're hearing us today talk about contract workers and bringing some of that in-house and using the talent cloud to offset; all those are contributors to that margin expansion, but we're getting more and more confident in what those levers can drive in terms of margin expansion. And thank God we did this, thank God we invested in all this stuff because it is mitigating the -- some of the execution issues I mentioned on revenue, but also just the slower ramp-up of some of these large digital projects. So we're able to absorb some of that revenue decline by this investment that we've made in automation and other workforce optimization programs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod [ph] with Deep Dive Equity Research.","Unidentified Analyst","Just a couple of clarifications on the revenue growth picture. So, do you feel like your intense focus on cost takeout where you seem to be outperforming your expectations; is that intense focus part of the cause of some of these revenue challenges? And do you feel like if that's the case, there is a cost versus revenue trade-off, are you starting to see an ability to turn the corner on that to sort of mitigate that trade-off?","Mike Lawrie","Listen, we have run -- as I said, we've run our workforce and labor programs very tightly, very tightly; and we're going into this quarter at a very thin bench. And we are now getting more confident in our ability to drive this digital workload and digital growth. The other factor here, Rod, is many of these digital projects -- the sales cycle on these is much shorter. So unlike the old IPO business that could be six months or a year, a lot of these digital projects are measured in two to three months, that puts a whole heck of a lot more pressure on how you are managing your workforce and how you are bringing new people and skills into the business.","So I think it's not so much a trade-off between the cost focus and the digital demand, it's more that we'll need to expand our bench so we can respond more quickly to the demand. There is no question there is demand; I mean when you see the bookings and you see that sequential growth in bookings, this isn't an issue with demand, this is an issue of being able to satisfy that demand.","Unidentified Analyst","And so it sounds like in terms of the route issues that you need to address on the revenue side, in digital, it's staffing, so you just clarified that. In application maintenance, it sounds like it's sales -- it's the sales approach, and these software upgrades had recently caused some disruption in client spending on maintenance work. Are those the two issues in the apps business?","Mike Lawrie","Yes, I think that's well said. We did not see the fall-off in this maintenance business; I didn't see it, maybe Paul did, I didn't. So that took us by surprise, because -- and that's an individual client-by-client what they choose to do as they begin to remix some of their IT investments in preparation for some of these digital projects that they are undertaking, in some cases upgrades to some of their major application. That we did not see, let me be perfectly candid about that. The second thing was we went to a generalist sales model in the United States, and after watching that for two quarters, I concluded that wasn't the right approach. And the reason for that is we were missing some of the add-on work that we would get by having deployed a more specialized application sales force. So we have corrected that and we've gone back, and we've put that dedicated application sales force in place which will allow us to pick up on some of those incremental add-on projects that we didn't get, particularly in this quarter. So those are the two things.","Unidentified Analyst","Final clarification; on the digital side, we talked about the staffing challenge there. Is this a case where you actually have an ability to win a deal and have strong digital growth but the inability to ramp the staffing fast enough actually prevents you from being able to land the deal? In other words, the demand is there, if you could staff it, you'd have more revenues; is that the case?","Mike Lawrie","Yes. I mean, we're winning a lot of deals, that's clear; but what's happening to our book-to-bill and pipelines and everything else, all of those metrics are very positive, but yes, we have had some slowness, I don't want to blame at all on this but it is a factor. Some of this is client driven as well. I mean, many of these projects when they get to scale -- I mean, for example, we just took live for a major automotive client, 150,000 users on our new digital workplace offering, that is a big deal when you move over -- a very short period of time, 150,000 users. So in some instances, the client is also going more slowly. That coupled with the -- more difficulty in bringing and onboarding the skills necessary to adequately stack some of the new sales that we have has contributed to that roughly $100 million shortfall that I talked about. So it's two things, it's not just one thing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.","Darrin Peller","How long do you think it will take for your staffing for digital to actually be right-sized? I know you're talking about different plans around it but when you -- and then, if you couple that with your -- when you're talking about all the partnerships you're announcing around cloud enablement, whether it's Amazon last quarter or incremental deals you're doing to partner more with ServiceNow and others. I'm just curious to hear are their revenues there that are yet to come on; is that still new and should we expect that coming forward and do you actually have the right talent for that or can you share in talent resources with those new partners?","Mike Lawrie","Part of our acquisition strategy is to help acquire the skills that we need. So when we source these new skills, this is a different staffing model than we've had in the business before [ph]. For example, we're hiring many more people out of universities worldwide and bringing them into our training program, that's new. That takes a little longer than just hiring a professional, hiring flopping them on a contract. So the whole staffing model; how we source, how we recruit is changing as we change the revenue mix of our business to more and more digital. The other thing here is that we're now really looking at the business in two dimensions as we think about scaling. One is digital in a lot of our new offerings and that has a different sourcing model and a different cycle time, and our mainstream business which we continue to drive reductions through productivity and other optimization programs.","We're also working with our partners; so a lot of our partners are very helpful here in training and then certifying skills. AWS is an example of this, Microsoft Azure is example of this. So it's a combination of things that need to be done to build up the bench and build up the digital skills capability to source some of the contracts that we're winning.","Darrin Peller","But when I think about where your bookings trends are for that -- those businesses, again, with the partnerships; and honestly, just what's going to look like easier compares after this quarter and last quarter and the next couple. I mean, I just wonder if you're going to be able to source from a talent standpoint fast enough to ensure that when we start getting into next fiscal year, you can show some sort of light at the end of the tunnel on the revenue side.","Mike Lawrie","Listen, we think we can, it forced us to change. As I said, we had to put a dedicated recruiting engine in place for these digital skills. We are now using our Talent Cloud, which has really just come on-stream here and from a scaling standpoint in the last several months. So, yes, I do think we're going to be able to meet that demand from a sourcing standpoint.","Darrin Peller","Look, I mean you bought back more from a capital allocation standpoint, I guess we'll hear -- again, we'll probably hear more at the Investor Day around this, but what are your latest thoughts Mike with regards to capital allocation now, just given where the share prices and your cash flow opportunities?","Mike Lawrie","I mean at this point, more capital should be allocated to share buybacks, that's pretty simple, it's a tremendous investment. And as Paul said, we're planning to do that, we'll cover that in a little more detail on Thursday; but yes, you can expect as part of our capital allocation model to allocate much more to shareholder return and buybacks at this level.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","Mike, I was wondering with the senior management changes and the cost saving initiatives, just trying to figure out how the morale is going at DXC and maybe is that having an impact on the top line?","Mike Lawrie","I think where our accounts are growing and where we're involved in the future around digital, I think the morale is quite good. We're moving the senior managers in most instances, improved morale, because whenever you delay or an organization or you remove positions that aren't adding a lot of value, the workforce understands that and they see that. On the other hand, where you've got accounts that are declining and aren't moving forward as quickly on digital, I'd say the morale isn't as good and it also varies a lot by geography, I mean I just -- I've been -- last several weeks I was in Asia and India and everywhere else, and we're seeing tremendous opportunity, as well as improvements in innovation and we've just launched another digital lab in Singapore, for example. So the people are very upbeat and buoyant about that.","Were we have been slower to make the transition to digital in a lot of these new areas, yes, you would expect and the focus is still primarily on cost and right-sizing the workforce. Yes, you would expect people not to be as happy and little more concerned about their future.","Bryan Keane","And then Paul, just on acquisition contribution; I was just trying to figure out for the quarter, how much revenue was from acquisitions? And then you've made several here recently, is there a contribution we can think about for total revenue for fiscal year '19 through some of these acquisitions and total acquisitions for the company? Thanks.","Paul Saleh","I think for the full year it will be less than 1%. I think in the past we said 1% to 2% but I think we'll be on the little bit lower aside for this year. And I will have to get back to you, I don't have the number in front in terms of what's in the number this quarter on a year-over-year basis.","Mike Lawrie","Not a lot because Molina didn't close until the end of the quarter, the two acquisitions we announced yesterday; obviously, there is no impact in the quarter and we'd announced a couple of smaller acquisitions in Australia that was a deminimis contribution in the second quarter.","Bryan Keane","And then just a last one, Paul, the $300 million in FX, is that total contribution for the full year or is that an incremental because I had in my notes that after the first quarter you were expecting $150 million of FX decline already for fiscal year '19.","Paul Saleh","Yes, as for the total, I think if you remember, this is compared to -- with the range that we gave you at the beginning of the year. So compared with those rates of the beginning of the year, it's $300 million for the full year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ashwin [ph] with Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","I wanted to kind of get a breakdown if possible. You've lowered your revenues here by roughly $800 million. The incremental FX is 150-ish, there is some other moving parts which are potentially offset by the acquisition. So is this -- you guys are taking another look at it, putting in an assumption for how much the delay will hit. Can you break that down a bit?","Mike Lawrie","Yes, I'll break it down for you. So it's roughly $300 million income, it's roughly the $200 million that we talked about in the second quarter. And then what we're doing is we are rephasing what we expect to happen around some of the digital contracts that have already been signed and what we expect to sign. So given our experience this quarter, we are rephasing how quickly we will be able to go from contract signing to revenue; that's another roughly $300 million. Now I will tell you that last part is the least precise just because of all the things we've talked about in this call, how quickly we can ramp-up some of the skills and some of the other factors we've talked about, but that's how it breaks down.","Unidentified Analyst","And the EPS number you put out and the margin implied there; should we assume that our incremental costs also baked-in for such things you mentioned like hiring ahead, hire training, hiring from colleges are potentially paying up?","Mike Lawrie","All the projections that we've given you include the investments that we are planning to make, so that is some of the hiring investments that we need to make to build out a digital bench. And we're doing this differently, we're doing this at our digital delivery centers, not embedding all this resource in our accounts, we're down the road, the projects aren't there, they have to be extricated; so we're doing this in a much more disciplined way. But to answer to your question, yes, those investments are factored in the projections that we gave you on margin expansion and on EPS.","Paul Saleh","When you look at what we said already, we had $575 million of incremental synergy savings this year over the -- compared with the $400 million when we started the year. So we're able to absorb some of those revisions that we've made on our outlook for revenue.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, understood.","Paul Saleh","And that's how felt confident to put -- or comfortable in increasing our EPS range to $7.95 to $8.20.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. See you in a couple days.","Mike Lawrie","And operator, we'll conclude the call now. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect. We do thank you for joining, and hope you have a nice day."],"8121":["DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC) Q3 2020 Earnings Conference Call February  6, 2020  4:45 PM ET","Company Representatives","Mike Salvino - President, Chief Executive Officer","Paul Saleh - Chief Financial Officer","Shailesh Murali - Investor Relations","Conference Call Participants","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research","Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson","Rod Bourgeois - DeepDive Equity Research","Jared Levine - Cowen","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Operator","Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the DXC Fiscal Year \u201920, Third Quarter Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. ","At this time, I would like to hand things over to Mr. Shailesh Murali. Please go ahead, sir.","Shailesh Murali","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased that you are joining us for DXC Technology's Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. Our speakers on today's call will be Mike Salvino, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast at dxc.com\/investorrelations, and the webcast includes slides that will accompany the discussion today. After the call, we will post these slides on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Slide two informs our participants that DXC Technology's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures.

Mike.","Mike Salvino","Thank you, Shailesh, and I appreciate everyone joining the call today. As I mentioned on my first earnings call, my style is one of focus and clarity, and our comments today concerning the quarter will follow that direction. ","Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. I will update you on the progress against the priority discussed during our Q2 earnings call. These priorities of running the business and unlocking value represent the transformational journey that we\u2019re on at DXC. We call this our focus strategy. ","Paul will then take you through the financial details of our third quarter results, and our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. I will then make some closing remarks concerning what's next on the transformational journey before we take questions. ","Turning to our third quarter, I'm pleased with the initial progress we've made on the priorities of running the business and unlocking value. We reported financial results in-line with our plan. Simply put, we did what we said we're going to do and we are executing nicely against our new focus strategy. ","Revenue is up 3% sequentially in constant currency. We also delivered on our profitability expectation and our book-to-bill ratio of 1.06. It was our best in three quarters. ","As I\u2019ve discussed with you before, this transformation will not be a quick fix, but I am confident that our new focus strategy will position DXC to compete in the IT services space. Let me give you a little color now around the progress we're making with our customers, people, operational execution and unlocking value. ","As I continue to meet customers, I\u2019m most impressed with the types of services our customers have entrusted us with for years. The applications and infrastructure we are running are at the heart of our customers businesses. I\u2019ve used the phrase \u201cinside of DXC that we have the courage to deliver the critical for our customers\u201d. This is truly unique in the IT services space. Without the work that our people do every day for our customers, planes don't fly, hospitals don't operate, and Black Friday sales are not completed. ","During our last call, I mentioned that we needed to leverage our ITO business and make investments to improve our delivery and regain trust with some of our customers. I have a fundamental belief that by running our customers\u2019 critical system smoothly, we will earn the right to win additional business. This is one of the key tenets of our focus strategy leveraging our ITO business to grow DXC. ","We have been focusing on account management and delivery capabilities and we're making good progress. My original assessment had 20 to 30 accounts in the challenge category, meaning we were not meeting service levels or customers were not pleased with our performance. We started doing in-depth reviews and saw some partial terminations and two accounts that terminated completely. ","During this quarter we establish a very focused program that includes 40 accounts to address these issues. These accounts represent about a quarter of our revenue. Overall this program is off to a good start, with seven accounts graduating out of this program. We expect the majority of these accounts to be turned around by the end of Q4 and the program to be completed in the first half of fiscal \u201921.","I've been receiving positive comments during my check-in calls of the 92 in total, and this program has clearly created positive momentum with our customers. In fact, we've already been awarded over $500 million of business from several of these accounts in the form of renewal and new work. ","Some of this network was previously put on hold, and some of the new work is an analytics, which is at the top of the enterprise technology stack. This is solid evidence that leveraging the ITO business and focusing on our customers, people and operational execution is the right strategy to grow DXC. ","Turning now to our people, we have held Town Halls in every region this past quarter and we have completed a global employee survey; received over 140,000 comments representing that our people are engaged. They are telling us that they are seeing positive changes and are feeling optimistic. ","Our current focus areas for our people are learning opportunities, career prospects and compensation. During this quarter a great example of our action and investment was implementing salary increases for our India delivery centers ahead of our typical salary review cycle. ","Another area where we are making progress is attracting new talent. In Q3 we had roughly 50 leaders to DXC in the areas of account management, delivery and corporate functions. We also added two more senior leaders to our leadership team. Both Carla and Chris have impeccable resumes, broad experience and played broader roles in their prior companies, but joined DXC to be a part of the transformation journey. ","Carla is our Chief Risk Officer and leads Physical and Virtual Security, Ethics and Compliance and Overall Enterprise Risk Management, and Chris will be our CIO and will lead our IT transformation to deliver tools to our people to better serve our customers. ","I've also made a couple of key leadership changes. Vinod is now Leading Global Delivery and Steve is accountable for our business in UKIIMEA. All of these hires are integrating well with the existing team and the total team is making an immediate and positive impact. Our book-to-bill of 1.06 for this quarter is evidence that we are working well as a team. ","We're also seeing a positive shift in the market about DXC\u2019s brand perception. This is evidenced by DXC alumni rejoining us and others reaching out to join the transformation journey. I am thrilled that Ian Read, the retired Chairman and CEO of Pfizer will be joining us as our new Chairman. Ian brings a wealth of experience, particularly in the area of leading large public company, through transformations. All of this gives me confidence that we can attract, integrate and retain top talent to execute on our focus strategy. ","Another key component to running the business is operational execution. We are taking steps to improve delivery execution. Vinod and his team are examining our delivery footprint, utilization and talent to improve our quality, speed and cost of delivery. Ultimately our goal is to consolidate and further scale our delivery operations. ","We are now also moving to our regionally focused operating model, with a tighter management system designed to speed up decision making and increase accountability. From an industry perspective, we are bringing together our automotive and banking capabilities with Lexar under Dmitry\u2019s leadership to take advantage of the opportunity in those two industries. ","As I previously mentioned, we are leveraging our ITO business to begin to grow DXC. Let me give you a little bit more detail on the plan. We are using our unique industry capability of virtual clarity to assess the IT estates of our top 200 accounts. These assessments will allow us to have fact based dialogues with our customers concerning the migration of their IT estate to the cloud. ","In these discussions we talk about technical feasibility, risk, the value proposition and the ability of our customers to execute such a migration, along with their need for assistance. In the fourth quarter we will complete these assessments for 30 of our top accounts and we will be in the market engaging with our customers. ","This work will allow us to have productive and proactive discussions with our customers and give us hard numbers concerning how fast our ITO business, which has a large amount of mission critical applications and infrastructure in it will move to the cloud. ","Now let me turn my comments to the area of unlocking value. The clarity of our strategy to focus on the enterprise technology stack has given us an opportunity to engage with our customers and better align with their needs. We are introducing our customers to the breadth of our offerings across the enterprise technology stack and customers are reacting positively by communicating to us and industry players that they have an interest in trying our services.","We are also executing well in pursuing strategic alternatives for three businesses, and are on track to hit the time-line we set for ourselves. We have retained several world class advisors to help us with this effort and our plan is to be in the market this month. Let me comment briefly on the three businesses. ","In State and Local Health and Human Services, it\u2019s been business as usual, and we're in the final stage of adding one new state to our portfolio. In the other two business, horizontal BPS and Workplace and Mobility, results were mixed, but they were in-line with our expectations. On the positive side, some customers have awarded us new work or have renewed existing contract. However, there has been a few cases where customers are pushing out renewals, insourcing the work or have indicated their intent not to renew with us. ","Now I'm going to hand the call over to Paul to take you through the third quarter results and our business outlook for the fourth and full year. ","Paul Saleh ","Well, thank you Mike and greetings everyone. As usual, I\u2019ll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results this quarter. In the current quarter we had restructuring costs of $74 million pretax or $0.25 per diluted share. Now these costs were primarily related to workforce optimization and facilities rationalization. ","Also in the quarter we had $68 million pretax or $0.20 per diluted share of integration and transaction of separation related costs. Year-to-date restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs amounted to $474 million pretax or $1.49 per diluted share. In the third quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $146 million pretax or $0.44 per diluted share. ","Now in the quarter, we recorded an out of period tax adjustment of $53 million related to the goodwill impairment we took in the second quarter. Now this non-cash adjustment does not impact income from continuing operations, net income or earnings per share. However, in connection with this out of period adjustment, we determined that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and this is primarily relating to complex transactions and processes. This material weakness does not involve any restatement of prior issued financials. ","Now more information about our remediation plan is included in our Form 10-Q, which we expect to file after the close of business tomorrow. Excluding all of these special items, our non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $468 million and our non-GAAP EPS was $1.25. I'll now move on to our third quarter results in more detail. ","GAAP revenue in Q3 was $5.02 billion. As always, all revenue comparisons I will discuss will be in constant currency. Our Q3 revenues represent a sequential increase of 3%. While we typically experience a pick-up in activities in Q3 compared with Q2, our revenue growth this quarter also reflects in-part, add on and project work from customers, who have previously put business with us on hold. Now these are encouraging signs that the investments we are making to turn around challenged accounts are starting to pay off. ","Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $528 million, adjusted EBIT margin was 10.5% in line with the plan we shared with you on our last earnings call. Our EBIT margin was down 40 basis points sequentially. That reflects the moderation of our cost take-out activities, as well as additional investment in the business, consistent with our stated priorities of customers, people and operational execution. ","In the quarter our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.9%, slightly better than our expectations of 32% to 33%. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.06x. We were able to close a few deals that had slipped from Q1 and Q2 and convert new business opportunities across every layer of the enterprise technology stack. This book to bill reflects the collaboration among all the members of the senior leadership team. Year-to-date, revenue was $14.76 billion, adjusted EBIT was $1.7 billion, margin was 11.6% and bookings were $13.3 billion for our book-to-bill of 0.9x. ","Turning now to our segment results, our global business services segment consistent of the three upper layers of the enterprise technology stack. It also includes for now the state and local Health and Human Services business, and the horizontal BPS business which are under strategic review. ","GBS revenue was $2.36 billion in the quarter, up 3% sequentially and up close to 10% year-over- year. Excluding Luxoft, GBS revenue was down 0.5% year-over-year, primarily due to the completion of a few application transformation projects and the insourcing of a large BPS contract earlier this year. ","In the third quarter GBS segment profit was $353 million and profit margin was 15%. Sequentially our margins were down 70 basis points, reflecting the investment we're making in digital talent, as well as the slower pace of cost take-outs. GBS book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.07x with every offering posting a book-to-bill in excess of 1x. ","In particular we saw strength in our data analytics and engineering services business. Year-to-date GBS revenue was $6.8 billion, segment profit was $1.1 billion, margin was 15.8% and bookings were $6.8 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x. ","Now let me turn to our GIS segment. The GIS business consists of the ITO, Cloud and security layers of the enterprise technology stack. GIS also includes for now workplace and mobility business, which is under strategic review. ","GIS revenue was $2.66 billion in the quarter, up 3.1% sequentially. Year-over-year revenue was down 10.6%, primarily due to the roll-off and insourcing of work in select accounts. GIS segment profit in the third quarter was $232 million and profit margin was 8.7%. Sequentially our profit margin was down 80 basis points, reflecting the slowdown in our delivery cost take-out actions and the investment we're making in turning around challenged accounts. ","GIS book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.06x, reflecting the conversion of pipeline opportunities that were previously delayed, as well as the award of add-on and project work from challenged account. Year-to-date GIS revenue was $8 billion, segment profit was $815 million, margin was 10.2% and bookings were $6.5 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.8x. ","Now let me briefly comment on the performance of the layers within the enterprise technology stack. ITO revenue was up 2.4% sequentially, but down 16.1% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to roll-off of previously terminated work on select accounts and price concessions made earlier in the year to help customers with their digital transformation efforts. Book-to-bill was 0.9x. ","Cloud and security revenue was up 1.9% sequentially and 9.9% year-over-year. Book-to-bill was 1.5x, which is the best book-to-bill we\u2019ve had since Q3 of last year. Moving up the stack, application and industry IP was up 3% sequentially and up 0.4% year-over-year. Book-to-bill for this layer of the stack was 1.1x. This is the first time in four quarters that our application business excluding our enterprise cloud applications grew sequentially. ","Data analytics, engineering services business, revenue there was up 3.5% sequentially and up year-over-year by two fold. Excluding Luxoft, data analytic and engineering services grew 0.9% on a year-over-year basis. Book-to-bill was 1.5x with solid performance across the board. Lastly, advisory revenue was up nearly 5% sequentially, but down 8.5% year-over-year against a strong prior year performance. Book-to-bill was 1.1x. ","Turning now to the three businesses under strategic review, those businesses were collective up 3.9% sequentially, but down 7.2% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by the shift from traditional to digital in the workplace and mobility business. ","We're moving that case and we are tracking the timeline for the strategic reviews for all three businesses. We plan to be in the market in the coming weeks and are still confident that we will be able to realize $5 billion of net proceeds from this effort as previously stated. ","Turning to our financial highlights, adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter was $397 million, a 124% of adjusted net income, reflecting improved working capital management and the expanded use of our receivables facility by $110 million. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow is $1.21 billion or 106% of adjusted net income. ","For the full year, our target free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income remains unchanged at 80% or more. Fee cash flow in the fourth quarter will reflect two large cash outflows, one to cover our annual 401-K match and the second for a contract settlement payment that we expect to recover in fiscal \u201821 from insurance coverage. Free cash flow also reflects more conservative working capital and functions for the fourth quarter. ","CapEx in the quarter was $310 million or 6.2% of revenue, and on a year-to-date basis CapEx was $1.01 billion or 6.8% of revenue. ","During the quarter, we returned $140 million of capital to shareholders in the form of $54 million in dividends and $86 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date we\u2019ve paid $161 million of dividends and repurchased $736 million in shares for a total $897 million. ","Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.6 billion, our total debt was $8.9 billion, including capitalized leases. Net debt to total capital ratio was 35.2%. Following our second quarter earnings call, all three agencies, rating agencies issued updated credit reports on DXC, which will [inaudible] our ratings and revise their outlook to negative. Moody's indicated that DXCs rating and outlook were unaffected, but as a pursuit of strategic alternatives was credit negative. ","Now we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation, including reinvestment in the business, making strategic tucking acquisition and returning capital to shareholders, while protecting our investment grade credit profile. ","In closing, we continue to target revenue in the range of $19.5 billion to $19.8 billion. Sequentially we expect revenue to be slightly down, primarily due to softness in the U.K. as we no longer expect the typical seasonal uptick in revenue from certain key accounts. We expect profit margins to be lower sequentially, reflecting the full quarter impact of the investment we're making. ","These investments include, salary increases, particularly in our delivery centers, new talent acquisition, including the addition of senior leaders, ongoing investment to turn around challenged accounts, additional resources deployed to assets the ITO state of our top 200 accounts and finally, additional investments, not previously contemplated to share our support functions, particularly in HR, finance, risk management and IT. For the full year we are targeting non-GAAP EPS to remain in the range of $5.25 to $5.75 per share, although we are trending towards a lower end of that range. ","I\u2019ll turn now the call back to Mike for his closing remarks. ","Mike Salvino","Thanks Paul. Our third quarter results are a decent first step on our transformation journey. We\u2019ve done a good job of executing against our new focus strategy. As I said in our last earnings call, we have significant scope and scale of services, a reduced cost structure and customers need our services to support their IT transformation needs. Although our transformation will not be a quick fix, I\u2019m confident that our focus strategy will position DXC in the future, because we have proven this quarter, we can win in the market and we are building a very strong team to execute. ","In Q4 our priorities are as follows: With customers, our plan is to turn around the majority of the challenged accounts by the end of this quarter, and we also expect to complete the Virtual Clarity IT estate plans with the first 30 account and be in the market engaging with our customers.","On the people front, we plan to continue to address the feedback of our global employee survey, implement our employee value proposition and continue attracting high talent to DXC. ","In the area of Operational Execution, we will complete the rollout of our operating model and support of our regional structure. We also plan to streamline our offering portfolio to better align with the Enterprise Technology Stack and we will be conducting detailed regional business reviews, focused at the account level to develop our plan and investment for fiscal 2021. Finally, we expect to make progress on unlocking value, as we move that page along our stated timeline for the three businesses. ","Thank you again for joining the call, and we will now open the line-up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jason Kupferberg, Bank of America. ","Jason Kupferberg ","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon guys. Really nice progress, out of the gate here, so congrats on that. I just wanted to ask, just going to combine a couple of quick ones here into one question if you will. But first off, do you think the book-to-bill of back to 1.O [ph] plus is sustainable. I know you are still comfortable with the fiscal 22 target you'd given us last quarter and then just last, any thoughts on when we potentially see the first of the strategic review announcements. ","Mike Salvino","So Jason look, thanks for your comments. First of all on the strategic alternatives, look we are moving at pace. We said that you know the alternatives would be looked upon and we\u2019d execute them across the next 12 months and that's what we're going to continue to do. ","As it relates to you know 2022 and the sustainability of the book-to-bill, look I've been very encouraged about the progress we've made over the last three months. The recent activity of our transformation programs by customers, people and the market have been very good. When I think about 2021, right that'll be a transitional year for us, and we're going to continue to invest in our customers, people and operational execution and what I plan to do is discuss that 2021 plan on our next earnings call. And then I also plan to provide any additional updates on our expectations for 2022 at that time. ","So I won't be and Paul won\u2019t be commenting any further on that, other than the outlook you know that we gave on 2020.","Jason Kupferberg ","Just on the book-to-bill. ","Mike Salvino","Look on book-to-bill we made a good start, right. I mean what I expect you know is we will continue to make good progress in Q4, but we are going to be in and around. You know I think that 1.0 maybe a little bit slightly lower, but I mean the bottom line is we have a motion in the market that is winning. ","Jason Kupferberg ","Perfect! Thank you. ","Operator","Next up is Darrin Peller, Wolfe Research. ","Darrin Peller","Hey, nice job guys and good bookings. Let me just start off. I mean, I appreciate the color on the 40 clients that Mike you just talked about. It seems like a meaningful portion of the headwinds in the ITO piece; I assume that\u2019s the case. Maybe just touch on how clients are reacting to your refocused emphasis on ITO now and I guess I\u2019d like to hear how your clients are reacting to that, but also how the internal organizational culture feels about the one DXC reemphasized focus on kind of one company investing in all parts of it. Do you feel that there's been reenergized of the employee base. Thanks guys. ","Mike Salvino","Okay look, thanks for that. First of all, on the comment, the 40 clients are not just within that, what I call the green layer or the ITO layers. It\u2019s also in the orange, in the apps layers, so it's those two layers. And when I talked about an in-depth review, I mean I took a very stringent line on what went into those clients and it wasn't like I said, just the service levels, because that\u2019s the easiest thing, right. ","You hear in the market place you know the watermelon effect, green on the inside and then you know red on the \u2013 green on the outside, red on the inside. What that means is you got to listen to the voice of the customer. So when I said I made 92 a month, 92 calls now, I'm talking to these customers to make sure that our performance is where it needs to be and if it wasn't where it needed to be, I\u2019d put them into the program. I mean it was as simple as that, alright. ","And moving out of the program, the only way you\u2019d get out of the program is if I hear, get a note or have a call that says the client is happy and we've seen that performance over a month. So when I said seven have gotten out, you know you would be expected sort of that framework, as it relates to you know the progression. ","The second quarter of your call was the one DXC, but our people are definitely engaged, all right and you know not only did they like the Town Halls and the openness and transparency that we're talking about in terms of the transformation, but they really responded well to the global employee survey, you know not only from taking it, but they wanted to see the results. And what I would say is, you know that that whole energy bleeds into the market, because our people sit side by side with our custom and when our people are happy, right, our customers here that and then that tends to get out in the market. ","So the reason I highlighted what I call DXP alumni rejoining, is that\u2019s a new movement, all right. Meaning people want to come back and join the place and then it goes without saying, right. I am honored, along with I'm very impressed with the talent that we\u2019ve been able to attract. So I would tell you, that the receptivity has been very good. ","Darrin Peller","Thanks guys. ","Operator","Next up we\u2019ll hear from Lisa Ellis, MoffettNathanson. ","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good afternoon guys, and off to a good start here. I got one for Mike maybe and one for Paul. Mike, can you just elaborate a little bit on any changes you're making to the sales and go to market model to support the sort of updated strategy for DXC. And then Paul just one for you, I mean I think restructuring and the separation costs are running you know about a third or so of adjusted free cash flow and that\u2019s kind of an important driver for the longer term outlook. Do you see that, as you look into 2021, 2022 coming down or are they going to be kind of a big piece of your free cash flow for the foreseeable future. Thank you. ","Mike Salvino","So Lisa, I\u2019ll go first. In terms of changes on the sales model, you know what I would say is, you'll hear this word a lot, is focus. So when I went into the detail about the Virtual Clarity IT estate plans, I'll tell you, I was getting a little tired of people saying that are ITO business was just going to run to the cloud. ","So the reason I started to do analysis around what that business and you know in KL and the critical nature of that, you know most of the stuff that's going to the cloud so far has been the easier stuff, right and it's gone to the public cloud. The state that we have now, being a more critical nature, that will take a little bit of time. And when it goes, it will usually go to a private cloud. ","So the reason I went into such detail on the estates Lisa, is we are literally handing all right, that road map to our sales force. And myself and the leadership team is getting involved in those conversations with those accounts, because when I did check in with the customers, you know they were asking us to be more curious. So as part of sort of the new mindset here, we're showing up, and we're going to not only show-up with a point of view, but we're going to show-up with you know a detailed plan of what can happen on their estate. ","So that's the main change I\u2019ve made so far, is I want to see these detailed plans all right, for the existing accounts and when we have a new account, right that we are competing with. I also want to see that detailed plan, because we can do high level analysis before we walk into the conversation with a new client. So that's the main thing I would highlight for you. ","Paul Saleh","And Lisa, on the restructuring, it\u2019s been just really this quarter. For example we had some restructuring more related to some of the complex countries. As I look to the near term and particularly its through fiscal \u201921, as Mike mentioned, this is going to be at a transitional year for us. Importantly there the restructuring is going to be a little bit also targeted, those stranded costs coming out of the three business, those we are going to be reviewing all the option from switch from a strategic perspective. ","And then as we have indicated previously, by fiscal \u201822 we start to expect restructuring to moderate and we\u2019ll start to think a little bit more about providing a little bit more granularity in terms of our expectations on restructuring in the coming quarters. ","Lisa Ellis","Excellent! Thank you, thanks guys. ","Operator","Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research has the next question. ","Rod Bourgeois ","Okay guys, nice initial step in the December quarter it looks like. So it seems that you\u2019ve made some positive progress on some of the turnaround in the December quarter and you're still though juggling multiple turnaround initiative and you're working to sell these three assets. And it seems that those multiple efforts that are still in process, could create some near term disruption, particularly to revenues. ","So what I'd like to ask, what is your experience so far with the business disruption that might be occurring and I'm assuming fiscal \u201821 is starting really before your turn around work can really drive full pay off, while you still have potential disruption to deal with. So essentially as we approach the fiscal \u201821 period, I'm trying to weigh potential for some turnaround progress against risks of revenue disruption and would like to hear what your experience is so far and how you're thinking about that. ","Mike Salvino","Okay Rod, I'll take that. First of all, thanks for the question. When I think about the business right, you know obviously it's one business, but if you look at the strategic alternatives, you know state, local, health and Human Services business as usual. In fact the one state we are adding, very happy about that. ","The horizontal BPS and workplace mobility businesses have held-up in line right, with what we thought. We thought we'd win some stuff and we thought that some stuff would go away. So revenue disruption to the strategic alternatives, you know we're not seeing, so we\u2019ll put that to one side. ","The rest of the business, in terms of revenue disruption, look, you know this business is a balancing act of decisions that have been made in the past in terms of term contracts that were now flowed into 2021 and also new \u2013 bringing on new business, that's why such the focus on the delivery, because that new businesses has got to come online right, so that we can balance out.","So the way I look at 2021 will be still that transitional year, right. We will be dealing with some of the stuff in the past, alright, but I\u2019m hoping with these IT estate plans that we are doing, I'm hoping with unlocking some of the work from the challenged accounts right, that we will have you know a motion in 2021 that will obviously be positive. But I look at 2021 as that transitional year Rod, where we are still going to deal with some of the stuff, but also invest in our customers\u2019 people and operational execution. ","So look, I mean the bottom line is I'm seeing progress across the board, in our client meetings, and the thing I guess I would highlight right, is the fact that when our clients talk to us, it is not just about the work that we have. They are very curious about the rest of the stack and this is where I'm looking forward to getting to the top of the stack in the blue. ","I mentioned about bringing automotive and banking together with Luxoft. We have got to make sure that we're combining the capabilities that we have to compete in the market. And Luxoft has a really, really nice agile workforce that we should be able to deliver in the top of the stack very nicely. So anyhow Rod, that\u2019s the way I think about it. ","Rod Bourgeois ","Alright, thanks. That's helpful color. ","Operator","Our next question today comes from Bryan Bergin, Cowen. ","Jared Levine","Hey, this is actually Jared Levine on for Brian. So Mike, where do you stand with the make-up of your direct hires? Obviously a lot of announcements in a short period since September. Just have a lot to do at the senior rank to really put your plan into action. ","Mike Salvino","You know look, right now my focus is to continue to implement what I call our regional operating model, and you know the reason I highlighted in my comments that the new hires are integrating well with the folks that are here, is because we did have a talented team. This isn't about just all bringing new hires into the place. Where I've seen, you know places that are really \u2013 you know, want to take a step up, that\u2019s typically when I've gone for a new hire. Carla is a perfect example of that, alright, in the sense that you know for a res standpoint I want lower level of detail on that, so we were able to attract a really talented person. ","IT is another one, right. I mean as you can imagine with EDS to HPE along with CSC, the back end of our systems right, we need to continue to do more with alright, and when I think about controls and so forth, that's why we went after and got Chris. I mean, you know Chris knows how to deal with complex environments being at GE. So very pleased with the hires, but I also don't want to disparage the existing team, because the existing team was incredibly talented. ","The thing that I want to highlight for people is they\u2019ve come together well. We don't have a series of haves and have not\u2019s here and like I said, the results in Q3 proved together that we could come together as a team very quickly and start making impact. So that would be my comment there. ","Jared Levine","Great! Thanks for the color. ","Operator","Next from Citi, we\u2019ll hear from Ashwin Shirvaikar. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thanks. Hi Mike, hi Paul. It\u2019s a good first step here, I appreciate it. My question is on the stronger bookings performance. How much of that was because of delayed bookings from prior quarters? I know that's been in the specter of delayed booking has occurred in both the June and September quarters, and now there are delayed contracts still outstanding and in that context if you can talk also about how the pipeline is building and whether the delayed contract coming in is more a function of when it was at year end, what was the improved process you put in, what\u2019s causing these contracts to now come in? ","Mike Salvino","Okay, so let me \u2013 I'll start with the bottom and then you go back to the individual details. So in terms of what happened, it wasn't year-end type thing, alright and it also you know wasn't something where we did something miraculous, right, because when I talked to you guys on November 11 in my first call, I mean the things I'm putting in place are just getting into place. ","But I will tell you the focus on making sure that we dealt with these clients and we were front and center, right. We came up and showed up with a new attitude, along with we cared, along with what I call the ground swell from our people saying, \u2018Hey, there's something new going on here\u2019 that unlocks stuff, alright and I\u2019ll let Paul get to the detailed numbers on what was put on hold and so forth. ","The only other comment I would make is with the challenged accounts, you know there\u2019s still more work to be at alright, and it's not work to be had that was just put on hold. It's also us sitting with those clients and finally being curious with them, and I made my comments around the operational execution, is the fact that what we're out in the marketplace talking about is the enterprise technologies stats, which means we're not just in the ITO business, but we're also not in this thing that we \u2013 you know that we used to call digital, right. ","We have a very focused approach about what we're selling; ITO, cloud, apps you know and then analytics and insights. So that's the motion that we're putting out in the market and I would tell you, decent first step. ","Paul Saleh","Yeah Ashwin, to answer your first question, $250 million \u2013 around $250 million from deals that have slipped in the first half of the year. There is still another 500 that\u2019s up for grabs, either in the fourth quarter or into the fiscal \u201921. And then out of the \u2013 this is all in TCV right, and then the other things Mike mentioned already, $500 million of TCV from contracts that have been put on hold, two separate things. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Understood! And Mike, if I can ask you just philosophically, to the extent you see some upside in earnings and cash flow relative to initial expectations, are you more likely to be on the side of reinvesting that upside or passing it on to investors? ","Mike Salvino","The bottom line is Paul already said it. We are going to keep capital, you know balanced right in terms of our capital allocation. We're paying attention to the rating agencies and we obviously, I totally understand my job is shareholder value. So we're going to keep that balance.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. ","Bryan Keane ","Hi guys. Mike I just wanted to clarify, on fiscal year \u201822 the revenue range of $50 million plus and EBIT margin, non-GAAP I think was 12% plus and $7 in earnings plus. Is that all still hold or should we now put that to the side and kind of wait till fiscal year \u201821 and see how things progress? ","Mike Salvino","Brian, you know again thanks for the question and like I said, I'm not going to comment outside of 2020. My plan right now is to go and do the detailed account reviews for 2021. I plan to discuss 2021 on our next call and on our next call I\u2019ll providing any update around those expectations for 2022. ","Bryan Keane ","Okay, got it. That's all I had, thanks. ","Operator","And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to hand things back to Shailesh Murali for any addition or closing remarks. ","Shailesh Murali","Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate it. Thank you. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation today. You may now disconnect."],"8112":["DXC Technology (NYSE:DXC) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call November  7, 2017  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Jonathan Ford - Head, Investor Relations","Mike Lawrie - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Paul Saleh - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Darrin Peller - Barclays","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi","Bryan Bergin - Cowen & Company","Rayna Kumar - Evercore","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the DXC Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today\u2019s program is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the conference over to Mr. Jonathan Ford, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jonathan Ford","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased you are joining us for DXC Technology\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. Our speakers on today\u2019s call will be Mike Lawrie, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer. We have slides to our website at dxc.com\/investorrelations, which will accompany our discussion today.","Slide 2 explains that the discussion will include comparisons of our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to our pro forma combined company results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The pro forma results are based on historical quarterly statements of operations of each of CSC and the legacy Enterprise Services business of HPE or HPES, giving effect to the merger as if it had been consummated on April 2, 2016. As a consequence of CSC and HPES having different fiscal year-end dates, the pro forma combined company results, include the results of operations of CSC for the 3 and 6 months ending September 30, 2016 and of HPES for the 3 and 6 months ending July 31, 2016.","Slide 3 informs our participants that DXC Technology\u2019s presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today\u2019s earnings release as well as in our supplemental slides. Both documents are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.","On Slide 4, you will see that certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of risks and uncertainties is included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. I would like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call, except as required by law.","And now, I would like to introduce DXC Technology\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Mike Lawrie. Mike?","Mike Lawrie","Okay, thank you. Welcome, everyone. Thanks for your interest in DXC. As always, I have got four, five key messages. I will develop those in a little detail and then Paul will come on and then as always we will have an opportunity for some questions.","So, first key message here is second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $1.93. This includes a cumulative benefit of $0.26 from reclassification of leases, which I will cover in a moment. EBIT adjusted for restructuring, integration and amortization of intangibles was $876 million, including a cumulative benefit of $121 million from the lease reclassification. Adjusted EBIT margin was 14.2% or 12.3% excluding the lease reclassification. We generated $589 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter. Second point, revenue in the second quarter was $6.163 billion on a GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, GAAP revenue was down 2.7% year-over-year and grew 2.5% sequentially. In constant currency, revenue was down 3.5% year-over-year and was flat sequentially. Book-to-bill was 1.0x for the quarter.","Third point, excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, our digital GAAP revenue grew 23% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Industry IP and BPS GAAP revenue was relatively flat year-over-year driven by the completion of several large healthcare contracts last year. The 7.5% growth in the insurance business partially offsets the decline in healthcare. And sequentially, industry IP, BPS GAAP revenue grew 4%. And in the second quarter, our digital book-to-bill was 1.2x and our industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was also 1.2x.","Fourth point, during the second quarter, we continued to achieve key merger integration milestones. We are executing our synergy plan are on track to meet our targets of $1 billion of year one cost savings as well as $1.5 billion of run-rate cost savings exiting the year. We are also on track in the early stages of separating our U.S. Public Sector business in combining that company with Vencore Holding Corporation and KeyPoint Government Solutions. As discussed in our announcement on October 11, this will create a separate mission-focused independent publicly traded technology company to serve U.S. government clients.","And then finally for fiscal 2018, we continue to target revenue of $24 billion to $24.5 billion in constant currency. We are increasing our fiscal 2018 target for non-GAAP EPS to a range of $7.25 to $7.75 reflecting the benefit from the reclassification of leases. On that basis, our adjusted free cash flow target will now be 90% of adjusted net income since net income will include the benefit of the least conversion and corresponding asset adjustments.","So, let me just develop each one of those points in a little more detail. As I said, second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $1.93. This included a benefit of $0.26 from the reclassification of leases which I will talk about in a moment. The effective tax rate was 31%. Second quarter EBIT adjusted for restructuring integration and amortization of intangibles was $876 million. Adjusted EBIT margin on that basis was 14.2%. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter included a cumulative benefit of $121 million or $0.26 of EPS from the reclassification of HPES operating leases to capitalize leases and a corresponding adjustment of those assets to fair market value.","In subsequent quarters, we expect a continued benefit of roughly $60 million per quarter or $0.13 of EPS. Excluding this benefit, adjusted EBIT would have been 12.3%, an increase of 630 basis points year-over-year and 80 basis points sequentially. The EBIT improvement reflects ongoing cost actions that we are taking consistent with synergy plans outlined at our Investor Day, including automation and supply chain efficiencies. Our delivery teams continue to increase productivity and effectiveness through our global automation program, Bionics. By replacing manual tests with automated scripts, we minimized the labor required to support and run environments and we are also leveraging predictive analytics to reduce incidents by up 70%. This significantly improves the stability of IP operations of our clients.","In supply chain, we are consolidating suppliers to create global highly leveraged relationships to reduce cost and more effectively serve our clients. We are working closely with third-party providers to ensure that the benefits of scale are translating into realized savings at an account level. We are also leveraging our internal delivery productivity initiatives such as service desk automation to help reduce external spend. And collectively, second quarter cost actions generate approximately $110 million of in-quarter savings, which keeps us on track or $1 billion of fiscal 2018 synergy realization.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $589 million or 106% of adjusted net income. And for the year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion or 116% of adjusted net income. Our revenue in the second quarter was $6.163 billion on a GAAP basis. In my comments to follow all year-over-year and sequential comparisons exclude the impact of purchase price accounting on revenue. On a GAAP basis, revenue was down 2.7% year-over-year and grew 2.5% sequentially. In constant currency, revenue was down 3.5% year-over-year and flat sequentially. And total bookings in the second quarter were $5.95 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.0x.","The second quarter GBS revenue was $2.3 billion. On a GAAP basis, GBS revenue was down 3.2% year-over-year and grew 1.2% sequentially. Constant currency revenue was down 4.3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. As was the case last quarter, a large portion of this year-over-year decline was driven by the completion of two large government contracts in the UK. GBS bookings were up 2% sequentially with a bookto-bill of 1.1x for the quarter and in the quarter, GBS segment margin was 16.4% compared with 11.1% in the prior year. There was very little impact in GBS from the lease adjustments, so the margin improvement reflects the impact of our cost take-out actions.","In the second quarter, GIS revenue was $3.1 billion. On a GAAP basis, GIS revenue was down 4% year-over-year and was up 3.1% sequentially. Constant currency revenue was down 4.8% year-over-year and flat sequentially. GIS revenue reflects the continued moderation of headwinds in the legacy infrastructure business. GIS bookings of $2.8 billion were up 38% year-over-year and represent a book-to-bill of 0.9x. In the quarter, GIS segment margin was 14.9% compared with 4.7% in the prior year. Now, excluding the impact of the lease reclassification and corresponding fair value adjustment of the assets associated with those leases, GIS margin was 12.2%, up 750 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points sequentially, again reflecting cost action and the automation and processes.","In the second quarter, USPS revenue was $710 million. USPS revenue was up 5.5% year-over-year and was up 4.2% sequentially. USPS bookings of $644 million were up 133% year-over-year and represented a book-to-bill of 0.9x. The USPS segment margin in the quarter was 15.4% compared with 10.1% in the prior year. Again, excluding the impact of the lease reclassification and corresponding fair value adjustment of the assets associated with those leases, margin in the second quarter was 10.8%. And I will talk more in a moment about the separation of USPS business and the combination of Vencore and KeyPoint. DXC also in the quarter continued to expand its client base by adding 27 new logo deals greater than $1 million in total contract value.","Now, let me move to our digital industry IP and BPS results. On a GAAP basis, digital revenue was up 23% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially. Digital book-to-bill bill was 1.2x in the quarter. And as we have discussed, digital cuts across all three of DXC\u2019s reporting segments of GBS, GIS and USPS and includes enterprise cloud apps, consulting, cloud infrastructure, analytics and security. And enterprise cloud apps and consulting GAAP revenue was up 26% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9x. The enterprise cloud apps team is continuing to drive this momentum by introducing 16 quick-start offerings to help clients plan, pilot and test enterprise and cloud application software accelerating their digital business solutions with software from DXC as well as our strategic partners.","Cloud GAAP revenue was up 33% year-over-year and was up 25% sequentially. Bookings were up 24% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 1.4x. Drivers of the bookings growth in cloud include a deal with a major insurance company to provide a large scale digital transformation enabled by DXC\u2019s cloud offerings.","Analytics GAAP revenue was up 30% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Bookings were up year-over-year 24% with a book-to-bill of 1.1x. Security GAAP revenue was down 4% year-over-year and was up 5% sequentially. We continued to invest in this business through increased hiring of security consultants and we are already beginning to see growth in managed security services and this was reflected in our bookings for the quarter, which were up 78% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 1.6x.","Industry IP and BPS includes our ITO offerings in healthcare, insurance, travel and transportation and banking as well as our industry business process services business. Industry IP and BPS GAAP revenue was relatively flat year-over-year and was up 4% sequentially and the book-to-bill was 1.2x in the quarter. Industry IP GAAP revenue was down 3% year-over-year and was up 5.5% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects the completion of several large healthcare contracts during the second quarter of last year. This was partially offset by a 7.5% growth in the insurance business and the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.4x, including a large win with Lloyd\u2019s Market Association and the International Underwriting Association of London.","We developed the transformation roadmap that builds on DXC\u2019s deep industry vertical expertise, while leveraging our end-to-end offerings across both traditional and digital capabilities. BPS GAAP revenue was up 1.9% year-over-year and was up 2.5%. And the book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9x. The revenue growth is driven by the continued ramp up of our large insurance contracts such as MetLife. We also had several key wins in the second quarter at large global banks. These deals leverage solutions such as our cognitive knowledge center, which significantly reduces call volumes handled by human operators by providing automated natural language answers to branch employees\u2019 imports.","Now, as I previously discussed, a new transformation oriented sales motion is needed to capture the shift from traditional to digital that is occurring in the marketplace. We formed a new digital business team to shape a unified digital transformation approach leveraging assets from across the company as well as our partners. The objective is to jointly develop digital roadmaps with our clients targeting clear business outcomes and efficiency gains in traditional IP, while unlocking greater share of wallet and overall revenue growth for DXC.","Now in the quarter, we continued to expand our partner offerings, including solutions to more effectively leverage the benefits of public cloud in greater breadth for our go-to-market alliance with PwC. We announced new application and managed services offerings for Microsoft Azure and the Azure Stack. These offerings provide a wide range of services to accelerate and scale digital strategies across public and private cloud. They include application services, analytics offerings and hybrid cloud solutions based on the Azure Stack.","With VMware, we announced an expansion of our longstanding partnership with the unveiling of new DXC managed cloud services enabled by VMware\u2019s next generation hybrid cloud services platforms. This expansion allows clients to move existing workflows to AWS and also connect native AWS workflows to the enterprise while maintaining service visibility and operational control. Our alliance with PwC also continues to show positive momentum with a significant win during the quarter, with luxury brands, Bally, Jimmy Choo and Belstaff. In collaboration with PwC, DXC will optimize their e-commerce, finance and accounting services to reduce operating costs and deliver process innovation. We are also strengthening the pipeline with PwC by expanding areas where we provide services for each other if we can then take to market together and we currently have two dozen large accounts we are teaming to develop joint proposal for digital transformation.","We are also continuing to invest in the business and our people consistent with the plan we outlined at Investor Day. We recently announced the acquisition of Logicalis, a leading European provider of technology enabled solutions for the service management sector. Combination of Logicalis with DXC\u2019s Fruition Partners business further solidifies DXC\u2019s one of the most experienced global integrators for ServiceNow, a key strategic partner. We will also continue to focus on the most important asset for services organization, our people. DXC University now provides over 120,000 learning assets, including training courses, videos and e-books and more than 85,000 employees have completed training programs so far this year. We expanded our sales training and certification program beyond our go-to-market teams. And almost 16,000 employees have completed the training and passed the certification exam, also established certification training programs with strategic partners, including AWS and Microsoft Azure.","Gaining extraction of the dynamic talent cloud, our crowd sourcing platform that enable us to bring new people and skills to DXC in a more flexible way. This platform links us to individual practitioners in the industry and we leverage algorithms to match specific skills to projects, assigned work, evaluate performance and then determine appropriate rewards. This allows us to better serve our clients while increasing the flexibility of our workforce and talent base. We are rolling out the pilot globally and we have about 5,000 subscribers now engaged.","Now, the fourth point, we achieved several key merger integration milestones during the second quarter and continue to execute on the build, sell, deliver operating model we have previously discussed. We are on track to meet our targets of $1 billion of year one cost savings and $1.5 billion of run-rate cost savings exiting fiscal 2018. As we announced on October 11, we are combining our USPS business with Vencore and KeyPoint to create a separate mission focused independent publicly traded technology company to serve U.S. government clients. The new company will be highly differentiated mission-enabled solution provider with meaningful scale and end-to-end technology solutions. It would be one of the top 5 independent IT service providers to the U.S. federal, state and defense sectors. The company will have approximately $4.3 billion in combined revenues in a highly skilled workforce of more than 14,000 people.","DXC will continue to serve global commercial and non-U.S. government clients across 70 countries. Our mission will remain the same. Leading clients on their digital transformation journey with diversified next-generation IT offerings, industry-leading partnerships and innovation and delivery excellence for our clients, employees, shareholders and our partners, it will be business as usual. We have launched planning and integration efforts targeting a deal close by the end of March of 2018. Prior to that, we will schedule an Investor Day for the new company.","And then finally before I turn this over to Paul for fiscal 2018, we continue to expect revenue to be $24 billion or $24.5 billion in constant currency. And as I said earlier, we are increasing our target for non-GAAP EPS to a range of $7.25 to $7.75 reflecting the benefit from the reclassification in the leases. And on that basis, our adjusted free cash flow target will now be around 90% of adjusted net income since net income will include the benefit of the lease conversion and corresponding asset adjustments.","So with that, I will turn over to Paul for a little more detail and then we will open it up to any questions as you may have.","Paul Saleh","Well, thank you Mike and greetings everyone. Before I review our second quarter results, I would like to take a moment to clarify the basis of our financial presentation. First, the pro forma results for second quarter of last year conformed to the same methodology we used in the first quarter. And as such, all references to the unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the prior year include the results of operations of CSC for the 3 and 6 months ended September 30, 2016 and of HPES for the 3 and 6 months ended July 31, 2016. Also prior year pro forma non-GAAP results assume a flat quarterly tax rate of 27.5%. In addition, fiscal \u201818 second quarter results reflect revenue adjustments for purchase price accounting, whereas the prior year pro forma does not. And lastly, non-GAAP results exclude restructuring, integration and amortization of intangibles consistent with CSC\u2019s non-GAAP methods from prior years.","And with that, I will now cover some items that are included in our GAAP results in the quarter. In the current quarter, we had restructuring cost of $192 million pre-tax or $0.50 per diluted share. These costs represent severance costs related to workforce optimization programs and expense associated with facilities and data center rationalization. Also in the quarter, we had $66 million pre-tax or $0.15 per diluted share of integration and transaction costs. Year-to-date, restructuring, integration and transaction costs amounted to $572 million pre-tax or a $1.45 per diluted share, which is in line with the $1.3 billion spend envelope we laid out for fiscal \u201818. In the second quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $169 million pre-tax or $0.39 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, adjusted EBIT was $876 million or on a non-GAAP EPS a $1.93.","Turning now to our second quarter results, revenue in the quarter was $6.163 billion on a GAAP basis. Purchase price accounting reduced revenue in the quarter by $22 million representing a write-down of deferred revenue. For the full fiscal year, the deferred revenue write-down for PPA is now expected to be $230 million, which is better than our prior estimate of $335 million. Excluding PPA, GAAP revenue was down 2.7% year-over-year and up 2.5% sequentially. In constant currency, revenue was down 3.5% and roughly flat sequentially. EBIT in the quarter was $876 million after adjusting for restructuring, integration and amortization of intangibles. Adjusted EBIT margin on that basis was 14.2%. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter included a cumulative benefit of $121 million or $0.26 of EPS from the reclassification of HPES operating leases to capitalized leases and a corresponding adjustment of those assets to fair value.","In subsequent quarters, we expect a continued benefit of roughly $60 million per quarter or $0.13 EPS from this lease reclassification. Excluding the reclassification benefit in the quarter, adjusted EBIT would have been 12.3% compared with 6% in the prior year and 11.5% in the first quarter. This improvement in our margin reflect cost actions we are taking to optimize our workforce, extract greater supply chain efficiencies and rationalize our real estate footprint.","In the quarter, we continued to rebalance our workforce. We reduced labor base by about 4% in the quarter through a combination of automation, best shoring and pyramid correction. We will also continue to rebalance our skill mix, including the addition of almost 4,800 new employees and the ongoing retraining of the existing workforce. Also at the end of the quarter, our near shore and offshore labor mix was 54.5%. In supply chain, we are extracting greater procurement efficiencies. We completed renegotiations with key strategic suppliers, ensuring that we capture the benefits of our global scale and we continue to consolidate our overall supplier base. In addition, we are implementing tighter procurement review practices across all of our regions.","In real estate, we have rationalized 49 sites and eliminate 900,000 square feet of space during this quarter. This represented 5% total square footage reductions in our facilities footprint and on a year-to-date basis would reduce our facilities cost by roughly 9%. So, in total, we delivered $110 million of incremental cost take-outs in the quarter and are on track to meet our $1 billion in-year and $1.5 billion exit run-rate of synergies for fiscal \u201818.","Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the second quarter was $1.93, including the cumulative benefit of $0.26 from the lease reclassification and corresponding asset revaluation. In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 31%, reflecting our global mix of income in certain tax attributes and key foreign jurisdictions. Year-to-date, our non-GAAP tax rate was 27%, which is in line with the non-GAAP tax targets for the full year of 25% to 30%. Bookings in the quarter were $5.95 billion for an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1x.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Global Business Services revenue was $2.3 billion in the quarter. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting of $6 million, GBS GAAP revenue was down 3.2% year-over-year and was up 1.2% sequentially. In constant currency, revenue was down 4.3% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. In the second quarter, GBS segment profit was $380 million and profit margin was 16.4%. This compares with 11.1% in the prior year. The impact of lease reclassification in GBS was minimal. So, the margin improvement reflects the impact of cost take-out actions in the business, particularly as we optimized our workforce in complex countries. GBS bookings were $2.5 billion in the quarter for a book-to-bill of 1.1. Year-to-date, GBS revenue was $4.6 billion, segment profit was $662 million, margin was 14.5% and bookings were $4.9 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.1.","Turning now to GIS, our Global Infrastructure Services revenue was $3.1 billion in the quarter. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting of $15 million in the quarter, GIS GAAP Revenue was down 4% year-over-year and up 3.1% sequentially. In constant currency, revenue was down 4.8% year-over-year and was flat sequentially. In the second quarter, GIS segment profit was $469 million and profit margin was 14.9% compared with 4.7% in the prior year. Excluding $86 million cumulative impact from the lease reclassification and corresponding fair value adjustments of the asset associated with those leases, margin in the second quarter was 12.2%. The year-over-year improvement in profitability reflects the impact of cost actions we are taking to drive greater operating efficiencies, including best shoring, labor pyramid rebalancing, workforce optimization from our Bionics automation program and supply chain efficiencies. Bookings for GIS were $2.8 million in the quarter for a book-to-bill of 0.9x. Year-to-date, GIS revenue was $6.1 billion, segment profit was $759 million, margin was 12.4%, and bookings were $6.5 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.1.","USPS segment profit \u2013 sorry excuse me, turning now to our USPS sector, revenue was $710 million in the quarter. Our USPS revenue was up 5.5% year-over-year and up 4.2% sequentially. Our USPS segment profit was $100 million in the quarter and profit margin was 15.4% compared with 10.1% in the prior year. Excluding $32 million cumulative impact of the lease reclassification and corresponding fair value adjustments of the assets associated with those leases, margin in the second quarter was 10.8%. Bookings for USPS were $644 million in the quarter for a book-to-bill of 0.9 times. Now, year-to-date, USPS revenue was $1.4 billion, segment profit was $186 million, margin was 13.4% and bookings were $828 million for a book-to-bill of 0.6 times.","Now, let me turn to other financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $5 million or 106% of adjusted net income. This reflects ongoing improvement in working capital management with an increased focus on collections and improved vendor terms. Adjusted free cash flow excludes proceeds from receivable securitization programs. And year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion or 116% of adjusted net income.","Our CapEx was $549 million in the quarter or 8.9% of revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of the reclassification of operating leases to capitalized leases. Year-to-date, CapEx was $804 million or 6.7% of revenue. Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.7 billion. Our total debt was $8.4 million including capitalized leases. Net debt to total capitalization ratio was 27%. During the quarter, we returned $97 million of capital to our shareholders. This included $51 million in dividends and $47 million in share repurchase. And year-to-date, we have returned $138 million of capital to our shareholders in the form of $72 million in dividend and $66 million in share repurchase.","Now, in closing, let me review our fiscal \u201818 targets. We continue to target revenue for the fiscal year to be $24 billion to $24.5 billion in constant currency. We are increasing our full year target for non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations to a range of $7.25 to $7.75, which includes the benefit of lease reclassification and corresponding fair value adjustments of the assets associated with the leases. Our EPS target assumes a tax rate of 25% to 30% for the full year as we continue to work on tax planning strategies to optimize our effective tax rate. Our adjusted free cash flow for the fiscal 2018 will now be 90% of adjusted net income since net income will now include the benefit of the lease conversion and corresponding asset adjustments.","And with that, I will hand the call back to the operator for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs.","Jim Schneider","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good job on the quarter. I wanted to maybe start with revenue question came in a little bit better than our expectation, but can you maybe Mike help us with an update on your conversations with clients. Any update on the dialogue regarding customer to synergies, specifically some of larger customers like the UK government, the U.S. Navy etcetera and maybe just give us a sense of how your progress is going with up-selling existing clients to increase their contract size in exchange for cost synergies etcetera?","Mike Lawrie","Yes, it was the \u2013 in terms of the UK we continue to see a runoff there I am not sure I got this synergy, it\u2019s more a reflection of some of the contracts concluding, but we still see pressure in the UK around some of the dis-synergies. On a global basis, I would say the revenue dis-synergies are pretty much tracking as we thought, I would say, probably a little bit less than what we had originally planned at the Investor Day. In terms of conversations with clients, I mean I got to tell you, we just had our global customer advisory board in London several weeks ago. We have got Americas Advisory Board going on this week in New York. I mean, the clarity of the messaging back to us is incredible. Every one of these clients is trying to figure out how they can improve their current IT operations. This is through automation, it\u2019s through simplification. It\u2019s a whole host of different things. And then we continue to encourage them to take those savings and invest in other digital platforms, whether it be the modernization of applications or new cloud native applications, the deployment of those, or cybersecurity platforms or analytics are moving to a hybrid cloud environment. So, we have done several deals very similar to the one that we announced before. So, the messaging back from the clients and our messaging to the clients has not changed one bit, they like our scale, they like the breadth of our portfolio, the partnerships that we have are clearly differentiated. In many cases, we are showing up as one in front of those clients which they readily appreciate and simplifies their decision-making. So, I\u2019d say the continued challenge we have, Jim, is to continue to attract and retain and retrain the talent necessary to capitalize on those opportunities. And that\u2019s one of the reasons we put this digital transformation even in place as we begin to pilot a different approach to some of these clients by helping build the methodologies and the tools and the process and procedures to help with a complete end-to-end digital transformation.","Jim Schneider","That\u2019s very helpful color. Thanks. And then maybe one for Paul, with respect to the $1 billion of any of your cost synergies, if I just mathematically look at the $140 million you achieved in the first quarter and I believe you said $110 million in the second quarter and run this through for the impact of the full year, even understanding we are kind of getting into the second half of the year now, any reason to believe you wouldn\u2019t be tracking ahead of those or any reason to believe those cost synergies would slow materially heading into Q3 and Q4?","Paul Saleh","We are just really are on track to meet and maybe slightly above that $1 billion. Again, the second half of the year will have less of an impact on the overall synergy realization. I think the things that we do in the first half of the year are so critical for us. And I think right now, we are tracking to the $1 billion to slightly above.","Mike Lawrie","And Jim, we still have lot of work to do. So, this is not a lay down here and there is still a lot of work to do as we continue to integrate the company. So this is business as usual as we march forward here in the second half of the year.","Jim Schneider","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Darrin Peller, Barclays.","Darrin Peller","Thanks, guys. First question is just on overall growth. I mean, I guess USPS accelerated quite a bit and maybe I missed it on the call, but I didn\u2019t hear any good explanation as to what drove the year-over-year acceleration there? And then really on top of that, I mean when we look at the GBS and GIS segment sequentially, revenue looks fairly stable at this point. Is there anything again that would \u2013 any seasonality or anything else or should we now start to expect that the majority of the revenue that you have been trying to address given the areas that you don\u2019t think made sense from its global pricing. Is that coming closer to finalization now so that we can have more sequential stable, maybe start to show some of the new add-ons benefit your year-over-year over the next few quarters?","Mike Lawrie","I would not draw that conclusion. I think there is still \u2013 there is many things in the second half of the year. We have got price-downs which is consistent with\u2026","Darrin Peller","Okay.","Mike Lawrie","Our season plan that needs to be factored. And so I would not get off the original sort of track that we have provided for you. What we are seeing is we are seeing moderation and some of the headwinds in the ITO business. And more importantly, we are seeing good growth in our digital offerings as we reported this quarter and we are seeing pretty good growth in our industry IP and BPS, particularly when you adjust for run-off of some of these big healthcare contracts. I would jump to any conclusions here that there is a significant change over what we have already talked about. In the case of USPS, the USPS has a pretty significant backlog and as they hire more people and bring those people on, then they are able to build that revenue out and that\u2019s up a partial explanation to why you saw slight acceleration in the revenue.","Darrin Peller","Okay.","Mike Lawrie","And then candidly, we have had some acquisitions. So, we added Tribridge which is the big Microsoft Dynamics business that we bought out of Tampa and those businesses are also performing well, which is again providing some offset to the revenue dis-synergies and the decline in the ITO business.","Darrin Peller","Okay. So it sounds like the GBS, GIS core commercial side of your business could still see similar year-over-year declines at similar rates, maybe not worse, not much better in the near term, but obviously trending the right way. And USPS, it sounds like that could be sustainable, I mean, it was an improvement overall just based on the math?","Mike Lawrie","Yes, except I will say to you that last year, you remember on the USPS side, everything has shifted by a little bit from a timeline. Remember, this is my first comment about \u2013 our second quarter basically is their first quarter so to speak. So, I think the comparison with the third quarter will be a little bit more difficult. I would look at it much more sequentially, sequentially they grew.","Darrin Peller","Okay.","Mike Lawrie","And they are in good position to continue to do well for the remainder of the year.","Darrin Peller","Alright. And then just \u2013 that\u2019s helpful. Just a quick follow-up and then I will turn it back, but Paul when we look at the new guide for EPS of 750, midpoint 750. Should we still expect the 20%, you guys have given 20% CAGR through 2020 and obviously I know you guys are just coming out of that, but is the CAGR held still on track just after the capital lease adjustments were made?","Mike Lawrie","I think you have to exclude the capital lease adjustment, because what the capital lease adjustment particularly when you start to adjust the asset to fair market value gives you that benefit that is going to be playing out over the next 2 to 3 years, 2.5 years in a sense from remaining life. And so what I will suggest is when we got too wait a little bit till the end of this fiscal year, we will be updating basically when the USPS business spinning off and merging with those two other businesses and we will give you a better feel for what remained those targets will look like.","Darrin Peller","Okay, alright. That\u2019s fair. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Up next we will hear from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Paul, just want to follow-up on that, of the increase in the guidance to $0.75 it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s all lease reclassifications or is that all lease reclassification, just want to be clear there?","Paul Saleh","I think there is in total about $0.53 in the sense of reclassification \u2013 the reclassification on the full year basis, $0.26 of it came into the second quarter, because there was a catch-up to the first half of the year and $0.13 per quarter. So if you add that it\u2019s about $0.53 for the full year and then we have done a little bit better than given the synergies a little bit better than we had expected in the first half of the year.","Bryan Keane","And then did you say the lease reclassifications continue for another couple of years. So how do we model that going forward? I guess, it\u2019s going to change, the model is going to change that divestiture, but I guess just for today\u2019s purposes, would that continue going forward?","Paul Saleh","I think it has at least a term I would say on average of about 2.5 years.","Bryan Keane","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I just wanted to ask on the overall ITO mix and digital mix of percentage of revenue, I guess once we divest the USPS business, what would be the total mix of business of ITO of DXC and of digital once we get rid of USPS? Thanks so much.","Mike Lawrie","I don\u2019t know. I mean, we have to remodel that. As I said the digital business cuts across all three reporting segments, GIS, GBS as well as USPS, but we have not sort of dissected that and segmented that yet. What I would tell you in terms of the total mix, fundamentally, the digital business is growing about what we thought was growing and what we modeled in the Investor Day and the IP business is not growing quite as fast and that\u2019s largely due to be a runoff in the healthcare business. The insurance business is basically growing the way we thought it would grow and the PPS business continues to gain momentum as some of these large insurance contracts continue to come on stream. So, by and large and the ITO business is declining a little bit less than what we anticipated, but the mix hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed since the since the Investor Day.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then that ITO business mix, did that change, because I am trying to figure out that in the USPS numbers are not, is it a larger percentage or not as big in USPS?","Mike Lawrie","We do have some BPS business, particularly in state and then they do have their ITO. I think if you just really bear with us we will provide some of that breakdown a little bit more particularly after we falloff Form 10 we will be in a better position to share that information with you.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Up next will hear some Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Thank you. Just wondering how bookings, I know you gave out book-to-bill measures, nothing too surprising, but how did bookings come in versus planned and would that rolling in traditional runoff, does it change your thinking around the next couple of quarters in terms of revenue production?","Mike Lawrie","No. I think as I said at the end of the first quarter, the bookings are tracking pretty much the way we had expected. I think what I have been most pleased about has been the digital bookings. So, we are seeing pretty good growth on the digital bookings. And that\u2019s an important measure of the backlog and in future revenue generation. The other thing I shared in previous call and we haven\u2019t been able to really quantify we are still probably at least several quarters out as we have moved sales force to an annual build revenue measure and we are seeing some benefit of that, because it provides more focus in your revenue, that\u2019s on a rolling 12-month basis. So, we have seen some increase in our performance against that annual build revenue. The problem is in all candor we have no comparison with previous year. So, until we get a year under our belt and understand little bit more, it\u2019s a little hard to ascribe a great deal of veracity or meaning to those numbers. However, what is clear is that we are seeing more focus on that annual build revenue, which I think is important and it also takes some of the focus off of total TCB, which often drove a capital intensity, which as you know we are trying to reduce the capital intensity as we go forward. So, there is a lot of knobs that we turned around sales compensation and how we are motivating the sales force so far, I think that\u2019s going well, but we have a lot more to learn before I am going to be comfortable giving you some sort of an equation that you can use in the models.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Alright. That\u2019s good to hear. Just on the \u2013 within the digital since you mentioned it, cloud obviously up strong digital. I guess security revenue this quarter looks a little bit different than the bookings, which was strong. So, is that an area where we might see DXC sort of double down more on the security side, just trying to understand the priorities within the digital book?","Mike Lawrie","I would say to be candid price of disappointment in that security number. That security number is driven a lot by our consultants or advisors and that is a highly competitive market in terms of skills. So, the more people that you can hire, then the more billings you generate. And as I said, we hired quite a few people in the quarter and that shows up in the improved book-to-bill, but the revenue in some respect demonstrates the fact that some of those people were not in place as we entered the merger and we progressed through the first quarter. So, there is always a time lag on some of these trends, but you are right the book-to-bill is usually an early or leading indicator.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Okay. We\u2019ll watch for that. Thank you.","Operator","Next up from Citi, we\u2019ll hear from Ashwin Shirvaikar.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thanks. So my first question is on digital growth it\u2019s good to see that number. I guess the question is as some of these digital contracts ramp and you prove out your digital capabilities are you seeing a difference in perception from your clients, which can kind of lead to resurgence in sort of good work the circle of demand from them or is it too early?","Mike Lawrie","Yes, I mean, yes, that not \u2013 that\u2019s a good question. What we are seeing is when our clients understand the full breadth of our offerings, frankly, that does change their perceptions. We see this show up all time when our clients are visiting our digital transformation centers in India, the UK or we just announced a new centers in Australia in the last about two weeks ago. So yes, that is changing the perception. The other thing is many of these digital solutions start out small. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing steady new logo ground around some of these new digital offerings and our quick start program is geared to that as well. So many times we\u2019re going in with our partners on offerings that start out much smaller in scope, but if you deliver you then have a chance to really grow and that is the difference it\u2019s think of it more as a journey then as just one contract it\u2019s in place for 5 years. So over time as we deliver against those digital platforms in a digital roadmap one that does change the perception, yes, that does create a virtuous cycle and it also creates a backlog rather than see price pressures over a period of 5 or 10 years like a traditional ITO contract. You actually see the opportunity to grow that contract and then grow that engagement over time. And that is a remix that we\u2019re talking about of the business. So these digital offerings have a different composition they have a different profile than some of the more traditional businesses.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. Good to hear. And one for Paul, Paul, yes, I get the segment level impact from the lease reclass. Is that also tax impact that persists?","PaulSaleh","A tax, did you say?","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Tax, yes, yes, right.","Paul Saleh","No, I think the tax rate that we apply, I think it all depends where the leases are in the USPS side, the leases are U.S. based. I don\u2019t think it makes a ton of difference to the tax rates.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. And since it\u2019s topical staying on tax rate, in your early analysis of the year proposal have kind of come out any takeaways that that we should take from that?","Mike Lawrie","Not yet, I mean we\u2019ve got some really just basic modeling on this and don\u2019t really have anything I feel comfortable sharing, yes, I mean, certainly would be a benefit. And I really want to see what comes out of the markup this week with the house and then what comes out it\u2019s so still early days in terms of understanding that impact.","Paul Saleh","But having said that though it is the lower U.S. tax rate goes from 35% to 20% that\u2019s there won\u2019t be a plus for us from a mix perspective given our income and some of the other provisions again are so much in influx right now that the net that I think it would be of benefit to us.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. Thank you. Congratulations, guys.","Operator","Next up is Bryan Bergin, Cowen & Company.","Bryan Bergin","Hi, guys. Can you about your non-federal government business, the public services businesses that and is that something that you can carve out and trying to understand if there are synergies there relative to your commercial business as well?","Mike Lawrie","Yes, there are some synergies, I mean we have a very large UK public sector business, we got a very substantial Australian public sector business, we\u2019ve got a very strong business in France, we\u2019ve got a very strong business in Germany and there are a lot of synergies between those public sector businesses and what we\u2019re doing on the commercial side. We share the same solutions, we share the same partnerships, we go to market. So yes, I don\u2019t is not something that we are planning to carve out. The U.S. federal government is a very unique marketplace is just like the state Medicaid business that we have in the U.S. that\u2019s not being carved out, that\u2019s part of our commercial business and is part of our worldwide health vertical, but the U.S. federal government is a slightly different, different animal, but in all cases whether it would be Australia, France or the U.K. it\u2019s all about trying to drive this digital transformation. We were in Australia couple weeks ago and the Australian government is taking a very strong position on digitizing their business processes and workflows and moving forward. So that\u2019s exactly what the commercial clients are doing. So in that sense there is quite a bit of synergy.","Bryan Bergin","Okay. And that\u2019s helpful. I heard the growth rates across digital, the industry IP and BPS, did you breakout share, where those are now as a share of revenue?","Mike Lawrie","No, what I said is the mix is about what we said it was when we did the Investor Day, nothing has shifted dramatically from there.","Bryan Bergin","Alright. Thank you.","Paul Saleh","If you remember on Investor Day we were saying that our digital business is running at about $4 billion on a run-rate basis, it\u2019s a little bit higher than that and then the industry I see it is a little bit less than the [indiscernible].","Mike Lawrie","Due to the run off in the UK, so net-net, it\u2019s about the same.","Bryan Bergin","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Next we will hear from Rayna Kumar, Evercore.","Rayna Kumar","Good evening. You saw some really strong bookings across your newer work like cloud security and analytics. Is that type of bookings growth sustainable going forward? And could you comment on the pricing trends you saw with these new bookings?","Paul Saleh","Well, the pricing is of course much different in a lot of these digital businesses, because many of these are much more consumption based and over time as the volumes as the transactions grow then our revenue from those offerings increases. So the dynamic, the pricing dynamics around many of these new offerings are entirely different than our traditional ITO business or our application maintenance and management business, which usually characterized by longer term contracts that have significant productivity improvements baked into that. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying it\u2019s really a different \u2013 a different world and we\u2019re developing and piloting new pricing tools around these digital offerings that are more consumption \u2013 consumption base. So the trends within that are they have not materially changed at all. We continue to see the pricing pressure due to productivity expectations and the more traditional business and it\u2019s really way too early to understand the long-term consequences more as a service consumption based pricing in the new offerings.","Rayna Kumar","Thank you.","Mike Lawrie","Operator, we\u2019ll do one more question and then we\u2019ll close.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Our final question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal","Thanks for squeezing me in here guys. I wanted to ask about synergy realization on the labor side and first on the optimization of your labor footprint meaning moving in the right shoring more headcount. Can you talk about the challenges or points of friction in doing and doing that operational logistical political, how much runway is where are we out in the process, I know you talked about a pretty material move in the context of the merger. So, sort of an update on where we are and sort of also on how \u2013 what are the challenges you faced kind of accelerating that shift or at least tracking?","Mike Lawrie","Yes, let me give you a couple of thoughts on that. One, I don\u2019t really see the political so much. I think what you have to understand is that the labor dynamics around these digital transformation projects are much different than the labor dynamics around the outsourcing business. So when you talk about digital offerings and digital transformation with our partners you do talk about much more client intimacy. These are projects that are often done locally sometimes with land and resource, but in any regard, they have really done very local. When we talk about right shoring, we don\u2019t necessarily talk about offshoring. Probably the biggest hurdle we have when we do choose to move workload to a right sourcing location is just the transition. So, you go as you have to ramp up the skill some place else before the skills in the current place could be redeployed or optimized. I would also say that automation is clearly adding a different dimension. So rather than thinking about moving positions from point A to point B in many cases we can displace those and retrain those people around our digital profile.","The other thing is as we rethink our labor strategies we are thinking much more about college graduates we are thinking about internships program, we are thinking about co-op programs. We are thinking about different training programs, because the mix of our business as it changes over the next 3 or 4 years will have an entirely different labor dynamic than what we have seen in the traditional businesses. So, it\u2019s a combination of rethinking how you bring people in, that\u2019s what our dynamic talent cloud is all about, it\u2019s about retraining, it\u2019s is about reskilling and it\u2019s about a whole different approach to where we setup our locations. I have said before we are looking at creating some lower cost facilities in the United States and moving some of our workload there. So, it\u2019s that mix of location that the type of businesses in the digital business requires more customer intimacy is it driven by productivity improvements and then that drives a whole reskilling, training and recruiting process. And that\u2019s what makes this so exciting and I think so a dynamic as we move forward.","Ramsey El-Assal","Alright, thanks so much. I will leave it there.","Mike Lawrie","Okay. Well, listen guys, thank you again very much for your interest and look forward to catching up after the first of the year. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8114":["DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call May 24, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Jonathan Ford - Head of Investor Relations","Mike Lawrie - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Paul Saleh - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Arvind Ramnani - KeyBanc","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","David Grossman - Stifel","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the DXC Technology Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 Results Call. Today's call is being recorded.","At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jonathan Ford, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Jonathan Ford","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased you are joining us for the DXC Technology's fourth quarter and year-end fiscal 2018 earnings call. Our speakers on today's call will be Mike Lawrie, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer. The call is being webcast at dxc.com\/investorrelations and we posted slides to our website which will accompany the discussion today.","Slide 2 explains that the discussion will include comparisons of our results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018 to our pro forma combined company results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2017. The pro forma results are based on the historical quarterly statements of operations of each of CSC and the legacy Enterprise Services business of HPE or HPES, giving effect to the merger as if it had been consummated on April 2, 2016.","As a consequence of CSC and HPES having different fiscal year-end dates, the pro forma combined company results include the results of operations of CSC for the three and 12 months ending March 31, 2017 and of HPES for the three and 12 months ending January 31, 2017.","Slide 3 and 4 as our participant -- the DXC Technology's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures, which we believe provide useful supplemental information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release, as well as in our supplemental slides. Both documents are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.","On Slide 4 you'll see that certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of risks and uncertainties is included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our annual report on Form 10-K that we'll file in the next few days and other SEC filings. I would like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call, except as required by law.","And now I'd like to introduce DXC Technology's Chairman, President and CEO, Mike Lawrie.","Mike Lawrie","Okay, thank you. Welcome everyone. Thanks for taking the time this afternoon. As is my practice I've got four or five key points which I'll go over briefly and then get into a little more detail before I turn it over to Paul and then we'll have plenty of time for any questions that you may have. So, first point here is our fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.28. For fiscal 2018 our non-GAAP EPS was $7.94. Adjusted EBIT was $1.17 billion in the quarter and adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%. For fiscal 2018 adjusted EBIT was $3.499 billion, and adjusted EBIT margin was 14.2%.","We generated $557 million of adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2018 adjusted free cash flow was $2.427 billion. Our revenue in the fourth quarter was $6.294 billion, on a GAAP basis and revenue grew 4.3% year-over-year and was up 1.7% sequentially. In constant currency revenue was down 1.3% year-over-year, is roughly flat sequentially, and for fiscal 2018, revenue was $24.556 billion, the book-to-bill in the fourth quarter was 0.9, and for the full year it was 1x.","In the fourth quarter our digital revenue grew 21.6% year-over-year and 8.5% sequentially. For fiscal 2018 digital revenue grew 17%. And in the fourth quarter our industry IP and BPS revenue was up 7.9% year-over-year and was up 5.7% sequentially. For fiscal 2018 our industry IP and BPS revenue was roughly flat. In the fourth quarter, our digital book-to-bill was 1x and our industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 0.7.","Throughout fiscal 2018 we achieved key merger integration milestones and exceeded our synergy targets, delivering $1.1 billion of year one cost savings as well as $1.6 billion of run rate cost savings exiting the year. Also the separation of our U.S. public sector business in combination with Vencore Holding Corporation and KeyPoint Government Solutions will close at the end of this month forming Perspecta. And for fiscal 2019, we are targeting revenue of $21.5 billion to $22 billion which excludes the USPS business. And our non-GAAP EPS target is $7.75 to $8.15 and our adjusted free cash flow target is 90% or more of adjusted net income.","So let me just delve into little more detail in each of those. As I said our fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.28 and the effective tax rate was 29.4%. For fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS was $7.94 and the effective tax rate for the full year was 28.3%. Fourth quarter EBIT adjusted for restructuring integration and amortization of intangibles was $1.017 billion, and adjusted EBIT margin on that basis was 16.2%, which was up 600 basis points year-over-year and up 127 basis points sequentially.","For fiscal 2018 adjusted EBIT was $3.499 billion and the adjusted EBIT margin was 14.2% an improvement of 460 basis points. This margin improvement reflects execution of the synergy plans we outlined at our Investor Day last March including workforce optimization, supply chain efficiencies, policy harmonization and facilities rationalization.","Our delivery teams continue to drive increased productivity, while improving service levels for our clients. We've scaled your Bionix automation program to more than 50,000 employees in our delivery centers. These improvements address capabilities such as service tasks, incident management, server provisioning to eliminate labor, reduce disruptions and accelerate resolutions. For example, we deployed runbook automation to diagnose the most common application faults in developed scripted resolutions which then trigger predetermined corrective actions. In centers where this has been implemented roughly 70% of instances are auto diagnosed and resolved. During fiscal 2018, our Bionix program reduced our delivery labor expense by more than 3%.","In supply chain, we've scaled are labor improvement actions to extract greater efficiencies from third party spend including reduction of hardware and maintenance expense. Through our relationship with Turbonomics we were able to optimize workflows and cloud environments to increase utilization of virtual machines and reduce the infrastructure cost. We're also enhancing our delivery capabilities to handle more data center maintenance work internally, which reduces third-party expense, as well as dependence on equipment manufacturers.","We're further lowering maintenance expense through the deployment of consistent architectural standards, and client solutions, which improves predictability and reduces overall support costs. Collectively we delivered $1.1 billion of year one synergy realization versus our target of $1 billion. And adjusted free cash flow for the quarter as I said was $557 million or 84% of adjusted net income and for fiscal 2018 adjusted free cash flow was $2.427 billion or a 105% of adjusted net income.","Now let me turn to revenue. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $6.294 billion on a GAAP basis. Revenue grew 4.3% year-over-year and was up 1.7% sequentially. In constant currency revenue was down 1.3 year-over-year and was roughly flat sequentially. Book to bill in the fourth quarter was 0.9x. For fiscal 2018, revenue was $24.556 billion on a GAAP basis, and in constant currency revenue was $24.2 billion in line with the target of $24 billion to $24.5 billion. Book to bill for the year was 1x.","Now in the fourth quarter GBS revenue was $2.361 billion. GBS revenue grew 3.3% year-over-year and grew 2% sequentially. And this I think reflects the continued shift from traditional application services to enterprise and cloud applications. We're working with our clients to standardize and rationalize our application portfolios, which typically involves a shift from legacy custom applications to packaged enterprise applications such as Workday, SAP, Oracle and Microsoft Dynamics. Through the consolidation of application providers these workload transformations often result in greater revenue for DXC while lowering the overall cost for our clients.","GBS book to bill in the quarter was 0.9x and for fiscal 2018 GBS revenue was $9.254 billion, and a book to bill of 1.1x. In the quarter GBS segment margin was 19.9%, compared with 12.4% in the prior year. And for fiscal 2018 GBS margin was 16.9% which was up 480 basis points from the prior year. In the fourth quarter GIS revenue was $3.223 billion. GIS revenue grew 3.3% year-over-year and 2.5% sequentially. GIS revenue reflects growth in cloud and platform services as well as mobility and workplace.","Workplace and mobility grew 7.8% year-over-year and was up 67% year-over-year in bookings. This includes a new logo win with a major automotive manufacturer. Working with Microsoft, Citrix and ServiceNow DXC will deliver workplace and mobility services for the entire company across more than 125,000 users and 1,400 locations. Overall GIS bookings were $2.9 billion which were up 11% year-over-year and represented a book-to-bill 0.9x.","For fiscal 2018 GIS revenue was $12.479 billion and the book-to-bill was also 0.9x. In the quarter, GIS segment margin was 14.8% compared with 11.4% in the prior year, reflecting productivity improvements in the automation process. In fiscal 2018, GIS margin was 13.6% which was up 340 basis points from the prior year.","During the fourth quarter USPS revenue was $710 million, USPS revenue was up 11.1% year-over-year and was down 2.2% sequentially. USPS bookings of $522 million represent a book-to-bill of 0.7x. For fiscal 2018 USPS revenue was $2.83 billion and a book-to-bill of 0.7x. The USPS segment margin in the quarter was 17% and this was up 710 basis points year-over-year, and 180 basis points sequentially. And for fiscal 2018 USPS margin was 14.8%, which was up 390 basis points from the prior year.","I'll talk more in a moment about the separation of USPS business and the combination with Vencore and KeyPoint. And during this first quarter of operation DXC expanded its client base by adding more than 90 new logo deals greater than $1 million in total contract value.","Now let me turn to digital. Our digital revenue was up 21.6% year-over-year and was up 8.5% sequentially. Digital book-to-bill was 1x in the quarter and as we've discussed digital cuts across all three of DXCs reporting segments of GBS, GIS and USPS and includes enterprise cloud apps and consulting cloud infrastructure, analytics and security. And for fiscal 2018 digital revenue grew 17%.","Enterprise cloud apps and consulting revenue was up 38% year-over-year and up 88.5% sequentially. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.2x. This growth reflects continued traction with our clients including a recent app transformation deal with a major communications provider. By consolidating its portfolio under a single service provider we are reducing their operational costs, driving consistent and improved service levels and reducing overall risk through more stable business operations. We're also deploying application development as a service which gives the client access to a highly flexible resource pool while providing predictable pricing for project work.","Cloud revenue was up 29% year-over-year and was up 12.6% sequentially. Bookings were up 50% year-over-year with a book to bill of 0.9x. Drivers of the revenue and bookings growth in cloud include a major deal with a large healthcare company. DXC partnered with the client to create an everything as a service solution across hardware, software, facilities and services incorporating offerings from Microsoft Azure, Dell EMC, HPE, HP and AT&T. This transformation allows the client to reduce its operating budget while also avoiding significant capital expense. In selecting DXC the client highlighted our experience in clinical healthcare technology infrastructure, our unique healthcare cloud on Azure solution and strong existing application support.","Analytics revenue was down 3.8% year-over-year but was up 9% sequentially. We continue to gain traction across our client base as we drive adoption of Artificial Intelligence. For example we're working with automotive manufacturers to accelerate autonomous driving R&D, and we detect possible money laundering crimes for financial institutions. Book to bill in the quarter was 0.7x. Security revenue was down 1.3% year-over-year and was up 1.4% sequentially. We continue to invest in expanding our security consulting capabilities, as well as our standard mobile security delivery platform. Book to bill in the quarter was 1x.","Industry IP and BPS includes our IP offerings in healthcare, insurance, travel and transportation and banking, as well as our industry BPS business. Industry IP and BPS revenue grew 7.9% year-over-year and was up 5.7% sequentially. Book to bill was 0.7x in the quarter. For fiscal 2018 industry IP and BPS revenue was roughly flat. Industry IP revenue grew 7.3% year-over-year and was up 5.9% sequentially. Industry IP growth was primarily driven by strong revenue performance in our healthcare sector, including growth in our state Medicaid accounts. Book to bill in the quarter was 0.4, reflecting the lumpiness of contract awards in this segment.","BPS revenue was up 8.5% year-over-year and up 5.5% sequentially. Book to bill in the quarter was 1.1x. Revenue growth reflects the continued ramp up of our large BPS contracts with insurance companies. We also continue to modernize our portfolio with a focus on robotics for shared services, including the launch of Bionix as an offering. Bionix provides an industrialized operating model leveraging analytics and Artificial Intelligence, Lean process design and leading automation capabilities to create comprehensive high-performance approaches to services delivery. DXC launched Bionix in response to client demand for greater IT performance and the need to digitally transform traditional IT environments and processes.","In the quarter we continue to expand our offerings and partnered solutions including the launch of DXC Open Health Connect, a digital health platform that allows healthcare providers to improve quality of care and patient outcome by providing data when and where it is needed across the healthcare ecosystem. We co-created Open Health Connect with a large academic and research hospital system in New York and have also worked with several of our strategic partners including Microsoft and ServiceNow.","In response to our client's need for an accelerated process to evaluate and transform their applications state we created the DXC Modernization Studio. The studio features 48 client experience datasets with data from 500,000 enterprise applications. DXC leverages the studio provide clients with an assessment and recommendation in as little as two weeks, a process that used to take up to six months. And we're investing in our people and we're investing in our business consistent with the plan we outlined at Investor Day.","We recently announced the acquisition of Sable37 and Ebix which will be combined with DXC's Eclipse practice to significantly expand our Microsoft Dynamics 365 Cloud capabilities globally. This represents a key part of our strategy to leave the Microsoft partner marketplace and accelerate digital transformation journeys for our clients. We also continue to invest on our people. DXC employees completed more than 1.5 million hours of training with a heavy focus on digital certifications and AWS, Microsoft Azure and Dynamics, ServiceNow and Agile development.","We also expanded our sales training and certification program beyond our go-to-market teams and more than 17,000 employees have completed the training and passed the certification exam. And we continue to expand the DXC Dynamic Talent Cloud, our cloud sourcing platform that enables us to bring new people skills to DXC in a more flexible way. We are working with partners such as Upwork, PoliTricks, HackerEarth and LinkedIn to scale the platform and we now have more than 7,000 subscribers engaged.","Once again DXC was ranked in the top 20 on Corporate Responsibility Magazine's ranking of the 100 best corporate citizens. This ranking recognizes DXC's performance across seven categories; environmental impact, climate change, employee relations, human rights, governance, finance, philanthropy and community support.","One the fourth point that I wanted to just get into little more detail before I turn it over to Paul, we continue to achieve key merger integration milestones during the fourth quarter and really successfully completed the overall year one integration roadmap for DXC. We delivered $1.1 billion in year one cost savings versus the target of $1 billion and $1.6 billion of run rate cost savings exiting fiscal 2018 versus the target of $1.5 billion. The separation of U.S. public sector business in combination with Vencore and KeyPoint to form Perspecta will close of the end of the month.","Integration activities for Perspecta have gone well and the company is set to begin operating as a stand-alone company. The operating model is in place and the leadership has begun to execute as an integrated team. And importantly, the response to the launch of Perspecta has been consistently favorable from key stakeholders. Perspecta held its Investor Day earlier this month and will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 1st. The Perspecta management team will continue meeting with investors, employees and partners over the coming weeks to discuss the new company and we at DXC plan to hold a separate Investor Day this fall.","Now finally, during our first year DXC did track a bit ahead of plan on revenue. And when we set our revenue target at $24 billion to $24.5 billion, we expected 2 to 3 points of revenue dissynergy during the year. We continue to see this playing out. But, so far we have seen less impact than what we had expected. Profits during the first year were also better than expected as we were able to accelerate many of the cost takeout synergies, including reduced management layers and global deployment of our automation program Bionix. We also benefited from lease reclassification, tax reform and a one-time FX gain.","Turning to next year, for fiscal 2019 we expect revenue to be $21.5 million to $22 billion which excludes the USPS business. There are several positive things contributing to that target, as well as a couple of mitigating factors. We continue to accelerate the growth in our digital and industry IP offerings and our BPS business is also demonstrating strong momentum. We do expect some additional revenue dissynergies next year, as well as the ongoing headwinds in traditional services that we have previously discussed.","Also, the revenue from our HPE contract associated with the merger will normalize this year at a bit lower rate and we continue to gauge the potential impact of Brexit in our UK business. We're targeting non-GAAP EPS of $7.75 to $8.15 and adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul and then we'll come back to answer any questions.","Paul Saleh","All right thank you Mike and greetings everyone. Before I review the fourth quarter and full year for DXC I'd like to take a moment to clarify the basis of our financial presentation. First, all the references to the unaudited pro forma statements of operations from the prior year include the results of operations of CSC for the three and 12 months ended March 31, 2017 and of HPES for the three and 12 months ended January 31, 2017. Second, the fiscal '17 pro forma statements of operations and those have been now revised to reflect purchase price accounting and lease adjustments as if the merger had occurred on April 2, 2016.","In addition we have continued to assume a flat tax rate of 27.5% in the prior year pro forma non-GAAP results. And lastly our non-GAAP results exclude special items such as restructuring, integration, separation and amortization of intangibles consistent with DXC's non-GAAP method from prior years.","And with that I'll now [Technical Difficulty] items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results this quarter. In the current we have restructuring costs of $208 million pretax or $0.50 per diluted share. These costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expense associated with facilities and data center rationalization. Also in the quarter we had a $124 million pretax or $0.33 per diluted share of integration, separation and transaction related costs. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $153 million pretax or $0.37 per diluted share in the quarter.","Also in the quarter our annual re-measurement of pension assets and liabilities resulted in a gain of $203 million. So adjusted EBIT excluding the impact of these special items was $1.017 billion for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS was $2.28. For the full-year restructuring, integration, separation and transaction costs amounted to $1.2 billion pretax or $3.06 per diluted share which is below the $1.3 billion spend envelope we laid out for fiscal '18. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $591 million pretax or $1.37 per diluted share for the full year. Adjusted EBIT for the full year was $3.499 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $7.94.","Turning now to our fourth quarter and full-year results in more detail. Revenue in the quarter was $6.294 billion on a GAAP basis. Revenue was up 4.3% year-over-year and 1.7% sequentially. In constant currency revenue was down 1.3% year-over-year and roughly flat sequentially. For the full year revenue was $24.556 billion on a GAAP basis, in constant currency revenue was $24.2 billion in line with our fiscal 2018 target of $24 billion to $24.5 billion. EBIT in the quarter was $1.017 billion after adjusting for special items. Adjusted EBIT margin on that basis was 16.2% compared with 10.2% in the prior year and 15% in the last quarter.","For the fiscal year 2018, adjusted EBIT was $3.499 billion and adjusted EBIT margin was 14.2% up 460 basis points versus the prior year. The improvement in profitability reflects cost actions taken to optimize our workforce, harmonize our policies, extract greater supply chain efficiencies and rationalize our real estate footprint. In the fourth quarter we continue to rebalance our workforce. We've reduced our labor base by an additional 2.2% in the quarter through continued deployment of our automation program Bionix as well as additional best shoring and pyramid correction.","For the full year we've reduced our labor base by 12.6%, net of new hires and contractor conversions. We continue to rebalance our skill mix, including the hiring of roughly 20,000 new employees during the year with a significant focus on digital capabilities. In supply chain we continue to extract efficiencies from our third-party spend and we've reduced third-party labor expense by roughly 6% during the year.","We're also reducing our hardware and maintenance expense by optimizing workflows to improve utilization of virtual machines and leveraging internal capabilities where feasible for the highest volume maintenance activities. In real estate we eliminated an additional [Technical Difficulties] space during the quarter and for the full year we've reduced our total square footage by 4.7 million square feet, representing a reduction of almost 20%.","So in summary we delivered more than $1.1 billion of in year savings, which translates to roughly $1.6 billion of run rate savings exiting the year. Excluding USPS in year savings were approximately $1 billion in fiscal '18 and run rate savings exiting the year were $1.4 billion. In fiscal 2019 we're targeting an incremental $400 million of in year savings in addition to the run rate benefit from the actions taken during fiscal 2018. Now the combined savings of $800 million will be partially offset by $200 million to $250 million of headwinds including stranded G&A costs, the [Q1] FX benefits and the off to cap lease impacts.","We're also planning to reinvest an incremental $200 million to $250 million from those savings in the business in line with the capital allocation model we outlined at our Investor Day. Now these investments include the continued deployment of the DXC digital platform Bionix, enhancements in our digital workforce and capabilities, BPS Agile and Robotic process automation and Blockchain capabilities.","Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $2.28, adjusted for special items. And for the full-year non-GAAP EPS was $7.94. In the quarter our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.4%, reflecting our global mix of income and an unfavorable valuation allowance related to tax attributes in certain foreign jurisdictions. And for fiscal 2018 our non-GAAP tax rate was 28.3%, which was in line with the non-GAAP tax targets for the full year of 25% to 30%. Bookings in the quarter were $5.4 billion for an overall book-to-bill ratio of 0.9x. And for the full year bookings were $23.67 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.","Now let's turn to our segment results. Global Business Services revenue was $2.36 billion in the fourth quarter. GBS revenue was up 3.3% year-over-year and was up 2% sequentially. In constant currency revenue was down 2.2% year-over-year but flat sequentially. In the fourth quarter GBS segment profit was $470 million and profit margin was 19.9% compared with 12.4% in the prior year and 18.6% in the third quarter. This margin improvement reflects cost take out actions. GBS bookings were $2.04 billion in the quarter for a book-to-bill of 0.9x. Now for the full-year GBS revenue was $9.254 billion, segment profit was $1.563 billion, margin was 16.9% and bookings were $10.2 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.","Turing now to Global Infrastructure Services revenue was $3.223 billion in the quarter. GIS revenue was up 3.6% year-over-year and was up 2.5% sequentially. In constant currency revenue was down 3.2% on a year-over-year basis but flat sequentially. In the fourth quarter GIS segment profit was $477 million and profit margin was 14.8% compared with 11.4% in the prior year and 14.7% in the third quarter. Profitability improvements in GIS reflects the impact of cost actions we have taken to drive greater operating efficiencies including best shoring, labor pyramid rebalancing, benefits from our Bionix automation program and supply chain savings. Bookings for GIS were $2.86 billion in the quarter for a book-to-bill of 0.9x. For the full year GIS revenue was $12.48 billion, segment profit was $1.7 billion, margin was 13.6% and bookings were $11.6 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.9x.","Now turning to the USPS business, revenue was $710 million in the quarter up 11.1% year-over-year and down sequentially. USPS segment profit was $121 million in the quarter and profit margin was 17% compared with 9.9% in the prior year and 15.2% in the third quarter. The year-over-year margin improvement reflects cost actions taken during the year. Sequential margin improvement was driven by cost optimization ahead of the spin-off, as well as the timing of milestone and award fees.","Bookings for USPS were $522 million in the quarter for a book-to-bill of 0.7x. For fiscal 2018 USPS revenue was $2.82 billion, segment profit was $417 million, margin was up 14.8% and bookings were $1.9 billion, for a book to bill of 0.7x.","Now let me turn to some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $557 million, or 84% of adjusted net income and this reflects the annual 401(k) match payments and seasonal higher -- seasonally higher payroll taxes. Adjusted free cash flow does not include any proceeds from receivables securitization program. For fiscal 2018 adjusted free cash flow was $2.427 billion or 105% of adjusted net income. Our CapEx was $471 million in the quarter or 7.5% of revenue and for the full year CapEx was $1.76 billion, or 7.2% of revenue.","Now, during the quarter we returned a $123 million of capital to our shareholders, consisting of $51 million in dividends and $72 million in share repurchases. And for the full year we've returned $311 million of capital to our shareholders, of which a $174 million was in dividends and a $137 million was in share repurchase. And for fiscal 2019 we expect to resume our pace of share repurchase in line with our capital allocation model.","Now today our Board authorized an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.19 per share, as well as $0.76 per share for the full year of fiscal 2019. DXC will not adjust its dividend as a result of the spin out of our USPS business. Therefore, shareholder will receive this dividend in addition to any dividend paid by Perspecta. Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.6 billion. Our total debt was $8.4 billion including capitalized leases. Net debt to total capitalization ratio was 25.8%. Now as part of the USPS spin off DXC is expected to receive $984 million from Perspecta. On that basis, the net debt to total capitalization of the company would be 18.8%.","Now let me close with fiscal '19 targets, all of which will now exclude USPS. Our targeting revenue for the fiscal year to be $21.5 million to $22 million. This compares with $21.7 billion in fiscal '18. Our fiscal 2019 target for non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations is $7.75 to $8.15. Now this compares with roughly $6.70 for fiscal 2018, which was recast to exclude earnings-per-share associated with the USPS business and adjusted for any stranded G&A cost. Our EPS target assumes a tax rate of 24% to 28% for the full year and our adjusted free cash flow target for fiscal 2019 is 90% or more of adjusted net income.","Now I hand the call back to the operator for a Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Will take our first question from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","I want to start with asking Paul can you talk about the cadence of revenues and profit improvement for the quarters through fiscal '19 as the layout and perhaps also provide clarification on some of the basic stuff and I can expect in FX will impact kind of the mixed pack state and the share comp that you are using?","Paul Saleh","Yes. So I think right now if you look at the guidance that -- the target that we have given you for the full-year of $21.5 billion to $22 billion, it will be right now -- and we expect that this is again for the commercial business only because USPS is going to be spun-off as of June 1st. I want to make sure everybody is clear on that. And I think what we will see is a relatively consistent performance throughout the year growing a little bit more in the second half of the year on a sequential basis. I mentioned the tax rate again of 24% to 28% I think using a midpoint right now would be appropriate and as I mentioned we will resume our share buybacks so we would expect to retire more shares this year than we have done this past year and will try to catch up on our capital. There is something aligned more with our capital allocation model.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. And the incremental synergies $400 million it sounds good on top of what you have already achieved. But can you speak as to whether that includes the impact of Bionix and I guess the improvements seen on a smaller scale as you try these things out but the industrialization of Bionix can you talk about that the potential for that?","Mike Lawrie","It's hard to gauge what the long-term effect would be of the industrialization of Bionix. But this is going to have an impact and we are just counting on that right now. How much it is I don't -- I honestly can't quantify right now. But as we apply this capability to different aspects of our business we are seeing significant reductions in labor or said another way increased productivity. And we are marching along here sort of offering-by-offering, function-by-function, so we're doing this very deliberately and we started out the call centers and that will expand to other functional areas. But it's not just that it's also the whole approach to analytics and a whole set of other disciplines and methodologies to drive that. So the synergy target encompasses more than just effort. We're going to do more facilities rationalization.","We're going to continue to move our resources around the world. We're going to continue to focus on our pyramid. We've launched a major program to hire students and bring them in and interns and co-ops and a whole host of things to continue to lower our overall labor costs. We're making good progress with the Talent Cloud and we got 7,000 subscribers. So we're now publishing tasks or jobs or components of projects and putting that out to not only internal employees but to the external world. That will expand. That creates less friction and provides a highly value skills at lower cost. So you need to add those things altogether and I think of it more of an integrated program to continue to drive these synergies as we go forward. Does that help?","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","I just wanted to know about operating margins for GIS and for GBS. Just how we think about those throughout the year? Will they improve year-over-year each quarter as we go through the year? And then secondly, on the investments I know we're talking about $200 million and $250 million, just curious exactly what those investments are going into, and should we think about that as an annual expense in the business so even beyond this fiscal year that's something that's kind of necessary to keep the investment going into business?","Mike Lawrie","Yes, listen, we are -- we concluded this year towards the high-end of our range on the margins and as I said in my commentary that was a reflection of doing better in the synergy arena than what we had originally forecasted. We also saw less in dissynergies on the revenue side and we still expect to see some of those dissynergies on the revenue side and as we just talked about for the previous question, there're some additional cost synergies. But I'd say those margins will over time continue to increase. But the key point here is we are investing back in the business. So this is not just about taking costs out. We are continuing to invest in our Bionix program and we'll spend tens of millions of dollars in that program this year.","We are continuing to invest in our offerings, our digital workplace offerings, an example is gaining a lot of traction in the marketplace. We're continuing to invest in cyber. We're continuing to invest in analytics. So another investment area is the investment we're making with our partners, beginning to move some of our industry IP to different cloud platforms with our partners. So we moved some of our healthcare IP platform to Azure for example. We're making investments in IoT. We're making investments in Blockchain. So these are all areas of our offering portfolio where we're going to continue to make investments because we're seeing a return, we're seeing a return in terms of increased sales and revenue.","And in terms of other areas where the other major investment we're making is in our people. And we're continuing to invest very heavily in the re-training and re-skilling of employees, particularly those that want to re-skill and prepare themselves for the opportunities that marketplaces present. So, those are the three primary areas that we're continuing to invest in.","Paul Saleh","And Bryan I think in terms of the margin on the GBS side I think we would expect them to be in the high double digit to 20% starting a little bit lower in the first quarter and then moving on throughout the year because we have some seasonality typically in our GIS margins and the post separation is on somewhere in the -- between the 13% to 16% and I think again it will be growing reflecting as some of these margins also reflect the investment that we are making in the business. Now that's I hope answer your question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc.","Arvind Ramnani","When I look at the last year and certainly we have been busy with kind of some of the cost cuts and of course the USPS spin and when you look into the next like 12 to 18 months I mean you outlined some of your priorities but kind of can you more broadly outline what some of the major priorities are and in particular can you talk about some of the work that we will be doing that's going to drive revenue growth or are you going to be looking to do some larger deals?","Mike Lawrie","Well I would say all of the above. So our fundamental priorities as we look out at over the next 12 to 18 months is when we want to continue to drive productivity and the quality of our service delivery and it's still the major cost element in our business. And the degree that we can improve productivity and continue to see improved service levels that has a enormously positive impact on our business. Our customer satisfaction -- I said this in my commentary, our customer satisfaction actually went up. So in the first year of integration all we did customer satisfaction continued to increase. So continuing to drive our cost structure and the productivity and improve service delivery is an absolutely critical objective as we look out.","Digital, so yes we are making huge shift in our digital offerings. I have chronicled thus, I have shared with you what the growth is. We are beginning to change our route to market in terms of investing in our large accounts to put more digital resources. Our digital delivery centers we just opened or cut the ribbon yesterday on our digital delivery center down in New Orleans. So we are continuing to make a very significant investment in digital. We're engaging our delivery teams and helping us drive growth to our delivery teams. It's something we call our delivery led growth initiative.","And then of course the other priority is to continue to focus on our workforce management and this includes our ability to more accurately predict what skills we're going to need, how many we're going to need, how we source them. I just talked about the dynamic Talent Cloud, that's a whole different way of sourcing skills and capabilities, how we onboard people, how we retain people and how we are able to move them around from project to project. So workforce management, the re-skilling of our people is a key priority, our whole digital initiative as we continue to want to increase the percent of revenue that we get from digital to offset the natural headwinds we have in the ITO business, some of the other legacy businesses and then continue to focus on the quality of delivery and the productivity of delivery. So that's how we're driving growth, that's how we're driving the cost envelope and we're always looking opportunistically for acquisitions that would align with the strategy that I just outlined and as we've done the past years make those type of acquisitions, and I expect that that will continue.","Arvind Ramnani","And one quick follow-up. Looks like you're making good progress internally on automation and AI, are you able to take some of these solutions to your clients to actually drive revenue?","Mike Lawrie","Yes, you bet. I mean that's really the whole strategy is -- we just had our global customer advisory board and that's exactly what we're doing, we closed another deal today and it's part of the same exact framework. We go in, we know what this automation and analytics and other capabilities that we have. We know we can lower the cost of the existing infrastructure, we know that. Okay. Then what we do is we say -- and here are ways that you Mr. Client can reinvest in your business with our other offerings like our application modernization, or cyber or analytics or other things and that is the strategy.","Help free up the money through a simplified, more productive IT infrastructure, use those savings to reinvest in the digital platforms that help the clients on their transformation journey. That is the strategy, hasn't changed since our Investor Day. It now is beginning to get some real traction with our larger clients. And the IT industry is famous for talking about stuff years and years and years before it happens. I mean I got to tell you the Enterprise institutions around the world are now just getting to critical mass and many of these things that we in the IT industry have been talking about for five or six years. So, I think this gives us some optimism that the majority of our offerings are converging when our primary client base which is large enterprises around the world are beginning to gather pace in their own digital transformations.","Arvind Ramnani","And just if I could just squeeze one last one in, you mentioned Blockchain a couple of times. Are there particular types of clients that you're seeing sort of more interesting and I assume a lot of the work is still a little bit early and more sort of consulting in nature?","Mike Lawrie","Well I think Blockchain is a pretty pervasive technology that is going to change a lot of how transactions are done. Now just think -- our portfolio, think of insurance claims or think of healthcare claims as areas where Blockchain can be certainly leveraged. The supply chain would be another area. Where we've a lot of intermediary transactions, Blockchain it is I think going to over time eliminate or at least reduce a lot those intermediary steps in the end to end transaction and payment systems.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move onto Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","Jim Schneider","I was wondering if you can maybe provide us a little bit of color on the revenue trajectory you expect as you head throughout the year. I think Paul you referenced the back half of the year being a little bit better from a revenue standpoint. Would you expect to be executing any M&A throughout the year that could help that ultimate revenue trajectory and I guess maybe where you expect you might be from a revenue growth standpoint exiting this year?","Mike Lawrie","Well as I -- I'll let Paul answer, but as I said we will do some more acquisitions that I can tell you. I mean we have a pipeline of things we're looking at. Jim you know -- we just don't know when these things are going to close. They have their own sort of lifecycle. So you just -- you don't know that and most of what we do and classify more stuck-ins that are very consistent with our overall strategy of improving our digital offerings, Ebix and Sable37 are great examples of that in the Microsoft Dynamics arena.","So yes I do expect to get some help from those potential acquisitions, I just don't know when they are going to occur and I don't know what the whole year impact would be on revenue, because that's obviously time dependent.","Traditionally our revenue is a little lighter in the early part of the year and stronger in the back half of the year and we saw that this past year. So I don't -- some of that seasonality is something that's just the way the year plays out, so we would expect that as we progress through a fiscal '19. Paul you may want to?","Paul Saleh","And I think Mike you captured it, if I look at it this whole year we've seen an improvement throughout the year for first quarter and second quarter sequentially all the way through the fourth quarter. We will see a similar pattern in fiscal '19. If you look at the target that we have set out and if you take the midpoint of those targets it would be relatively flat year-over-year with a similar type of progression.","Mike Lawrie","And Jim I just don't know yet, I don't know some of the headwinds. I mean we -- I don't know how Brexit is going to play out. There is some great opportunities associated with Brexit to get many of those systems prepared for Brexit as an opportunity. It will also I think -- it also has created some indecision and delay and other decisions and projects we see. We expect to continue to see some revenue dissynergies as we are in the second year here, but I don't -- I can't quantify those for you.","We see growing momentum with our partners. I mentioned in my commentary BPS offerings in our industry, IP and some of our digital opportunity. No question we're seeing some momentum in growth. I mean I haven't been on a lot of earnings calls where I could actually use the word growth for the number. So we are seeing that and we're just giving you our best estimate right now where we see things playing out. Does that make sense Jim?","Jim Schneider","Yes, it does, thanks. And then maybe on the cost synergy side, you've alluded to in the past of maybe being ahead on the Bionix driving the cost of sales that you mentioned, but maybe being a little bit behind on supply chain. As you look through fiscal '19 what are some of the opportunities where you might kind of reaccelerate those cost synergies relative to how you've been progressing so far?","Paul Saleh","Yes, I think the areas where we have still a lot of opportunities will be in our contractor spend that's an area that we have made some progress, I mentioned 6% reduction year-over-year than in fiscal '18. There is more yet to be done there, particularly as we also apply our Bionix program to that segment of our spend. I do believe also that you are going to see a lot more also from our facilities, particularly in the data center arena where we have just really started. This year we have just already consolidated two of our [90 data centers. We have at least 10 in flight and more to come. So those are the areas where we see still some great opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from David Grossman with Stifel.","David Grossman","So Mike growth is definitely improving, although, on an overall basis, it remains negative year-over-year. Are you seeing any light at the end of the tunnel as it relates to the legacy business and perhaps you can share some of the data points that may give us a better sense of just how that legacy business is trending and whether it is actually starting to plateau?","Mike Lawrie","I think the way I look at it is I look at the amount of revenue that we're getting from these new offerings. Go back to the Investor Day that we had, whenever, when we had the chance last March. So we sort of laid out some projections around our digital growth, our industry IP and BPS growth and that's largely playing out that way slightly less growth than we laid out the first year, but it's basically playing out. The other thing is we had estimated a decline in the traditional legacy businesses primarily IP, but also our application maintenance and management business and we estimated what that curve would be. Now that curve wasn't as much as we had thought.","So, what happened this year, was we didn't see the decline as rapid as we had forecasted and we didn't see quite as much growth in some of the new offerings, and that got us sort of where we were -- where we are. The other thing that we're seeing is that when we do go into a client and we help them reduce their infrastructure costs, the reduction of those infrastructure costs is usually in a shorter timeframe than the revenue that we achieve from the digital platform growth. Again I don't want to go into too many client names now, but I'll give you an example of how this works.","So, we went in and reduced the infrastructure costs, by somewhere around 10% to 15% and that we began billing at a lower rate, two or three months after we initiated the agreement and then we began to get some of the reinvestment back into the digital platforms like our application modernization and some of our enterprise cloud apps business. That revenue is now starting to flow and the account is growing, so we're now forecasting growth in that account for the first time in seven years. But there was a -- not a delay but there was an interregnum where the revenue actually went down slightly more before it went up.","Those are -- that is -- I got to tell you that's very difficult to model. Because each thing is different. The transition to a digital workplace offering might take longer than the transition to a new cyber offering. So each of these has their own time scales, and each customer plays out slightly different. So what we try to give you is an aggregate, but the overall revenue model that we talked about over the two or three year period of time is absolutely intact with what we've discussed at the Investor Day. Does that give you the color you're looking for?","David Grossman","And just to follow that up then you are talking about '20 -- sorry if I missed it but do you have any plan or did you mention whether you are going to re-class that fiscal year '20 target that you laid out a year ago?","Paul Saleh","Yes we will. I think you can see already, initially our margin expectations were 14% to 15% and now we are already closer to the 15%. So it would be probably more likely the 15% to 16% if I had to make a guess now. And then the revenue I do believe is going to be fine because we were already factoring I guess sort of the USPS business was going to be in the same range of the 3% to 4% growth over that timeframe from before. So we will have an opportunity to update some of these.","Mike Lawrie","And that's why we wanted to do another meeting sometime this fall, so that we can give -- update those models and make sure everybody is on the same page post the formation of Perspecta.","Jonathan Ford","So we're going to now close questions. Paul wanted to have a final comment before we close the call.","Paul Saleh","I just really wanted to make sure that as we set the targets for fiscal '19, you are at least clear on the EPS. So I just want to make sure we -- that we said that we will do $7.75 to $8.15 that's the target range that we are having -- we expect for fiscal '19. Now this is how it works out, for fiscal '18 we have reported $7.94 now if you take out the USPS contribution that's a $1.03 and there is also some stranded costs that we will have to -- we are planning to take out but we have that's about $0.20. Then do you get $7.94 less the $1.03 less the $0.20 you get to the $6.70 that I referred to. So on a year-over-year basis I want to make sure that people have the right calibration. We go from $6.70 to $7.75 to $8.15 for the commercial DXC business which is a 16% to 22% growth on a comparable basis -- on a year-over-year basis.","Mike Lawrie","And with that operator we will close the call.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation."],"8113":["DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call February  8, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Mike Lawrie - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer","Paul Saleh - Chief Financial Officer","Jonathan Ford - Head of Investor Relations","Analysts","Damian Wille - Jefferies","Arvind Ramnani - KeyBanc","James Friedman - Susquehanna","Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley","Rod Bourgeois - DeepDive Equity Research","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of American","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the DXC Technology, Third Quarter FY \u201918 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over Mr. Jonathan Ford, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. ","Jonathan Ford","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased you are joining us for the DXC Technology, third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. Our speakers on today's call will be Mike Lawrie, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer.","The call is being webcast at dxc.com\/investorrelations and we posted slides to our website which will accompany the discussion today.","Slide two explains that the discussion will include comparisons of our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to our pro forma combined company results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The pro forma results are based on the historical quarterly statements of operations of each of CSC and the legacy Enterprise Services business of HPE or HPES, giving effect to the merger as if it had been consummated on April 2, 2016.","As a consequence of CSC and HPES having different fiscal year-end dates, the pro forma combined company results include the results of operations of CSC for the three and nine months ending December 30, 2016 and of HPES for the three and nine months ending October 31, 2016.","Slide three and four as our participant, the DXC Technology's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain further adjustment to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. ","In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release, as well as in our supplemental slides. Both documents are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.","On slide four you'll see that certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call.","A discussion of risk and uncertainties is included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. I would like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call, except as required by law.","And now I\u2019d like to introduce DXC Technology's Chairman, President and CEO, Mike Lawrie. ","Mike Lawrie","Okay, thank you everyone and thanks for your interest in DXC. I know there is a lot going on today. As is my custom I will share four or five key points and then Paul will go into a little more detail and then we\u2019ll open it up to any of your questions. ","Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.15, adjusted EBIT was $927 million and adjusted EBIT margin was 15% and we generated $686 million of adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter. ","Our revenue in the third quarter was $6.186 billion on a GAAP basis. All revenue comparisons exclude the impact of purchase price accounting and a one-time contract reset USPS last year. And on that basis revenue was down 4% year-over-year and was up 0.6% sequentially and in constant currency revenue was down 5.9% year-over-year and was up 0.8% sequentially. ","Sequential revenue growth reflects strong ad on in project sales in the quarter and our book-to-bill for the quarter was 1x. Our digital revenue grew 13% year-over-year and was down 3.3% sequentially reflecting contract milestone achievements in the second quarter. Year-to-date digital revenue was up 16%. ","Industry IP and BPS revenue was down 0.4% year-over-year and grew 1.1% sequentially. In the third quarter our digital book-to-bill was 1.1x and our industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 1.6x, including a large BPS life insurance deal that was completed in the quarter. ","Now during the third quarter we continue to achieve merger integration milestones. We are on track to deliver $1.1 billion or more of year one cost savings, which implies roughly $1.6 billion of run rate cost savings exiting fiscal 2018. The separation of our U.S. public sector business and combination with Vencore and KeyPoint continues to progress. Today we filed the Form 10 and now expect the deal to close in May to allow the necessary SEC reviews. ","Finally for fiscal 2018 we continue to target revenue of $24 billion to $24.5 billion in constant currency and we are increasing our fiscal 2018 target on non-GAAP EPS to a range of $7.50 to $8, reflecting additional synergy realization this year, and our adjusted free cash flow target remains 90% of adjusted net income. ","Now let me go into a little more detail on each of those points. ","As I said, third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.15. The effective tax rate was 28.7%. Third quarter adjusted EBIT was $927 million. Now adjusted EBIT margin was 15%. This was up 550 basis points year-over-year, and EBIT margin was up 180 basis points sequentially. All sequential margin comparisons adjust for the one-time catch-up impact of lease reclassifications during the second quarter. ","Now the EBIT improvement reflects ongoing cost actions we are taking consistent with the synergy plans outlined at our investor day. Our delivery teams continue to scale and accelerate our Bionics program to drive productivity through increased automation. These efforts address both internal labor, as well as third party contractors. ","We also enhanced our workforce management process to more cost effectively deliver existing business, while staffing the required labor for new business. In supply chain we continue to tighten controls on contractor spend, resulting in the elimination or conversion of thousands of contractor roles. We are also executing several initiatives to optimize non-labor spend, including ongoing rate negotiations, vendor consolidation, demand management and reductions in maintenance expense. ","Collectively third quarter cost actions generated approximately $130 million of in-quarter savings, which means we are on track to deliver the $1.1 billion or more of in-year synergy realization versus our target of $1 billion. And adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $686 million or 110% of adjusted net income. For the year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1.87 billion or 114% of adjusted net income. ","Now turning to revenue in the third quarter, revenue was $6.186 billion on a GAAP basis. Revenue was down 4% year-over-year adjusting for the USPS contract reset in fiscal 2017. Sequentially revenue was up 0.6%. In constant currency revenue was down 5.9% year-over-year and up 0.8% sequentially. Total bookings in the third quarter were $6 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x. ","Now as I mentioned, historically ES experienced significant revenue headwinds each November. Through our focused add on sales and project work we were able to offset those headwinds and grow revenue sequentially overall. ","In the third quarter GBS revenue was $2.315 billion. GBS revenue was down $4.6 billion year-over-year and was up 0.2% sequentially. In constant currency, revenue was down 6.6% year-over-year and was up 0.4% sequentially, and the book-to-bill was 1.4x in the quarter. In the quarter GBS segment margin was 18.6%. This was up 470 basis points year-over-year and 220 basis points sequentially. This margin improvement reflects the impact of cost takeout actions, including the reduction of management layers, improved utilization of project based resources and third party labor optimization. ","In the third quarter GIS revenue was $3.145 billion. GIS revenue was down 4.7% year-over-year and was up 0.4% sequentially. In constant currency revenue was down 6.8% year-over-year and up 0.7% sequentially. GIS revenue reflects the continued management of headwinds in the legacy infrastructure business and client transformations leveraging digital offerings in cloud and security. GIS bookings of $2.245 billion represented a book-to-bill of 0.7x in the quarter. ","Now in the quarter, GIS segment margin was 14.7%. This was up 520 basis points year-over-year and 120 basis points sequentially. This improvement reflects cost actions and as I said earlier, process automation. ","In the third quarter, USPS revenues were $726 million and during the third quarter last year we had a large one time contract reset that provided roughly $100 million of revenue in the quarter. Now excluding this benefit UPS revenue was up 0.9% year-over-year and up 2.3% sequentially. ","USPS booking were $527 million for a book-to-bill of 0.7x, reflecting the typical lumpiness of contract awards timing in the industry. The USPS segment margin in the quarter was 15.2%, which was up 350 basis points year-over-year and 210 basis points sequentially. ","Now I\u2019ll provide an update on the separation of the USPS business and the combination of Vencore and KeyPoint in a few moments. ","DXC also in the quarter continued to expand its client base by adding 24 new logo deals greater than $1 million in total contract value.","Now let me move to our digital industry IP and BPS results. As we discussed, digital cuts across all three DXCs reporting segments of GBS, GIS and USPS and includes Enterprise Cloud Apps in consulting, cloud infrastructure analytics and security. Digital revenue was up 13% year-over-year and down 3.3% sequentially reflecting contract minestrone achievements in the second quarter. Year-to-date digital revenue was up 16% and the book-to-bill was 1.1x in the third quarter. ","Enterprise Could Apps and Consulting revenue was up 25% year-over-year and book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.2x. The Enterprise Cloud Apps team continues to drive growth through an expanded portfolio of quick start offerings. These offerings allow us to rapidly understand the client environment and develop more impactful large scale transformations. ","Cloud revenue was up 13% year-over-year and book-to-bill in the quarter was 1x. Analytics revenue was up 2.4% year-over-year and the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1x. Recent wins include a deal with large German Bank, as well as deals with two major automotive companies. The auto companies are leveraging our analytics capabilities to significantly shorten R&D cycles and to more effectively manage data and generate insights from autonomous driving programs. ","Security revenue was down 3.5% year-over-year but was up 12% sequentially. As we\u2019ve said before and we are continuing to invest to growth this business through the expansion of our security consulting capabilities. We also launched new offerings, including identity access management as a service, and a ransom where consulting diagnostic to address the increase in cyber security threats and the book-to-bill in security in the quarter was 1.1x. ","Industry IP and BPS includes our IP offerings in healthcare, insurance, travel and transportation and banking, as well as our industry business process services businesses. Industry IP and BPS revenue was down 0.4% year-over-year and was up 1.1% sequentially. Book-to-bill was 1.6 in the quarter, including a large full service BPS life insurance deal. Industry IP revenue was down 1.8% year-over-year and was up 1.8% sequentially and the book-to-bill was 0.6%. ","BPS revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, roughly flat sequentially. The book-to-bill in the quarter 2.8x, again reflecting the large insurance deal as well as new logo contract with a state medicate agency which is as I might add, our 23rd State Medicaid account. ","Now as I previously discussed on earlier calls, we formed a new digital business team to jointly develop digital transformations with our clients, leveraging assets from across the company and our partnerships, and we are scaling this model to more than 50 accounts over the next few months. ","In our pilot accounts we increased digital pipeline by 30% and created several new opportunities valued at more than $200 million each. We also leveraged these initial engagements to develop a DXC Digital Framework which aligns DXC assets, capabilities and partner offerings to create a reusable digital transformation blueprint. This allows us to quickly shape modular transformation roadmaps by the clear business outcomes for our clients, while unlocking greater share of wallet and overall revenue growth for DXC. ","The recent Harvard business review survey found that more than a third of the companies do not believe their internal IT organizations are capable of executing their digital agendas. And as a result, digital transformations typically result in expanded revenue opportunities for IT services providers like DXC. ","We also launched five digital transformation centers globally, including the recently announced New Orland\u2019s Digital Transformation Center. And in the quarter we continue to expand our partner offerings, including digital insurances as a service on AWS, bundling DXCs industry leading insurance applications with business process and infrastructure services to create an integrated solution with a simplified consumption based pricing structure. This allows insurers to launch consumer oriented products quickly, while delivering a streamlined customer experience across new businesses, servicing and claims. ","We also sold our largest Microsoft Azure deal today and expanded renewal with a major consumer products company that included transformation from legacy infrastructure environments to hybrid cloud. And we continue to focus on up-skill and training our workforce on digital capabilities. More than 105,000 DXC employees have completed training programs through DXC University, with a heavy focus on cloud infrastructure, cloud native application, DevOps and Agile. Overall our employees have competed 385,000 courses and programs so far this year. ","Now turning to our fourth point here, we continue to achieve merger integration milestones and to execute on the bill sell deliver operating model we previously discussed. We are on track to deliver, 1.1 billion or more of year one cost savings and roughly 1.6 billion of run rate cost savings exiting fiscal 2018. The addition savings were primarily driven by workforce optimization actions including the acceleration of management reductions and the global deployment of our automation program Bionics. ","We are underway on the operational separation of the U.S. public sector business to operate as a standalone company and the integration of that company with Vencore and KeyPoint. We\u2019ve conducted a series of integration summits bringing together leaders from each part of the new company. The operating model for the new company is finalized and we also recently announced the senior leadership team and the Form 10 registration statement was filed today. And at this time we expect the deal to close in May based on the anticipated SEC review process, and as I said before, prior to the deal close we will have an Investor Day for the new company. ","Now just to conclude before I turn it over to Paul, for fiscal 2018 we continue to expect revenue to be $24 billion to $24.5 billion in constant currency and we are increasing our target for non-GAAP EPS to a range of $7.50 to $8, reflecting the additional synergy realization this year and our adjusted free cash flow target remains 90% of adjusted net income.","So with that, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Paul and then we\u2019ll be back for any questions that you might have.","Paul Saleh","Thank you Mike and greetings everyone. Before I review our third quarter results, I would like to take a moment to clarify the basis for our financial presentation. ","First, the pro forma results for Q3 of last year conform to the same methodology we used in the first two quarters and as such, all reference to the unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the prior year include the results of operations of CSC for the three and nine months ending December 30, 2016 and our HPES for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2016.","Also prior year pro forma non-GAAP results assume a flat quarterly tax rate of 27.5%. In addition, fiscal \u201918 third quarter results reflect the impact of a differed revenue write down for purchase price accounting, whereas the prior year pro-forma does not.","Lastly, non-GAAP results exclude restructuring, integration, amortization of intangibles and one-time tax items consistent with CSC\u2019s non-GAAP methods from prior years. And with that I will now cover some items that are included in our GAAP results this quarter.","In the current quarter, we had restructuring costs of $213 million pretax or $0.56 per diluted share. These costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expense associated with facilities and data center rationalization. Also in the quarter we had $94 million pretax or $0.23 per diluted share of integration and transaction related costs. Year-to-date, restructuring, integration and transaction costs amounted to $879 million pretax or $2.23 per diluted share, which is in line with the $1.3 billion spend envelope we laid out for fiscal '18.","In the third quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $149 million pretax or $0.36 per diluted share. Pension and other post employment benefit actuarial and settlement gains were $17 million in the quarter.","Third quarter results include the benefit from the provisional impact of US federal tax reform, including the reprising of our differed tax liabilities, offset by tax accrual required under the new tax rules. We\u2019re still awaiting further guidance from regulatory agencies on the interpretation of the U.S. tax reform provisions, including those related to global intangibles non-tax income and the base erosion anti avoidance tax. It\u2019s still early to tell, but overall we expect tax reform to provide a moderate tailwind.","Now let\u2019s turn to our third quarter results in more detail.","Revenue in the quarter was $1.186 billion on a GAAP basis. Purchase price accounting reduced revenue in the quarter by $34 million representing a write down of differed revenue. For the fiscal year the differed revenue write down for PPA is now expected to be $214 million versus our prior estimate of $230 million.","All revenue comparisons exclude the impact of purchase price accounting and a one-time contract reset in USPS of $105 million last year. On that basis revenue was down 4% year-over-year and up 0.6% sequentially. In constant currency revenue was down 5.9% and up 0.8% sequentially.","EBIT in the quarter was $927 million after adjusting for restructuring, integration and amortization of intangibles. Adjusted EBIT margin on that basis was 15% compared with 13% last quarter, but that is after normalizing for the one-time catch up benefit of lease reclassification we recorded in the second quarter. This improvement reflects cost actions we\u2019re taking to optimize our workforce, extract greater supply chain efficiencies and rationalize our real estate footprint.","In this quarter we continue to rebalance our workforce. We reduced our labor base by an additional 3% in the quarter through a combination of automation, best shoring and pyramid correction. We also continue to rebalance our skill mix, including the addition of 5,300 new employees and the ongoing retraining of the existing workforce. ","In supply chain we\u2019re extracting greater procurement efficiencies. We leverage our digital analytics capabilities to mine over $2 billion of statement of work spend data identifying specific opportunities to reduce demand, improve rate compliance and consolidate suppliers.","In real estate we eliminated 1.3 million square feet of space during the quarter and for the year-to-date we\u2019ve reduced our total square footage by roughly 17%. In total we delivered $130 million of incremental cost take out in the quarter and are on-track to achieve $1.1 billion or more in in-year savings, which translates to around $1.6 billion of run rate savings exiting fiscal \u201918.","Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the third quarter was $2.15 adjusted for one-time tax items, restructuring, integration and amortization of intangibles. Year-to-date our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.66.","In the quarter our non-GAAP tax rate was 28.7% reflecting our global mix of income and certain tax attributes in key foreign jurisdictions. Year-to-date our non-GAAP tax rate was 27.9%, which is in line with the non-GAAP target for tax that we have for the full year of 25% to 30%. Booking in the quarter were $6.02 billion for an overall book-to-bill of one-time. Year-to-date revenue was $18.26 billion, adjusted EBIT was $2.48 billion and bookings were $18.24 billion for our book-to-bill ratio of one-time.","Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Global business services revenue was $2.3 billion in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting of $6 million, GBS revenue was down 4.6% year-over-year and was up 0.2% sequentially. In constant currency revenue was down 6.6% year-over-year and up 0.4% sequentially. ","In the third quarter GBS profit was $431 million and profit margin was 18.6% compared with 16.4% in the second quartet. This margin improvement reflects cost take out actions, including reductions in both internal and third party labor expenses. Our GBS bookings were $3.3 billion in the quarter for a book-to-bill of 1.4 times. Year-to-date BGS revenue was $6.9 billion, segment profit was $1.1 billion for margins of 15.9% and our booking were $8.1 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.2 times.","Turning now to global infrastructure services, revenue was $3.1 billion in the quarter. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting of $26 million in the quarter, GIS revenue was down 4.7% year-over-year but was up 0.4% sequentially.","In constant currency revenue was down 6.8% year-over-year and up 0.7% sequentially. In the third quarter GIS segment profit was $463 million and profit margin was 14.7% compared with 13.6% in the second quarter, normalizing for the one-time catch up impact of lease reclassification last quarter.","The profit improvement reflects the impact of cost actions we are taking to drive greater operating efficiencies, including best shoring, labor pyramid rebalancing, benefits from our Bionics automation program and supply chain savings. Bookings for GIS were $2.2 billion in the quarter or a book-to-bill of 0.7 times. Year-to-date GIS revenue was $9.3 billion. Segment profit was $1.222 billion and margins was 13.2% and our bookings were $8.8 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.9 times.","Turning now to the U.S. public sector; revenue there was $726 million in the quarter. USPS revenue was up 0.9% year-over-year and up 2.3% sequentially. USPS segment profit was $110 million in the quarter and profit margin was 15.2% compared with 13.1% in the second quarter, normalizing for the one-time catch up impact of reclassification this past quarter.","The margin improvement was driven by a reduction in indirect costs and award fees associated with successful program executions and milestone achievements. Bookings for USPS were $527 million in the quarter for a book-to-bill of 0.7x. Year-to-date USPS revenue was $2.1 billion, segment profit was $296 million, margin was 14% and our bookings were $1.4 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.6x.","Turning to other financial highlights for the quarter, adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $686 million or 110% of adjusted net income. This reflects ongoing improvement in working capital management. Adjusted free cash flow excludes proceeds from receivable securitization programs. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.87 billion or 114% of adjusted net income.","Our CapEx was $481 million in the quarter or 7.8% of revenue reflecting the reclassification of operating leases to capitalize leases. Year-to-date CapEx was $1.29 billion or 7.1% of revenue, of which 1.7% was associated with the reclassification of operating leases to capitalized leases.","During the quarter we returned $51 million of capital through our shareholders and dividends. Year-to-date we have returned $189 million of capital to our shareholders in the form of $123 million in dividends and $66 million in share repurchase. ","Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion. Our total debt was $8.5 billion including capitalized leases. Net debt to total capitalization ratio was 25.8%.","So in closing we continue to target revenue for the fiscal year to be $24 billion to $24.5 billion in constant currency. We are increasing our full year target for non-GAAP EPS from continuing operation to a range of $7.50 to $8, reflecting the additional synergy realization this year. Our EPS target continues to assume a tax rate of 25% to 30% for the full year. U.S. federal tax reform will likely provide a moderate benefit in the fourth quarter. We still expect the full year tax rate to be between 25% to 30%. Our adjusted free cash flow target for fiscal remains the 90% of adjusted net income.","And with that, I\u2019ll now hand the call back to the operator for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Jeffries.","Damian Wille","Hi guys. This is Damian on for Ramsey. I just wanted to ask you. I know you had said you were going to wait to some guidance on tax reform before giving official guidance for the rate, but you mentioned that it was going to be a tailwind. So just on free cash flow then, can you talk about how we should think about your use of those proceeds from tax reform and the context of your broader capital allocation strategy you\u2019ve already laid out.","Mike Lawrie","This is Mike and then Paul, you can chime in here. The terms of the capital allocation model, that\u2019s not going to change. So we\u2019re going to continue to stick with that as we go forward here and conclude this year and get into our next fiscal year. Paul you may want to add something to that. ","Paul Saleh","Yeah, well I think the tailwind that we expect is a couple of points. I think, so it doesn\u2019t change the way.","A - Mike Lawrie","Doesn\u2019t change the capital allocation model.","Damian Wille","Got it and just as a follow-up I wanted to ask, just on the runoff rate on the legacy infrastructure business, what are your expectations in terms of the long term rate of decline there? Should we expect the decline to moderate at some point as the sort of less sticky business falls off and it leaves a more harden book of business. ","A - Mike Lawrie","You know I think we have to be candid. We\u2019ve seen a little less revenue dissynergies and we have been a little more successful than we had planned in terms of offsetting the decline in legacy infrastructure business. We\u2019ve been more successful offsetting that with cloud and some of our other digital offerings. So that has gone in all candor a litter better than what we had modeled and what we had communicated. ","Now as we look out into next year, we are going to run a lot of the same plates that we ran this year. So we are ramping up our investment in digital skills, both the retraining of our people as well as the recruiting of our people. We are significantly investing in the number of accounts we are trying to take to our digital transformation road map and blue print. So we are going to continue with the same plate that has given us some of the success around offsetting that decline in the traditional IPO business. ","Damian Wille","Thank you. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc. ","Arvind Ramnani","Hey, congrats on another good quarter. Just had a couple of questions. You know kind of revenue just came in slightly above and bookings came in at $5.5 billion, which is an uptick from the prior quarter. You know is this reflective of a healthier demand environment or is it more to do with seasonality? ","And also can you provide kind of a broader context to how the market is responding to the combined entity; including the partnerships we have been putting together and how you feel you are reshaping our capabilities relative to what clients are looking for?","Mike Lawrie","Yeah listen, I\u2019m going to start with the back part of that first. Our partners have responded very well. So that means we are a large, independent, end-to-end services company. We are the ideal partner for many of our technology partners to get their technology and their solutions to market. So that is moving along at a very good pace and frankly those partnerships are deepening every week, every quarter as we go forward and it gives our clients unprecedented choice and the ability to avoid a lock in, which is increasingly important to them as they continue to progress through this next phase of the industry around digital capabilities. I would say in terms of the \u2013 so that\u2019s the business partner side of this Arvind. ","In terms of what we are seeing, to be honest with you, I just spent two weeks on the road. I was in Japan and I was in China and India and Singapore and I got to tell you, I have never in my life been. You know I could be downtown Tokyo talking with clients or Beijing the next day, they are all talking about the same thing. I have never witnessed this in my life. They all understand the impact of these digital technologies and how that is transforming their industries that they operate in front of their very eye. They all have plans to do this. ","They all are very, cautious and skeptical as to whether they have the skills internally to do this and the Harvard businesses review study did nothing more than confirm that. We are seeing good growth in all parts of the world. I mean when was the last time you saw Europe and Japan and China and India and the U.S. all growing. So I\u2019m pretty optimistic about the longer term demand profile. ","Now there is a lot of work to do to capture that demand, and I don\u2019t want to in any way shape or form minimize the amount of work ahead. But there clearly is a good opportunity and we are continuing to transition our business to much more digital, much more of our industry IP, and BPS businesses that we have been investing for some time. ","Arvind Ramnani","That\u2019s great to hear it and just a quick follow-up. You know clearly you are ahead of, kind of based on your cost targets and you had time to settle and really get this integration underway. Just trying to get a feel about the acquisition now versus a year ago, and specifically beyond the numbers can you qualitatively talk about the integration process and any lessons learnt on having owned the HP source of business for close to a year? ","Mike Lawrie","Well I think there is a lot of lessons to be learnt. One, we did a lot of upfront planning on the integration and frankly, that went well. Like every other integration, when you get into all the detail, there is a lot of things under the covers that you have to address as begin to integrate the company. ","I mean for example, in March we\u2019ll go to a consolidated workday platform or human resources. That is a very important next step in unifying all of our human resource systems, processes and just allow us to better serve and mange our employee base, and that will continue for the next several years as we integrate all these systems. But I think the biggest lesson learnt is that detailed planning and then sticking to a very disciplined integration processes is absolutely imperative and we are prepared to be able to force correct as we find new things and we are always finding new things. ","But at the end of the day from my advantage point this was a merger than has not only generated significant synergies as we are witnessing in terms of the results that are being posted here, but really is allowing us to respond and scale, and scale not only for our partners but able to scale for our clients and we think that\u2019s going to have a long term benefit.","Arvind Ramnani","Thank you very much, and good luck for 2018. ","Mike Lawrie","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to James Friedman of Susquehanna. ","James Friedman","Hi, its Jamie at Susquehanna. I\u2019ll just ask Mike two up front in the interest of time. So now that we have three of the four quarters, it suggests that final quarter is going to grow year-over-year if my math is right. Could you just contextualize that and remind us what happened in the fourth quarter of last year; if there is any call out\u2019s there; that\u2019s my first one. ","And then with regard to the Form 10, thank you for that. My recollection is the intended timing. I don\u2019t mean to complain, but my recollection was original timing was the end of March. I know stuff happens Mike as you say, but why are we thinking May now instead of March. Those are my two, the year-over-year and then the timing. Thank you. ","A - Mike LawrieYes. I will take the second one first. Yes, we had \u2013 I had communicated \u2013 we thought we had closed this transaction at the end of March, early April and that was the scheduled, and candidly we had some issues getting the accounting firm approved to be able to do an audit for all the numbers in USPS and we lost about 30 days in getting that accounting firm approved and we\u2019ve completed that work now and that is about 30 days behind and we filed the Form 10 today and I am allowing you know the necessary time for the SEC to review and approval process. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m now saying the month of May.","Paul Saleh","Yes, I think on the other question about last year, you know I think you are absolutely right. I think if you look at it, we will \u2013 at this level we would posting some revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. And as you look back at historically HPES on there, their fourth quarter which usually is the November to January quarter for them, they typically saw a significant decline sequentially because at their quarter end of October you saw a lot of one time or accelerated revenue recognition and so you saw a price down or other kind of a decline sequentially. I think last year was close to a few hundred million dollars sequentially and this year I think as you could see, we have been able to mitigate those kind of declines about the project work and mitigating even\u2026","Mike Lawrie","And any separation in the digital offering growth; as we are seeing the digital offering growth.","Paul Saleh","And you are absolutely right, at these levels we would show growth year-over-year. ","James Friedman","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. ","Brian Essex","Hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to address maybe you know tax reforms and maybe if could parse those comments on you know USPS versus DXC pro forma post spend. Any consideration for you know post spend with DXC be a meaningful beneficiary tax reform and then as a part (b) to that question, does it impact at all the amount of synergies that you anticipated long term understanding that you know maybe some decisions around transfer pricing and taking advantage of low cost tax jurisdictions may have played a part in some of those numbers? ","Paul Saleh","So those are very good questions. So I would like to break it into its pieces. For USPS obviously they would be a U.S. tax filer and they will benefit from the new tax reform there. The rates will be about 21% federal and then maybe about four or so percent for the state and local. So in total they would be at a 25% versus otherwise they would they would have been closer to the 39% rate. So for them that\u2019s a good deal for the new gov. ","For DXC we are certainly are going to be benefiting from a lower tax rate as we said. There are other things in the tax reform that play into it. There are some taxes on foreign earnings, a minimum tax on foreign earnings. There are also some minimum tax on payment to non-U.S. subsidiaries. That\u2019s kind of our contra bailing type of forces there. So it\u2019s a balancing act. We are revisiting many of our tax position to make sure how do we optimize in the current environment. ","In fact what\u2019s really interesting is now our foreign taxes are higher than in the U.S., expect for the UK. So we have to rethink a little bit more the enter transfer pricing as you well correctly point out and \u2013 but net-net at this particular point in time is still a tailwind overall for DXC Remain Co.; if you think about it, the company on the commercial side.","Mike Lawrie","And Paul, I\u2019ll just add one other thing is that I think longer term is there a tailwind associated with it. But I do think it will allow us to simplify our structures. So over the years we have created a lot of legal entities and other structures to try to optimize tax on a global basis and I do think this tax reform is one of the benefits that will be the ability to simplify that structure and that has a lot of downstream benefits when you are running a large global corporation that has, that is dependent on the number of people and employees that we have in so many other countries. So when you add that all up, I think it\u2019s definitely going to benefit DXC post the spin and as Paul said, there is question that it\u2019s going to help the USPS businesses and Vencore and KeyPoint. ","Brian Essex","Right, and are you seeing any of that on the discretionary side of customer budgets at this point, just to kind of follow up on that?","Mike Lawrie","No, I\u2019m not saying that. But I want to tell you, I was \u2013 I was interested. I mean you know even in visiting with clients on a worldwide basis, many have indicated to me that they see it as positive. That it will actually help their businesses as well. So you know overall, I\u2019ve got nothing but positive feedback from clients on a worldwide basis. ","Brian Essex","Very helpful. Thank you.","Paul Saleh","One second, I was going to build on that, because I think there is actually part of the tax reform. There is the immediate opportunity for some of our customers to expense qualified PPNE expenditures. So for some of them it maybe just really an encouragement and it\u2019s because they could get in 100% depreciation on some qualified...","Mike Lawrie","That\u2019s yet to play-out. ","Paul Saleh","Yes.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research.","Rod Bourgeois","Hey guys. Hey, I want to talk about digital mix aspirations. It\u2019s encouraging in addition to all of the synergies on the cost side that you guys have multiple efforts internally to drive more digital sales. So my question is, do you view acquisitions as a major avenue to drive your digital mix higher going forward or are you feeling like your organic sales efforts are looking sufficient to keep moving the needle on the digital front? ","Mike Lawrie","Yeah, that\u2019s a good question Rod. I think we will probably continue to acquire, to build out that capability. We did that this year with Tribridge and some other service now acquisitions that we\u2019ve done. So within our capital allocation model we\u2019ve always said that we\u2019d like to buy 1% or so of revenue growth around acquisitions. And those acquisitions have been targeted in the digital areas. So that will continue as we go forward. ","So I mean we are pleased with the organic. We are seeing good growth in some areas. I mean we are seeing 24%, 25% growth in our enterprise cloud apps business, so that stuff is like service now and Microsoft and SAP and Oracle, we are really pleased with that. We are seeing good growth in our cloud infrastructure business that gets masked a little bit with the headwind associated with the traditional ITO businesses. ","We are investing big time in the cyber security businesses prior to the merger there and a disinvestment in that, and we are reinvesting in that and we are also really investing. This is more an organic basis where we\u2019re investing in our existing clients. So we are appointing what we\u2019re calling digital account teams. So we are actually beginning to move in the direction of having one team responsible for the legacy or the run environments that we have and then a separate team that is focused in many cases on dis-intermediating and driving a digital platform growth. And we\u2019ve concluded that this digital business requires a different mindset. ","It is a different culture; it\u2019s a different thought process. And most of our teams are fully employed, busy and just maintaining and running the systems that we have responsibility for. So we are making a big organic investment around trying to ignite those digital sales and we are beginning to see some results. ","I think I said in my commentary, we are going to scale that to 50 accounts. We are seeing good pipeline growth now. Pipeline growth has to get converted into revenue, don\u2019t misunderstand me, but that all of those are encouraging signs as we look out.","Rod Bourgeois","Great. Hey, so on the related note; do you have a good metric to track progress in cross selling to your existing clients, particularly in the digital arena? I guess what I\u2019m getting at is you had still some compression on traditional work that\u2019s going on across the industry, but you are also pursuing scope expansion as some of that legacy work runs off. Is there a metric to track that and if there is, is it tracking right now in the right direction amidst all the cost savings that are going on?","Mike Lawrie","Yeah, that\u2019s also a very good question. We track something called ABR which is Annual Billed Revenue and we stated that this year. It really is around our new offerings, so I think of this primarily as our digital offerings and also around incremental project work that we are trying to drive within our existing base. ","Now that ABR metric is still immature. So I am not ready to report publically on it, because I am just not ready to do that, because I want to see a little more history in data points. What I will tell you is that that ABR has been increasing now three quarters in a row. So we saw really sort of a base line in the first quarter and we are seeing good growth in the second quarter and we saw good growth again in the third quarter. But I am not ready to report that as a metric yet until I\u2019m comfortable that that ABR can be linked to what we see running through the P&L. ","So we\u2019ve done some initial work on this and we think that in the first quarter what we sold in ABR, 90% of that has actually shown up in the P&L in the second, third and fourth quarter. The ABR that we sold in the second quarter, we are seeing a yield of seventy some percent and so on and so forth, but it\u2019s not ready for primetime yet. But those are encouraging for us internally and organically encouraging sign posts for us. ","Rod Bourgeois","Alright, well that ABR has a nice ring to it and the three quarters in a row trend, that sounds great. Look forward to hearing more about that later. Thanks.","Mike Lawrie","Thanks Rod. ","Paul Saleh","Thanks Rod. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. ","Jim Schneider","Good afternoon and thanks for talking my question. Maybe just kind of stepping back on the cost synergy side for a second. Can you maybe talk about out of the broad buckets that you\u2019ve identified, obviously it\u2019s very good to see the overall aggregate number go up and guide up the synergy number for the full year. But if you look at the individual buckets, clearly some upside in the headcount and workforce rebalancing piece of it. But can you maybe talk about some of the other buckets and where you are running ahead of plan and where you think you could end up with a little more synergies on a longer driven basis and where I wonder this might be actually a little bit behind plan. ","Mike Lawrie","Yeah I think let\u2019s start with where we are behind. Where we are behind a little bit is in the supply chain, that procurement savings and not that we aren\u2019t going to get them, but they were a little more delayed than we thought. So the aggregate number we are still very comfortable with, but the realization of that is coming a little later, so we\u2019ll continue to see some of that flow through next year. We still have quite a bit of work to do with our subcontractor base and how we manage that contingent labor force. So I\u2019d say there we are behind. ","An area where we are ahead and are very pleased about is Bionics and that\u2019s our automation, our lean methodologies and our sort of advanced analytics. That is having a bigger impact on the business than what we had anticipated, a positive. And we frankly see that continuing and I see this continuing not through the fourth quarter, just through fiscal \u201919. I see this as a long term trend and we are really getting comfortable with that. ","So that was probably the biggest over achievement. It was an investment we made; it\u2019s the best of our delivery organization. Early in the year we sort of put a lot of money behind it and it has paid off handsomely and we are going sort of full speed ahead. ","The other thing we have done is our whole agile process methodology. As we are using internally to reengineer some of our processes and then we\u2019ll take that methodology externally and pack the set up as an offering for our client. We see that as very promising. ","So I think the big area we are behind was around procurement, not that the absolute number isn\u2019t there, but the timing was more skewed to the right than what we had anticipated and then on the automation or Bionics side we are clearly ahead. I\u2019d say from a real-estate standpoint and fiscal asset standpoint we are probably slight ahead of where we thought, but not materially and then in the harmonization of policies and all that stuff is pretty much what we thought it would be. But we are seeing a little better yield on the synergies and that\u2019s why we increased our end year synergies and we increased our exist synergies rate existing fiscal \u201918. ","Jim Schneider","Great, thanks and then maybe kind of building on some of the questions that were asked early on digital. I mean if you look and combine all those targeted focus areas for you, industry IP, BPS, Enterprise Could, Analytics, Securities etcetera, as you look into next year, can you maybe give us some kind of sign post as to how much of the mix that might represent based on all the trends you are seeing underlying in bookings today?","Mike Lawrie","Well, we\u2019d like to see the digital business begin to approach you know a 17%, 20% sort of range of our total business. The IP business, I don\u2019t have a number right off the top of my head, but somewhere\u2026","Paul Saleh","15% to 16%","Mike Lawrie","15% to 16%. The BPS business, particularly insurance is growing. We just signed another major deal in the third quarter and we\u2019ve gotten most of the accounts that needed some remediation. That is almost completely behind us now. If you remember last year, we talked about the investment we needed to make in the insurance BPS business to remediate and get some more solid methodologies. We made that investment and that too is beginning to pay off for us. ","Jim Schneider","Thank you. ","Mike Lawrie","Let\u2019s just take one more. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go now to Jason Kupferberg with Bank of American. ","Jason Kupferberg","Hey guys, how are you?","Mike Lawrie","Alright Jason, how about yourself? ","Jason Kupferberg","Good, good. I wanted to ask a question about Margins. Real strong in the quarter, 15% adjusted EBIT. I\u2019m guessing you probably had your call at 1% help from the lease re-classes, so maybe I\u2019ll call it 14%. You know I think the fiscal 20 guide from last year\u2019s Analyst Day was you know to get to 14% to 15% in that [inaudible] and so your kind of there if my math is right. So I just wanted to see if there is any other considerations we should be thinking about as far as you know where that multi-year target could go?","Mike Lawrie","Well yeah, I think one, you\u2019re accurate. We are seeing a little bit better margin expansion this year than what we had anticipated and that\u2019s largely due to the increased synergies that we got and also the fact that we had a little less revenue run off than we had expected this year. So those are the two factors that conspire to expand the margins a little faster this year. ","I am not ready to update the model. What I am going to be taking a look at pretty carefully is what we think the impact of automation is going to be longer term and that\u2019s a wild card, because frankly it\u2019s something I am excited about, because for the first time in a long time I am seeing operating leverage in this business. I have not seen \u2013 I have been in this business for 30 years, services business and I have never really seen true operating leverage and we\u2019re beginning to see some of that operating leverage being reduced into a labor based business through automation. ","So I think that, I think the investment we\u2019re making in re-skilling our people are all critical factors in helping to expand the revenue attainment, as well as drive incremental synergies which then results in a better margin performance.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, I just want to ask a quick follow-up on digital too. I mean since you broke it down in a helpful fashion, I mean analytics and security I guess are maybe the [Achilles][Ph] heel right now relative to some of the other areas of digital. What\u2019s the outlook there? Is that where you\u2019d maybe focus some of the M&A energy?","Mike Lawrie","Yeah, I mean the cyber business, I\u2019ll tell you when I look back at it that that business was dis-invested in prior to the merger and that was one of the things we discovered post merger and we have been working pretty hard to reinvest in that and we are beginning to see sequential growth, so I am pretty confident that that will come back. We are definitely attracting now some really good talent in the cyber business. ","The analytics business, I think we see some very strong capabilities. We were \u2013 you know I was in India last week looking at some of the innovation coming out of our analytics labs there. In my opening comments I talked about some of the things we\u2019re doing with the auto companies and a lot of this analytics capability really scales across many accounts and many industries. ","So we\u2019re in the process of what I\u2019ll call harvesting some of the unique one-off things we\u2019ve done and now packaging up those one-off things so that they can be scaled across multiple industries and multiple accounts. And in many instances, many instances, the analytics business is sort of an entry point into other digital offerings that can be solved, and it\u2019s instructive because we\u2019re using some of that analytics capability ourselves as we take a look at metrics around our delivery business, particularly infrastructure business. ","We\u2019re using some of these analytics capabilities to better understand our business, which is then driving greater insights into where we can add automation and where we can do other things, lean out the business, etcetera and we\u2019re applying that analytics also to our own business process. ","You know while we\u2019re doing all this, we\u2019re re-engineering some of our most fundamental business process; how we hire? How we recruit? Are we onboard? Are we trained? How will we retain? That whole end-to-end process around people is absolutely critical to a business that is people based. The way we procure. I mean we\u2019re doing thousands of transactions now that are smaller volume that require a complete rethink of our procurement process and how we manage to hire a number of low value transactions, and we\u2019ve used our own analytics capability to try to understand that so we make more prudent decisions. So you know I am confident those businesses are going to perform better as we move forward.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, good color.
