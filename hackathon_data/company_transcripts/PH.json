My name is Carolyn, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, the call is being recorded for replay purposes. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Pamela Huggins. Please go ahead.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thanks, Carolyn. Good morning, everyone. This is Pam Huggins speaking, just as Carolyn said. And I'd like to welcome you to Parker Hannifin's third quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today is Chairman, CEO and President, Don Washkewicz; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Jon Marten.","For those of you who wish to do so, you can follow today's presentation with the PowerPoint slides that have been presented on Parker's website at www.phstock.com. For those of you who aren't on the line today, the slides will remain posted on the company's investor information website 1 year after today's call.","At this time, reference Slide #2 on the slide deck, which is the Safe Harbor disclosure statement, which addresses forward-looking statements. And we ask that you please take note of this statement in its entirety if you haven't already done so. The slide also indicates, as required, that where -- in cases where non-GAAP numbers have been used, they've been reconciled to their appropriate GAAP numbers and are posted on Parker's website as well.","Slide #3, moving to the agenda. The agenda today consists of 4 parts. First, Don Washkewicz, Chairman, CEO and President, will provide highlights for the quarter. Second, I'll provide a review, including key performance measures for the quarter, and concluding with the updated fiscal year 2014 guidance. The third part of the call will consist of our standard Q&A session. And for the fourth part of the call today, Don will close with some final comments.","So at this time, I'll turn it over to Don and ask that you refer to Slide #4, titled Highlighted -- Highlights, Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2014.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Thank you, Pam, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning. We delivered a strong quarter operationally, that was ahead of expectations, and we are on track with our previously announced restructuring initiatives, and we'll talk a little bit more about restructuring a little bit later in the presentation.","Restructuring costs were higher than planned, reflecting final agreements with employee works councils, and I believe we talked a little bit about that in the last meeting.","Some highlights for the quarter. Sales increased 3%, adjusting for our previously announced joint venture with GE Aviation. As reported, sales increased 2%. The strongest organic sales growth of 5% was in our Diversified Industrial International business. We're very pleased to see a third consecutive quarter of order growth producing a 7% improvement year-over-year. Our order growth trend is giving us increased confidence in the global economy.","Total segment operating margins were approximately 13%, but close to 15%, excluding restructuring expenses, and I think, everyone on the call today knows that, that's our target ROS that we've been shooting for. So excluding the restructuring, we've been closer to 15%.","We were particularly pleased to see strong operating margin performance in the Diversified Industrial International businesses, where operating margins were just above 9%, but when you exclude restructuring expenses, that approached 14%, so that's extremely strong for that segment of our business. So we're pretty much hitting on all cylinders right now.","Earnings per diluted share were $1.88, adjusted for $0.28 per diluted share in restructuring expenses in the quarter. As reported, earnings per diluted share were $1.60.","As I said, I'll give you a few comments on our restructuring. We have an incurred now $0.40 year-to-date. Critical steps were completed in the quarter that allows us to move forward with a range of initiatives. And I just wanted to take this opportunity to give our team -- our global team special thanks in all the countries that were affected by the restructuring for working through these difficult negotiations. They did just a remarkable job and brought us pretty much on target with what we projected we'd be able to do for the year.","We're now projecting our total restructuring for the year to be $118 million or $0.55 per diluted share, and that's up from $100 million that we talked about previously. The increase reflects negotiations completed in the third quarter, as well as some additional initiatives that we decided to take some action on this year. So I think, that's all good, and I think, that's all going to accrue for improvements in the years to come -- in the next year to come, I should say.","Cash flow continues to be strong. Year-to-date, Parker generated operating cash flow of 8.4% of sales or 9.4% before pension contributions and restructuring. We expect to deliver our 13th consecutive year of cash flow greater than 10% before pension contributions in fiscal '14. And so that would make it a pretty much every year since we launched our WIN strategy that we've been able to deliver cash flow greater than 10%. So we're pretty proud of that accomplishment as well.","Our first priority for capital allocation will remain increasing the dividend. Next will be to pursue acquisitions to grow our business. We have continued our share repurchase program, having completed roughly $150 million in share repurchases year-to-date. As we announced last year, we approved our regular quarterly dividend, which will bring our record to 58 consecutive years of increasing our annual dividend, that's not just paying the dividend, but increasing the dividend for 58 consecutive years. And that's still among the top 5 dividend increase records in the S&P 500.","So -- and just one other comment on the 10b5-1. We plan to do another $50 million in the fourth quarter, so that would bring us to about $100 million -- or $200 million in share repurchases in the 10b5-1 for the fiscal year, and that's pretty much in line with what we've told you before.","We celebrated another milestone last week at the New York Stock Exchange, where we celebrated 50 years as a New York Stock Exchange listed company by ringing the closing bell. That was a very nice event that we had. This past quarter, we also announced a clinical trial agreement for our Indigo Exoskeleton technology with 5 of the top 10 rehabilitation centers in the U.S. We're certainly very excited about this technology and the impact it will have on humanity going forward. The commercial version of Indigo, which enhances many of the unique features of the original design, is going to be introduced in May at a trade show in Germany. And we think this is really tremendous technology, and it's another foundation that we will be building on going forward that adds another layer of technology to the company.","Looking ahead to the full year, we're increasing our guidance and have provided adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $6.40 to $6.60 per diluted share for fiscal 2014, and that brings us to about a $6.50 midpoint.","Our guidance includes -- by the way, the midpoint was $6.40, so we're bringing it from $6.40 to $6.50.","Our guidance includes $0.55 per diluted share in restructuring expenses, but does not include the gain on our previously announced joint venture, which was $1.68 per diluted share and the second quarter asset write-downs of $1.26 per diluted share.","So that's what I wanted to do as far as an opener. And now, I'm going to turn it back over to Pam and we'll get into a little bit more detail for you.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thanks, Don. Let's reference Slide #5 now, and I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.","On the slide to the left, you can see that adjusted fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.88 versus $1.69 for the same quarter last year, which is an increase of $0.19 or 11%.","As you recall, last quarter, we planned to have $0.20 in restructuring, and we came in at $0.28 for the quarter. And this compares to restructuring last year of $0.01.","So moving to Slide #6. This chart on Slide #6 lays out the significant components of the WAC from the adjusted earnings per share of $1.69 last year for the third quarter, to the $1.88 for the third quarter of this year. And as you can see from this slide, the significant items are increased segment operating margin due to North America and International, and lower below the line expenses due mainly to pension expense, partially offset by higher tax rate due to the expiration of the R&D credit.","So moving to Slide #7. And on the far right, focusing on the adjusted number here, you can see that sales increased almost 3.5% in the quarter versus the same quarter last year. And as shown in the gold box on the left, currency reduced sales by a little less than 1%.","So adjusted to realignment cost in the quarter, segment operating margins, detailed at the bottom of the slide, of 14.7% are ahead of last year of 14.1%. Realignment costs in the quarter were $60 million versus realignment cost last year of $2 million.","The higher segment operating income this year of $493 million versus $465 million last year, a 6% improvement, and that's due to higher volume in International, a slight volume increase, product mix and tight cost control in North America.","So now moving to Slide #8 and focusing on Diversified Industrial North America, focusing on the segments here. For the quarter, North America reported revenues increased to $1.46 billion from $1.43 billion, an increase of almost 2%, 1.9%. And if you adjust for the unfavorable currency impact, mainly the Canadian currency, organic growth was up almost 2.5%. Adjusted operating income increased to $243 million from $225 million, an 8% increase of the same quarter prior year, and again, mainly the result of higher volume in the quarter, product mix and tight cost control.","So moving to Slide #9, addressing Diversified Industrial International. For the quarter, organic revenues increased 5%, and unfavorable currency reduced sales by a little less than 1%. As such, the reported revenue growth for the quarter was 4%. The increased sales in this business were mainly due to higher volume in Europe. Adjusting for realignment cost, operating margin for the quarter increased to $186 million from $159 million for the same quarter 1 year ago. Realignment costs were $59 million in the quarter. So of the total $60 million that we had in restructuring in this quarter, $59 million related to International. And last year, in International, there was $1 million in realignment cost.","Margins increased 150 basis points from 12.2% to 13.7%, and again, due to higher volume.","So moving to Slide #10 and addressing Aerospace Systems. Revenues adjusted for the previously announced joint venture increased 2%, and the impact of acquisitions and currency on this segment was negligible.","Operating margin decreased to $64 million from $80 million versus the same quarter a year ago, and this is really due to the OEM, MRO mix in this particular quarter.","So moving to order rates, Slide #12. It details order changes by segment. These numbers represent a trailing average in our reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, and they exclude acquisitions, divestitures and currency. Diversified Industrial uses a 3-month average, while Aerospace Systems uses a 12-month average.","I think, you can see from this slide, total orders were positive, 7% for the March quarter just ended, representing 3 quarters of positive numbers. Diversified Industrial North American orders for the quarter just ended increased 6%. Diversified Industrial International orders increased 5% for the quarter. Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America were all positive. Aerospace System orders increased 16% for the quarter.","So now, we'll move to the balance sheet. And Parker's balance sheet remains strong. Cash on the balance sheet at yearend was slightly over $2 billion at $2.1 billion, and Commercial Paper outstanding of $1.1 billion. DSI, or days sales and inventory, came in at 66 days, and this is a 6-day improvement sequentially versus the second quarter. Inventories levels at 11% of sales are improved versus last year, where inventories as a percent of sales were 11.3%.","Accounts receivable in terms of DSO closed at 50. That's a 1-day increase from last quarter but that's mainly due to the higher sales at the end of the quarter in March. Weighted average days payable outstanding at the end of March was 56, and this is fairly consistent with last quarter.","So now, moving to Slide 13, cash flow. Adjusted year-to-date cash flow from operations of $907 million or 9.4% of sales. This compares to $944 million last year or 9.9% of sales, adjusting for -- or adding back the discretionary pension contributions and the cash expended for the restructuring activities.","In addition to the cash flow from operations, we had proceeds of more than $200 million from investing activities as well.","So after increasing cash on hand by $315 million, the major uses of cash year-to-date are as follows: $357 million returned to the shareholders via share repurchases of $150 million and dividend payments of $207 million; $254 million utilized in the pay-down of Commercial Paper; and $167 million or 1.7% of sales utilized in connection with capital expenditures.","So now, moving to Slide #14 and focusing on guidance, which I know all of you are interested in. The guidance on this slide, it's -- we have the guidance for sales growth, segment operating margins. Of course, below the line items, the tax, shares outstanding and adjusted earnings per share. Beginning at the top of the page with sales. Sales are expected to increase approximately 1.5% at the midpoint for the year, but on an adjusted basis, this is 3%, adjusting for the joint venture.","Segment operating margins forecasted at 13.8% at the midpoint. This is slightly ahead of the projection last quarter, which was 13.7%, and this is obviously due to the better performance in the third quarter.","Also included on this slide is the projection for below the line items, which you know includes corporate admin, interest and other. And so the forecast is $461 million for the year at the midpoint, this obviously excludes the nonrecurring items, such as the joint venture and the asset write-downs that were recorded in the second quarter.","The full year tax rate now is projected at 34%. This is lower than that projected last year, and again, due to the lower tax rate in the third quarter as a result of some discrete items. A 29% tax rate is projected for the fourth quarter, and the number of shares outstanding used in the guidance is 151.7 million.","So for the full year, as Don said, the adjusted earnings per share guidance is $6.40 to $6.60, that's $6.50 at the midpoint. And this guidance range excludes the joint venture gain of $1.68 and the asset write-off of $1.26 that were recorded in the second quarter. But the $6.50 does include the projected realignment cost for the year of $0.55.","So just a couple of points with regard to guidance. Sales first half, second half are divided 48% in the first half, 52% the second half. Segment operating income in the first half versus the second half is divided 46% in the first half, 54% in the second half.","Looking at EPS, the first half and the second half, the first half is 44%; second half, 56%. And again, this excludes the JV gain and the asset write-off, but includes the realignment cost.","So fourth quarter fully diluted earnings per share is projected to be $2.04 at the midpoint. Realignment costs are projected to be approximately $118 million, up from $100 million that we referenced last quarter, mainly due to the higher cost incurred in the third quarter. So the growth EPS impact to the year is $0.55 in realignment cost. The third quarter year-to-date growth impact of realignment cost is $0.40, and we're projecting $0.15 for the fourth quarter. This $0.15 that we're projecting for the fourth quarter is very much in line with what was provided last quarter.","So now, savings are projected at $30 million or $0.15, very much in line. This is exactly what we said last quarter. However, savings next year increased from the incremental $50 million that we talked about last quarter to $60 million.","So again, please remember that the forecast excludes any further acquisitions or divestitures that may be made in fiscal year 2014. And for published estimates, we ask that you please exclude the joint venture gain and the asset write-downs, but please include the restructuring expenses.","So at this time, we'll now commence with the standard Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.","[Technical Difficulties]","Operator","Jeffrey Hammond is on. Sorry about that, I'll get Joe back in.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you hear me guys?","Pamela J. Huggins","Hey, Jeff, a question for you, it's Pam speaking, were you able to hear us talking?","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes. I heard the intro remarks, and we just had a little pause before the Q&A. So maybe just to jump in, can you just talk about any kind of weather impact you saw and if March and April were materially better in North America than January, February?","Jon P. Marten","Okay. Joe, first, Jon here.","Donald E. Washkewicz","It's Jeff.","Jon P. Marten","Oh, Jeff. Okay. Now in terms of weather first. It's really hard for us to quantify the impact. Of course, we're aware of the weather here in the upper Midwest and Northeast, but we're a global company, and it's very hard for us to quantify a number for weather. So we're conscious of it, but we purposely decided not to call that out because we don't see that as a -- certainly not an important factor for our quarter that we just finished. Now the other question that you had, Jeff, I'm sorry. Please repeat it.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","No, that's fine. And then, just margins on Aerospace, I think, you tweaked that up in the guidance. They were, in the quarter, a little bit lighter than I was thinking and imply kind of 15%, I think, for the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about the trend there? And how do we start thinking about some of these nonrecurring and R&D cost going away into '15?","Jon P. Marten","Right. We -- showing right now in our updated guidance that the yearly number for R&D trends below 10% to about 9.6%. In the quarter, in our guidance, it implied 8.7% R&D as a percent of sales. And so the trends in Q4 for Aerospace are up in revenues and flattish in actual expenses R&D, but as a percent of sales, trending down for Q4.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Joe Ritchie.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So the first question I have, and I did appreciate the color that you gave us on the incremental savings, but I guess, one of the things I wanted to better understand is how do I think about the margin trajectory for '15? I think, historically, you guys have suggested a 15% number for '15, but just based on all the incremental initiatives that you're doing, the restructuring that you're doing, that number just seems way too light to me. So perhaps, you can comment on that?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. Joe, this is Don Washkewicz. Really, right now, let me just describe the process, the forecasting process, we've got about 150 divisions right now that are working on the -- our fiscal '15 plan. And that's a global initiative. So they all roll off in the next month or so to our group presidents, our group levels. And then, those group presentations will be made to the management committee at the company. So really, at this point, it's really premature for us to really give you anything solid. Of course, we're not backing down from what we said before, is that our target is 15%, and we talk a lot about that. So we're not backing down from that. But I can't give you anything more specific. And so I see what the groups are coming in and what then we'll do is we'll aggregate all that and come up with -- we'll present that to the board. Once the board signs off on it, then we'll present it to you at the next meeting and give you a real good -- not only give you the numbers but we'll give you a lot of insight as to how we arrive at the numbers. But we're right in middle of that process. So it'd be kind of premature for me to predict anything at this point. Other than the fact that we're not backing down from what we told you earlier.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Don, that's helpful. I guess, one -- my follow-up question is on capital allocation. You've talked about the propensity to get out in the market and acquire assets that are available. Perhaps, you can just provide a little bit of color on what you're seeing in the marketplace today? And if things don't materialize, do you have higher inclination to perhaps more aggressively buy back shares, just given how strong your balance sheet is?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. Well, as I said, I'm just going to repeat this a little bit, but I've kind of stated this in the past, the first priority, and I've mentioned it in my opening comments, is the dividend, and that's been our first priority, and will continue to be our first. Just to give you a little color on that, we've increased now 58 years in a row, actually increased the dividend. In the last 5 years, it's 92%, roughly, increase in the dividend. What we're trying to get to, this is a repeat as well, we're trying to get to 30% payout. Last year, we finished at 27%, we're at about 28% now, and we're going to gradually move it up and get to the 30% payout level. So that's the dividend. The second thing is CapEx. I'll only comment on CapEx because that's a critical part of our allocation as well, is that we've doubled the size of the company with a CapEx running around 2% to 2.5%, which I think is unheard of in this day and age. And it's really a tribute to the Lean initiatives and the WIN strategy that we're able to do that. So we're in pretty good shape on CapEx. You mentioned acquisitions, that's our next priority would be acquisitions, we have a number of them that we're looking at. We've got some in the pipeline, we've got some expressions of interest out there. I can't predict anything, and I won't predict that if we get them to the finish line or not because you never know until you actually signed the paperwork. So -- but we're still hopeful that we're going to be able to do something in the way of acquisitions. And if we don't, to your second question, yes, we will be looking at, this year, this calendar year, we will be looking at potential share repurchases. We've realized that there's -- we have plenty of capacity. Our first priority is to grow the company and use that capacity to grow the company but if that's not in the near-term cards, we'll utilize capacity to do some share repurchases. So we're not backing down from that. As far as pensions are concerned, I mentioned earlier, I think, we did $75 million this year, we don't anticipate we'll have to do anything else there. So that kind of gives you the total look at what we're looking at as far as capital allocation.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Mig Dobre from Robert W. Baird.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just clarification on Aerospace really quickly. Did I hear it correct that you expect to exit fiscal '14 with 8.7% R&D as a percentage of sales?","Jon P. Marten","Yes. Discretely for the quarter, Mig, this is Jon. For the year, will be at about 9.6%.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Great. And are you still sort of aiming for 8% or the very low-8s, and is that something that's achievable, maybe over, say, the next 12 months?","Jon P. Marten","Well, we don't want to get into guidance too much for FY '15, Mig, but that has been our stated goal, to get it down into the low-8s. We intend to do that. And as Don described, we'll be really pulling it all together here in Q4, and we'll give you a much fuller report, but there's been no change in our intentions there.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Then my last question real quick is on OE versus distributor demand in the industrial segment, if you could provide any color there?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. Let me just talk a little bit about -- maybe I'll talk about several aspects of what's happening out in the marketplace. A little bit of comment on the PMI index, first of all, which kind of gives you a general look in the different regions around the world just from a high level. Actually, we saw this month, this period, a little bit of a disconnect, not a major disconnect, a little disconnect from our order trends that PMI is actually -- all the PMIs for all the regions actually dropped slightly. Overall, probably not all of that significant, overall globally dropped about 0.6%. But we saw a negative movement on every region with the exception of the Eurozone, which was actually slightly positive. So -- but the good news, having said that, it's not all bad, I mean, these movements happen, and sometimes, we lead, sometimes, we lag. But the good news is that everybody is above 50. Every region is above 50, Germany, Eurozone, U.S., global and so forth, with the exception of China, which is at about 48 right now. So that's the PMI look. When you look at some of the markets, actually, the list is very long on positive markets, okay, for us right now, and fairly short on weaker markets and flat markets. Let me just kind of run down quickly for you. Of course, we participate in a lot of OEM markets, as well as the distribution segment of our business. So some of the strongest markets for us right now -- or segments, I should say, would be distribution, which should be very strong, I'll talk a little bit about the order trends there in distribution in a few minutes. Oil & gas is very strong for us. Cars and light trucks are very strong. Some of the other positive markets, the markets are trending in a positive way are machine tools, power gen, general industrial markets, off-highway construction, heavy-duty trucks, farm and ag, industrial machinery, industrial trucks, I should say, which is the material handling type of lift trucks, and forestry. Also on the process side, industrial refrigeration and commercial refrigeration is strong. And on the aerospace side, it would be the aerospace commercial aftermarket and the aerospace commercial OEM. So you can see that unlike prior quarters, we really are looking at a much better overall picture here in just about all of the market segments. Weaker segments then, let me just run down a couple of weaker ones for you. Process industries would be weaker, telecom and life sciences would be a couple of weaker segments. And of course, ongoing weakness in the aerospace, defense, MRO and OEM part of the business. And then, flat -- pretty flat would be semiconductor, mining and marine. So as you can see, much more positive in the -- this quarter than what we've seen in the past pretty much across the board. When we look at regions then, on a 3\/12 and a 12\/12 basis, of course, you've seen the 3\/12 number, so you know what's happening there, those are the numbers that we post every quarter, you don't really see the 12\/12 necessarily. I'd just kind of give you a little color on what's happening here. First of all, all regions are tracking above 100 on the 12\/12. This is the last 12 months orders, divided by the prior 12 months orders. Everything is above 100, which is very good. That's a very good sign. And all regions are tracking above 100 on the 3\/12, with the exception of Latin America. Latin America in our International segment was actually down below 100 slightly, and that's pulling -- that's going to pull their 12\/12 down a little bit from where it stands right now. But these are very good signs, I think, from an order trend standpoint. Positive signs for us going through the -- setting us up for a good close for the fiscal year. And just a little bit about the order trends in those -- some of those specific segments that I mentioned before. Distribution is extremely strong right now, and remember, that's half of our industrial business, so this is a very major number for us. So it's -- the 3\/12 there is running about 109, and the 12\/12 is north of 100 as well. And actually, it's less than the 3\/12, so it's going to be pulling up the 12\/12 over time. So distribution, very strong. We're very happy about that. Growing is the heavy-duty truck business. The 3\/12 there is north of 100, and as well as the 12\/12, and it's -- the 3\/12 is greater than the 12\/12, so it's pulling the 12\/12 up over time, so that's good. A bad market for us right now but it's improving, is construction. 3\/12 is less than 100, and the 12\/12 is even worse as far as less than 100. So actually, the 3\/12 is improving and pulling the 12\/12 up over time. So even though that's a segment that's been beat up pretty bad over the last year, there's some light at the end of the tunnel there, it looks like, over time. Softening is this -- what we consider softening would be semiconductor, and that's tracking less than 100 right now in the 3\/12, but the 12\/12 is still well over 100. So over time, we'll just have to watch and see how that materializes going forward. Growing segment for us would be ag, which is running both above 100 on the 3\/12 and the 12\/12, and it has been running like this for quite a while for us. So we like what's happening in ag. Bad, one of the -- probably the worse segments, I should say, and actually getting worst is some of the process markets. Actually, the 3\/12 is running well under 100, closer to like 75%. And that's dragging the 12\/12 down along with it. So process market is being one of the worst segments. Another very strong segment for us would be aerospace. 3\/12's running well over 120, or right around 125, and the 12\/12 is running around 120, 121. So that segment is extremely strong. So I know that's a lot to absorb but that's how we see right now and that kind of gives you a good look at our order trends with the general summation of all that is that just about every place, things are looking a little better and a little bit more positive, with the exception maybe of Latin America and maybe a couple of these segments that I mentioned. But there are quite a few strong segments in here, too.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Alex Blanton from Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","I wanted to go back to the fourth quarter. I was off a little bit so this might've been asked. But if we look at what's implied in the fourth quarter, you're seeing -- without restructuring, excluding that $1.77 versus $1.88 in the third quarter, and then, if we include the restructuring, the gap is narrower, it's just about flat, $1.62 versus $1.60. Typically, you have a stronger fourth quarter than third. So what is the reason for this implied decline?","Pamela J. Huggins","Alex, I just want to make sure that we're all clear about the numbers, for the fourth quarter, at the midpoint, we have $2.04 projected, okay? It's higher than what we projected last quarter, but the restructuring that we're projecting is pretty much the same. We said $0.14 last quarter, and now we're saying $0.15 in the fourth quarter. So I just want to make sure that we have the numbers. We -- really, this guidance, when you look at the guidance that we're giving you today, compared to the guidance that we gave you last quarter, really, the only thing that is different is we built in the third quarter beat because we beat our third quarter versus what we said, and we adjusted the international numbers because of the order rates, the consistency in the order rates, and we felt that we got through a lot of the noise that was happening in Europe as a result of the restructuring, so we took the international numbers up. But that's the only difference when you look at previous guidance versus the guidance today.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Okay. Well, I was using the full year of $7.05, that's $6.50 plus $0.55 of restructuring, right?","Pamela J. Huggins","Well, if you take the $6.50, we had $0.47 in restructuring last year, now we have $0.55, okay? The difference is the restructuring that you saw in the third quarter, which is $0.08 higher.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Well, I know that, but if you take the full year, it's $7.05 without the restructuring, correct?","Pamela J. Huggins","Well, it's $6.50, plus the restructuring that's included is $0.55.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","$7.05. And then, I looked in the -- it's $5.28 without the restructuring for 9 months.","Pamela J. Huggins","The $6.50 has the restructuring in it. And you're right, $0.55 plus the $6.50 gives you your $7.05.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Don, if I could just push you a bit more on the balance sheet, the balance sheet is obviously suboptimal at the moment and you're at as low a leverage ratio as far back as my model goes for Parker. You've talked about wanting to do acquisitions, you would need to do some fairly large acquisitions to get the balance sheet back into a more optimal capital structure. Is it safe to assume that you are working on some larger deals and some deals that would be record size for Parker at this point?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, we're looking at everything that comes across. I mean, all different sizes. There's no specific size that we're targeting on. So we're looking at a lot of different things. And if whatever we end up getting across the finish line, if we have excess capital and we think it's prudent to do some share repurchase, we'll do some share repurchase with whatever we've got left and bring everything back into kind of the normal range what you typically have seen us do in the past. I won't read anything more than that into this. I think, like I said, we've got some expressions of interest out there. We've got things that have fallen out of the pipeline, we've got other things that are coming into the pipeline. And until we can get something across the finish line, I just can't really give you much more to go on there. I mean -- but, with the exception that -- we hear what you're saying. And Nathan, you're consistent, you've been saying this for a long time now. So you're very consistent, and we appreciate that. And -- but that's kind of what I would say is we would certainly try to do the acquisitions and the balance, if we have a balance left after that, we would do some share repurchase. And that would have to be approved by our board, too. So I can't even give you a hard number on that but we would -- I think, the board would be in agreement with that.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Do you have a targeted timeframe for getting that capital structure back more in line with the historical level that Parker's had?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. I think, what we would say is that we're looking at the calendar year here, we're a few months, or 3 or 4 months into the calendar year now, we're seeing this calendar year, I think, would be the relative -- relevant timeframe that we'd be looking at.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. My follow-up question is on inventories, destocking versus restocking. Can you talk about any pockets where you're continuing to see inventory destocking, and with orders starting to firm, if you're starting to see anywhere where there's any inventory restocking?","Donald E. Washkewicz","I don't think that -- with the exception of maybe a couple of segments that are not tracking very strong like right now, which would be not very significant, and overall, I don't see a whole lot of destocking going on right now, I see more of cautious stocking relative to, and maybe in line with normal growth activities right now, pretty much across the board in all those segments I mentioned. I don't see big movements one way or another. No great destocking, nor any great emphasis on restocking above the current demand levels.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a clarification and a question, Don, not to delay for the balance sheet question. But now you're saying you're really not going to have an answer on the share repurchase or anything until calendar year 2014, whereas before, I thought, we would hear something by the end of your fiscal year. Are you pushing things out or was I incorrect? And then, my second question is just your confidence level in the ability to achieve 15% margin next year in international industrial, it sounds like, now, the restructuring is ahead of plan. I think the concern was it would be behind. And given the size that Europe is getting better, how should we think about incrementals in that business coming out as we approach next year?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, let me just say that I don't know that I've been specific. I think, we've been talking about the year. And so I'm saying calendar year '14, it could happen in fiscal year '14, certainly. We might take some action, but we really don't have another board meeting until after the end of the fiscal year. So chances are we probably wouldn't do a major share repurchase before then. So it's really more like calendar '14. I don't know that I was specific one way or the other. I think, we just said the year within a year in the past. And then, the question on the 15%, I'm going to let Jon handle that. I think, he has some information for you.","Jon P. Marten","I think, Jamie, the trends in international for us in our restructuring for FY '15 certainly indicate to us that we can get there, Pam talked about the restructuring without the restructuring in the slide that she had for the quarter at gain well north of 14. And given that we're boosting up our savings projected for next year with the additional restructuring that we spoke about this morning, we feel good that we're on track to do 15% in '15. So we're optimistic. We don't want to get too far out ahead of ourselves because we want to really get through to make sure that the numbers are footing here in the quarter, and that we really understand precisely the final impact of all the different restructuring initiatives. One of the things that I find myself doing sometimes is minimizing the difficulty that we've gone through in the past 3 quarters getting this restructuring done. It is awfully complex, a very tough work. Our employees in Europe have worked very, very hard to get us to the point that we're at right now. And certainly, all of our employees around the world that have been working on this restructuring program have just done yeoman's work. And so I don't want to really project anything other than what we talked about this morning, which is an additional incremental $60 million in savings for industrial international for FY '15.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Don, can you just give us some color, I'm struggling with your comments on the process industry. I think, the process industry produce natural gas, and will be benefiting and maybe thriving in this environment. Could you give me some more color on what exactly you're seeing in process industries and what process industries are we talking about?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. I think, for the most part, what I would be referring to, it would be chemical process probably would be dominant within what I've been referring to here.","Jon P. Marten","So yes, you're right, there's some petroleum refineries and things like that probably would still be doing okay. Chemical process, I think, is more what I'm referring to here. And semiconductor, I mentioned earlier, as a separate item.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And the semiconductor is pretty consistent, but the process just being inconsistent. And then...","Jon P. Marten","It depends on who lumps what into that bucket. I think, it's going to maybe make a difference for you.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. Got you. And then, on the acquisitions front, it struck me last night, I saw that Stanadyne sold its filtration business to CLARCOR, that was about $100 million business. I might've thought that, that would've been exactly in Parker-Hannifin's sweet spot, filtration, maybe a little vehicle-related, but is that still the kind of business that Parker might be looking at? And what are you seeing on the competitive front as their own pricing, when deals are coming to fruition?","Jon P. Marten","Ann, the filtration business for us is a great business for us. And that business that you were talking about didn't fit into that category. We are in the process of looking at all filtration companies. Please keep in mind that we are looking at every deal possible. And when we look at every deal possible, we are focusing in on synergies that we can get and what we can deliver to our shareholders at the end of the day. And that's how we do our evaluations. And without commenting on that specific deal, we feel very good about our process. And as Don talked about, we've got several businesses in our pipeline in general. And we will always be sure to emphasize the filtration business. Don, you want to add something to that?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. And I think, Ann, you had asked about the pricing as what's happening on pricing. Generally, I think, what we're saying, and it's been typical here of late, is that people are looking in the rearview mirror and saying, \"What kind of a multiples businesses have gone for prior to 2009, prior to the big recession?\" And I think, that's still in their memory banks. And I think, they still feel that even going into a much slower growth period that we're looking at now that they still think that the properties command much higher multiples than what we would normally think that we could justify based on a discounted cash flow. So I think, that's kind of where we're at now with probably a lot of other companies. We're looking at a future with growth rates that are not going to be bad, but they're not going to be as great as they were back prior to the big recession, at least not in the near-term. And so, the valuations we think are a little bit more pricey than they have been in the past. And I think, people need to forget a little bit about -- or maybe need not forget, but need to make an apples-to-apples comparison of what's going on in the past and what's going on now because we know that only -- there's only 2 lines on this kind of cash flow that make a difference, it's the sales growth line and operating margin. And with the sales growth being down a little bit from what it was in the past, I think, the multiple should come down with that.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. I guess, if I were the seller, Don, I would argue that maybe we don't have the big peaks and troughs we've had historically either. And so, your earnings volatility is lower, therefore, you need to pay for that.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. But I would be one -- yes, I would say the same thing, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If you were selling your business.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Right.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just a question on North American operating margin. I know that last quarter, there was a little bit of debate, and I think, some fine point tuning on guidance. Having a hard time calling what perhaps peak margins look like there and maybe some debate of whether or not you were at peak, given that they were so strong and mixed with the tailwind. Seems like with the performance here and the guide that, that's a little bit less of an issue. Is that a comfort with the sustainability of the current mix and profitability? Is that just better visibility on end markets? Any more color you'd like to add?","Jon P. Marten","I think, we just have a little bit better visibility on where we are with the end markets. Coming out of Q2 is always a tough time for us because we're always sequentially moving up from Q2 into Q3, and trying to make a judgment about those margins at that time, Josh, was a little bit more difficult than it is for us now. And you can tell by our implied margins for Q4, we are even more bullish than we were last quarter.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Excellent. And then, Jon, just a question on pension, with rates where they are today, any sense of what that year-over-year delta could look like in '15 if we freeze the rate environment here?","Jon P. Marten","Yes. I think that a couple of things to keep in mind. Number one, we will need to reevaluate our discount rate, and that's one part of it. There will be a potential change in the mortality table, that will be another part of it. There'll be another change in the rate of return on our assets, that will be another part of it. So just as Don described how we're doing things at the division operating level and rolling everything up, we'll be looking at all of those factors and getting the latest data points. It's too soon to be bullish or pessimistic on the pensions for FY '15 at this point. Pam, do you want to add anything to that?","Pamela J. Huggins","No, I think, that you said it very well. We will be looking at it. But we do have all 3 of those factors to consider this year. And whereas in the past, we have the discount rate, the long-term of return and we also have the mortality table that will be taken into consideration, which will be somewhat as an offset to, obviously, any improvement in the discount rates. So we'll keep you posted.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Got you. And if I can just sneak in one last clarification on the balance sheet and an update there. Am I understanding it right, the plan always, the entire time, was somewhere between August and call it December that you guys were going to update us on plans, and that's still the case? I think, last quarter, you said fiscal yearend, but it was really more no sooner than fiscal yearend?","Donald E. Washkewicz","You're talking about the capital allocation?","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Yes, capital allocation. That's right.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. I think, right now, we're saying calendar year. And yes, we'll update you in August, for sure.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Just one clarification first question because that was confusing me. You gave us $2.04 guidance for the midpoint for 2000 -- for the fourth quarter, and that includes the $0.15, so that's where your $2.19 operating quarter. Is that correct?","Pamela J. Huggins","Thank you, Eli, and I appreciate you pointing that out. And just to add onto that a little bit, it may help Alex [ph]. Last year, for the fourth quarter, we gave $1.98, which included $0.14 of restructuring. So it's $2.19 now versus $2.12 then.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","So it's strong. And what's driving this fourth quarter is the improvement in profitability almost across all the businesses quarter-to-quarter, plus a little bit of volume, is that correct?","Pamela J. Huggins","I think, that's a very good summarization.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And can we talk a bit about pricing across the industries at this point? Are we seeing any issue? Outside, I know Latin America has pricing problem. When you have a volume problem, you're going to have pricing problem. But is pricing pretty stable around or is there any movement in prices at all?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, Eli, I think, that we're managing that pretty good. The pricing, we do raise -- I assume you're talking about how we're pricing relative to the raw material inputs?","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Well, just the cost versus the industry and versus...","Donald E. Washkewicz","I think, what we're doing, we're managing this pretty well. What we have, and it's a global index, we have what we call the Purchase Price Index, and the goal there is to be less than one, that's basically how we aggregate all the purchases we have from prior periods to current period. Time's divine. We aggregate all that. And we're tracking less than one. So I think, on a purchase price basis, we're doing a very good job of recovering the cost and as well as the margin. And on a sell price, we have also an index, which we call a Soft Price Index that works pretty much the same way. We track that around the world globally for all of our operations, all of our sales. And we want that to be tracking greater than one. So if we accomplish both of those things, which we are doing, then we're going to be recovering our cost and the margins. We increased the aftermarket twice a year. Well, it could be once or twice a year, but we have 2 different times, depending on what the need is, either in January or July. So that's when we address the aftermarket, any changes there. And the OEMs are addressed based on the anniversary of the contract that we would sign with OEMs. So that varies throughout the year. To talk about some of the input costs, actually, the input costs have been going up somewhat. But like I said, we were recovering them as they have been going up. Just some of the energy ones would be oil and natural gas. Oil is up slightly over last July when we started the fiscal. Natural gas is up about 30% from last July, so that's up quite a bit. And then, some of the raw material inputs being castings, that's up around 8%. Steel, just looking at a couple of other ones, steel and aluminum, steel is up about 5%, aluminum up 10%, copper up 3%, and nickel up 5%. So some of the more exotic metals are up about 5%. So there is some pressure coming from raw materials. But like I said, we've been managing that pretty well, and so far, we're staying ahead of the curve. I hope that's helpful. Pam has one thing to add there.","Pamela J. Huggins","No. I think, I'm just going to say, at this time, we'll take one more question, and then, we'll move to Don's closing comments. Thank you.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan from RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the savings side of the restructuring program. Can you give some color, I know you mentioned $30 million for the year. What were the savings that you achieved in the third quarter and year-to-date, so far?","Jon P. Marten","Yes, Jamie, Jon here. The savings in Q3 would be -- bear with me for 1 minute, $8 million. So that would be $8 million of the $30 million. And for the year, we would be at $17 million year-to-date of the $30 million.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, on the $10 million in additional savings that you'll get next year, was there a particular area that you uncovered through the process? Or was it the initial plan had some additional cost but also an additional savings with it, just maybe some additional details on where the $10 million in additional savings was coming from?","Jon P. Marten","Yes. It's more the latter than the former. This is because we've moved the restructuring number from $100 million to $118 million as we went through all the additional projects. We found that, in some cases, we're doing a little bit better in terms of savings that we had before. And in some cases, we've had to increase the savings. And in other cases, and again, I -- sometimes, we make it sound very simple, these are many, many, many different projects all throughout the world, and so they go both ways. But when you aggregate them all together, we get to that additional $10 million. So it's -- but it's really mostly related to the delta between $100 million that we originally talked about at the beginning of this fiscal year, and the $118 million that we're talking about today.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thank you. So at this time, I'll turn it over to Don who has a few comments.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Thanks, Pam. So just a couple of closing comments. First of all, I want to thank again everyone on the call for joining us this morning. With our restructuring proceeding as planned, I think, you can see, with the strong operating execution and positive order trends, we expect to close out the year on a positive note, and we'll be well-positioned heading into fiscal year 2015. So we're very pleased with where we are today. A lot of hard work and effort went into the restructuring activities, which was referred to earlier in the year as a self-help program, and it is a self-help program. And I think, we've executed extremely well along those lines. Very difficult. But the team has really performed very well. I'd like to take the opportunity to thank our employees, all the employees, for their continued commitment and the success that we've had. Our global team continues to do a great job executing the WIN strategy and delivering positive results. So at this time, we'll close out, and I'd just like to wish everyone a great day. And then, if there are any other questions, Pam will be available for those throughout the balance of the day. Just give her a call.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thank you very much. We know you have a lot of calls today, it's very active at this time, especially this quarter, at the end of the month. So thank you very much for your participation. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you.

The third part of the call will consist of our standard Q&A session and for the fourth part of the call today Don will close with some final comments. So at this time I will turn it over to Don and ask that you refer to slide number five titled third quarter fiscal year \u201912 highlights.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Thanks Pam and welcome to everyone on the call. To start the call I will just take a few moments to point out some of the highlights for the quarter. This was obviously a very strong quarter for Parker. We are really excited about it, we delivered a number of records and I will touch on some of those records here as we go forward. We did exceed our guidance that was given last quarter, so we are pretty excited about the results for that quarter.","Sales were a third quarter record while net income and diluted earnings per share were all-time records for any quarter in Parker\u2019s history, so a pretty remarkable performance there. Although we did have some benefits on the tax side from some prior year tax filings, our results this quarter definitely reflected strong operating performance in our industrial North America sector, and I will share some of those margins with you in a few moments.","Internationally, our results this quarter did slightly exceed our expectations for soft market conditions in Europe and Asia. International markets appear to have somewhat stabilized. You may recall that when we started our fiscal year, our projections were that the first half was going to be strong and the second half was going to be somewhat weak and it\u2019s exactly how this is rolling out, exactly the way we see it now. We predicted these markets would be soft in our second half and they were soft, and we expect them to be soft throughout our last quarter here, pretty much in line with our original forecast that was given at the beginning of the fiscal year.","Substantially, all of our sales growth in the quarter was organic at 5.8%. Currency rather impacted us by 1.3% negative and acquisitions were very minimal at 0.2%. So you can see most of the growth was organic and the majority of that came form from North America and also aerospace.","Looking on the orders side, orders increased 2%. We did report that against tough comps while quarter ending backlog was up 5% compared with quarter end backlog a year ago. So our backlog has never been stronger as well.","Total company\u2019s segment operating margins were a third quarter record at 15.1. Again you can remember this was our target. We have been trying to get to that 15% and finish the year strong at 15, it looks like we are heading it down that path to have another record year from segment operating margins. Of course that was driven primary by, as I indicated earlier, industrial North America margins and those were 17.3%. We have never achieved that before.","Hopefully there is more to come as we look forward on building on that record as well. Year-to-date, our operating cash flow remains strong at 10.3% of sales and exceeded $1 billion. For the quarter operating cash was $443 million or 13.1% of sales, and I might add that this is the highest amount of operating cash in any quarter since fiscal 2008. So really doing a very good job in spite of the fact that some of the regions around the world are soft, the company still performs very, very strong.","Our usage for cash will be to continue our dividend increase record and make accretive acquisitions similar to what we have done recently and opportunistically repurchase Parker shares. Our board recently authorized us to repurchase up to 16 million additional shares during the remainder of this fiscal year.","Today, we announced another 5% increase in our dividend as we now enter our 56th consecutive fiscal year of increased annual dividend payouts and currently Parker\u2019s yield is approximately 2%, and there is only four or five companies that can match that record.","We are also successful as you\u2019ve seen in acquiring Snap-tite Corporation, a strategic high pressure connector and valve acquisition, and also we announced today an agreement to purchase the Olaer Group based in England. So some of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve referenced going back earlier in the year that we are working on you can see that a couple of those are actually have come through the pipeline, so we\u2019re pretty excited about being able to accomplish that.","Combine these two acquisitions that I just mentioned at approximately $300 million in annual sales and that would make the total for the year so far about $341 million in annual revenues added due to acquisitions. Again these are coming later in our year, so that\u2019s going to be accretive to next year\u2019s forecast as we go on and review that with you going forward.","Due to the fact that outperformed relative to guidance in the third quarter, we\u2019ve now increased our earnings range for the full fiscal year. We now expect that fiscal 2012 earnings will be in the range of $7.30 to $7.50 per diluted share. At the mid-point that represents a 4% increase from our previous guidance and I\u2019d also anticipate some all time record year for the company.","We will be giving guidance for our next fiscal year in early August after I finish this fiscal year, and that\u2019s when we will be reporting our fourth quarter results and full year earnings. Our early projections reflect another year of growth in FY \u201913. We\u2019ve completed a lot of reviews here at corporate with our groups and so far it looks positive for next year as far as additional growth going forward. So we\u2019re going to be more specific on that when we get on our fourth quarter call end of August.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back then over to Pam, and she will give you a little bit more detail.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thanks, Don. At this time, I\u2019d ask that you reference slide number six and I\u2019ll begin by addressing earnings per share. Fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $2.01 and this is an increase of $0.33, or 20% versus the $1.68 from the same quarter a year ago. The $0.33 increase in earnings per share for the third quarter year-over-year from $1.68 to $2.01 is comprised of the following. One segment operating income added $0.13 largely due to higher volume industrial North America. Lower tax rate due to a favorable resolution of prior year\u2019s tax filings impacted EPS by $0.13 and non-controlling interest favorably impacted EPS by just a penny. And as a result of shares repurchase, the lower share count had a favorable EPS impact of $0.14. Higher expenses below segment operating income impacted EPS by $0.08 and I will talk about this in just a moment.","Sales were higher in industrial North America in the aerospace, while climate industrial controls group and international sales were down slightly. International is down less than a percent and this is in spite of the sovereign debt issues and slowing economies in Europe and Asia. Climate industrial controls sales are down due to the issues that we have consistently spoken about in previous calls, but income is actually higher than last year.","North America generated increased operating income year-over-year and international and aerospace were slightly lower. International is down as a result of the slower economy in Europe. Continued investment in Asia in the impact of currency mainly the Euro as it weakened against the dollar. The segment did better than projected however, due to a more favorable impact from currency and less restructuring than anticipated as fore stated by the higher volume.","Expenses below segment operating income as I said I would speak to this were impacted by higher other expenses of $25 million, and that\u2019s mainly due to favorable adjustments last year for insurance settlements and higher currency expense this year. The lower tax rate, again as we said was due to the favorable resolution of prior year\u2019s tax filings and the lower share count obviously as a result of the shares that we repurchased last year and this year.","So now moving to slide number eight. Looking at the top line revenues for the quarter increased 5% to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion last year. This 5% increase in revenue was in spite of a slight decrease in international as a result of slowing economies in Asia and Europe, and climate industrial controls where the residential construction market remains soft. Climate industrial controls however generated more income on less sales.","There was minimal impact from acquisitions in the quarter. Currency reduced sales by 1%, so core growth was 6%. Segment operating margins for the quarter increased 30 basis points from 14.8% to 15.1%, an all time surge for the records of company.","Now moving to slide number nine. Focusing on segments and I\u2019ll commence with North America, North America reported revenues increase of 12% for the quarter. Acquisitions and currency had little impact as such core revenues increase 12% as well. Operating income increase from a $189 million to $227 million, a 20% increase for the quarter year-over-year. Operating margins, a record third quarter increase to 17.3% from 16.1% last year.","Now moving to slide number 10 and continuing with the industrial segment moving to international. Organic revenues in this segment increased 2%, however currency reduced revenues by 3%. Acquisitions had minimal impact in the quarter. So total revenues for the quarter decreased 1%, and again a decrease of 1%, very good in light of what's happening in the macro economy. For the quarter segment operating income decrease to a $195 million from $200 million and operating margins decrease to 15.2% from 15.5%, and again due to the softening economies in Europe and Asia.","So moving to slide number 11 now, I'm focusing on the aerospace segment. They recorded increased revenues of 8%. Acquisitions in currency had no impact and margins decreased for the quarter 160 basis points for the quarter to 12.1% from 13.7% last year. And again this is due to the higher research and development expenses being incurred this year that we have spoken about on previous calls. On a year-to-date basis the aerospace margins are 70 basis points ahead of last year with segment operating income $28 million ahead.","Moving to slide number 12 the climate industrial controls group. For the third quarter year-over-year total reported revenues decreased 6% for the year. Again slow market, some of the slow markets that they are saying that we talked about on previous calls. There is no acquisition impact for the quarter and currency decreased revenues by a percent. So therefore, organic revenues decreased 5%. Segment operating margins however the percent of sales are going up 9.3% for the quarter versus 8.5% last year. And this is due to the continued restructuring efforts that we have spoken about again on previous calls.","So moving to slide number 13 and referencing orders for the quarter. Slide number 13 details orders by segments. And just as a reminder these numbers represent a trailing three month average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year excluding acquisitions in currencies except for aerospace. Aerospace is reported using a 12 month rolling average. So as you can see from the slide, orders are up 2% for the March quarter just ended. North American orders increase 7%, industrial international orders decreased 1%, aerospace orders increased 4%, and this is up from last quarter, and climate industrial controls orders decreased 6%, again due to weakness some other market. ","So moving to the balance sheet on Slide 14, Parker\u2019s balance sheet remains solid. Cash on the balance sheet at year-end was over $773 million. Days sales and inventories decreased to 57 days from 63 last quarter, so we are very happy with that performance. Accounts receivable in terms of DSO closed at 50 days versus 49 last year, and then weighted average days payable outstanding increased to 54 days versus 51 last year, so we are happy with that progress as well.","Moving to Slide number 15, addressing cash flow from operations, for the quarter was $443 million at 13.1% of sales, so very, very good cash flow for the quarter. The major components of the uses of that $443 million in the quarter, we returned to shareholders via share repurchase and dividend payments $80 million, $88 million was used in connection with acquisitions as we closed the Camfil Farr and TAIYO acquisitions in the quarter. $57 million utilized for capital expenditure purchases and then in addition to all of these uses of cash, cash increased another $67 million in the quarter largely due to commercial paper proceeds within the quarter, however that was paid by the end of the quarter, so in total cash increased $285 million quarter-to-quarter.","On Slide 16, you can see that the debt to total cap ratio is 24.3% and on a net basis 15.4%, obviously in very good standing and providing the capability to grow the company moving forward.","So getting to the revised guidance for fiscal year 2012, this is shown on Slide 17 through 19. On Slide 17, the guidance for revenues and operating margin by segment has been provided. I\u2019m not going to go through each one of those numbers. ","Moving to slide 18, guidance has been provided at the mid-point and in total for the items below segment operating income. Again, you can see the numbers moving to slide 19, it summarizes the guidance on a diluted earnings per share basis, and as you can see, the revised guidance for fiscal year 2012 is projected to be $7.30 to $7.50, just as Don has already said.","So please remember that the revised guidance excludes any acquisitions that will be made in the fourth quarter, and to summarize the revised guidance assumptions for revenues increased 6.7% at the mid-point. Segment operating margins are in the range of 15.1% to 15.3% for the year. And expenses below segment operating income, which includes corporate administration, interest and other, at the midpoint of projected to be approximately $429 million, and we put a band around that of plus or minus 0.7%. The projected full-year tax is 26.5% full-year tax rate.","Just a couple of points with respect to guidance, sales first half, second half are divided 48%, 52%. Earnings per share first half, second half are divided 47%, 53%. Realignment costs are minimal and projected to be 6% for the quarter, $0.04 has already been incurred in the remaining projected expenses that will take place in the fourth quarter.","At this time, we\u2019ll commence with the standard Q&A session. But as a reminder, before we do that, we would like to keep this call to one hour, so please honor the request of one question at a time and one follow-up only when clarification is needed. By adhering to this courtesy, everyone will have a chance to participate.","Lisa, at this time, would you please open the call to begin the question-and-answer session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Andrew Buscaglia\u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, this is Andrew Buscaglia in place of Jamie Cook. I just had a quick question on \u2013 can you guys give an updated thought just on the pace of the recovery that you are seeing in Asia and potentially Europe, just a little bit more color there would be great?","Pamela Huggins","Okay, thank you and nice to have you on the call. Jamie is probably on another call as I understand.","Andrew Buscaglia\u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah, we\u2019ve got a few going on.","Pamela Huggins","Yeah okay.","Jon Marten","Okay well, this is Jon and just to begin \u2013 I think as Don indicated earlier where we stand in Asia is right where we thought we were going to at the beginning of this year. Don talked about how our revenues internationally industrial are stabilizing. That holds true for Asia as well as for Europe for us when you really look into the guidance by segment you will see that we are basically sequentially up slightly from Q3 to Q4 in our comps versus last year, very tough comps and still showing really good results.","So as Don indicated we are going to be looking at the trends for Asia, China specifically, but Asia in total as well as Europe altogether deeply during our Q4 and we will be updating our guidance from July 1 to June 30 of calendar year \u201913 here at the beginning of August. But I think the keyword for us right now is that our international sales both in Europe given the issues there as well as in China given the issues there that have stabilized and that\u2019s what's included in our guidance here for Q4.","Andrew Buscaglia\u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks. And then actually just on this \u2013 I saw this acquisition this morning on Olaer. It looks like actually this company is pretty sizeable with $200 million in revenue. There is not a whole lot disclosed in the press release. Could you guys talk to that a little bit more in terms of like what you are expecting, or would appreciate how much you paid for it or can you give any more details there?","Jon Marten","Well, yeah I appreciate the question. I mean I think two key points on that deal. We announced an agreement to acquire that company. So we expect and we are hoping that that deal closes on July 2 and \u2013 so that will be impacting our FY 2013. At this stage of our transaction we would not be disclosing that level of detail. We have some work to do and we want to make sure that we get our real good work done with the sellers as well as all the employees of Olaer in Q4 and get this final agreement on by July 2nd. So that\u2019s our plan.","Andrew Buscaglia\u2013 Credit Suisse","All right. Thanks guys. I will step back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Robert W. Baird and Company. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning guys. This is Rick Dubber [ph] for Rob McCarthy.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","A quick clarification question when looking at your guidance. So, if we are taking the mid point of the updated guidance, $7.40, and I'm adjusting for the $0.13 tax benefit, then I guess according to my math I'm looking at fourth quarter guidance of about $1.80 which when I am looking at performance in the third quarter again adjusted for the tax benefit of $1.88, at the mid point would suggest a step down in EPS from the third to fourth quarter and that\u2019s something that traditionally speaking we haven\u2019t seen generally speaking.","Pamela Huggins","Oh, that \u2013 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going down here, but this is Pam speaking, and I have the guidance sitting before me by quarter. And while third quarter is a little bit below the third quarter not to the degree that you are mentioning, but one thing to remember is that in the fourth quarter we are not baking in the impact of the third quarter tax benefit. So really the fourth quarter is stronger than the third quarter once you back out that tax benefit.","Unidentified Analyst","Right, I thought I was doing that, but perhaps I got my math wrong. The point is we should be seeing really a step up in operating results in the fourth quarter result.","Pamela Huggins","Yeah, and we do. At the mid point you are seeing well over $10 million and it\u2019s higher than that in terms of the increase. So you are seeing a substantial increase from third quarter to fourth quarter and I throw up that number because I know that you guys are smart enough and are going to be able to back into it anyway.","Unidentified Analyst","Well, hopefully. My follow-up is still on the international side, and some of the commentary, they are positive and we appreciate that. A little bit different than what we\u2019ve heard from Ethan. So I guess I am wondering, what is it that you guys are seeing Europe versus Asia, is there a difference in the way these markets are performing and perhaps mobile versus fixed [inaudible].","Jon Marten","Well, I think that in Europe we are seeing a broad based stabilization in all end markets and all of our businesses in Europe. So we feel very confident in our forecast here for our Q4 and for the balance of the year. Now, in Asia although, yes, we are very well aware of the mobile hydraulics issues in Asia and in China specifically. We have gone through in detail all of our end markets and all of our product lines there and we are seeing a real stabilization of our revenues that are coming from that region. So, yes, mobile hydraulics is down slightly, not a big number, nothing really that concerns us, and we are really happy with the way that our Asian business and our revenues from Asia have materialized here for us as we really look at Q4. And like I said, I think to give you a broader perspective long term we\u2019ll have to give you a really more detailed update in August for that.","Don Washkewicz","Yeah. And Rick, this is Don, I don\u2019t know \u2013 you were mentioning other companies, so I am not sure exactly what they are saying. I am not watching their reports. But we are putting a lot of infrastructure into Asia, we are penetrating market in Asia, we are going to continue that along those lines. Our breadth of product line doesn\u2019t even compare to the other people that we are talking about here. We have a broad range of products whether it goes from ceiling or filtration, pretty much across the board, so I don\u2019t think you can do \u2013 there is no apples to apples comparison when you are talking about the two companies. ","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Pamela Huggins","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please proceed.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Hi, good morning.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning. ","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Pam, could you just give a little more details on the balance sheet ratios, specifically the ones that really measure your progress on getting leaner. I'm talking about inventory to sales ratio for the quarter, how that compares with the past, working capital sales ratio and CapEx to sales and what you expect for the year in the CapEx, because those things have been dropping and they are generating cash for you.","Pamela Huggins","Yeah, Alex, you bring up a good point and I think if you look back, that's one of the strengths of Parker Hannifin, really the way that they are able to manage their working capital, whether it be in an up cycle or a down cycle. When you look at our DSO versus our peer companies, we always are at the very top of that list in managing our receivables. So we are very proud of where we come out with regard to that, and so \u2013 and I don't take credit for that, there are a lot of people around the world who work every day to make sure that that is taken care of.","So we have people out in all of those divisions working very hard every day, making sure that we are collecting those receivables and that we don't have the kind of risk that you sometimes see out there.","In terms of inventory, we are trying to get that down, we\u2019ve been talking about that and in fact we have set an all-time record this quarter. Inventory as a percent of sales is 10.9%, and it's the first time it's ever been that low. So, and obviously we are smart enough to know that numbers play a little bit apart in that. But again, all of our divisions around the world working very hard to get that inventory. We said we want to be 10% of sales and at 10.9% we\u2019re getting pretty close to that number, so we\u2019re working very hard on that as well. We still have work to do, but happy with the results thus far.","And then, of course we have gentlemen here who works on the payables side who is very good at seeing results there. We don\u2019t quite do as well as we would like to do there, but we\u2019ve made great progress. You can see the [inaudible] that three-day improvement that I mentioned in my script remarks. So, we are making progress there as well, so we\u2019re very happy with what we\u2019re seeing, but working hard every day to even make it better.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Yeah, the numbers on ","Jon Marten","Yeah, Alex, the CapEx was the other number. We\u2019re running around 1.6% right now of sales. And I think that over a longer run we\u2019re not going to see that be 1.6%, but I haven\u2019t been quite amazed myself as to how efficient we\u2019ve been able to get as a result of rolling out lean and really driving that to some of the self-directed work team effort going on in the company and so forth. It\u2019s really gratifying to see these kinds of CapEx numbers. And that just frees up cash to do other things which you\u2019re starting to see here that we\u2019re looking at. So, yeah, it\u2019s a good number. ","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Thank you. ","Pamela Huggins","Thank you, Alex","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan Securities. Please proceed. ","Ingrid Aja \u2013 JP Morgan","Good morning. This is Ingrid Aja, standing in for Ann","Pamela Huggins","Hi, Ingrid. How are you","Ingrid Aja \u2013 JP Morgan","I am fine. How are you? ","Pamela Huggins","Real good","Ingrid Aja \u2013 JP Morgan","Good. You touched on this a little bit, but I was wondering if you could about the climate industrial controls, it continues to disappoint versus our expectations and with orders down 6% in the quarter, I wonder if you could just talk little bit more about the fundamentals in that business and where specifically the weakness is?","Don Washkewicz","Well, the key there \u2013 this is Don, the housing starts as a key part of that group that\u2019s tied directly pretty much to housing starts. There is truck activity and there is some industrial valves activity, but primarily the refrigeration, air conditioning parts are tied to a great extend to the housing market. And we know that what the situation is there. I will make a note that, in March, and you don\u2019t see that number in March, but in March that group had double-digit ROS numbers, operating ROS. So it is improving as we go forward. Some of the restructuring that was done last year is starting to come through. So like I said, you are not going to see that number but that\u2019s what it was.","There was less revenues and there was more income. So, yeah, the revenues were down but the income was higher. So I think we\u2019re seeing the benefits of lot of the restructuring that has been going on in that group. So until such time as the housing market really starts to rebound I think we are probably bouncing off the bottom there. And when we start getting some up lift I think this group will start coming back and show some nicer numbers based on a lot of the work that they have done as far as restructuring over the past six to nine months.","Ingrid Aja \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. So it\u2019s basically offsetting any positive that you are seeing on the chart [inaudible] side.","Don Washkewicz","Yes.","Ingrid Aja \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little about acquisitions. Your pace of acquisitions have picked up in recent months. So if you could talk a little bit about what your pipeline is like and what you expect to see? Should we continue to expect to see this kind of activity level?","Don Washkewicz","Well, we have \u2013 as we had indicated for the last year or two, some of the ones that we are talking about today we have been \u2013 well actually one of them I can tell you I have been looking at for 35 years. So you never can predict when you are going to get something through the pipeline and so that\u2019s gratifying to see where we are at. And there is more in the pipeline. We are working on, we are looking at more, and we anticipate more coming through. It\u2019s hard to predict when because you never know what you run into as you are going through the negotiations.","But we haven\u2019t stopped. We\u2019ve got a lot of dry powder so to speak in cash capacity, debt capacity that we can utilize to make more acquisitions and we intend to do that. I think just the ones we\u2019ve done off late would add about 3% of sales roughly next year just themselves. So I think you can see how we are building some backlog here for another good year in the coming year. But we don\u2019t anticipate stopping here. We want to continue to build on what we have started to get through the pipeline.","Ingrid Aja \u2013 JP Morgan","That\u2019s great color. Thank you.","Pamela Huggins","Thank you Ingrid.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning Terry.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good morning, good morning. Hey, Don, just want to clarify on the re-up on the buy back. I think the way you said it, one could have interpret it to mean that you are looking to execute 16 million share buyback by the end of fiscal 2012. Can you just clarify?","Don Washkewicz","Yeah, we have authority, renewed authority from our board to buy up to 16 million shares in this fourth quarter. We could buy zero or we could buy 16 million or anything in between. So that\u2019s strictly just for the fourth quarter. We have renewed authority for next year, but that\u2019s all separate than what we are talking about now. This specifically has to do with the fourth quarter. And with the stocked away it\u2019s been languishing at the levels that it\u2019s been which has not been where we think it should be. We will take some prudent action here where you are looking at our models where we use a discounted cash flow model, we have a grid that we establish. We are kind of getting in the red zone, okay, if I can put it in those terms as to when we just don\u2019t want to see this drop any further. So, yeah, so we have that capacity and we will utilize it wisely and opportunistically.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And I was just wondering if that has implications for the pace of acquisitions.","Don Washkewicz","No. Actually we have \u2013 this would give us the ability at $80 a share, you know assuming it\u2019s at $80, to acquire about a 1.2 billion or some thereabouts in shares. We have about, what our debt capacity right now we have another $1.2 billion capacity and that\u2019s not counting any additional earnings going forward that we\u2019ve been generating record cash flows going \u2013 over the past year if we look at our record cash flows we are going to have plenty of cash to do the dividends, the share repurchase, and any acquisitions that we want to going forward. I feel pretty comfortable with all that.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then Jon, I'm wondering if you can add a little more detail to the organic growth picture on the international industrial side. Orders in March, down one 3 months trailing average, I was wondering if you can help us with January, February, March progression. I wonder if you can clarify. It looks to me unless I'm missing something on acquisitions and FX that the implied organic range for 4Q is 0 to minus 3. And then I'm wondering also if you can just talk, you should be coming up on some really easy comps in some of the international end markets like semiconductor and such. Do you think to the back half of calendar 2012 how much visibility you have on an acceleration just on easy comps alone?","Don Washkewicz","This is Don, I just have a couple of quick comments and I\u2019ll let Jon follow-up from there. Europe for the year I'm going to touch on Europe I'm going to touch on Asia just separately, but Europe for the year is going to be up about 5%. Remember what we said earlier that the second half, which our second half or third and fourth quarters is going to be weaker.  Well, actually it was down on a year-to-year basis third quarter about 1% in Europe. So what you are saying is true. There has been some degradation, but we anticipated that. For the fourth quarter we are looking at down another percent which is on target from what we have predicted and that\u2019s from last year\u2019s fourth quarter so that\u2019s about a 1% down from last year\u2019s fourth quarter which was a pretty strong quarter.","If you look at Asia, we are going to end up for the year about 2.5% up for the full year. The third quarter was up about a percent over last year\u2019s third quarter. Again if you look at Europe and Asia they are kind of offsetting in that respect. Europe was down about a percent third quarter over third quarter, Asia is up about a percent third quarter over third quarter. So you get kind of a flat, stable kind of outlook.","We are looking at Asia about down 2% in the fourth quarter, which is a strong quarter over last year, 2% quarter over quarter in Asia in total. So when we look at all of this together, and keep in mind that Latin America is coming back as a smaller region, of course Latin America is starting to show some life off the bottom, we are looking at kind of a stable outlook, flattish kind of outlook going forward. I hope that helps, and Jon you can add anything that you might want to add to.","Jon Marten","No, I would say that that covers it perfectly. Terry, anything further on that?","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yeah, just to be clear. Don that\u2019s all in including FX factor or that\u2019s just organic, just on your 4Q commentary.","Don Washkewicz","That\u2019s organic?","Jon Marten","That\u2019s organic.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Raso with ISI Group. Please proceed.","Don Washkewicz","Hi David.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Hi, I am sorry, I am here. So if you look at the full year guidance for \u201912, basically you are saying the full year revenue is up 6.6 with an incremental of 20.8. So just trying to peak a bit into next year, going into this past year you had a lot stronger order growth, right, up 24, up 15 the last two quarters of last year. This year obviously a little slower, plus 2, and whatever fourth quarter gives us. But you have more acquisitions going into fiscal \u201913 than you had in \u201912. So trying to think through the incremental margins, how you are thinking about just framework going into next year based on how this year is playing out, right? This 6.6 revenues, 20.8% incremental. How should we think about A, maybe the margins of what you recently acquired, because that\u2019s obviously going to impact how we should think about incremental into next year. Structurally any of the things that you\u2019ve done to the company this year to still allow that kind of incremental next year. Again, I'm just thinking about the revenue going into \u201912 as more organic sales growth. At the moment, the revenue growth going to \u201913 is more acquisitions, which usually provides lower incremental. If you can help us on just thinking about especially those incrementals for \u201913 versus \u201912.","Don Washkewicz","Yeah, David, I think the relevant range is still the 20% to 30% incremental returns. That\u2019s with acquisitions. I think at least the early numbers that we have looked at here is kind of falling in that range. Like I said, we are going to give you a more detail and better color as we go forward. But I feel comfortable in that range going forward with the projections that we are going to be giving you from organic as well as the acquisition growth. I think we are going to be doing fine.","We are seeing obviously a pretty strong growth from aerospace, which is positive. I think we had a little negative impact off late because of their higher than expected non-recurring engineering. I think that\u2019s going to drift down a little bit, that\u2019s going to be a little bit more accretive to the MROS going forward. Irrespective of what happens in Europe and Asia, I think as long as they don\u2019t implode more than what we anticipate here, I mean a little softening, I think we are going to be fine with those kind of marginal that I am reflecting here.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","I mean that is pretty interesting. To think higher incremental next year than this year, those \u201913 or at least the initial base case, kind of how we are starting the year, can be a little more acquired revenue in a way to your comment earlier about what you already acquired to give you 3% growth for \u201913 already. Can you imply from that to the margins of the recent acquisitions are because I have to say north of 20%? Are those acquired revenues that high a margin?","Don Washkewicz","No, I won\u2019t make those assumptions, no. Keep in mind too that we have been shrinking in CIC all year. We anticipate that not going to be continuing to be continuing forever either. So there is some margin impacts from other areas of the business that you got to take into consideration when you look at the end result for the year.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Not to push on it. But just trying to figure, those incremental margins, if they were lower than 20 to 30 on the acquired revenues obviously implies even bigger than 20 to 30 on the base revenue growth. So clearly there must be some restructuring benefits that quantify to some degree.","Don Washkewicz","Yeah, there are restructuring benefits that we have seen and we will continue to see. We are also going to see the continued activity on oil and gas which has been very good for us, very strong. And again, the other thing that we see building and continue to build strong relative to the OEM side of the businesses distribution, distribution is a real strong piece of the puzzle, and we anticipate at least early look at next year looks like that\u2019s going to continue strong as well. That all adds to the higher margins and higher incrementals.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","All right. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks David.","Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Good morning everyone.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning Eli.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","[Inaudible] to those of us who believed that Parker is a stronger operating company today.","Don Washkewicz","Thanks for hanging in there with us. Everybody else abandoned ship.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Come on, you have got a couple of good guys.","Don Washkewicz","All right, I know we have got a few good ones on the phone.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Yeah a few good ones. Just one clarification, when you talk about $315 million of acquisition. That includes the Olaer one today that you announced?","Don Washkewicz","That\u2019s correct, yeah.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","I wanted to make sure that. Can you give us a little bit of color on what's going on in the various segments? You talked \u2013 a lot of question about industrial international. You had a much stronger organic showing in North America than you might have suspected from 8% and 7% order patterns going on, something actually stepped up in that business and you are expecting it to continue actually into the fourth quarter. Can you give us some idea on what happened to give us a double digit number as opposed to the order pattern that we are showing?","Jon Marten","Well, I think Eli, I\u2019ll start out, this is John and I know Don will perhaps have some points to add. But, certainly in Q3 in the ordering patterns as well as our conversion, we saw excellent progress in our oil and gas end markets. We saw excellent progress in our construction end markets, and we saw excellent progress in distribution overall. Those markets really helped drive our results in Q3 and drive results in our Q3 to a greater extend that we thought that they would be here as we were looking at Q3 in North America at the end of Q2. So I think in a nut shell I don\u2019t want to just say that it\u2019s just that but those would be the top markets I think. In general I think a key take away would be that North America results with the quarter on the top line and in the orders, is broad based. It\u2019s many, many of the segments that we operate in all across the product lines that we have, and a real testament to some of the diversification efforts that we have been making over the last five years here to really help drive our North American revenues and we are very, very proud of that, very excited about that for the future. And with that oath for the future too.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Can we also talk a little bit about aerospace, are we going to see an acceleration of top line growth with all these wins and there I mean we are still running 7%, 8% plus a little more top line. Are we going to see an acceleration of this, not much in the fourth quarter but in 2013 with better profitability as the R&D comes down, I mean that [inaudible] as we look forward.","Jon Marten","Well, Eli, Jon again. Just a couple of comments on that. Number one, I don\u2019t want to say anything too definitive about FY \u201913 today because we really need to study very hard the patterns. But two, just high level points to make. The commercial OEM business and the commercial after market business in aerospace are just fantastic and they are only going to accelerate as time goes on. What we have to balance that out is against what is happening in the defense markets at the OEM level and it defends aftermarket MRO level, and that\u2019s where the really deep analysis will be made. But I think long term as we were talking about on our investor day in December, long term the prospects, the organic prospects going forward are fantastic and we are going to have a lot more to say about the mix in aerospace here at the beginning of August.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","All right, thank you.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks Eli.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with Keybanc Capital Markets.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","Hi, good morning guys.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","Yeah, so, you gave us some good color into the fourth quarter on kind of how you are thinking about Asia and Europe. And Don, you said early in the call, you expect growth into fiscal 2013. But as you kind of think directionally, I know you are not prepared to give any guidance, but if you think directionally, how do we kind of think about trajectory into fiscal \u201913, as we think geographically North America versus Europe versus Asia.","Don Washkewicz","Well, I'm just going to give you a little bit of color on the order trends. Again we\u2019ve done this in the past. We look real closely at our 3-12 pressure curves in \u201912, and that\u2019s a good predictor of what's coming down the road. And if you look at industrial North America just looking at our 3-12 \u2013 this is the last three months of the previous year of the same three months in 12-12 would be the last 12 months order trend over the same \u201912. North America, both of those trends are very strong and are well above a 100%. We are talking about a 108% on the 3-12, a 112% on the 12-12. So, very strong going into next year. We don\u2019t anticipate any major changes there because they already have orders in the pipeline to cover the early part of next fiscal year already. Europe is flattening out at about a 100, little bit of greater than that on the 12-12 is running about a 110, but 3-12 is running around a 100. So I can see the Europe coming in for a soft landing going into next year which is kind of what I have been saying here. Asia likewise is coming in at around a 100. So we are coming in kind of \u2013 that\u2019s what we say those two regions look kind of stable to us right now at the levels that we are looking at here right now.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","So it\u2019s good growth in North America and kind of a stable international\u2026","Don Washkewicz","Kind of stable outlook internationally, right. Now, if you look at some of the specific markets, heavy duty truck is strong, I think you probably tracked that as well. Construction, off highway construction is still strong. Refrigeration, as I indicated earlier, the CIC Group is one of our weaker segments. That\u2019s below 100% on the 3-12 and the 12-12, so that\u2019s still got ways to go before it bounce off of the bottom and start seeing some improvement there.","Semiconductor is still weak, according to our pressure curves 3-12 and 12-12 are under a 100 there, and that\u2019s what we anticipate and we have been forecasting. Process has been \u2013 process markets have been pretty strong, well above a 100, about a 120 and growing on the 3-12, running about 110% on 12-12. So you can see that that is a real strong market for us. And I mentioned Aerospace before, the Aerospace 3-12 pressure curve is at about 125. So that\u2019s going to be very strong for us next year.","But keep in mind that two areas I think I want you to remember, our distribution and aerospace, I think those two areas, discount the fact that Asia and Europe are going to be whatever they are going to be. We are going to continue to grow our presence in Asia and put more assets on the ground which we are doing and we are going to eat into the market share over there. But we\u2019ll have to see how that develops. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get much worse than it is now, we are not anticipating that. But the real big areas for next year I think you are going to continue to see a real strong North American development and then also Aerospace will be another strong segment. So that would be some of my input on the coming year.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","And then the just a quick on European restructuring, can you quantify what your total restructuring will be in this fiscal year and kind of how you think about restructuring benefits into fiscal 2013 on that basis?","Jon Marten","Well, I think our restructuring all together is $0.06 for the year, we\u2019re going to have $0.02 in Q4. And in Europe, specifically, there has not been, as compared to the prior years, nearly as much restructuring as we\u2019ve had in prior years. We feel very good about our cost structure there as it continues to improve over time. And really, we\u2019ve been working with the local councils and the local governments on different programs there that really frankly don\u2019t require us to do a significant restructuring like we maybe had to four or five years ago. So, we really are very optimistic about being able to further improve our cost structure there over time and really improve our bottom-line margins as we continue to grow and add synergies from all of our businesses there and our sales companies and the way that we go to market which is we feel is very unique and very special about on our company.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with stifle Nicolaus. Please proceed.","Richard Hall\u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hey guys this is Richard Hall on for Nathan Jones.","Pamela Huggins","Hi Richard.","Richard Hall\u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","How is it going?","Pamela Huggins","Good, welcome.","Richard Hall\u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Good, thanks. So I am looking at the aerospace margins. Obviously they are fairly weak during the quarter. You mentioned that this is because of the R&D impact, primarily because of the R&D impact. So two quick questions here. Is there any way you can quantify what the R&D impact was in the quarter? And then second, and you may have hinted to this earlier. But when you are looking over the next few quarters, should we try to continue to see a little bit of margin pressure from the R&D or is that going to ramp down or how should we think about run rate here?","Jon Marten","Well, I think as Don talked about in his comments, this is Jon, Don talked about in his comments, you know, R&D is a really tough expense. You know, the expense \u2013 everything is incurred in that business from an R&D standpoint, and it\u2019s really tough to get the timing right. And so, we really got some expenses into our Q3 that we have been projecting into other quarters. But really when you think about R&D in aerospace as a percent of sales we are still going to be right where we thought that we were going to be at the beginning of the year, last year in FY \u201911 we were above 10% heading towards 11% of sales of R&D as a percent of sales. This year we will be FY \u201912 well below 10% as a percent of sales in R&D. And we anticipate that trend will continue in our out years as time goes on. A more normalized number is in the 7% to 8% range. And so, that\u2019s what we have been kind of targeting for ourselves, and as Don alluded to there is just a timing issue in Q3.","Richard Hall\u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Sure. Okay, great, thank you.","Pamela Huggins","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Volkmann with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Steven Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Hi good morning. Most of my questions have actually been answered, but I'm just wondering Don, the tone of kind of how we progress through the quarter in CIC, we\u2019ve seen some of your larger or I assume your customers talking about things getting a little bit better as we progress through the quarter and seeing some signs of life in HVAC finally, and I'm just wondering if you might have seen that tone of things through the quarter or is it still too early to think about that?","Pamela Huggins","Steve, this is Pam speaking. Yeah, I think you know what you are referencing we are seeing, but we are not getting too excited here yet. You know I think if you look at the very end of the quarter, in the last month and even in the mid month you saw some things may be picked up, but it\u2019s just too early for us to get too exuberant. But you are right we are reading the same things that you are reading and so I did question our climate industrial controls group about that, and yeah, slightly.","Don Washkewicz","I think Steve we found the bottom. Hopefully going forward we are going to start bumping on the up side here. So, year-over-year we are down 6% on revenues. We\u2019ve got more income than we did last year because of all the restructuring we are down 6% in revenues. We are lean as we have ever been in that group, and believe me we get a little volume we will be generating some nice MROS numbers. But, yeah, I think if you hear the rest of the commentary from other companies I think there is only one way to go from here is up. I mean that\u2019s the only way to go. So it\u2019s just a matter of timing right now.","Steven Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","I guess that\u2019s mildly encouraging. So since you brought it up Don, I'm going to ask the question. Can you get to the corporate average for the rest of the company margin? Is mid teens doable on this business with reasonable volume or is it still going to be a bit lower?","Don Washkewicz","Again that would depend on just a mix of what's going on there. Certainly we have been in the teens before. We have never been, to the best of my recollection to 15 for any period of time. We might have hit 15 and a quarter. I'm not even sure we did that. I think more like 13 or some or thereabouts. But keeping in mind too that that group has traditionally had a much lower asset intensity to it, and as a result we get to our return on net assets metrics a lot, and a lot lower ROS. Not this data we want to give any group a pass. We still think that we want all these groups to be at 15 plus, and as a matter of fact virtually all of the other groups demonstrated 15% plus kind of performance here especially as you can see now from this month or this quarter.","So, we have got some other things going on in that group that are going to be accretive to us going forward. There are some very significant projects going on in our renovation program with precision cooling and things like that that are higher margin businesses. These are innovative type products coming out and we think that\u2019s going to be accretive to that business as well. We are going to be able to hit 15. The question is, it\u2019s hard to say. I think we are going to certainly be in the teens and approaching 15. Like I said we hit double digits in the pretty down period of time here this last quarter. So it has been gradually coming up and a lot of that\u2019s because of all of the restructuring we are doing. So I think we are setting the field for something good going forward in that group.","Steven Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And is it sort of order of magnitude, a third of that would be HVAC and the rest would be mobile or?","Pamela Huggins","Yeah. There is about 15% of that business which is on the industrial side, which is the flood control, and then there is 35% which is what we call mobile, which is made up of trucks, refrigeration and trucks, off highway equipment, auto. And then about 50% of the business is stationary air conditioning and refrigeration.","Steven Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","50%, okay, great. Thanks very much.","Pamela Huggins","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague [ph] with Vertical Research. Please proceed.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Pamela J. Huggins","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","A lot of ground\u2019s been covered. Just a couple of little loose ends from me. On aero, just to put a finer point on it Don, you said a higher than expected non-recurring engineering, is that put to bed, I'm assuming that\u2019s a certain business shift program that maybe can remain nameless on the call, but is that totally behind you or there is still some more work to be done there?","Don Washkewicz","That\u2019s a good question. I know that it was unusual for this quarter. Every now and then we get a surprise like this. I can't promise you that we won't get another surprise going down the road. It\u2019s the timing issue as far as how these class roll in, and so our hopes are that this is a one time event, but I can't promise you that. A few quarters down have a timing situation where a lot of things hit all on one quarter, we have another event. But the trend ought to be going down.","Pamela J. Huggins","Yeah, Jeff, I think it\u2019s \u2013 we do pretty well on an annual basis but quarter-to-quarter you may see some fluctuation. So why you saw that maybe it was higher in this quarter, you know it\u2019s going to even out for the year. We still think it\u2019s going to be less than last year as a percent of sales. We are still intense on that goal. That\u2019s what we have been communicating and we still feel pretty comfortable that it will come in at that level.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Great. Just finally from me, just pricing in North America Don, can you give us a little color on what's going on in pricing dynamics and maybe contrast that to cost side of the equation?","Don Washkewicz","Yeah, that\u2019s a good question. You know we had a lot of things going on here on the raw materials side that have been going up and down and sideways and what have you. One of the more significant things that happened was on the polymer side. There was an explosion in Europe of one of the Nylon 11 \u2013 Nylon 12 facilities over there which put the automotive business companies in a tizzy because a lot of it is used in fuel lines. We are not in that part of the business, but we do use Nylon 11 and Nylon 12 for air break tubing on trucks and things like that.","We did have alternates that we were able to utilize. We had different constructions for some of these products and we are able to keep our customers out of trouble. So I think there was going to be a ramp up certainly on pricing and some of the raw materials on the polymer side of the business.","If you look at the metals, copper is increasing at a decreasing rate, aluminum for the most part is leveling off now, at least the last numbers that I had seen. Oil was at one year high in March. Steel had an annual all time high, I believe it was in February and Nickel was kind of flat for the year, but pretty volatile, bounces all over the place. So, when you talk about pricing where we are right now is as you know we measure the \u2013 what we call the purchase price index and for all of our divisions and all of our purchases worldwide and we aggregate that number for the entire company and then we look at the sell price index through our pricing teams worldwide and we aggregate that and the key here is to make sure that the sell price index is high enough to recover any purchase increases in cost that you\u2019ve incurred and any other costs plus the margin. And I can tell you right now we are running positive there.","So we are staying on top of this and we are recovering these raw material increases as we are inferring them in pricing, and we will continue to do that. There is price increases that are scheduled for the July timeframe, we had some of that happen in the January timeframe and that\u2019s going to continue. And again, our whole mission here is to make sure that we don\u2019t fall behind and jeopardize margins because we are not passing on increases properly. We have done a really, really good job of this over the last probably six, seven years since we have launched our strategic pricing initiative here in the company.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Thank you, that\u2019s all from me.","Pamela Huggins","Thank you. At this time I think we are going to end the Q&A session. We are past our hour. I would like to thank all of you for attending and to those people out there supporting your analysts. I want to give you a special thank you for participating in the call today and look forward to talking to you later. But before closing, I just want to turn it over to Don, who just has some comments before we close the call. Thank you.","Don Washkewicz","Yeah, thanks Pam and just a couple of last closing comments. First of all thanks all of those on the call. I know that there was another meeting. We were not expecting that to happen. Unfortunately it did happen with another one of our peer companies. So this is going to be tough for people to try to cover both of these meetings. But I think hopefully we gave you a little bit of color on what\u2019s happening at the company and maybe a little glimpse of what we anticipate going into next year.","You can see what\u2019s happening with the acquisitions and how we are going to be managing the cash here. The dividend increase that we have talked about, it\u2019s another 5% that we just announced. That\u2019s 10% for the year. So we are trying to keep our shareholders that we have happy, and we have got some capacity here certainly on the share buyback activity that we can action as we go forward.","So I think you have an idea as to what our plans and our strategies are going forward. I would like to take this opportunity also as long as we are on the call to thank all of our employees worldwide for their continued commitment to serve our customers. They have really done a remarkable job here off late and for continuing to deliver a strong financial performance that we are seeing for the company, setting our all-time records. It\u2019s really gratifying to see all the good work that\u2019s been done and the kind of results that we are achieving as a result of that.","We anticipate a strong finish to fiscal \u201912, as we indicated. We don\u2019t see anything bad happening over the next several months here certainly, and we are going to give you the best look at fiscal \u201913 in August and we think again that\u2019s going to be a growth year for us.","So I want to thank you for your participation on the call and for your continued interest in Parker, and then if there is any additional questions, of course Pam will be around the rest of the day. She will be happy to take your calls. So with that, take care and have a great day, bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you very much. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

The third part of the call will consist of the standard Q&A session; and for the fourth part of the call today, Don will close with some final comments.","So at this time I\u2019ll turn it over to Don and ask that you refer to slide number five titled First Quarter Fiscal Year \u201813 highlights.","Don Washkewicz","Thanks Pam and welcome to everyone on the call. We certainly appreciate you joining us today. I just want to make a couple of comments and then we\u2019ll turn it back over to Pam for some additional detail about the quarter.","First of all, our results in the first quarter largely reflect the impact of the continued weakness in international markets and the softness in North America and that\u2019s particularly late in the quarter and I\u2019ll talk about that in a minute here.","Actually I had a plan going into September, so July and August were actually fairly strong months. We are actually ahead of plan than we experienced in September; a lot of cancellations and rescheduling of orders and so forth by many of our OEM customers as they adjusted to current economic conditions. So that\u2019s really what impacted the quarter for the most part. We were ahead and then a lot of these cancellations, rescheduling. We saw a September come in weaker than what we had anticipated.","Considering what happened in these conditions, we have performed well in the quarter or remain cautious about the outlook, especially going into calendar 2013 and I just say it to keep in mind that we are one of the few companies giving guidance into 2013 due to our mid-year fiscal. Our earnings guidance therefore reflects this caution with regard to the global economy in calendar 2013. ","Just a few points about the quarter, a little review of the quarter. Our sales were essentially flat with last year at $3.2 billion and they were impacted by a 9% decline in industrial international sales, so you can see where the weakness is coming from; its in our international segment. ","This is the third consecutive quarter in which we have reported a year-over-year decline in this segment, largely as a result of recessionary conditions in Europe and moderating growth in Asia. So really Europe was impacted the most and that followed by Asia. That was partially offset by a 5% growth in North America in the quarter.","Currency was negative 3%, while acquisitions contributed 3% and organic sales were essentially flat and that combination resulted in a flat top line for us for the quarter.","Total segment operating margins were 14.4%, which were actually pretty good when you look historically, they were pretty good numbers, in spite of all of the negative segments that we are talking about here and we are again impacted by the industrial international segment, which had operating margins of about 12.9%, while industrial North American margins remained pretty strong at 17.9%. I might just point out that North America margins were better than our full year North American margin last year, which was at 17.2%. So North America performed very well in the quarter.","Net income for the quarter was $239 million or $1.57 per share and that\u2019s a decline of 18% compared with last year\u2019s first quarter and that EPS reflects additional acquisition integration costs and we\u2019ll talk about that in a bit, as well as aerospace R&D expense. I might add there that the additional expense for aerospace was required to keep pace with our customers timelines for several of these new programs that we\u2019ve been working on, that we landed over the last couple of years, so that\u2019s what impacted the R&D expense. Net cash from operations was slightly negative driven by a $226 million discretionary contribution to the pension plan and this anticipated change was announced previously.","During the quarter we also continued to execute on long term initiatives to drive growth and profitability, some of those were as follows: we completed five acquisitions in the quarter, which added $243 million approximately in annualized sales. Additionally in October we announced two more acquisitions, two filtration acquisitions and those were at about $141 million in annualized sales.","In addition we announced the divestiture of the automotive air conditioning portion of the climate industrial control segment and that the sales for that segment that we divested was approximately $140 million in sales. That unit by the way was in our numbers for the entire first quarter, but will not be going forward.","Earlier this month in France we saw a graded opening of our 2000th Parker store. We added 1000 stores in the past five years. We\u2019ve added a store approximately every business day over the past five years somewhere in the world. So a lot of good things happening from the standpoint of acquisition activity and other growth initiatives for the company. ","Looking forward to our expectations for the full fiscal year, we have revised our guidance for earnings for continuing operations from the range of $7.10 to $7.90 to the range of $6.15 to $6.75 per diluted share and that\u2019s basically reflecting what we see right now. ","As the year unfolds and we get another quarter end, we\u2019ll have a better look at the next calendar year. At that time I think the elections will be over and maybe some of that things will calm down a little bit and we\u2019ll see what impact that might have going forward. But right now we felt comfortable going with this range. We\u2019ll adjust that as we deem necessary.","As a reminder, these estimates include an expected increase in pension expense of approximately $0.35 per diluted share as the lower discount rate was required for accounting purposes. ","So with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Pam and she will get into a little bit more detail for you.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks Don. So at this time I\u2019d probably just take a look at slide number six and I\u2019ll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. ","Fully diluted earnings per share for the first quarter came in at the low end of the guidance at $1.57. This is a decrease of $0.34 or 18% versus the $1.91 from the same quarter a year ago. And just weighing out both components, the puts and takes of that $0.34 per yield, segment operating income accounted for $0.26 of the decrease and this is mainly due to international and the continued softness that we are seeing in that region that Don just talked about.","Below segment operating income are what we refer to as below the line items, impacted earnings per share and favorably by $0.09 and again, this is mainly due to the other category and it\u2019s the result of the higher pension cost that we communicated last quarter.","Higher taxes impacted earnings per share by $0.02 and this is mainly due to the expiration of the tax extended bill for U.S. research and development credit and there also were some discreet items that were in expense this year and a benefit last year and then less shares outstanding impacted the earnings per share favorably by $0.03.","So moving to slide number eight, looking at the top line, revenue for the quarter, they were essentially flat, decreasing $19 million or 0.06%, coming in at $3.2 billion consistent with last year. Our revenues decreased in international and climate and industrial controls, offset by increases in North America and aerospace. ","There wasn\u2019t any impact to revenues as a result of acquisitions and currency and total acquisitions added 3% to sales, which was offset by negative currency of approximately the same amount.","Segment operating margins for the quarter decreased 170 basis points from 16.1% to 14.4%, again mainly due to international and aerospace. Please note that acquisition expenses and integration charges are included in these numbers. Parker incurred $0.01 in restructuring charges in the quarter and plans to incur $0.05 to $0.10 in fiscal year 2013 going forward.","Slide number nine, focusing on segments and commencing with North America, organic revenues increased 2% in the quarter, acquisitions added 3% to revenues and currency was relatively minor in this segment, as such reported revenues increased 5%.","Operating income increased from $223 million to $227 million, a 2% increase over the prior year and operating margins of 17.9% for the quarter decreased 60 basis points from the first quarter last year, however you should note that the first quarter of last year was an exceptional quarter with a margin of 18.5%. ","Continuing with the industrial segment, moving to international, organic revenues decreased 6% for the quarter. Currency was a deduction to revenues in the quarter of 7%, again mainly due to the weakness of the euro acquisition that is 4% to sales and as such reported revenues decreased 9% for the quarter.","Operating margins decreased 330 basis points to 12.9% and this is down from 16.2%, again due to reduced sales in Europe, Asia and Latin America and the impact of acquisition related cost and of course currency.","And then moving to slide number 11 and focusing on aerospace for a moment, their reported and organic revenues increase 9% in the year as acquisitions and currency had minimal impact. Margins decreased 240 basis points for the year to sub quarter to 11.4% from 13.8% and this includes the higher non-recurring engineering charges and the higher OEM business for this aftermarket. ","So moving to slide 12, climate and industrial controls, for the quarter four revenues were down 3% and unfavorable currency deducted another 2%, so as such reported revenues were down 3%. Segment operating margins as a percent of sales, in spite of lower sales increased to 9.4% from 8.2% a year ago.","So now moving to orders, I\u2019ll quickly run through this for you. Slide number 13 detailed orders by segment and just as a reminder, these numbers represented trailing three-month average and are reported as the percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year and excluding acquisitions and currency, except for aerospace. Aerospace is reported using a 12-month rolling average, because of the lumpiness of that business. ","And as you can see from this slide, orders declined 6% for the September quarter just ended, reflecting softness in North America, continued softness in Europe, China and Latin America, which resides in the industrial international segment.","North American orders for the quarter decreased 11%, industrial international orders decreased to 8% and aerospace orders increased 5% for the quarter, the climate industrial control orders increased 2% for the quarter.","So moving to the balance sheet, our balance sheet remains strong. Cash on the balance sheet at year-end was $436 million and $35 million in commercial paper was outstanding. DSI or Day Sales and Inventory remained at 62 days in fiscal year 2013 versus 2012 and this includes inventory that we added in connection with acquisition. ","Inventory to sales of 11.3% compares to 11.4% in the same quarter of fiscal year 2012, so not bad performance on the inventory side. Accounts receivable in terms of day sales outstanding closed at 51days, 3 days higher than last year and the WADPO or what we call weighted average days payable outstanding increased to 55 from 54 last quarter.","Operations used cash of $7 million in the quarter, mainly due to cash contributions to the pension plans of $226 million. Other major uses of cash in the quarter are as follows: $169 million returned to the shareholders by a share repurchase, $108 million and dividend payments of $61 million. $195 million in cash utilized in connection with acquisition and then $77 million or 2.4% of revenues was used in connection with the capital expenditures. We\u2019ve been saying for some time that it would get up to the 2.4% level and so we are seeing a sector that we\u2019ve talking about for a while. And then net of these uses of cash, there was a positive FX impact of $39 million, so cash decreased $402 million in the quarter.","So on slide 15, here we have the debt to total cap ratio, 25.7% and on a net basis 20.7%, so we have lots of room to grow through acquisitions and organically.","So now I\u2019ll move to the guidance, which is illustrated on pages 17 through 19 and on slide 17 the guidance for revenues and operating margins by segment, they have been provided there. I am not going to read through those here on the call, but they\u2019ve been detailed on the slide for your convenience. ","And then on slide 18, guidance has been provided in total for items below segment operating income and that\u2019s $480 million at the mid point. The amount is higher than the prior year, but its used as a petition cost that we talked about on the last call.","Slide 19 summarizes the guidance on a diluted earnings per share basis and as you can see from this slide, the guidance for 2013 for earnings per share is projected to be $6.15 to $6.75, just as Don had mentioned earlier. The components of the changes in guidance have been detailed on the waterfall chart on this slide that you see now and this is reconciling the previous guidance of $7.50 to the revised guidance used in the midpoint of each.","So you can easily determine if that segment operating income on a per share basis decreases by $1.09 and that\u2019s mainly due to the industrial segment of our business, below the line items at $0.05. Tax is a deduction of $0.05, less shares outstanding is a result of share repurchase and adds $0.04. So just as a reminder, the forecast, it doesn\u2019t include any acquisitions that we may make in the next three quarters of this year. ","The guidance assumes the following at the midpoint: increased revenue year-over-year minus 2%, that\u2019s decreased revenue I should say; segment operating margins of 14.5%; expenses below segment operating income including corporate, admin, interest and other at the mid point of $480 million, with a band of plus or minus 2.4% and a projected full year tax rate of 28.5% and this is up from 28% in the previous guidance and I\u2019ll talk about that in a minute, and then the guidance includes $0.05 to $0.10 for restructuring. I expected it to be on the high end. We talked about the $0.05 to $0.10 last quarter and we are now expecting the restructuring to be at the high end of that amount.","But a couple of tail end points with respect to the guidance. Sales first half, second half are divided 48%, 52%. Segment operating income, the first half and the second half is divided 44%, 56% and now getting back to the tax rate and why its going to be higher. ","The company will recognize a gain in the second quarter from the sale of the automotive portion of the climate industrial control segment. We\u2019ve excluded that from the guidance due to planned offsets that will occur in the second quarter, however the tax rate attire in the second quarter, because we needed to add the tax that\u2019s related to that gain, as we don\u2019t see an offset in the tax line in the second quarter as a result of the offset. ","So you\u2019ll see in the second quarter that the tax rate is about 200 basis points higher than it is in the third and fourth quarter and again, just to reiterate, that\u2019s the tax on the gain from the sale of the portion of the climate industrial control business that we sold. ","Earnings per share will be lower in the second quarter as revenues are lower, and again, this is consistent with the natural cycle of our business. We have more holidays in the second quarter and so our second quarter is I would say, our worst quarter of the year. That\u2019s consistent from year-to-year for the most part and so don\u2019t forget that as your working your model. The second half of the fiscal year is higher than the first half, and again, this is due to the natural cycle of the business. We have a 48%, 52% split. ","So, at this time I think that pretty much covers the guidance and we\u2019ll open it up to the standard Q-&-A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO. Please proceed.","Joel Tiss - BMO","Well, I finally made it. Just two quick questions; one is a clarification I guess. Can you be more specific on the accretion or dilution from the sale of the CIC business, the auto part?","Pamela Huggins","Yes, I can. It\u2019s about $0.04.","Joel Tiss - BMO","Okay, thanks. And then I just wanted to ask Don. I mean he\u2019s probably the guy with the most experience on the call, unless Alex Blanton is on, and I just wondered, you\u2019ve been through three or four recessions or whatever and you\u2019ve seen how they developed and all that and I just wondered, like what do you see for the next year? What are your customers saying? Are we going into another recession or we are just slowing down or correcting inventories. Can you just take your whatever years of wisdom and help us out a little bit.","Don Washkewicz","Well, thanks Joel. Basically if you think back to the end of last fiscal and we started talking about this fiscal, which takes us half way into 2013, what we are hearing on the street at the time and from our customers and all that, keep in mind that for instance Latin America was pretty flat and had been flat for quite some time and we started hearing well, we are going to start seeing a little bit of a hick-up there, because we\u2019ve been down and that\u2019s on a month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter basis we\u2019re going to start seeing some pick up, we didn\u2019t see any of that.","The next thing we\u2019ve heard was that Europe\u2019s in the tank and which we knew. Last year they were, of course the whole Greece thing just continues on. I don\u2019t know if that will ever be resolved, but it was all that malaise about what\u2019s happening in Europe and who is the power. They are going to get their financial things in order and we heard that there was probably going to be some improvement there, we haven\u2019t seen any improvement or actually we\u2019ve seen and actually it\u2019s gone the opposite direction.","Then lastly as you recall we talked about Asia, and we said, yes that stimulus is coming in China. The rail project is going to come back on, construction is going to probably pick up a little bit and in fact if you look at our China activity, it hasn\u2019t really materialized. As a matter of fact, the GDP over there is more like in the low sevens now as opposed to what they were looking at before. ","So as I look forward, do I see a cliff coming? I don\u2019t see a cliff. It just seems like, just like a flat lining if you will, waiting for something to happen. Its not like what happened a couple of years back in \u201809 when we had the housing crisis and all the sub prime crisis and so forth going on. I don\u2019t see that happening, but I just don\u2019t see any more right now as we were hoping to see. Some positive movement in any of these markets overseas and that\u2019s any of these regions around the world. ","So what we decided to do here is just say, hey, lets not assume anything at this point. Lets just assume this current situation continues as is. We don\u2019t see anything where its going to like be a cliff going forward, but at least for the rest of our fiscal year, I haven\u2019t heard anything that would change my opinion that we are going to change the current picture, all that dramatically. Something might happen after the elections, who knows. I mean, its anyone\u2019s guess as to what might happen after November, but we are just assuming that its kind of flat line from here to the rest of the way out and that\u2019s kind of the way we are playing it here.","We are taking a number of actions internally to adjust to that reality and we are doing all the prudent things that we\u2019ve done in the past with respect to our workforce adjustments and CapEx rebalancing and things like that and we\u2019ll continue to look at that. ","So we\u2019ll get another look at the end of the calendar year. Probably have a better vision of the third quarter and fourth quarter then. I would say, based on what we are seeing right now, at this point I don\u2019t think there will be much change, unless something dramatically happens in one of these regions.","Joel Tiss - BMO","All right. Thank you very much.","Don Washkewicz","Sure.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks Joel.","Operator Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies","","Hi, good morning.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies","I was wondering if you could just give us a little more color, I guess on the North American orders. That was the one that was kind of surprising for me, and Don, you sometimes have your sort of 3\/12, 12\/12 commentary that you do by end market. I am wondering if maybe that might help us understand that?","Donald Washkewicz","Well, let\u2019s talk a little bit first about just a couple of other indicators. Now one thing, when you look at it, I like to look at the PMI indices, because that\u2019s kind of telling as to what\u2019s happening there. ","First of all, all of the PMI\u2019s pretty much globally have been going up interesting enough, in spite of what we\u2019ve been just talking about here, but only North America is greater than 50%. So that\u2019s kind of telling us, well everything seems to be moving a little bit in the right direction, but nothing other than North America is really in a positive territory with respect to the PMI. ","When we look at the specific market segments and what\u2019s happening there as far as order trends, which ones are doing better and not as good, pretty much all of the aerospace markets, both military OEM and aftermarket segments are all looking good on a quarter-to-quarter comparison; that\u2019s what I am going to kind of give you here is the kind of the overall trend. ","Some of the other ones that are looking good, power gen process markets, farm and ag has been positive and I think that will continue, oil and gas has been positive and commercial refrigeration. If we look at our trends, those would be the positive ones. The ones that are kind of flattening out for the most part, but not necessarily terrible, but it\u2019s just that they are not growing at the same rate they had been in the past would be cars and light trucks distribution, semiconductor, life science and heavy-duty truck. I mean this is not to say those are doing real bad, it\u2019s just that the trends are actually flattening out on those. ","Then regionally if we look at the regions as well, as far as the trends both the 3\/12 cyclical and the 12\/12 cyclicals, right now North America, the 3\/12 is a little bit below 100%, which would mean that the North American markets are coming in for a soft landing, kind of flattening out, which we kind of have been seeing here so the 12\/12 is still north of 100, but heading toward 100% on a year-to-year basis. ","Europe is running around mid-90\u2019s on a 3\/12, which is basically pulling the 12\/12 down into the mid-90\u2019s. So that would be the worst region for us worldwide, that\u2019s real weak. Asia, we have basically a 3\/12 and 12\/12, that\u2019s just slightly below 100%, so pretty flat. Asia pretty flat at this level, this is flat to slightly negative. ","Latin America, the 12\/12 is running just under 100%m so again it\u2019s still weakest as well. So really with the exception of North America, the rest of these regions are weak, Europe being the weakest for us. ","I could go on to specific end markets, but I just wanted to give you that basic color there. One other thing that just to give you maybe another bit of information, our backlog, this would be our total backlog for the company. In the first quarter it decreased 2.5% year-on-year and that\u2019s for the total company, that includes aerospace. ","If you look just at the industrial part of the business, the backlog decreased by 8%, so that will kind of give an indication. Again, that activity or those numbers Pam already covered as to where that was coming from. So hopefully that helps you a little bit.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies","Great. I appreciate that, and maybe just quickly, just your thoughts on share repurchase given the liquidity you have on the balance sheet and the cash flow that you seem to be doing this year.","Donald Washkewicz","Well share buyback, currently just to remind everybody, we increased our 10b about a year ago, 10b5-1 from about $50 million a year to $200 million. So we are around $200 million a year, about $50 million a quarter pace right now, so that will continue. ","We bought in the first quarter I believe somewhere around 57 million shares back in the first quarter and that would give you about $107 million in the first quarter total for the company. ","What I have been doing, not just I, but what we have been doing is really focusing primarily right now, trying to keep enough dry powder to go after some of these acquisitions that are in the pipeline. You can see that we picked up five. We\u2019ve got a couple of more coming through in this quarter. So we\u2019ve been just kind of are these going to make it at the finish line or not. If they are, we\u2019d like to maintain, have some capacity to do some of these acquisitions, not all of them we realize are going to make it to the finish line. ","Then after that if in fact they don\u2019t, we\u2019ll buyback more shares, but I don\u2019t want to predict at this point just what we are going to do. I\u2019d say the preference right now, because we\u2019ve been working on some of these acquisitions is to try to get some of these closed in the balance of this fiscal year. ","The other thing that we are going to do, of course we are going to continue to do would be the dividend payout; we want to continue that. We have an increased record that goes from 56 years now and we are pretty happy about the yield where it\u2019s at. We are approximately at the median of our peer group, around 2% yield and we might need to tweak that a little bit. Of course if the stock drops further, we don\u2019t have to worry it\u2019ll be higher than 2% yield, but we hope that doesn\u2019t happen. ","In acquisitions, not acquisitions, but in other growth areas like supporting capital expenditures, we are still looking at around 2.5%. I think Pam mentioned around 2.5% and we are still looking at that as far as capital allocation. ","So hopefully that answers and I can\u2019t give you a hard number on share repurchase of course. We\u2019ll look at share repurchase in light of the acquisitions that we are looking at and if we have capacity there and the shares are suppressed, we\u2019ll definitely do more share repurchase.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies","","That\u2019s great, and I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth Don, but it sounds like what you\u2019re saying is the acquisition pipeline is fuller than it\u2019s been for a while. Is that accurate or it might mean too much.","Donald Washkewicz","I think that\u2019s very accurate. It seems like it took a longer time to fill it this time around, because we\u2019ve been talking about it for a long time that we are looking at a lot of things. It seems like the fluid is moving a little slower through the pipe, but they are starting to coming out the other end, so that\u2019s good and it\u2019s encouraging, because we\u2019ve picked up some very nice acquisitions off late.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you very much.","Pamela Huggins","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities; please proceed.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Good morning everyone.","Pamela Huggins","Hi Eli, how are you?","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Just had a clarification, your EPS guidance assumes what share count for the year? Is it probably the easiest way for us to do it?","Pamela Huggins","About $1.54.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","About $1.54. So you actually don\u2019t expect the net\u2026","Pamela Huggins","I am sorry, $1.53, I apologize.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","You were just about $1.526 I think for the quarter. So you\u2019re assuming there\u2019s no net share reduction for the rest of the year?","Pamela Huggins","That\u2019s right.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Okay, and the guidance for revenue includes the $380 million of annual sales that you\u2019ve announced in the first quarter and it\u2019s all in there.","Pamela Huggins","That\u2019s right. Just so you know though, let me just give you some numbers here, in terms of the acquisitions. It\u2019s about 2.5%, 2.4%, 2.5% of the sales amount. Okay?","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Okay. I mean you are indicating that profitability, I guess as the volume comes down, you are going to be able to hold profitability in Industrial in North America for the last year. In other words, you don\u2019t expect to go much under 17%, I would suspect for the rest of the quarter despite the lower volumes? And in aerospace, the increase of profitability comes from lower R&D or better volume or better mix or what\u2019s\u2026","Jon Marten","Well, in terms of the aerospace Eli, it is really both. It\u2019s the R&D that Don talked about earlier and just us trying to react to some of the programs that we won over the last five years and a little bit of a change there in terms of our forecast going forward and also again\u2026","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","How much was the R&D increase in the quarter unexpectedly for us?","Jon Marten","About $0.02. And then the other part of the change in the guidance is in the mix and it has to do with the commercial MRO business here. Its not quite as robust as we had planned, slightly down.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Okay, and the profitability in both industrial North America and industrial international going forward, I guess you are saying it\u2019s going to come down to like this operating margin in North America to stay the same, and international from where we are today?","Jon Marten","I would say that\u2019s North America is staying, industrial is staying north of 17% and international gradually improving throughout the year.","Pamela Huggins","Right, and one thing to be aware of the way the currency impacts, it gets more favorable as we go throughout the year.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Okay, and one final question is that we talked about the drop in orders and so, can you talk about inventory liquidation at distributors. Are we seeing \u2013 like they were saying, that we are starting to hear and talk about it and particularly as construction equipment and I am surprised heavy truck is flat, because the production is down 20% in the fourth quarter, but has construction equipment taken down their orders also across the board?","Donald Washkewicz","Yes, that\u2019s the segment that we\u2019ve seen the most adjustment in, is the construction equipment, the OEM segment. A lot of the OEMs readjusting there and I think that\u2019s pretty much globally too by the way, its not just North America, it\u2019s pretty much globally, that, what we are seeing in the construction segment or part of the business.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","And distributor inventories are\u2026","Donald Washkewicz","Yes, the distributors, I wouldn\u2019t say distributors Eli are probably reacting from what input we are getting, pretty much like they have in the past. Pretty much haven\u2019t been building a lot of inventory to begin with. So they are basically adjusting to the reality like we are. I don\u2019t see any huge material changes one-way or the other. I think they are going to gradually making adjustments as times go forth. Keep in mind that there is no cliff that we see on the distribution part of the business either, see that\u2019s still a pretty solid segment for us.","Pamela Huggins","Eli, we need to be cognizant of time to give other people a chance. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob McCarthy with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Mick Dobray - Robert W. Baird","Hello, this is Mick Dobray in for Rob McCarthy, good morning. ","Pamela Huggins","Good morning.","Mick Dobray - Robert W. Baird","So first, a quick question on Industrial and International. Can you give us a little more color on the integration acquisition cost in the quarter?","Jon Marten","Well, for the Industrial International segment we are seeing a $0.03 for the integration and acquisition cost. This relates to deals that we have announced and completed in Q1. This also relates to deals that are unannounced and that are in the pipeline that Don has been referring to.","Mick Dobray - Robert W. Baird","Okay, great, thank you. And then switching back to industrial and North America and you commented a little bit about the Parker stores, but I\u2019m wondering, are you seeing going forward any sort of mix shift in the way your revenues are generated in that segment. ","And what sort of impact did you bake into your margin assumption? Because from what I can tell, your incremental margin embedded in the guidance is something north of 35% in North America. So I\u2019m kind of wondering, is it that you are sort of seeing a more pronounced shifted on the distributor side or is it that its OEM business that potentially carries higher margin there.","Pamela Huggins","I just would like to make a comment about this marginal return on sales at this point. There are certain points in the cycle when you don\u2019t have a lot of acquisitions, you can look at these marginal returns on sales number and they make a lot of sense. But then there is points in the cycle and especially a period like this when we are doing a lot of acquisitions. ","These marginal return of sales numbers, there is the law of small numbers, number one. And then also due to the acquisitions they can become a little distorted, and if you look at North America, just to give you an example, the marginal return on sales in the first half is, you\u2019re right, north of 35%, but if you look at the first quarter and the second quarter, you have a favorable 6% and then a unfavorable 24% in the second quarter, so it\u2019s just the way the numbers are working out. ","For North America, quite frankly we\u2019re right in line where we think we should be.","Mick Dobray - Robert W. Baird","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset. Please proceed.","Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset","Hi, can you hear me?","Pamela Huggins","Yes, good morning Alex.","Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset","","Thank you. Hi Joel. You asked the question I was going to ask and I want to go back to that for a minute. No one has really focused on the 11% decline in North American orders in the quarter and that apparently really started in September, was the first two months up in September more than offsetting, and what does this mean in terms of the economy for the fourth quarter, what do you think?","Pamela Huggins","Well, let me just give you a little color on how things played out through the quarter. As we went into July and then August, we were feeling pretty good, because we were right on pace with what we had told you previously. It\u2019s really the month of September that really did take a big decline.","Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset","So, it was more than offsetting. In other words, it was down more than the first two months were up?","Pamela Huggins","Yes. For the quarter, you can actually look at the miss. We did a $1.57 for the quarter; we thought we were going to do around $1.66. It really was attributable to the really tough September month.","Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset","Well, now doesn\u2019t this sort of indicate we might be entering a recession here, a big fall off in orders in September and the weakness overall in other companies results that are coming along here as we go through the earnings season? I\u2019m just wondering why you are assuming it\u2019s going to be flat for the year when you are starting the next nine months with a big downturn in your orders. ","And secondly on that question, how do you think the election is going to affect you? I mean, depending on who is elected, you might have a big increase in the business in the second half or a big decline. So are you just waiting to see what happens or do you think it doesn\u2019t matter?","Donald Washkewicz","Maybe Alex I\u2019ll just touch on -- this is Don, I\u2019ll touch on the second part of that. We can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen frankly. We have our own opinions as to what would be best for the economy and best for our business certainly as to outcomes, but I don\u2019t want to go online and predict anything. ","I think instead of doing that, we just decided not to predict anything, and just say, hey we are going to get another look at this after the beginning of the year. We\u2019re going to know lot more then. We feel pretty comfortable with our second quarter; you can back into our second quarter numbers. We\u2019ve given enough information. So you can back into that and we feel pretty confident on those. ","And when you look at October, the way it\u2019s coming in right now, I mean October is usually a pretty good month and its shoring up to be reasonably good month, so that\u2019s going to carry a big portion of the second quarter, because remember November, December are the weakest months in the quarter. So had we not had indication of a reasonable October, we would be telling a different story right here, so okay.","Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset","Okay, yes, I got that. Okay listen, I don\u2019t want to take too much time, but I\u2019ve got another question on your international business, you had a 50% decremental margin. Operating earnings were down $56 million and sales were down $112 million. So why was this so large on decremental side?","Jon Marten","Alex, Jon here. Just to try to help you with that. Internationally, first we talked about the acquisition integration and acquisition costs. So that $0.03 that we\u2019ve talked about are baked into those MRO this year for Q1. ","In addition to that, as you know we try to manage to negative 30. That\u2019s historically in the best times. When we are actually going down we, are able to manage the negative 30 and that provides a very good result from us, from a margin or return on sales. ","When we first start turning though, as we are turning right now, we can\u2019t react instantaneously and so we are furiously throughout all of our operations, specifically in this case internationally that we are talking about working to try to take the actions that are necessary in order to adjust to the new reality that we are seeing here in terms of the recession in Europe in most countries there, as well as the reduced industrial production indexes that we are seeing from Asia, primarily in China.","Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset","Yes, so you try to get a 30% decremental margin, but you can\u2019t react that fast, right?","Jon Marten","Right, right. So, we don\u2019t expect that 50 to continue and we are determined to get to no worse than negative 30.","Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset","And that 30 would be lower, but you don\u2019t want to cut out all of the SG&A that you built up necessarily, right?","Jon Marten","Well, we\u2019ve got a certain base that we will continue to maintain and we will continue to try to structure all of our operating divisions in a way that is going to make us also able to be able to react as things go back up. So we\u2019ll be mindful of the long-term, we\u2019re not going to be totally short-term focused.","Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo","Thanks and good morning everyone. ","Pamela Huggins","Good morning. ","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo","At the risk of beating a dead horse, I just wanted to ask Joel and Alex\u2019s question a little bit differently. From a historical context, could you discuss whatever differences you may be seeing between what happened in September in industrial North America, the order drop-off from what you historically saw back in fiscal Q2 \u201809?","Jon Marten","Andy, Jon here. One thing that we\u2019ve been looking at very closely is and talking about is of course as we are putting the guidance together here. How does this situation compare to prior years and we are very intensely looking at the data in each one of our groups and each one of our segments. ","One of the things that Don talked about earlier, I think it\u2019s very important for you and Alex and Joel and everybody to remember is that we did experience several cancellations from some of our OEM customers and those cancellations of course are one-time events. They are not a general pattern. They were enough for us to mention in our comments going forward and so as we experienced those cancellations they\u2019ll have a one-time impact on our order rates for a quarter, but we don\u2019t see, especially given the detail that we know behind the order reductions, we don\u2019t see that impacting us going forward at the same rate. ","So what we do as you know is, we took our bottoms up approach in our forecast when we put our guidance together. We feel very good about our Q2 and our balance of the fiscal year based on what we know right now, and that is how we basically have looked at this question of the orders in the month of September and the impact on North America for the quarter.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo","Thank you for that Jon. So if I could take a stab at re-characterizing what you just said, is your view that the OEM customers in particular who made those cancellations are just taking deep production cuts right now to true up their order boards? Is that\u2026","Jon Marten","Yes, I think that they are resetting, there is no doubt that they are resetting and we are reflecting that in our results and keep in mind that as Don talked about the PMI moving up in North America, many of our customers that reset their orders in the quarter are also resetting their look to react to the international situation and sometimes those orders are going to our OEM customers in North America, but ultimately are destined for final demand that is international related.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you very much.","Pamela Huggins","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning Jamie. How are you doing?","Linda - Credit Suisse","","Oh! This is actually Linda in for Jamie. ","Pamela Huggins","Oh! How is Jamie doing by the way?","Linda - Credit Suisse","","She is doing well.","","Pamela Huggins","Good, good. She just had a baby by the way.","Linda - Credit Suisse","","I mean kind of going with what everyone else has been asking with those orders in the U.S. I mean those cancellations, how is that making calendar year 2013 looking for you. Like OEMs, are they looking at sort of a growth year or is that going to be more flat looking or down. Like what\u2019s sort of your expectations with dealer orders?","Donald Washkewicz","This is Don again. I think if we see that happening on an ongoing basis, then it\u2019s going to bode not so well for 2013. But like we said earlier, we\u2019re seeing this adjustment and I think this is just adjusting like we are adjusting to the current reality and I don\u2019t see it continuing. ","At least at point if the global condition worsen, and then I think maybe there\u2019s going to be another readjustment. But I think that\u2019s how it will affect us over the long period. I don\u2019t see any sustaining effect of what we saw in September above and beyond what we\u2019ve already indicated in our guidance.","Linda - Credit Suisse","","Okay, and then switching over to international then. I mean China seems like it\u2019s kind of an important part of the international recovery. What is your thoughts on China? I mean, is growth going to come back there next year or is that pushed out to your fiscal years 2014 or how is that kind of looking?","Pamela Huggins","It\u2019s Pam Huggins speaking. Really we\u2019ve become, I don\u2019t want to say negative, but versus what we were thinking even three months ago, our view is somewhat different. We were probably a little exuberant in what we thought might happen in China, but we were right in line with that everybody else was thinking at the time too. ","We thought we would see more of an up-tick there actually now. We do have the little bit of growth baked in, but it\u2019s very minor, 1% to 2 % in the second half, and I would call that probably more in line with the natural cycle of our business, than really seeing any true up-tick that\u2019s going to take place there.","Linda - Credit Suisse","Okay great. Thanks guys.","Pamela Huggins","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus","Good morning everyone.","Pamela Huggins","Hi Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus","Can we just talk a little bit about Europe and kind of the sequential progression there, things still deteriorating sequentially stable, getting any better?","Jon Marten","Well, I think if you look at what\u2019s happening from some of the PMI\u2019s that I had mentioned earlier, which is probably the best indicator overall. I mean we can talk about our own numbers and all that, but the Europe is negative, I mean negative to 50%, they are down around 45%, 46%. They creped up a little bit in September. ","Germany actually bounced up about three points, so they are around 47%, which is a good indicator. So I don\u2019t think deterioration from this point as what I\u2019m seeing here. I just don\u2019t see a tremendous up-tick either. I just see more of a steady as she goes.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus","And could you talk about specifically your own business over there and how that progressed through the quarter?","Jon Marten","Nathan, as the quarter went on, it was obvious to us that in Europe we were bouncing along a low level, and so we don\u2019t see further deterioration through the quarter. Our projections through the balance of the year are that we are basically flat lining and flat lining in terms of the growth that we had projected in the first sort of the guidance at the rate that we are now seeing. ","And Nathan, we are in a low level there. We\u2019ve never gotten to the point that we really have been able to see a huge growth in the different end markets that were in there that are opposed to some of the other end markets around the world. ","We are really focusing in on some of the growth opportunities that are in very strong end markets that are in Europe right now; one of them being oil and gas process, a few other chemical industries that are really very promising for us. But the short answer to your question; we are at a low level, but we are not deteriorating further and that\u2019s what our guidance indicates.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And it sounds to me a little bit like the drop-off in orders in Industrial North America might be primarily driven by end market weakness in Asia. Is that a fair statement?","Jon Marten","I think that certainly some part of that is attributable to that. It\u2019s really hard for me to tell you what part of it, but that is certainly a material portion of the answer and again, we are looking at it as a reset and we are looking at our customers reacting to their ultimate demand levels and many of our customers are multinationals too as you will know.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus","And if I could just slip one more in on aerospace, are you expecting the OE versus MRO mix in the balance of the year to be the same, more heavily skewed to original equipment or more heavily skewed to MRO?","Jon Marten","As time goes on through the year, it\u2019s going to be more heavily skewed to OEM.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus","","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc","Hi guys. You mentioned a lot of kind of acquisition and integration cost, but clearly you are bringing in some good businesses. I mean how should we think of \u2013 I mean, do these start to become accretive pretty quickly or I mean, may be if we look at the whole year, how should we think about accretion from these deals?","Jon Marten","All of these deals that we announced in Q4 last year and in Q1 this year have been accretive, accretive to the bottom line and are performing very well for us. We are very excited about the prospects and of course we\u2019ve got integration cost and things, but even given that these deals have been accretive.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc","Okay, but your bridge doesn\u2019t really call out any acquisition positives or negatives?","Jon Marten","No, we just don\u2019t get to that level of detail and we normally don\u2019t go deal by deal and explain exactly what the performance has been by quarter, but in general, we wanted to make sure that we explain to you and anybody else in the call that deals have been accretive for us and we are happy with the results that we are seeing.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc","Okay. And then Don, I just want to understand the capital allocation dynamics a little bit better, because I think what you are saying today is acquisition pipeline is pretty full and we are going to focus more on deals. Yet, the last two quarters your comments were, I want to buyback my stock, I want to buyback my stock and now the stock is down 7% today, and looks like maybe a better buy than the previous quarters, I mean what\u2019s really changing here?","Donald Washkewicz","Nothing\u2019s changing, it\u2019s a timing thing. Like I said the pipeline takes a while to fill. Once you get things going down through the pipeline, it\u2019s a timing issue. When those start coming out the other end, I have to have money to pay for. If they are not going to come out the other end or if they are going to come through slow, then I can maybe do some share buyback and replenish my dry powder in the interim. So it\u2019s really a matter of timing as far as what I can do and how much I can do, when I can do. We\u2019ve done a lot of share buyback in the last couple of years. I mean a $1 billion type numbers. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been sitting here doing nothing. ","We weren\u2019t able to do as many deals in the last couple of years, because we are filling the pipeline, we are looking at things, we are turning some away, we are looking more seriously at some. So I think it\u2019s really a timing issue and we look at kind of real time all the time, like okay, how much money do we have, what\u2019s our leverage, we are not going to let our leverage go above 37%. We are going to maintain our A ratings on our debt. So what can we do and how much can we do; when can we do it? ","Of course, if I knew that the stock was going to drop $7 today, of course this would be a great buying opportunity and it is a great buying opportunity, and I am not going to predict anything here, but I say that we are certainly looking at that in light of everything else we\u2019ve got coming through the pipeline. ","But once I get things going through the pipeline, and get them going through a due diligence process, I can\u2019t just shut that off. I mean it would be silly to do that. We spent a lot of money to get them to that point. So we\u2019ve got to continue through with the ones that we are looking at seriously and we are always looking at Parker\u2019s stock as a good potential acquisition for us and certainly at these levels that it\u2019s at now, it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc","Okay, thanks.","Pamela Huggins","Okay, we\u2019ll take one more call or one more question at this time please.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Henry Kirn with UBS. Please proceed.","Henry Kirn - UBS","Hey, good morning guys.","Pamela Huggins","Hi Henry.","Henry Kirn - UBS","How quickly can you flex production? could you discuss a little bit the changes to your headcount plans over the last quarter and then maybe if the OEMs were to switch back to a more positive view, how quickly could you shift the production back up?","Donald Washkewicz","That\u2019s a good question Henry. I think one thing that we are doing is adjusting the workforces globally. It\u2019s slower in Europe. Probably the slowest of any region around the world is Europe because of all the workers council negotiations and the government negotiations that go on when you are trying to reduce workforce or adjust it down and so what we\u2019ve done over time, is we\u2019ve built up a layer of what we call associates part time employees and so forth, so that we could flex better and that\u2019s what we are kind of working into right now as these associates, where you can take actions a little bit quicker and adjust a little bit faster and yet not eat into your core workforce, so that\u2019s kind of what we are working on. ","The other thing that we\u2019ve done as we gotten some locations, we have shortened work weeks. Again, every facility -- we have about 350 facilities, so everyone is in a different state as far as demand and order trends and so forth. So they are adjusting with short work weeks, part timers and associate workers and so forth. Those are the kind of things we are doing in the workplace. ","I think we are going to be in a tremendously good position to rebound whenever there happens to be a rebound and hopefully that\u2019s soon here. There is certainly a possibility it could be soon. So we are ready, we can add people back, we\u2019ve got the core workforce still there, so that we can respond quickly to any changes in demand.","Pamela Huggins","Okay. At this time, we\u2019d like to end the formal Q&A session and I\u2019m going to turn it over to Don who just has a few closing comments. But for those of you on the call, I just want to say thank you. I know that you guys have had a very busy day today; a lot of people releasing earnings this morning. So thank you for taking the time to attend our call. ","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don.","Donald Washkewicz","Well, I want to once again thank everyone on the call for joining us this morning and I also want to take the opportunity to thank all of our employees as I have in the past for their continued commitment and our success. The team continues to execute on our win strategy and they continue to outperform and perform extremely well vis-\u00e0-vis our peer group. ","Throughout this period of uncertainty we are going to continue to manage our cost as we said on this call. We are going to maintain our strong financial position as I stated with our leverage and we are going to continue to pursue our long-term growth strategy and we\u2019ve talked about all of those issues today. ","So I want to thank you again for your participation on the call and for your continued interest in Parker. As we\u2019ve said in past, Pam will be here the balance of the day and she will be taking calls. If you have anything that we haven\u2019t answered, feel free to give her a call today. Thank you very much and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation.

Welcome to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Parker-Hannifin Earnings Conference Call. My name is Philip and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Pamela Huggins, Vice President and Treasurer. Please proceed, ma'am.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thank you, Philip. Good morning, everyone. Just as Philip said, this is Pam Huggins speaking, and I'd like to welcome you to Parker-Hannifin's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Release Teleconference. Joining me today is Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Don Washkewicz; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Marten.","For those of you who wish to do so, you may follow today's presentation with the PowerPoint slides. They've been presented on Parker's website at www.phstock.com. And for those of you not online, the slides will remain posted on the company's investor information website 1 year after today's call.","At this time, reference Slide #2 in the slide deck, this is the safe harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements. And if you haven't already done so, please take note of this statement in its entirety.","Slide #3 addresses non-GAAP financial measures. This slide, as required, indicates that in cases where non-GAAP numbers have been used, they have been reconciled to their appropriate GAAP numbers, and they're posted on Parker's website as well.","Moving to Slide #4, outlined the agenda here. The agenda for today consists of 4 parts. First, Don Washkewicz, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, will provide highlights for the quarter. I'll come back on second and provide a review, including key performance measures for the quarter, along with the revised fiscal year 2014 guidance. And then the third part of the call will consist of our standard question-and-answer session. For the fourth part of the call today, Don will close with some final comments, as usual.","So at this time, I'll turn it over to Don and ask that you refer to Slide #5 titled First Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Highlights.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, thank you, Pam, and welcome to everyone on the call. We certainly appreciate all your participation today. I'll make a few brief comments and then Pam's going to return for a more detailed review of the quarter.","I'm certainly pleased with -- that we're off to a good start in the first quarter. We continue to execute well in spite of a moderate growth environment out there.","Some highlights for the quarter. Sales remained flat, as anticipated, with acquisition sales offset by divestitures. We were pleased to see our order rates turn positive for the quarter, for the first time in 5 quarters, as we showed a 5% improvement year-over-year. Our order growth is consistent with marginally positive trends that have been reported across major economic indicators of industrial production.","Total segment operating margins were strong at 14.4%. I'll just point out that the Diversified Industrial segment operating margins were above our 15% target, at 15.3%. So we're very pleased with that. And of course, that was helped by 110 basis point year-over-year improvement in our International business.","Earnings per the diluted share increased 2.5% to $1.61 compared to a prior-year quarter. Excluding restructuring expenses, earnings per diluted share were $1.67, or an increase of 6%. We consistently generate operating cash flow greater than 10% of sales, coming in at 11.1% in the first quarter before a discretionary pension contribution, and that contribution was about $75 million. We remain on track to deliver our 13th consecutive year of cash flow greater than 10%. So again, that's a nice record that we'd like to keep going.","Just a few comments about our restructuring. Restructuring this quarter was $12 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, and that was on a forecast of $19 million, or $0.09 per diluted share. We're still projecting restructuring for the year to be $100 million, as we notified you last time at the last meeting, or $0.47 per diluted share. And that was what we had in our original plan. Pam is going to go into a little bit more detail as to how this impacts each of the quarters going forward.","New for this quarter, we released supplemental sales information for 3 global technology platforms within our Diversified Industrial segment. You'll find a fact book with some of the historical data and additional information on these businesses on our investor website. This additional disclosure will give investors great insight into the strong underlying businesses in our portfolio, so we'd appreciate any feedback you have once you have an opportunity to review that information.","Looking ahead to the full year, based on a good start for our first quarter and a larger than expected gain from the previously announced joint venture with GE Aviation, which will be recorded in the second quarter, we are increasing our guidance for the year. We have updated guidance to the range of $7.78 to $8.38 in diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2014. This guidance does include the anticipated gain of GE Aviation joint venture, which is $1.68 and an estimated $0.47 per diluted share in restructuring expenses that I mentioned earlier.","So with that, we'll go ahead and turn it over to Pam for a little bit more detail.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thanks, Don. So at this time, if you'll reference Slide #6, I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. It came in at $1.61, as you saw in the press release for this morning. That compares to $1.57 for the same quarter a year ago, an increase of 3%. If you exclude the restructuring expenses, this quarter's earnings per diluted share was $1.67, an increase of 6%.","So, moving to Slide #7, this lays out the components of the $0.04 increase in fully diluted earnings per share for the first quarter versus the same quarter a year ago. And you can see that higher operating income, while it shows $0.01 on that Slide, was really $0.06 when you exclude the restructuring.","Our International business came in very strong. There was some offset. It was partially offset by lower income in Industrial North America and then of course, the Aerospace business.","The items below segment operating income accounted for the remaining $0.03, and this was mainly due to a discrete tax benefit of $0.08, which was offset by a higher corporate and general and administrative expense and other expense. It was $0.03 for corporate G&A and $0.04 for other expense, mainly due to market-driven benefits.","So moving to Slide #8, looking at the top line, revenues for the quarter increased 2% as a result of acquisitions. So revenue moved to $3.23 billion from $3.18 (sic) [$3.21 billion] last year. And of course, we took the opportunity to adjust for the divestiture of the automotive air-conditioning business in October of last year. So these slides are a little bit different for those of you who follow these slides closely. We did take the opportunity to restate fiscal year '13 for the divestiture.","Segment operating margins for the quarter at 14.4%, basically flat with last year. But however, don't forget that, that includes additional restructuring in the quarter.","So, moving to Slide #9, addressing the Industrial North America. Here you can see that revenues of $1.39 billion, they're relatively flat as additional revenue from acquisitions of 3% was offset by an organic decline of 3%. And of course, currency was relatively minor.","Operating income decreased to $234 million from $244 million, a 4% decline of -- over the prior year, and this was mainly due to mix.","So, moving to Slide #10, addressing Industrial International. For the quarter, revenues increased 3%, about half from acquisitions and half organically. Currency had no effect on this business in the quarter, which is unusual. And operating margin increased to $173 million from $157 million. And again, remember, we had this increase in March and even with higher restructuring costs in the quarter. Volume, obviously contributed to the higher margins as well and we had good cost control in Asia and Latin America.","So moving to Slide #11, Aerospace reported, and organic revenues increased 5%. There were no acquisitions in the impact of currency on this segment. It was negligible. Operating margin decreased to $57 million from $62 million versus the same quarter a year ago, and this is due to additional development expenses, entry-into-service costs and a higher OEM to MRO mix.","Now moving to the order rates, Slide #12. This slide details orders by segment. Just as a reminder, these numbers represent a trailing 3-month average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions and currency, except for Aerospace. Aerospace is reported using a 12-month rolling average.","So as you can see from this slide, orders were positive 5% for the September quarter just ended, reflecting improvement sequentially across the segment. North America orders were up 3%. Industrial International orders increased 5% for the quarter. And Aerospace orders increased 11% for the quarter, again using the 12-month rolling. So orders are showing improvement coming off the bottom, turning positive for the first time in the last 5 quarters.","So moving to the balance sheet. Parker's balance sheet remains strong. Cash on the balance sheet at year-end was $1.9 billion. This is offset partially, however, by outstanding Commercial Paper of $1.3 billion. DSI or days sales in inventory came in 70 days for the quarter versus 71 for the same quarter a year ago. This decrease in the quarter represents a reduction of approximately $24 million and includes the additional inventory as a result of acquisitions.","Inventory levels are at 11.2%, and this is slightly better than last year at this time. Obviously, we did increase inventory sequentially, which is in line with the normal cycle of our business.","Accounts receivable in terms of DSO closed at 50 and that's a 1-day improvement from the same quarter last year. And then of course, weighted average days payable outstanding at the end of September was 58 versus 56 at the end of June. So good working capital management.","Moving to cash flow on Slide #14. You can see the cash flow in the quarter of $358 million. This excludes the $75 million pension contribution that Don talked about. And this $358 million compares to $219 million last year and represents a little over 11% of sales. So after the increased cash on hand sequentially, it went up by $164 million. The major uses of cash were obviously $117 million returned to the shareholders, $50 million via share repurchase and dividend payments of $67 million. And then of course, 1.6% of sales, or $53 million, was utilized in connection with capital expenditures.","So now, I'll touch guidance, which I know you're all interested in, on Slide 15. The guidance for revenues and operating margins by segment has been provided on this slide. Now, I'm not going to read through the information on the call on this slide, but this detail's been provided for your convenience. And just so you know, these numbers include the GE Aviation JV and the restructuring cost that Don talked about.","On Slide 16, this slide lays out the guidance assumptions, and I'll go through them as follows: The full year guidance assumes increased revenue year-over-year of 0% to 3%. 1% of this growth is from acquisition carryover, but that acquisition carryover is offset by a 1% reduction in sales in connection with the GE joint venture and the divestiture of the automotive air-conditioning business of Climate and Industrial Controls that happened last year, in October.","Segment operating margins, 13.4% (sic) [13.7%] to 14% (sic) [14.1%] are projected. And guidance has been provided in total for the items below segment operating income, what we here refer to as below the line items, and is forecasted to be $75 million at the midpoint. Now this $75 million includes a gain. And as you recall last quarter, the gain was $360 million, this quarter it's $411 million. This gain is recorded in the second quarter. If you exclude this gain, the total for the below the line items is $486 million, and of course, that's at the midpoint of the range. And of course, we put a bracket around that of plus or minus 1%.","The full year tax rate is projected at 30.8% (sic) [30.3%] however, that's due to the JV gain, which is taxed at 38%, and again, included in the second quarter. The full year tax rate, if you exclude this gain, is 28%. So if you look at the second and third -- or the third and fourth quarter, you'll see that 29% tax rate has been included in the guidance. And then of course, the number of outstanding shares used in the guidance is 151.8 million.","So let's move to Slide 17. And here, you can see we summarized the guidance on a diluted earnings per share basis for you. And using the assumptions, as I just explained and as documented at the bottom of Slide 16, the 2014 earnings per guidance share is projected to be $7.78 to $8.38, and that's $8.08 at the midpoint. Excluding the gain on the JV, the guidance is $6.10 to $6.70.","Now this slide here details the walk for the major components from the midpoint of the initial guidance provided last quarter, utilizing the $7.75 walking to the $8.08 provided this quarter. Of the $0.33 increase to the guidance, $0.18 is the result of the increase in the JV gain and the remaining $0.15 is the result the first quarter B. So the $0.33 increase, $0.18 JV, $0.15 B.","A couple of salient points with respect to guidance. Sales first half, second half are divided 48%, 52%. Segment operating income first half, second half is 45%, 55%, first half, second half. EPS, first half, second half is 55%, 45%. But if you exclude this JV, the GE Aviation JV, it's 43%, 57%.","Restructuring costs are still projected to be approximately $100 million, in line with what we conveyed last quarter. And the growth EPS impact, not counting any of the savings, is expected to be $0.47. So unchanged from the last quarter. Our restructuring in the first half is $0.19 and restructuring in the second half is $0.28, giving you the total of $0.47 that we just talked about.","Remember that our guidance excludes any further acquisitions or divestitures that may be made in fiscal year 2014. And I would just like to ask that for your published estimates, we ask that you please exclude the GE Aviation gain, if you would.","So at this time, I think that we'll just move right into the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On the revenue guidance, it looks like you took the top end a little bit lower. Could you talk about what changed to drive that decision?","Jon P. Marten","Yes. Andy, Jon here. I think what we did was we looked at our actual results for Q1 and we were comfortable with what our growth rates were that was contained in the original guidance. And because our quarter came in very solid, as -- almost as expected, we ended up deciding to keep the guidance where it is. You'll see in the components of the guidance on the top line, that Aerospace is down a little bit and North America and Industrial International is coming along as projected here for us. So that was our thinking at this point and that's how the comparisons came in for the Q and for the year as we rolled everything up from the bottoms up.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, Jon. And then a follow-up. The cash flow, very, very strong again. You have substantial capital allocation potential. Could you update us on what the acquisition pipeline looks like?","Donald E. Washkewicz","This is a Don, Andy. We're always looking, with respect to the acquisitions, as far as what's out there. And of course, that's one of our main drivers as far as capital allocation this year, is to try to find some good acquisitions. I can never forecast what we're going to get to the finish line. We're always looking, we're always evaluating, and it's hard to predict what you're going to get to the finish line. So -- but that is a priority for us. The acquisitions are a priority. But also, I just might want to mention along with that, that as far as capital allocation, that we're still maintaining a focus on dividends. We've had a major increase over the last 5 years in dividends, and last year was about a 10% increase. And just so that everybody knows, we finished the year last year at about a 27% payout on dividends and we're looking for something north of that now, closer to 30%. Of course, that hasn't been approved by our board. I'm just telling you what I'm -- would be comfortable with and what we said, we're going to be trying to get closer to that 30% number, and that's what our intent would be this year. So dividends are going to be a priority. Obviously, acquisitions are way up -- way high on the list and we're continuing to look at those. The only other comments on capital allocation that I would make, would have to do with share repurchase and we'll do about $200 million as a minimum this year. We did $50 million in the first quarter and we'll continue that at $50 million a quarter and then potentially do more than that, depending on where we end up with our cash balances and the acquisition pipeline toward the end of the year. The only other thing is that -- we did mention earlier, is that we did put $75 million into the pension as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Don, would you just walk us through your normal -- what you're seeing out there by end market and by segment? You made an interesting comment that sequentially, it looked like there was an improvement. If you could just give us your normal end market color, that'd be great.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Sure. Sure, sure. Well, maybe I'll start with the PMI Indices, the ISM Index and so forth, just kind of give you a little recap of what that looks like. I think when I tell you this, it's going to be along with our 3\/12 and our 12\/12 pressure curves, our order rate curves. I think you're going to see that they kind of tie in pretty good with where we are as far as our order rates that we're showing and sharing with you. From a PMI standpoint, all of the indices now -- unlike in the past, all of the indices now are north of 50%. So that's a good sign. Everything is north of 50% for the global PMI and it's up slightly from the August period. So that's good. That's up from June as well. Europe, as far as PMI, has increased slightly from August -- I'm sorry, has decreased slightly from August, the Europe one. And also Germany's decreased slightly, but they're up quite a bit from June. So I'm not looking at that being a negative. I think they're still riding above 50% and that's still a positive place to be. The U.S. took a big jump. You may have noticed that yourself. It's up around 56% right now, which is really a very good territory for us. China's flat but north of 50%. It's pretty flat and that's -- we are still seeing kind of a flat environment in Asia and China, in particular. And Brazil is up slightly, but they are just right at about 50%. So they're still pretty flat as well. If you look at the markets, the positive markets that we have, as far as positive trends, would be as follows: commercial aerospace aftermarket and commercial aerospace OEM, both being positive. One of the things that I would point out, one of the segments that has moved positive for us, which I think is a big one because half of our business roughly comes from -- on the industrial side, comes from the aftermarket or distribution, is our distribution now is tracking positive where it had not been in the past. So that's a big change because it does affect half of our business. And so that's a positive one. Cars and light trucks are strong, of course. Semiconductor and telecom. One of the strongest segments for us right now is oil and gas, but offshore oil and gas, not land-based oil and gas. Offshore. Farm and ag, forestry and machine tools, those are all solid as well, as far as positives. So then the negative market segments would be the defense part of our business, the aerospace, the OEM and the aftermarket defense. Mining, of course, is a negative. Power gen and oil and gas, but the land-based oil and gas part of the business. And then, residential air-conditioning, commercial air conditioning are all both negative as well. So that -- and then anything that I did not mention would be kind of flat, which would include like process industries, heavy-duty truck, off-highway construction, industrial trucks and so forth, those kind of markets. Those would be what I would consider flat. Just a couple of comments on the -- our pressure curves, our order curves. When we look at Industrial North America and we also look at Industrial Europe, on a 3\/12 pressure curve basis, this would be the last 3 months' orders divided by the previous year, the same 3 months of the previous year. So this is what you call our 3\/12 curves. Industrial North America would be slightly increasing on a 3\/12 basis and Europe as well, slightly improving on a 3\/12 basis. So that's good news and I think that's what you're seeing in the order trends that we pretty much posted for you as far as those increases in those different regions. Asia. Like the PMI, Asia's flat on a 3\/12 basis. It's slightly above 100% on 12\/12 but pretty flat, and Latin America's pretty flat overall. So we don't see anything real positive yet from both of those regions. But again, the distribution part of our business, both on a 3\/12 basis and on a 12\/12 pressure curve basis, both improving and both greater than 100%, which means that our business is going to continue to increase going forward for the foreseeable future. So those would be just a few of the comments I'd make. If you wanted me to touch on anything else specifically, I could do that too, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. Maybe Don, just a quick follow-up on the distribution business. In speaking with your distributors, do you get the sense that it's restocking or is it true end market demand that's driving the increased rate?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes, I think it's end market demand. I think that everybody has been managing their inventories pretty good, at least in that channel, for over this cycle. And I think now, they are really seeing end market demand, and I think that's consistent with the overall order trend and the indices that I've kind of highlighted. I think that would be more end market demand than anything.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Don, you made a $5 million today on your stock, you could probably take -- you can take the afternoon off.","Donald E. Washkewicz","See, it pays to stay investor. It's never a bad time to own a Parker stock, right?","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, that's right. So just first question on margins, can you just talk about why so tough on the Aerospace side? It seems like the R&D cost would be coming down and we should start to see some of that benefit. And then also, the opposite on the European margins. Is there anything in there besides just the restructuring that's really pushing those margins up so quickly?","Jon P. Marten","Yes, Joel, Jon here. I think, first on the Aerospace margins. Really, what we saw in Q1 was the impact of a couple of different things. One, we had a mix issue just with a little bit less commercial aftermarket than we had expected and a little bit more OEM business than we had expected. And of course, that impacts the margins. And then also, we saw some effects of some entry into service support that was required. A little bit more in development expenses and then just supporting some of the new airframes and some of the new programs that are going into service, our support cost, to be sure that we're carrying out our obligations in terms of those programs, was higher than we expected. In terms of international margins and including Europe and Asia, I think what we're seeing there is a little bit higher leverage for ourselves as the volume improves, commensurate with the order rates that you're seeing and a little bit of a better increase there. We're also starting to see the benefit in our International margins from our integration efforts from the deals that we did last year and in FY '12. So as we continue the integration process, we're starting to see slightly better margins there, too.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And just a quick follow-up. Is there any way that you can kind of ballpark the incremental margins on the organic volume growth, just so we can get a sense of, you know what I mean, how strong of a component that is to the overall improvement?","Jon P. Marten","Well, are you talking about just worldwide, Joel?","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, and probably in Europe, too because it's been so depressed for so long.","Jon P. Marten","Well, of course, our margins right now, as we are starting to go through that inflection point and our order rates are starting to go up, our MROS is higher than our normal MROS targets. We're targeting, of course, with a -- to have a cost structure that provides us on the upside, 30%-plus, and we certainly did see that in our International business here for the quarter. That's what we'll be targeting for as we go on. So we feel very comfortable through the cycle at 30% and a little bit above 30% here as we start to inflect out of the downturn and follow the order rates that we reported.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions. One, just on the restructuring action that you've taken so far, can you provide a little color about what you've done or what -- where you expect to take more actions? I don't know if you can give color in terms of workforce reduction or facility closings or any color by country. And then I guess my next question, just given the strong orders that you've seen over the quarter, I'm surprised that you're taking your revenue down. I know Andy sort of asked that. But was there anything unusual in terms of how the months progress that make you a little more cautious, or is it just it's the first quarter? Just a little more color there. Because the orders are actually better than I would've thought.","Jon P. Marten","Thanks, Jamie. Just first, on the restructuring. We're still in the middle of really working out exactly what the timing of all of that is going to be around the world. We feel very comfortable with our $0.47 that we're sticking with here for the quarter and for the year. And we're feeling very comfortable with what we were able to get accomplished. We were $0.01 shy of what we wanted to do in Q1. And just to set the scale for you, that $0.01 shy of what we wanted to do in Q1 was the entire amount of restructuring that we did in FY '13. So just to emphasize how big of a program this is for us. But, as we went through all the initiatives, the initiatives are intact. They're intact for this year. And Pam has given how they breakout from the first half to the second half. And so -- but it's tricky in terms of exactly the details behind it at this point. We'll be able to probably give you a little bit more detail as to precisely how this has ended up here at the end of Q2. Now, in terms of the guidance for sales, you got to keep in mind a couple of things. One, we took a look at how we did in the quarter. We took a look at how the order rates were coming in. You got to keep in mind that the GE joint venture, from an annual revenue standpoint, is going to remove $200 million a year from us -- from our ability to generate sales. Of course, we won't be able to consolidate that in the future. And we are really just trying to just update it incrementally. We are not taking a look and adjusting our guidance anymore specifically than just feeling really good about doing well in the quarter, coming in almost just in line. And the quarter went as we expected, and our guidance range is just pretty much intact here. A little bit better in International and maybe not quite as good than some of the other segments. But overall, we felt comfortable sticking with our guidance that we put out in August.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Couple on the Aero side. I guess is there a point in time where you start to get a little impatient about margin progression there and these lingering costs that keep popping up? And just on the top line, again, I understand the fine-tuning, but why are we lowering the top line given that we're still seeing double-digit order growth out of Aero?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Jeff, this is Don. Yes, it does got a little bit frustrating, but we're in territory that we, frankly, we haven't been before with all of these new programs. I know, we hate telling you the same story every quarter and having to push things out a little bit here and there, but we've never really been here before with this order of magnitude of new programs and complex -- if the technology was something that we had done in the past, this fly-by-wire technology is new, I think that we would've been a lot more accurate in some of our estimates. It's just hard to predict with the number of programs and the complexity. Hitting this right on for you folks has been tough, and we don't like it anymore than you do. We're doing the best we can, and we're just going to continue to stay on it and try to give you the best information we can. Some of the programs, by the way, have pushed out from a sales standpoint. We've got some orders that have been pushed out from a couple of the programs that we had worked on. So that's changed the sales mix as well going forward. I don't know, Jon, if you had anything else you wanted to add to that.","Jon P. Marten","No. I think between the mix and the level of complexity and the entry into service support, that's a -- there's a lot of moving parts there, and we are really trying as hard as we can to be as accurate as we can when we update the guidance each quarter. And keep in mind that our backlog for Aerospace is at an all-time high. This is all going to pay back for us in the future. This quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year kind of fluctuation is going to occur here when we're in the middle of the unprecedented number of development programs for us. But we feel very confident that in the long run, this pain that we're going through is going to pay off for us, and it is really going to drive value for the company long term.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just quick housekeeping item. Can you give us the pretax restructuring charge in the quarter and where it would've fallen in the 3 segments?","Pamela J. Huggins","Jeff, it's Pam speaking. Yes. Let me give you the quarterly amount, okay? Last time -- and I just want to make sure that I'm very clear with this, because last time we talked about $0.32. The $0.32 that we talked about last time was the net. It was basically cost less savings, okay? So we had $0.47 of cost, $0.15 of savings. Obviously, the net being the $0.32. By quarter, the costs are $0.06 in the first quarter, $0.13 in the second quarter, $0.06 in the third quarter, $0.22 in the fourth quarter, and that gets you to your $0.47. What I will say is that close to 95% of that is obviously in the international businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton from Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Your CapEx for the first quarter, what was that again?","Pamela J. Huggins","1.8% of sales.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","1.8%. And what do you expect for the year in that?","Jon P. Marten","It's going to be around that number, Alex. It's been fluctuating from 1.8% to 2.1%. And so we wouldn't expect it to be any less than the 1.8% and probably no more than 2.1%.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","So that's about a saving of about 300 basis points from what it ran 10 years ago.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes, sir.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Which on $13 billion in sales is $400 million that you can use to repurchase stock or buy your own stock or buy companies. So I think that's an excellent achievement. The other question I have is on the earnings guidance, you've given that to us including the restructuring of $0.47. And if you look at the consensus number, which this morning was $6.53, it's in the middle of that range. But I believe that, that consensus excludes the $0.47. Is that correct? So that if you put that $0.47 back in, the consensus would be $6.06 compared with your $6.10 to $6.70 number. Is that correct? Is that the way we should look at that?","Pamela J. Huggins","What I would say about that is we worked very hard in the quarter to try to get everybody on the same page with respect to inclusion or excluding that. And it was very difficult to do that.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","So you mean the $6.53 consensus is a mixture of people that are including restructuring and those who aren't?","Pamela J. Huggins","There could be some of that in there, Alex.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Because usually, they work pretty hard to make everybody on the same page at first call.","Pamela J. Huggins","Right. Well, we had a couple of things moving around this time. We had the JV gain, as well as the restructuring. And we were pretty good at getting the JV gain excluded, but on the restructuring side, it was quite a challenge, let me tell you.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Okay. So you don't really know what the clean number is?","Pamela J. Huggins","Well, we think most of those numbers exclude the restructuring -- include the restructuring, sorry. And the reason I say that is because we gave guidance with restructuring in it. So most of the people followed the guidance that we gave.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Alex, this is Don. Just one follow up on the comment that you made just a minute ago. I think it's a very good observation. It's something that I think we tend to miss because you're looking year-on-year but you don't look over the longer run and see that because of our WIN initiative that we started back in the early 2001 time frame that we've been executing on, we have really driven the need for capital down drastically throughout the company, plus the need for facilities and so forth because we're driving inventory out of our system by executing Lean. It's been really a positive -- probably one of the most positive things we've done in the company. But what I want everybody to understand is that the dividend increase scenario that we've been executing here, 114% increase over the last 5 years, would not have been possible had we not driven this capital expenditures down to where we were. That's where the money is coming from that I'm using now to pay back to our shareholders. So I just wanted to make that tie-in because it's exactly what's happening here. We feel a lot more comfortable that we can raise that dividend given the fact that we've done the heavy lifting here.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","That's an excellent point. Lean applies to the management of capital as well as the management of factories.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Don, I'm wondering, can I take you back to capital allocation for just a moment here? And I'm curious, as you talk about your focus being on acquisitions, is there any way to sort of size for us what might be in the pipeline? I realize it's not over till it's over, but is there a chance that there's something kind of a little chunkier that we're waiting to do here? And have you changed any of your thoughts about what you're willing to pay for these things?","Donald E. Washkewicz","No. I think that what we're willing to pay, I think we're pretty consistent on that. We do a valuation here, and we're pretty -- we haven't really changed our method of evaluating or coming up with a value in our discounted cash flow approach over the years. It's been pretty stable. The ones that we're looking at are not in the $1 billion category for the most part. I mean, there's only a handful of those that we would consider. If they were available or actionable, of course, we're always looking at those as well, but I would say are more in the range of $100 million to $300 million kind of size range. Maybe even some that are a little less than that would be the ones that we're looking at today. Again, though, it's hard to say what we're going to get to the finish line. We did about $0.5 billion last year. I would've done more last year if we could have gotten more to the finish line. But we did $0.5 million, which is 4-point some percent of sales. I'd love to do that much again this year. We're going to have to get some moving down the pipe and get them to the finish line here to be able to pull that off.","If not, though, like I said before, if not, we'll figure out what else to do with the allocating capital elsewhere, and we don't want to continue to build up a lot of cash on the balance sheet for the long term. So we'll figure out what to do there.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. I guess what I'm wrestling with and maybe my math is just wrong, but it looks to me like you guys have about $2.5 billion of excess liquidity on your balance sheet right now. If I was just to get you back to 30% net debt to cap, I'm coming up with something in that range. And given that you tend to pay somewhere around onetime sales for things, it would appear that you have just way more than you need even for what's in the pipeline. And so I guess I'm just trying to kind of square all of that up and figure out why you would want to wait on other options as you described them?","Jon P. Marten","This is Jon. I think one part of that answer is that, as Don talked about, there are the bigger deals that we continue to look at. And as we look at the smaller deals, we've been able to do in some years 10 or 12 relatively smaller deals in the $50 million to $200 million range. So I think your math is correct in terms of our ability to fund these. And we are looking at this very hard, every quarter, and we take it very seriously in terms of the cash deployment and our need to do something there. But as Don said, our preference is the pipeline, the acquisition pipeline, and we want to make sure that we've got the liquidity to fund all of the ones that are in our pipeline. And of course, you never know what's going to get in, to the very end, but we want to stay prepared for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre from Robert W. Baird.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So I guess my question is primarily around the cost savings. You detailed the restructuring costs. I'm wondering if you can update us on that a little bit. Obviously, first quarter performance was quite strong. And as it pertains to International, it looks to me like in your margin guidance change, most of the upside is pretty much housed in the first quarter. How do we think about the rest of the year?","Jon P. Marten","Well, I think you're right there, Mig. I mean I think most of the upside is in the first quarter, as we looked out, as I said before in the answer to the top line question. It's the middle of October. We just came out in the middle of August here with our guidance for the year. And what we're trying to explain to everybody here is that this year is starting out just like we thought that it was going to. And our Restructuring Program, as we revamped the entire program here and looked at it program by program, initiative by initiative, for the year is coming in remarkably close to the way that we originally envisioned it here at the end of our Q4. So we feel confident in our top line and in our restructuring going forward.","Now as we looked at the guidance then, therefore, for the follow-on portion of the ensuing 3 quarters, we felt comfortable enough with our look that we had put together at the year end to maintain that. We made a few minor changes in a couple of the segments and a couple of the quarters here to account for certain activities. We adjusted the tax rate, as Pam explained earlier, and we adjusted for the JV also. But I would characterize our look at the ensuing 3 quarters as consistent with what exactly Don said, a moderate growth following in line with our orders growth. And our ability to generate cash and operating income here are just about where we thought it would be here at the end of Q1.","Our savings for the restructuring program has not changed. It's the same as what we had for the beginning of the year at a total of $0.15 for the year. And our first quarter came in just right where we thought that it would. So, so far, so good. We're very proud and we're continuing and we're determined to get through with this restructuring program and get on with providing value to our shareholders and growing the business.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, very well. And then my follow-up. Very much appreciate the technology platforms that you guys have put out there. I'm wondering, what sort of growth in, say, motion flow and filtration for the year is embedded in your current outlook? Can you provide that?","Pamela J. Huggins","Mig, we don't really have it broken out by that. We didn't break it out by that, but we can get back to you on that, okay?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","I had a question on restructuring for 2015. I mean, $0.06 actually doesn't matter, but $0.47 is material, and it would be Wall Street protocol to always exclude that unless you're going to tell me the $0.47 is an ongoing number for the next several years. And I don't think you're believing to indicate that. Is it expected that restructuring in '15 will be much lower than this year and, therefore, we should exclude it?","Jon P. Marten","Yes, very much so, Eli. And we're trying to be as transparent as we can. So the $0.47 is a onetime event for FY '14. We don't expect that in FY '15.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And that's why people should exclude the number if they want to get an apples-to-apples comparison [ph]. I'd encourage you to go back to normal protocol as opposed to bury it in there. My real question is 2 parts. One, were most of the orders driven by distribution as opposed to OEM across it? And two is all the drop in Industrial International, the restructuring, profitability and the slight drop in Industrial North American mix, or what's causing the slightly -- expected slight decline in profitability in those?","Jon P. Marten","Eli, I'm sorry, Eli. You broke up there a little bit. Could you repeat the question?","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","A question was, one, is most of the order gain from distribution as opposed to OEM. It would seem that, that would be distribution that drove all your order gains. And the second part of it, is the margin change through the year versus the first quarter, principally restructuring in International and mix in North America?","Jon P. Marten","I think that for North America, the margins, as you know, are at a historical high. And we are cautious on being able to really take a look at increasing our margins there in North America. I think our order growth there is a combination of distribution and our OEM business. It's not one or the other. And so I think that's the way that we're looking at that going forward. Now in terms of the International margins. I think there are obviously numerous reasons for the increase in our forecast there. But 2 of the biggest ones are our ability to integrate the acquisitions that we have done in the prior couple of years and that ongoing benefit that we're getting there. And then of course, per our guidance for FY '14, we are continuing to focus on our operations there and trying to -- as Pam said, 95% of our restructuring being there, what we're trying to do is to make sure that we are getting the entire company up to the level where we can maintain, for an entire year, our 15% ROS targets that Don talked about last quarter. And so we're seeing some improvement in our international margins, and we're very pleased by that, and so our updated guidance is just reflecting that marginally.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Ritchie from Goldman Sachs & Co.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just clarification on the $0.32 versus the $0.47. Is the $0.15 in benefit that we discussed last quarter not happening in FY '14? And subsequently, is the run rate for next year it's still expected to be $80 million in savings?","Pamela J. Huggins","No, that's exactly right. We still are expecting $80 million, and it's moving along just as we thought it would. So the $0.15 is exactly what we reported last quarter. And I think if you look at it by quarter, it's coming in line with what we said.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then I guess just one question on Industrial International. The margins were great this quarter. It seems like prior restructuring actions have helped. I take a look at your margin guidance for this year at 11.4% to 11.8%, it seems a bit conservative to me if you assume that the benefits come through, through the remainder of the year. Even if you have additional restructuring costs, it seems like the top end of that range is pretty conservative. So maybe you can just discuss that a little bit.","Jon P. Marten","Well, I think that from our viewpoint there, we understand always for the company in all segments, almost, our Q2 is seasonally lower than our Q1. So we will see that impact here for this fiscal year. Our Q3 and our Q4, as I tried to explain earlier, is intact with how we explained our guidance coming out here for the fiscal year. And so since we're only 2 months in, we feel comfortable. Our order rates are coming in where we thought they were. Our end markets are, like always, moving up and down slightly, and we continue to tweak how we are projecting our revenue through the changes in the end markets, not only internationally, but also as well as North America. And so we feel like our numbers that we came in with here for the second half, especially in International Industrial, are good numbers for us to be able to project our future EPS.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Because the implication, I guess, is for the next several quarters that Industrial International is going to be down. Margins are going to be down over the next 3 quarters despite fairly easy comps. So is that the right way to think about it?","Jon P. Marten","I think again, getting to the question, we see again we're looking at these numbers with our restructuring in them. And if I took out the restructuring out of the international margins, they would not be going down. They would be relatively flat to trending up slightly. But the bulk of our restructuring is in the second half, not the first half. So if you're looking at it including the restructuring, then it may appear to be that way to you, but that's not what the underlying trend is in the business going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Pam, if I remember right from the last quarter, you gave a little bit of help on the first quarter, just saying $1.40 midpoint. Any help you can provide on the December quarter, particularly with all the moving parts coming through?","Pamela J. Huggins","Sure. I can do that because it's very difficult, I know, for you to see with the JV in there. But I would say that the midpoint -- I could tell you the midpoint and then you can wrap the $0.15 around it, if that'll be helpful. But if you exclude the JV, it's probably around $1.14, $1.15. Somewhere in there.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And then, Don, just one last one here, going back to some of the comments you made on the PMI earlier, particularly in North America. I think we get pretty consistent feedback that it doesn't feel like a 55-plus PMI environment. Is that the sense you get from your customers? And if so, when do you think we start to catch up to that on a more realtime basis?","Donald E. Washkewicz","That's a good question because I've seen that stated before. I forgot where, what I was reading, I saw some comments to that effect. And I would have a tendency to agree that usually when you're up into that 56 territory, which is where the U.S. PMI is now, that you would expect to see more activity. I think there's a little bit of a lag this time. But when we look at our 3\/12 data, which is our more recent 3 months order trends, they're tending to trend in the direction of that PMI where you expect them to be. So I think that's just a little bit of a lag here, maybe a month or 2. And I think we're going to be caught up with it. That's just really off the top. That's my gut feel based on looking at our order trends and the current PMI trends that we're looking at.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Got you. So we should start to see that show up in the December quarter, excluding normal holiday shutdowns and things about that?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Exactly, yes. I think that would be accurate, yes.","Pamela J. Huggins","Josh, just for clarification, on the numbers that I just threw out to you, I want to make sure that you know that, that includes the restructuring for the second quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC.","Pamela J. Huggins","Jamie, I would just like to announce that this will be the last question. We'll close it off after this, and Don will have a few closing comments. Thank you. Go ahead, please.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So just revisiting the revenue guidance, it sounds like first quarter is at least in line with expectations. The order trends are positive. In the Industrial segments, you did take a point off of the top end of the range of the revenue growth. I know that may be minor, but just given the commentary and sort of the trends, just wondering why change the range at all at this point in the year? Are there maybe some end markets that are recovering a bit more slowly than you expected? Just if you can give a little bit more color.","Jon P. Marten","I think that the way that we were looking at the guidance at the beginning of the year, when we put it together, we showed certain -- as the year went on, certain end markets improving as the year went on. And as we look at updating all of these numbers, like we do every month, and of course on detail every quarter, we saw some of the end markets, maybe not coming back quite as strongly, and I pushed it down in the second half slightly. As Don talked about at the beginning, some of the markets that are down, primarily the construction equipment market, is not coming back quite as quickly as we thought, primarily in our international margins. And so we wanted to account for that as well as a few other markets that weren't really quite as strong as we thought that they were going to be, as we look out now for the next 9 months. Having said that, there's other markets that are doing better than we have projected. And when we rolled them all together, we ended up deciding to just pull that down by 1 point.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then sorry if you covered this on the Aerospace side, but just the log again from the change last time to this time. Did defense have any impact on those numbers?","Jon P. Marten","I think that there's a, from a top line standpoint, there is an impact of some defense orders. But this is more timing than it is a significant downshift. So we think that there is some impact there. There's also a 1 or 2 commercial programs where they are also a timing issue, where they're moving from FY '14 to FY '15. And then the other, of course, the other major factor there is that there's, going forward on an annual basis, $200 million less in revenue that we will see in the Aerospace segment as a result of the closing of the JV as of October 1.","Pamela J. Huggins","So at this time, Don, we'll turn it over to Don who has some closing comments. Prior to that, I'd just like to say thank all of you for your attendance. And Todd and I will obviously be around this afternoon, and I'm sure we'll be talking to most of you.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Thanks, Pam. And just a couple of comments real quickly here. Just want to once again thank everybody on the call for their participation and for joining us this morning. Just I guess 2 key takeaways to recap. There's more takeaways than that, but just maybe a couple of key ones. Just one thing is our expectations for the balance of the fiscal year is for a moderate improvement in our global markets, and more importantly, ongoing growth in our distribution business. And that was suppressed in the past quarters, and now we see that coming back to life and that's good for Parker, for our future, because it represents half of our -- approximately half of our Industrial business. So that's a real key one that I think is part of the takeaway we should all be pretty happy with.","The other thing is that we do expect to complete the comprehensive restructuring that we talked about. We went into a lot of detail with you about that. There's a lot happening behind the scenes. When you talk about capital deployment and all that, this is one of the major things we're doing this year in that area, spending $100 million on this major restructuring is not a typical program for the company, as we mentioned. So we do plan to complete that. As we've outlined it for you and with the full benefit occurring in fiscal '15. So that's going to be a positive as well.","And then as always, I'd like to just take the opportunity to thank our employees for their continued commitment and success that we've had. Our global team really does continue to do a great job executing on the WIN strategy and delivering the positive results that we've seen, so I want to thank all of them. And then just lastly, as Pam indicated, she will be here with Todd the balance of the day if there's any questions or follow-up that's needed. So with that, goodbye and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Suever, Vice President, Corporate Controller and Acting Chief Financial Officer. Ma\u2019am, you may begin","Cathy Suever","Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning and welcome to Parker Hannifin\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks. Today\u2019s presentation slides, together with the audio webcast replay, will be accessible on the company\u2019s investor information website at phstock.com for 1 year following today\u2019s call.","On Slide #2, you will find the company\u2019s Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations or any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning\u2019s press release and are posted on Parker\u2019s website at phstock.com. Today\u2019s agenda appears on Slide #3.","To begin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, will provide highlights for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Following Tom\u2019s comments, I will provide a review of the company\u2019s second quarter fiscal year \u201817 performance, together with the guidance for fiscal year \u201817. Tom will provide a few summary comments, and then we will open the call for a question-and-answer session. This time, I will turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to Slide #4.","Tom Williams","Thanks, Cathy and welcome to everybody on the call and we appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I would like to share highlights on our second quarter results, a very strong quarter for Parker, give you an update on the CLARCOR transaction and comment on changes to our fiscal 2017 guidance. As I have shared before, keeping our people safe is our first priority, so I thought I\u2019d once again report on that first.","During the second quarter of 2017, we are able to reduce our recordable injuries by 31% compared to the prior year. This builds upon a 33% year-over-year improvement we posted comparing 2016 to 2015. This improvement is being driven by a combination of strong leadership, training and engagement of our team members globally through our high-performance team focus. Nationally, we have a long way to go to reach our goal of zero accidents, but I am very pleased with the progress we are making.","Now to the financial highlights of our second quarter results. Overall, this was a very strong quarter for Parker. Second quarter sales were $2.67 billion, a 1% decline compared with the same quarter a year ago. Organic sales were basically flat, as the decline was primarily due to currency. This is largely in line with what we anticipated and continues a favorable trend with sales showing less of a decline quarter-to-quarter and top line growth expected to turn positive in the second half of our fiscal year. Order rates also continue to move in a positive direction for the second consecutive quarter. Total orders increased 5% compared with the same quarter last year. North America orders were flat, Industrial international orders were up 10% and then our aerospace systems segment orders were up 9%.","Net income for the second quarter was $241.4 million as reported or $258.8 million adjusted, representing a 24% increase compared with adjusted net income in the second quarter of last year. Earnings per share were $1.78 as reported or $1.91 on an adjusted basis, a 26% increase in adjusted earnings per share compared with the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we did record a pre-tax gain of $45 million or $0.21 per share related to the sale of our Autoline product line. Autoline manufactures quick connectors for passenger car applications and was no longer a strategic fit within our portfolio.","I am particularly pleased with our overall segment operating margin performance this quarter, which was a second quarter record at 14.4% as reported or 14.7% on an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins increased 120 basis points compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2016, which is an excellent year-over-year improvement. This is strong margin performance for Parker and reflects the benefits of our implementation of the new Win Strategy. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations, excluding a discretionary pension contribution, was 11.5% of sales, reflecting our ability to be a consistent generator of cash through economic cycles.","Now just a few comments on capital allocation. As previously disclosed, clearance has been received with respect to the regulatory filings made on the pending CLARCOR transaction. These events satisfied important conditions to the closing of the CLARCOR transaction. Transaction remains subject to other closing conditions, including approval by the CLARCOR stockholders. Based on the current date for Parker\u2019s special meeting on the stockholders on February 23, 2017 and subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions, the parties currently expect the pending CLARCOR transaction to close on or about February 28, 2017. All of us are really looking forward to welcoming the CLARCOR team to Parker.","Also note, yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Helac Corporation. Helac specializes in the design and manufacture of helical rotary actuators and attachments. This is a nice bolt-on acquisition for our Hydraulics Group that expands our actuator platform, providing a broader bill of material that we can leverage through our global channels. We are happy to welcome the Helac team to Parker. Last week, we also announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend, consistent with our desire to extend our record of increasing annual dividends paid, which now stands at 60 consecutive years. These actions reinforce our commitment to being a great deployer of cash in ways that generate increased long-term returns for our shareholders.","Now moving to our revised FY \u201817 guidance. We have increased our earnings guidance for fiscal 2017. We are increasing our organic growth forecast for the second half of the fiscal year from 2.3% to 3.3% at the midpoint in our new guidance. However, this increase in organic revenue is being offset by currency headwinds resulting in essentially flat full year reported annual sales growth versus fiscal 2016. For fiscal year 2017, we are updating guidance for as-reported earnings in the range of $6.71 to $7.21 per share or $6.96 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $7.05 to $7.55 or midpoint of $7.30. Earnings are adjusted for anticipated business realignment expenses of approximately $0.25 per share forecasted for fiscal 2017 and for acquisition of transaction-related expenses of $0.09, which were incurred in the second quarter. Our revised guidance does not include any benefits or costs from CLARCOR or Helac acquisitions in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2017. Guidance will be updated for these acquisitions in our next earnings call.","And for now, I will hand things back to Cathy to review more details in the quarter and the fiscal 2017 guidance.","Cathy Suever","Okay. Thanks, Tom. At this time, please refer to Slide #5. I will begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.91 versus $1.52 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.39. Fiscal year \u201817 second quarter earnings include a gain on the sale of a product line of $0.21. Second quarter earnings have been adjusted to exclude CLARCOR transaction expenses of $0.09 incurred during the quarter and business realignment expenses of $0.04, which compares to business realignment expenses of $0.19 for the same quarter last year.","On Slide #6, you will find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.52 for the second quarter FY \u201816 to $1.91 for the second quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per share income included higher adjusted segment operating income of $0.15, reduced other expense of $0.38 per share due to the sale of a product line and a currency again in Q2 of this year versus a currency loss in the same quarter last year, and the impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.02 per share. Adjusted per share income was reduced by $0.09 due to a higher effective tax rate as compared to the prior year. During Q2 of \u201816, the tax rate was significantly reduced following the passage of the U.S. tax extenders bill. Finally, higher corporate G&A versus prior year as a result of favorable market-based incentive adjustments in the prior year equated to a reduction of $0.07 per share this year.","Moving to Slide #7, we have reviewed total company sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter. Total company organic sales in the second quarter decreased by 0.5% compared to the same quarter last year. There was 0.3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions, while currency negatively impacted the quarter by 1.1%. As Tom mentioned, total company segment operating margin reached a second quarter record of 14.4% on an as reported basis. Total segment operating margins adjusted for realigned \u2013 sorry, realignment costs incurred was 14.7% versus 13.5% for the same quarter last year. Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $8 million versus $35 million last year. The increased adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $392 million versus $366 million last year reflects the impact of the new Win Strategy, complemented by increased progress towards stabilization in several industrial end markets.","Moving to Slide #8, I will discuss the business segments, starting with the Diversified Industrial North America segment. For the second quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 2.8% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was no impact from acquisitions, while currency negatively impacted the quarter by 0.6%. Operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 16.6% of sales versus 15% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $2 million as compared to $20 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $186 million as compared to $174 million, driven by favorable incremental margins. I will continue with the Diversified Industrial International segment on Slide #9.","Organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment increased by 3.0%, acquisitions positively impacted sales by 0.8%, while currency negatively impacted the quarter by 2.4%. Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for business realignment costs, was 13.1% of sales versus 11% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $4 million as compared to $14 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $132 million as compared to $109 million, which reflects strong incremental margins on increased revenues and lower fixed costs.","I will now move to Slide #10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues declined $0.016 \u2013 1.6% for the second quarter. While growth in military OEM and military aftermarket was positive, commercial OEM continued to be negatively pressured in business jets, commercial helicopters and widebody commercial aircraft production, resulting in a modest year-over-year decline. Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs was 13.5% of sales versus 14.8% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $1 million compared to minimal business realignment expenses in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $74 million as compared to $82 million last year. Prior period margins benefited from comparatively high commercial aftermarket sales volume.","Moving to Slide #11, we have the details for orders, changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders improved to a positive 5% for the quarter end. Diversified Industrial North American orders improved to a year-over-year zero percent change. Diversified Industrial International orders increased year-over-year to positive 10% for the quarter and Aerospace Systems orders grew year-over-year at a positive 9%.","On Slide #12, we report cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, cash flow from operating activities was $404 million or 7.5% of sales. This compares to 6.5% of sales for the same period last year. When adjusted for the $220 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was 11.5% of sales. This compares to 10.1% of sales for the same period last year, adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the prior year. In addition to the discretionary pension contribution, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $196 million for the company\u2019s repurchase of common shares, $169 million for the payment of shareholder dividends and $72 million for capital expenditures equating to 1.3% of sales.","The full year earnings guidance for fiscal year 2017 is outlined on Slide #13. Guidance is being provided on both an as reported and an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout fiscal year 2017. Adjusted below the line items and earnings per share exclude CLARCOR transaction expenses of $16 million incurred during fiscal year \u201817 Q2. Total sales are expected to be in the range of minus 2.3% to a positive 1.3% as compared to the prior year. Organic growth at the midpoint is 0.4%. Acquisitions in the guidance are expected to positively impact sales by 0.4%. Currency in the guidance is expected to have a negative 1.3% impact on sales. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming fiscal year 2017.","For total Parker, as reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 15.1% and 15.5%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 15.5% and 15.9%. The midpoint of the forecasted adjusted margin is 110 basis points above fiscal year 2016. The full year guidance at the midpoint for below the line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest and other expense, is $425 million on an as reported basis and $409 million on an adjusted basis. The full year tax rate is now projected at 27.5%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 135.7 million shares. For the full year, the guidance range on an as reported earnings per share basis is $6.71 to $7.21 or $6.96 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is $7.05 to $7.55 or $7.30 at the midpoint. This adjusted earnings per share guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be incurred in fiscal year 2017. The effect of this restructuring on earnings per share is approximately $0.25.","Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million and are fully reflected in both the as reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges. In addition, adjusted guidance excludes $16 million of CLARCOR transaction expenses incurred in Q2 equating to $0.09 earnings per share. Our revised guidance does not include any benefits nor costs from the CLARCOR or Helac acquisitions in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal year 2017. Guidance will be updated for these acquisitions in our next earnings call. We would ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison. Some additional key assumptions for full year 2017 guidance at the midpoint are; sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% first half, 54% second half. Adjusted earnings per share first half, second half is $3.52 and $3.78 at the midpoint. Q3 \u201817 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.74 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.09 per share of projected business realignment expenses.","On Slide #14, you will find a reconciliation of the major components of fiscal year \u201817 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $7.30 per share at the midpoint from prior fiscal year \u201817 earnings per share of $6.75 per share. Increases include $0.09 from stronger Q2 segment operating income, $0.35 from lower other expense and $0.12 from lower SG&A expense and a lower effective tax rate. The decrease includes a $0.01 per share reduction from slightly higher interest expense. Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisitions or divestitures that might close during fiscal year \u201817. This concludes my prepared comments.","Tom, I will turn the call back to you for your summary comments.","Tom Williams","Thanks, Cathy and I am glad we were able to continue our progress through 2017 with a very strong second quarter. I would like to thank Parker team members around the world for their dedicated efforts. We have made meaningful progress with initiatives designed to improve margins, but we have also taken decisive actions to strengthen and sustain our business for the long-term and create value for our shareholders. All signs point to an improving second half of fiscal 2017 and we are positioned for even greater success under the framework provided by the Win Strategy as we go into the future. I would also like to point out that Parker-Hannifin celebrates its 100th year anniversary this year. We are very proud of the efforts put forth by all who have come before us and the achievements we have made throughout our long history. Today, as the global leader in motion control technologies, we are focused on engineering the success of our stakeholders as we work in partnership with our customers to solve the world\u2019s greatest engineering challenges. With the actions and investments we are taking today, we are ensuring a bright future for Parker as we enter our second century.","And with that, at this time, we are ready to take questions. So Chelsea, if you want to go ahead and get us started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeff Hammond","Hey, good morning guys.","Cathy Suever","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. So maybe just, first, can you just talk about anything that\u2019s really driving the more positive margins? Is that just feeling a little bit better about volumes? And then Tom, it looks like there is some corporate expense \u2013 lower corporate expense if you exclude this gain. And I am just wondering what are the moving pieces there and then in particular, are there any savings captured by the simplification program? Thanks.","Tom Williams","Okay, Jeff. This is Tom. I will take the margin side and I will have Cathy cover the corporate expenses. But the margins is really a holistic impact that we have seen with the Win Strategy and the changes we have made to the Win Strategy. I would say we made, clearly, market adjustments. When we saw the market turn down, we restructured the company. But we have also done a strategic restructuring that focused combination of footprint and SG&A and that combination has dramatically lowered our fixed cost structure of the company. I think probably the best way to visualize that for people is the line we have put in the annual report this year, but we went from 59,000 people on the team, going back probably about 4 years ago, to 48,000 people. And we have done that through a variety of initiatives, responding to the market, looking at footprint, looking at SG&A and in general trying to make the company simpler, faster, easier to do business with, with our customers. And ultimately, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the margin enhancements that you see. The part that I am very encouraged by is that we are in very early days of this whole journey. We continue to find more upside and more positives as we work through this simplification program. In particular, it\u2019s got lots of upside. And we are excited as orders are starting to turn, we will get to leverage that lower fixed cost and generate even better margins. But I will let Cathy take the corporate expense question.","Cathy Suever","Yes, Jeff. The corporate expense has been impacted a little by a market-based incentive plan that we have. But I would say, in addition to that, we have done some realignment and movements to reduce some of the fixed costs at corporate and you are seeing the benefit of that as well.","Jeff Hammond","Okay, great. And then just maybe just sticking on North America moving to flat, can you just talk about the tone there and maybe decipher between OE and distribution? Thanks.","Tom Williams","Maybe I will start with orders. And then since I know this is a popular question, I will just hand it to Lee to go through the markets kind of by region, because everybody, I\u2019m sure, has questions about that. But in North America, the order pattern followed exactly what we had anticipated when we laid out the guidance last quarter. We expected that it get to flat this quarter and it did. In general, what\u2019s enabling that is that the natural resource end markets kind of oil and gas, mining, construction and ag have moderated to where they have become less of a drag. We saw North America distribution go to flat, which being a big part of our total revenue, that was a huge help. And then in particular, semicon, telecom, refrigeration, machine tools and mining were positive order entry for North America. But let me turn it over to Lee and we will kind of spin you through the markets and the regions.","Lee Banks","Okay, Jeff. You are going to get more than you asked for here. But I think first, just following up on Tom, I think what\u2019s encouraging is the organic growth moved largely in the direction we thought from the last call. And many of our markets are showing positive momentum towards year-over-year growth as I go around the world, and I shared that with you. Just on North American distribution, I would say, in general, the mood of our major distributors is fairly positive and this is after a solid order entry during the quarter. And that trend has continued in January, which has led us to the guidance that is reflected here today. I think what\u2019s also encouraging is I checked many of our largest distributors have reported increase in their backlog, so again, bodes well. If I talk about oil and gas on the industrial side, land-based oil and gas is showing increasing signs of growth, which is real positive. There has been obviously and you track this too, an increase in rig counts, which has led to an increase in MRO and some first bid activity. And we are seeing very small signs of recovery with offshore drilling contractors. We do expect the offshore to lag behind the land-based, but there is activity taking place there. I think the best way to sum it up, too, I was talking to one of our key partners in oil and gas, and he said, Lee, 60, 90 days ago, I would have said we see sparks, and today I am starting to see smoke. And so there is just things happening out there, which are positive.","Just talking about energy markets overall, the market for large frame turbines, was flat in Q2. Our overall business was slightly up due to some market content wins. And we do continue to see positive year-over-year growth in alternative energy such as wind turbines and Parker is benefiting mostly from significant content and customers trying to take advantage of some of the federal tax credit programs that still exist. Residential air-conditioning and refrigeration, Tom talked about, we continue to see strong year-over-year growth in commercial and residential air-conditioning and we expect that to continue going forward. On the mobile markets in North America, most key customers are still showing year-over-year decline in Q2. This includes off-highway construction, farm and ag equipment material handling. But we are getting many positive inputs and preparedness requests from many of our key OEM partners. So I think that bodes well going forward. So I would call that segment. It appears that we have really formed the bottom with some upside.","Just turning to EMEA and I will be brief here. On distribution, it\u2019s still slightly negative year-over-year. However, the distribution order entry is beginning to show signs of strengthening. The order entry rates definitely improved during the quarter on a year-over-year comparison. Oil and gas is probably the biggest impact still in Europe, but it\u2019s flattened out and we definitely see signs of strength in distribution that focuses on core industrial end markets. So, that\u2019s positive. Just in general, industrial, I would just say positive markets like North America, we have seen a real uptick in mining and related equipment. This would be hard rock mining for iron ore, etcetera and then semiconductor and telecom are very \u2013 both very strong. Oil and gas, I talked about, still very low year-over-year, but we \u2013 it does appear the bottom has formed with the activity taking place in the North Sea. And then in the mobile markets, we do see an increased activity in forestry and off-highway construction equipment markets. In Asia Pacific, I would say it\u2019s a very positive story and it\u2019s really continued from the story we told last quarter. So in distribution, we are very encouraged by our focus and progress on distribution. The order entry was a positive and we continue to add new distribution outlets. In the industrial markets, almost all industrial markets are positive year-over-year and order entry continues to be strong. Strongest markets include machine tools, mining again, semiconductor is very strong, life sciences and medical equipment. And then in the mobile equipment markets, that\u2019s probably perhaps the strongest sequential and year-over-year growth and order entry came from those markets. And those strong end markets include off-highway construction equipment engines, cars and light trucks. And then just lastly, I will touch on Latin America. We continue to be encouraged by Q2 order entry. As you know, Brazil still has its share of issues, but there are some positive things taking place in Ag, construction equipment and then distribution, all obviously from a very low base. So bottom line, organic growth continues to move in a direction we talked about. And I think we are all encouraged by what we see in many of our end markets and regions right now.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ann Duignan","Thank you. That was quite a summary, my head is kind of spinning from all of that information, but I will go back to that CLARCOR acquisition, if we look at some of the potential changes under the new administration, the elimination of interest expense is one that might impact Parker significantly post CLARCOR, have you have any discussions about, instead of issuing debt that you might use equity instead just because of the uncertainty or maybe you could just tell us what you are talking about behind the scenes there?","Cathy Suever","Yes. Ann, I will take that. We are focused on issuing debt. We think it\u2019s a good time to be in the market at today\u2019s rates. Yes, we understand that there could be some changes in rules around interest expense, but at this point, we do not plan to issue any equity. The agreement we have with CLARCOR, that it\u2019s a cash deal.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And I know you have said all along that in the first year of ownership, it would be \u2013 the deal would be accretive, if I just take the synergies that you have noted versus the costs that you have noted, we are looking at somewhere around $0.15 of accretion in the first full year, is that about right, is that the order of magnitude that you are looking at in first full year or am I missing anything?","Cathy Suever","Yes. Ann, we are not really prepared to update from what we told you on December 1, but that\u2019s you are in line there, after excluding the one-off costs of the transaction fees, the inventory market valuation and the synergy costs. But yes, we do expect to see it accretive in year one.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And just finally on CLARCOR, they recently noted headwinds from higher material costs, does that change anything on the synergies side for you or was that anticipated when you made the offer?","Tom Williams","Ann, this is Tom. I won\u2019t comment about any of CLARCOR\u2019s comments as they are still an independent company. I will just make a comment in general about what we have seen so far with integration planning. It\u2019s really confirmed the excitement that we feel about the strategic fit and the synergies that we communicated, $140 million in cost on December 1. So we feel as good or better about that today. And we really love the team that is joining in Parker. And I think the cooperation that we have seen between both companies, both leadership teams, this has been fantastic and we are ready to hit the ground running when this thing closes.","Ann Duignan","Well, great. I wish you luck on that. Now, I will get back in line. Thanks.","Cathy Suever","Thanks Ann.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andy Casey","Thanks a lot. Good morning.","Cathy Suever","Good morning Andy.","Andy Casey","On the outlook, the guidance for Diversified Industrial International, the top line came down, margin went up from the prior guidance, could you kind of discuss what factors drove that was that all the divestiture, or was there something else?","Tom Williams","Andy, it\u2019s Tom. So for international, the big change is two-fold. One, the new guide organically is higher than what we told you before. So last guide, we have 4.4% organic sales growth for the second half. These are all second half numbers I have given you. And now it\u2019s 6.7%. However, when you look at currency, prior guide had a slightly positive currency and now it\u2019s a minus 5% drag. So that\u2019s the big difference, is that a currency impact, basically is about $130 million swing from last guide to what we are guiding today. And that creates the headwind for us.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thanks Tom. And then could you address the margins slightly higher as well?","Tom Williams","The margins, I mean it\u2019s the Win Strategy coming through. But in particular, we are leveraging \u2013 you have all heard me talk about Asia Pacific, how it\u2019s a region that is better margin than the company average and relatively underutilized from a fixed cost and facility standpoint. So a lot of what\u2019s propelling our growth internationally so far is Asia Pacific. So we are getting to leverage a little higher mix as Asia comes in higher margins and we are leveraging that fixed cost structure and converting it at a much faster clip because the Asia team \u2013 everybody around the world is lowering their fixed cost, when you put some extra volume through a plant that\u2019s relatively underutilized, you get a really nice pop in margins.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you. And then if we kind of look at the order improvement that you and Lee have gone through, we have heard some commentary that the fourth quarter - fourth calendar quarter, your second quarter, had kind of a surge at the tail end, first, did you see that and then second, has there been any noticeable change to the trend you saw last quarter so far through January?","Tom Williams","Andy, it\u2019s Tom again. I would characterize the order pattern for the quarter as steady progress sequentially through the quarter. So it kept improving gradually through the quarter. And January continued and really our view, January in the quarter is all reflected in the revised guide, which popped the organic growth up 100 basis points for the second half.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Nathan Jones","Good morning everyone.","Cathy Suever","Good morning Nathan.","Nathan Jones","Tom, your total margin guidance has gone up about 30 basis points for the year, which would seem to have all been debate in the second quarter, can you talk about the margin guidance in the second half relative to where you were before and whether or not that there were some one-time things that might have helped the 2Q number or maybe you are just being conservative on the back half?","Tom Williams","Okay. Nathan, it\u2019s tom. So let me \u2013 I have got second half \u201817 to second half \u201816. All I have got, I got to compare it to the guide. I don\u2019t know if I have them.","Cathy Suever","Nathan, a lot of the beat we saw in the second quarter margins came from international. And as Tom described, a lot of that was driven by the performance in Asia Pacific. As we look at the guidance we are giving for the rest of the year, some of that gain shifts into North America doing better than we had previously thought. And that comes from the simplification efforts that we see coming through and the realignment and the lowering of fixed costs. On the other end, we are not promising as much from international as the currency headwind and just a little bit of doubt in what is going to happen with orders in Europe. We are being a little bit more conservative on the \u2013 for international.","Nathan Jones","Okay, that helps. And so you had also said 5 points of extra FX headwind relative to what you forecast before, that dollar-euro cross rate really hit the bottom probably at \u2013 as we crossed into the New Year, is at the currency rate you used and if we used 1.08 that it\u2019s at today, would that have a meaningful impact on where you had guided the overall Industrial International for the year?","Cathy Suever","Yes. Nathan, we are using 1.05 as we measure the second half. That\u2019s what we had as of the quarter ending December. So yes, 1.08 would have some impact, which we have not built in.","Nathan Jones","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then if I could just do one on CLARCOR, you have got the $140 million of cost-out targets. Is there anymore granularity you can give us to that in terms of what the main buckets are that, that $140 million goes into?","Tom Williams","Nathan, it\u2019s Tom. At this point, we are not going to give you that granularity, probably won\u2019t in the future either. Let me explain why. We will clearly give you visibility how we are tracking the $140 million, so we will give you progress updates to that number if we know that is important to all of our shareholders and to our analysts. However, the buckets and I can assure you we have very clear visibility as to what they are. However, there is some obvious sensitivity to our people and to our suppliers on how that might all play through, but we have very good granularity to that. And recognizing that as we start the integration related to full speed once we close, we are going to rely on the CLARCOR team who knows the business better than anybody to work side-by-side with us to help fine-tune what those buckets will be. But there is probably lot of reasons we won\u2019t disclose individual buckets, but we will clearly give you everybody an update on the $140 million as we go every quarter.","Nathan Jones","Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Tom Williams","Yes. Thank you, Nathan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","John Inch","Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Cathy Suever","Good morning, John.","John Inch","Good morning. You are competing with GE for below-the-line moving parts, so I don\u2019t know who is ahead, but I\u2019ll come back to you on that. So Ethan, on the last call prior to yours, talked about their inability to recapture price in the short-term given the rising ROS. Is that part of why we are being so conservative on the organic for the next couple of quarters even though you have obviously seen some leverage and some pretty good growths signs out of Asia? And if so is there a way to quantify that, Tom?","Lee Banks","John, it\u2019s Lee. First, from a cost price standpoint, we are still slightly positive on price. So it\u2019s something, if you followed us long enough, we try to really stay ahead of that. It\u2019s not a pricing environment we have seen in the past, but we are still slightly positive. And I would say, on the organic growth guide, we are just trying to be as realistic as possible. I mean, it\u2019s early days right now. So, we have kind of done this bottoms-up and with our regions and some of our key customers and that\u2019s what we are trying reflect here.","John Inch","Right. But I mean, but raw materials, specifically copper steel, etcetera have gone up a lot. So do you anticipate \u2013 to my question, do you anticipate in the next couple of quarters, just because of that impact, some negative spreads in the next couple of quarters that\u2019s baked into your guide or do you still think, Lee, you can sustain kind of the flattish, up slightly?","Lee Banks","I think we can sustain it. Where we have got heavy content, usually, we have contracts in place with our end customers where the pricing is adjusted because of the raw material increase and it\u2019s not a big portion of our business. But I think we all feel pretty comfortable about what we do internally to manage that.","John Inch","Okay. Can I ask you about sort of when the dust settles here, how are you feeling about incrementals in your businesses, given the win to and other actions that you have taken? I mean, it seems fairly clear volume is going to start at some point to grow again, not just because of compares, but it\u2019s actually really going to start to grow. At what cadence is the $64,000 question? But how are you guys thinking about future incrementals, call it, beyond \u201817 just what can Parker really be doing here?","Tom Williams","John, it\u2019s Tom. So I would think if you look at us traditionally, if you look at a cycle regardless how long that cycle typically was, when we first come out, there is a pretty sharp inflection, we might be greater than 30% MROS and we come down to 30% MROS. Then you start to glide down as you are deeper into an expansion more into the upper teens, I would just say that based on what we have been able to do and we will continue to work as we will continue to see improvements that you should see our margin return on sales be better than what we have historically done over that cycle. And we are still confident like we have been communicating that we are going to get the company to 17% segment operating margins in FY \u201820.","John Inch","Did anything \u2013 this is the last question, thanks for that, Tom, did anything actually get little worse in the quarter, forgetting about all the kind of moving parts of \u2013 or at least adjusting for all the moving parts of incrementals and other stuff? Did anything actually get a little worse could be geographic or customer end markets from the trend?","Tom Williams","John, it\u2019s Tom again. Nothing really got worse, but the only one that I would say was a pause was rail. Rail, in particular, in Asia as the China government really kind of took a pause in projects to reassess the activity there. But that\u2019s the only one that I would say took a pause. We expected automotive, automotive went slightly negative, but we expected that. So that would be about the only one I would call out.","John Inch","Got it. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning and nice quarter. I guess two questions, one for you, Tom, and then the other one for Lee. Tom, I feel like the story with Parker-Hannifin has been you guys have continued to surprise on the upside on the margin front even though the top line has been challenged. But I guess, as I look at the sales trends that we are seeing, you are increasing your organic growth. Was this all just sort of end market demand or you further had versus where you thought you would be in terms of you being able to outgrow your market? Are we starting to see any of those benefits? And then my second question, Lee, you noted two things when you were talking about sort of order trends. One, I think on the mobile equipment side, you have said like the preparedness to refresh or something. Can you just give more color on that and whether you have incorporated what they are telling you in your numbers or they haven\u2019t put that in their numbers yet? And then on the distributor side, I mean, it sounds like things are more positive there, but how are inventory levels at the distributor side? I am just wondering if they need to restock more or if they are still sort of being a little more conservative because we don\u2019t know if this trend is real.","Tom Williams","Okay, Jamie. It\u2019s Tom. I will start first as far as basically what you are asking our efforts to try to grow 150 basis points faster than the market, have we started to feel that yet. And I would say at this point, most of what we are seeing is end markets getting better, natural resource end markets becoming less of a drag, distribution moving to neutral, the PMIs trending positively across the world have all yielded better order entry patterns. However, that being said, when I look at the ones that are near-term on our list of organic growth actions, the focus we have had on international distribution and trying to convert competitive product, add distribution outlets, we have seen good traction on that. There is a lot of visibility into that across the company. And so I think that when we are starting to feel some of that, we have a very concerted effort on really just tracking opportunities across the world by account managers. We probably have our sales team better organized than we ever had around our global OEMs. We have updated our incentive plans, as all of you know, around the growth, a growth multiplier times a return on net assets. So I think all of those are starting to early traction, but I would say during the first inning of our margins to grow 150 basis points faster than the market. If we grow 3.3% in the second half, which is in our guidance, we will be growing faster than industrial production growth, so that will be our first indicator that, hey, what we are doing is starting to take hold. Now I will let Lee chime in.","Lee Banks","Yes, Jamie, you are going to have to remind me on the distribution question again. But on the preparedness question, so just dealing with some of our customers that have been suppressed for some time, we are starting to have conversations with us now looking forward. And it\u2019s mostly towards 2018 to be candid with you, just about being prepared because they do have an anticipation, there is going to be some growth here. So it seems to be \u2013 you will walk away with the sense that things have kind of plateaued, hit a bottom, and let\u2019s just talk about what\u2019s going to be happening going forward.","Jamie Cook","And was that fairly broad across the mobile equipment market or specific to one?","Lee Banks","Fairly broad.","Jamie Cook","Okay. And so the second question just on the distributor level, like, are they sitting there? Are your distributors sitting there with inventories that are low levels? Have they restocked yet? I am just trying to get a feel for...","Lee Banks","No, I would not characterize the channel as inventory heavy at all. And you know some of them that were tied to oil and gas did get stuck with some inventory. I would say, by and large, that\u2019s not 100% gone, but it\u2019s burned off quite a bit. So I don\u2019t consider the channel heavy at all.","Jamie Cook","Okay, thank you. I will get back in queue.","Lee Banks","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee Banks","Good morning Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","I want to come back to the margin execution, I think it plays a little bit of John\u2019s question, but very strong decrementals when revenues were declining. And you used the term incremental here today, but really, revenues aren\u2019t up so \u2013 to some degree the construct doesn\u2019t apply, right, so we are seeing a pretty nice step-up in margins without help from revenue this quarter, just wondering if you could give us a little bit of insight into what drove that kind of a combination of win execution, but perhaps there was some favorable mix going on. And again, it\u2019s really the question being that kind of getting comfort on that incremental trajectory once the revenues do in fact begin to go the other way?","Tom Williams","Yes. Jeffrey, it\u2019s Tom. Hopefully, you are \u2013 collectively everybody listening on the call starting to get more comfortable with that because we have demonstrated our ability to hold the decrementals for like seven quarters or eight quarters in a row and what you described is likely what happened. So we now have favorable growing margins, growing operating income with flat slightly declining sales. It\u2019s really a combination of things. We did do get some help last quarter with Asia growing like it did and leveraging that fixed cost structure that I talked about. Remember Asia, see most of our factories we invested in probably 7 years, 8 years ago and they are running the shift may be able over a shift, so any incremental volume that we put through there is nice utilization for us. But it\u2019s a combination of things. We have made very aggressive market adjustments when ordering went down in the last 2 years and we have been very focus on strategically reshaping the company through looking at revenue complexity, division consolidations, organization design, process redesign, just making the company easier, faster. And we are still in very early days at this. I think there is tremendous upside here, which is a big part of what\u2019s going to lift us to the 17% operating margin. So I can\u2019t pick one particular thing. I think we were smart several years ago to get ahead of this, what the restructuring we did and we have continued that. And we have layered on top of that the most strategic look at the company, looking at the SG&A for the company. Our fixed costs were down and so it\u2019s easier to convert when we have quarter entry showing positive volume increase.","Jeffrey Sprague","Very impressive. And just looking forward, how do you judge the balancing act between maybe stepping on the throttle on new product investment and the like as you do get a bit of revenue tailwind, do you feel as if you can clearly drive for those margin targets and step up to kind of the next level of investments to drive the top line?","Tom Williams","Yes, absolutely. I mean because part of why new products are a big part of two things; one, our organic growth as well as margin expansion because if you look at our profile of margins for new products, they are tend to be higher than the average margin for the company. So they will be incremental for both of that. There is a big focus on that across the company. We have got a dashboard that looks at what our new product vitality is and how we are doing. I think it\u2019s been somewhat camouflaged with the end market deterioration that we saw in the dramatic downturn of natural resources. But there is a lot of activity there and we are making investments from a corporate standpoint at the group level and division that\u2019s in there today. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 when we talk about growing faster than the market, that will be a big element of it.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Your line is now open. Eli, if your phone is on mute, please un-mute it.","Eli Lustgarten","Can you hear me now?","Cathy Suever","Yes. Good morning Eli.","Eli Lustgarten","I am sorry. Just a clarification and I apologize for asking, in the 7.30 for the year, so it looks like we had $0.38 in the quarter or $0.35 of what you would call sort of non-recurring earnings fees as a base for 2018, does it fare \u2013 the $0.21 and you have a foreign currency gain, is there anymore foreign currency gain expected, but I just want to say we use it as a base for fiscal \u201818, should we use in closer to $7, like two things out before looking at it and the same thing in tax rate, 27.5 would we go to a normalized tax rate before any politics of the 28.5% that we sort of expected for the year?","Cathy Suever","Yes. Eli, we have not forecasted any additional currency gains. We have flat for currency in terms of transactional gains or losses. And in terms of the prior question...","Eli Lustgarten","I mean you showed 35\u2026","Cathy Suever","Sorry, about the tax rate. We are getting a benefit this year from the new accounting rule related to stock options that get exercised at a gain. We have not forecasted for that going forward because we really can\u2019t predict who will exercise and that what gain. And so we have not built any of that in. So I would assume that the tax rate would not stay as low as the 27.5 that we are forecasting for this year. I would expect it to go back up.","Eli Lustgarten","And is it fair to say that about $0.35 or some number in that range is a non-recurring number as a basis because of the sale of the division and in foreign currency gain that we shouldn\u2019t use it as a base to forecast \u201818?","Cathy Suever","Yes, I think that\u2019s fair.","Eli Lustgarten","Okay. I just want to make sure and started looking at the organic numbers that you are starting to see, you have minus organic gains in North America, international, I understand, but you are looking at modest North American gains in the second half of this year into next year, what\u2019s on the low single-digit gains?","Tom Williams","Yes. Eli, we have got 0.5% for North America. Really, what we tried to mirror in this guide is what happened in Q2 on order entry and what we saw on January and North America came in flat and we are anticipating a little bit of upside there. Hence, we put 0.5% of organic and most of the upside we put organically was international based on that strong order entry we saw.","Eli Lustgarten","And just to tag on to that, are you hearing anything from your customers, there is a lot of \u2013 you hear a lot of talk, everybody is optimistic, but almost sort of being a little cautious in the first half of the year, which is the second half of the year, just because lots of optimistic for policy, but nothing happening when you see what happens, is that part of the conservatism that we are seeing from your customers and from you?","Tom Williams","Well, Eli, this is Tom. I think the way you describe it is probably fair. I mean I think until you see the policy discussions turning to policy, which turns into action, you can\u2019t tell. But we do our forecast and I don\u2019t want to say 6.7% international organic growth for the second half was conservative. I think that\u2019s a pretty good number. And we are just reflecting what we saw order entry so far and we will update it next quarter if we see something different, but so far so good on that.","Eli Lustgarten","I appreciate really talking about North America, I wasn\u2019t talking about international. Thank you very much.","Cathy Suever","Okay. Thanks Eli.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Joe Giordano","Hey guys, how are you doing?","Cathy Suever","Hi Joe.","Joe Giordano","I guess most of my thoughts have been answered, so I will shift over to Aerospace a little bit, I have to look back, but I don\u2019t remember you guys calling out widebody specifically over the last couple of quarters, is there anything specific, what are you seeing there and when did the bizjet comps start not working against you?","Cathy Suever","So I will start with the bizjet. I think part of the bizjet will come back when oil and gas comes back and there is just more demand for it. In terms of the widebody production, yes, we have just \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen the level of delivery requests for the 777 and the 747. And we really don\u2019t expect that coming forward until the 777x comes into production. So the widebody just does not come through at the demands that we had hoped.","Joe Giordano","So is it \u2013 like how do we reconcile that with like order entry, like what kind of \u2013 is like where we are now pretty good run rate you thinking into that for now?","Cathy Suever","Yes. We are expecting organic growth in the second half of a little over 3%. I would say, for the longer term, as Aerospace orders tend to be, we are looking at about a 3% organic growth over the next several years. We still, long-term expect as new planes come into entry into service that, that will continue to grow and our long-term production remains at about a 4% growth for Aerospace.","Joe Giordano","Okay. So your second quarter half production doesn\u2019t inherently assume any sort of change from the current outlook on bizjet order like what you just mentioned on 777 and 747?","Cathy Suever","Correct.","Joe Giordano","Okay. Thanks guys.","Cathy Suever","Okay. Thank you. And we will take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning. Thanks for letting me in.","Cathy Suever","Sure Josh, good morning.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Just a couple of questions, I guess first on oil and gas, it sounds like you are not seeing the turn yet, but what\u2019s the sort of the lead time you would normally expect from the pickup in rig count versus when you start to see the orders, acknowledging that distributor inventories are probably not overstocked anymore?","Tom Williams","Well, if we are starting to see some positives in North America, I mean obviously, there has been inventory that\u2019s burnt off. But if you look at the rig count year-over-year, it\u2019s on land based, it\u2019s up significantly from the low levels that it was. I would put lead times in the kind of that same 30-day, 60-day bucket on projects that are done and the way it\u2019s ordered. So it\u2019s fairly short cycle, if you would characterize it that way.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got it. So you could see an improvement more on the \u2013 further momentum this quarter?","Tom Williams","Sure.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Okay. And then just snapping volume, because I know that there was some initial volatility and what you guys thought you would have for financing costs on CLARCOR, what\u2019s the rate on that today, I think you started out at 100 and then maybe thought there could be some downside to that and how are we recalibrating that with the current markets?","Cathy Suever","Yes. Josh, we have been watching the interest rates very closely. We are still on the path of using about $1.5 billion of our cash available and $3 billion of new debt. That new debt will be a combination of short-term and long-term. As we are watching the rates, we do have the capability of use \u2013 pulling a bridge loan from Morgan Stanley and we also have plenty of room in our commercial paper. So we will watch the market and we will take an opportunistic opportunity to jump in, in both short-term and long-term debt when we see it best available for us.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","But there is no big delta as you see it today in those financing costs?","Cathy Suever","No, I think the $100 million that we told you earlier is still a good estimate.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Okay, Thanks a lot.","Cathy Suever","Okay, thank you. So this concludes our Q&A session and our earnings call for today. Thank you everybody for joining us. Robin and Ryan will be available throughout the day to take your calls should you have further questions. Thank you everybody and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"16938":["Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) Q1 2020 Results Earnings Conference Call October 31, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Cathy Suever - Chief Financial Officer","Tom Williams - Chairman and CEO","Lee Banks - President and COO","Conference Call Participants","Nathan Jones - Stifel","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Parker-Hannifin Corporation First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advise that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Cathy Suever, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, madam.","Cathy Suever","Thank you, Joule. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Parker-Hannifin\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks.","Today\u2019s presentation slides, together with the audio webcast replay, will be accessible on the company\u2019s investor information website at phstock.com for one year following today\u2019s call.","On slide number two, you will find the company\u2019s Safe Harbor disclosure statement, addressing forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning\u2019s materials and are also posted on Parker\u2019s website at phstock.com.","Today\u2019 agenda appears on slide number three. We will begin with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, providing highlights from the first quarter. Following Tom\u2019s comments, I will provide a review of the company\u2019s first quarter performance, together with the revised guidance for the full year fiscal 2020. Tom will then provide a few summary comments and we will open the call for a question-and-answer session.","Please refer now to slide number four and Tom will get us started.","Tom Williams","Thank you, Cathy, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to the call. We appreciate your interest in Parker. So let me start with the first quarter highlights and I am going to start like I normally do on safety.","We had 25% reduction in recordable safety incidents year-over-year, which is a great start to the year. When you look at it from a safety incident rate, so for those who aren\u2019t familiar with this, this is the number of safety incidents per 100 people. We came in at 0.46, which is the top quartile number, top quartile happens to be 0.5. So this is the first time in history of our company that we came in on the top quartile for incident rates. So we are very proud of that.","Safety for us is a core value and zero accidents is not an aspirational goal. It\u2019s really an expectation that we are going to operate the business and lead the business in such a way that we are going drive a zero accident culture.","And if you have seen, there\u2019s a linkage between safety and business performance, and you can see that if you look at our numbers over the last several years and plot its safety and our financial improvement, you will see they went hand in hand.","So switching to financial results, Q1 was a strong quarter on margins and on cash against a challenging macro environment on sales. Sales declined 4% and that composition was a minus 3 organic, minus 1.5 on currency and a plus 0.5 on acquisitions.","Total segment operating margin remained level at 17.0% reported. Adjusted segment operating margins increased 10 basis points to 17.3 basis points. On a reported basis, EBITDA margin increased to 70 basis points to 18.4 basis points, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points and reached 19.1%. So really when you look at it operating margin or EBITDA margin, really excellent performance at this part of the cycle. EPS reported was $2.60 and on an adjusted basis it was $2.76.","We had a very strong quarter on cash flow. Cash flow from operations came in at 13.5% of sales. We had a record as far as cash flow from operations in terms of dollars at $449 million and free cash flow was 12.0%, and when you look at free cash flow conversion that was 118%. So, really, really strong quarter on cash.","We had a number of exciting announcements in the quarter. We launched Win Strategy 3.0. So that\u2019s the third revision of the Win Strategy. This follows the second revision we did in 2015 and we launched a new purpose statement for the company and we closed the LORD and Exotic acquisitions. So we have been busy in the quarter.","And we are excited to welcome the LORD and Exotic team members to the Parker team. The joint integration teams have been working hard in preparation for the closings and they are hitting the ground running as we speak.","And you heard me talk about the acquisitions are transformational to Parker\u2019s portfolio, really strengthening engineered materials and aerospace with high growth, high margin businesses that will definitely be more resilient over the business cycle. Our global Parker teams are very energized by all these announcements between the Win Strategy, purpose and these acquisitions so we are excited about the future.","Now switching to the outlook, we advised guidance for FY \u201820, we have seen a market shift within the last 90 days as reflected in weekend order entry, primarily driven by macro conditions and trade certainties.","So when you look at total sales for Parker in FY \u201820 are expected to be flat year-over-year at the midpoint. With guidance now, these midpoint numbers at minus 6 organic, minus 1 for currency and plus 7 on acquisitions. Segment operating margin guidance is now at 15.2% as reported at the midpoint and the adjusted midpoint is now 16.3%.","I would just call your attention there\u2019s two important impacts on there, when you look at it from a partial year as the amortization of the two deals from a partial year standpoint for FY 2020, that impacts us by 70 basis points, when you look at it on a full 12 months, there\u2019s 100 basis points of deal amortization as a headwind on margins.","Business realignment expenses are expected to increase to $40 million. This is reflective of the current macro conditions. This was $20 million in the prior guide, and, of course, our guidance now includes LORD and Exotic Metals forming for the balance of the year. And we will go through discussing markets and the guidance assumptions in more detail during the Q&A.","So let\u2019s switch to cash flow and margin resilience. So, hopefully, you saw on the cash numbers in my comments just a moment ago, cash flow was very strong, record numbers. And then when you look at the operating and EBITDA margin performance and I am going to compare it to 2015 and 2016, so the last downturn we experienced and we will look at this legacy Parker without acquisitions. So it allows us to do an apples-to-apples comparison.","So FY \u201816, which would have been the worst year in that downturn on an adjusted operating margin was 14.8% and then FY \u201820 guidance is 16.6% the midpoint. So when you look at that delta, that\u2019s an improvement of 180 basis points.","On adjusted EBITDA FY \u201816 it was 14.7%. Our current guide at the midpoint is 18.2%. So that\u2019s a 350 basis point improvement. So, clearly, raising the floor on margins when you compare the 15%, 16% downturn to what we are experiencing now.","We fully anticipate to do double-digit cash flow from operations for the full fiscal year like we have been doing for the last 18 years and really this performance is driven by a combination of factors. The new Win Strategy, which we introduced in 2015 is propelling our performance. All the previous restructuring activities we have done, which has positioned us to be a more agile and lean operating company.","So let\u2019s move to slide five and talk about the future. We are very positive about the future and I think we are absolutely poised to generate nice earnings growth after we clear these near-term macro conditions.","A couple things influencing our confidence on the earnings potential, Win Strategy 3.0 and the purpose statement represents some important changes for the company, plus we have added two great businesses via these acquisitions. And actually in my view the timing of these acquisitions couldn\u2019t be any better during the soft part of the cycle there\u2019s clear advantages here.","We have the capacity to digest these much easier than when we were digesting CLARCOR we were trying to ramp-up the base business, as well as digest CLARCOR. And when you look at the timing, when you look at the integration teams hitting their stride, it\u2019s about the same time the markets will start to turn for us in approximately nine months and both of those factors will drive earnings growth as we look into the future.","We are going to be hosting an Investor Day March 12, 2020 in New York City and during that Investor Day we are going to showcase Win Strategy 3.0 and the purpose statement. So we will give you a lot more color on the key strategic changes for the future.","We are going to highlight all six operating groups and in the past we have highlighted one group and last time we highlighted three groups. So for the first ever we are going to give you insights to all six groups. You will see the entire company and we will go through the three last acquisitions, CLARCOR, LORD and Exotic.","So just a quick reminder, which is on this page as you see the winning format for Parker, our competitive differentiators the Win Strategy now 3.0, the third revision of that, which is our business system, you couple that with our decentralized divisional structure.","In my view, that\u2019s the best of both worlds. You got a certainly led business system that\u2019s deployed locally with that closeness to the P&L. The breadth of our portfolio and technology is very interconnected, strong intellectual property, long product life cycles, very balanced between OEM and aftermarket with the best distribution channel in the motion control space, low CapEx requirements to actually generate growth and productivity.","And all this equate -- ends up culminating in being able to generate a lot of cash and being able to deploy on the best we can for shareholders. So, we have a lot of confidence on our ability to achieve the FY \u201820 financial targets. I just want to thank all the global teams listening in for their hard work, their continued and dedicated effort.","And I will hand it back to Cathy for more details on the quarter and the guidance.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Tom. I\u2019d like you to now refer to slide number six. This slide presents as reported and adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $2.76, compared to $2.84 for the same quarter a year ago.","Adjustments from the fiscal year 2020 as reported results totaled $0.16, including before tax amounts of business realignment charges of $0.04, acquisition costs to achieve of $0.04 and acquisition transaction related expenses of $0.14, offset by the tax effective these adjustments of $0.06. Prior year first quarter earnings per share had been adjusted by $0.05. The details of which are included in the reconciliation tables for non-GAAP financial measures.","On slide seven, you will find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $2.84 for the first quarter of fiscal \u201819 to $2.76 for the first quarter of this year. We have benefited $0.02 per share in operating income from Exotic Metals Forming Company since closing on that acquisition September 16th. For Legacy Parker, a $166-million decline in sales contributed to a $0.15 reduction in operating income. The teams did a great job of controlling costs with lower volume by sustaining a 15% decremental margin for the quarter.","Incremental interest expense on the debt borrowed for the two acquisitions resulted in a $0.15 decline in the current earnings per share. Interest income from the pre-acquisition investments of that cash benefited the current quarter $0.09.","Lower other expense of $0.13 came from several one-time gains in the current year and by not repeating several one-time losses from last year. Lower corporate G&A contributed $0.01, while fewer favorable discreet tax benefits in current quarter resulted in a higher tax rate causing $0.12 of incremental tax expense. Finally, our lower share count benefited the quarter $0.09.","Slide eight shows total Parker sales and segment operating margin for the first quarter. Organic sales decreased year-over-year by negative 3.3%. Currency had a negative impact of minus 1.5%. These declines were partially offset by a positive impact of 0.6% from the September acquisition of Exotic.","Despite declining sales, total adjusted segment operating margin improved to 17.3% versus 17.2% last year. This 10-basis-point improvement reflects the operating costs improvements teams have been working hard on, combined with additional positive impacts from our Win Strategy initiatives.","On slide nine, we are showing the small benefit Exotic had on the first quarter FY \u201820 results post-close on September 16th. You can see they contributed $21 million in sales and $3 million in operating income on an adjusted basis during this brief stub period. Exotic results are included in the Aerospace Systems segment.","Moving to slide 10, I will discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the first quarter, North American organic sales were down 3.2%. Currency had a small impact on sales of negative 0.2%.","Even with lower sales, operating margin for the first quarter on an adjusted basis was an impressive 17.3% of sales versus 16.6% in the prior year. North America continued to deliver improved margins, which reflects the hard work dedicated to productivity improvements, as well as synergies from CLARCOR and the impact of our Win Strategy initiatives.","Moving to Diversified Industrial International segment on slide 11, organic sales for the first quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 8.7%, currency had a negative impact of minus 3.9%. Operating income for the first quarter on an adjusted basis was 15.9% of sales versus 17.0% in the prior year, a decremental margin of 25%. The teams continue to work on controlling costs during the more difficult drops in volume by utilizing tools of our Win Strategy initiatives.","I will now move to slide 12 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 8.2% for the first quarter as a result of growth in all of the platforms, with the strongest growth in Military OEM and the Commercial Aftermarket. In addition, the Aerospace segment sales increased $21 million or 3.7% from the addition of the Exotic acquisition.","Operating margin for the first quarter was 20% of sales versus 19.5% in the prior year, reflecting the impact of higher volume in all the platforms, lowered development costs and good progress on the Win Strategy initiatives.","On slide 13, we report cash flow from operating activities. Cash flow from operating activities was a first quarter record of $449 million or 13.5% of sales. This compares to 10.3% of sales for the same period last year after last year\u2019s number is adjusted for a $200 million discretionary pension contribution. That\u2019s a year-over-year increase of 25%. Free cash flow for the current quarter was 12% of sales and the conversion rate to net income was 118%.","Moving to slide 14, we show the details of order rates by segment. As a reminder, these orders results exclude acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average.","Continued declines in the industrial markets drove total orders to drop 2% for the quarter-end. This year-over-year decline is made up of a 6% decline from Diversified Industrial North America, 10% decline from Diversified Industrial International orders, offset by a very positive 22% increase from Aerospace Systems orders.","The full year earnings guidance for fiscal year 2020 is outlined on slide number 15. This guidance has been revised to align to current macro conditions, and now includes the impact of the LORD and Exotic acquisitions. Guidance is being provided on both an as-reported and an adjusted basis.","Total sales for the year with the help from acquisitions are now expected to remain flat compared to prior year. Anticipated full year organic change at the midpoint is a decline of 6%. Currency is expected to have a negative 1.1% impact on sales and acquisitions will add 7.4% to the current year.","We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended September 30, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the remaining quarters of this fiscal year.","For Total Parker, as reported, segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 15.0% and 15.5%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 16.0% and 16.25%. We have not adjusted for the incremental amortization of approximately $100 million, which we will incur for the remainder of this year as a result of the two acquisitions.","The full year effective tax rate is projected to be 23%. The first quarter tax rate was favorably impacted by discrete items which we don\u2019t forecast. We are anticipating a tax rate from continuing operations of 23.3% for quarters two through four.","For the full year, the guidance range for earnings per share on an as-reported basis is now $8.53 to $9.33 or $8.93 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is now $10.10 to $10.90 or $10.50 at the midpoint.","The adjustments to the as-reported forecast made in this guidance include business realignment expenses of approximately $40 million for the full year fiscal 2020, with the associated savings projected to be $15 million.","Synergy savings from CLARCOR are still estimated to achieve a run rate of $160 million by the end of fiscal 2020, which represents an incremental $35 million of year end savings. In addition, guidance on an adjusted basis excludes $27 million of integrated costs to achieve for LORD and Exotic and $200 million of onetime acquisition-related expenses. LORD and Exotic are expected to achieve synergy savings of $15 million this fiscal year. A reconciliation and further details of these adjustments can be found in the Appendix to this morning\u2019s slides.","Savings from all business realignment and acquisition costs to achieve are fully reflected in both the as reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges. We ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison.","Some additional key assumptions for full year 2020 guidance at the midpoint are a split first half, second half of 47%, 53% for all sales, adjusted segment operating income and adjusted EPS. All three we expect to be split 47%, 53%.","Second quarter fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $2.22 per share at the midpoint. This excludes $15 million of projected business realignment expenses and $167 million of acquisition related expenses and costs to achieve for both LORD and Exotic.","On slide 16, you will find a reconciliation of the major components of revised fiscal year \u201820 adjusted EPS guidance of $10.50 per share at the midpoint, compared to the prior guidance of $11.90 per share.","Starting with just the legacy business, a $0.10 per share beat in the first quarter is quickly going to be offset by the challenging macro conditions facing the rest of the fiscal year. A drop of nearly $800 million in forecasted sales at the midpoint is driving a decline of $1.44 in operating income for the rest of the year.","Interest expense in our previous guide included the interest on $2.3 billion of bonds we were holding for the acquisitions. Since then, we have borrowed additional term loans and commercial paper to complete those acquisitions. Now that both acquisitions are closed, we have allocated $0.72 of interest expense to the acquisitions, which includes the interest on the bonds, the term loans and the new commercial paper, causing a relief of $0.29 of interest expense within the Legacy business.","Also, in our previous guide, we had an assumption of earning $0.35 from interest income on the cash from the bonds. That cash has now been used for the acquisition so the other expense line, which includes interest income has been reduced going forward.","And finally, within the Legacy business, we are anticipating a slightly higher tax rate for the rest of the year, which will drop earnings per share $0.03, resulting in revised Legacy Parker adjusted guidance of $10.50.","Exotic is estimated to contribute $0.28 and LORD $0.44 to operating income for the year, inclusive of the additional combined $100 million amortization expense we will be incurring. Offsetting this will be the $0.72 of interest expense related to the debt for these acquisitions. All in, this leaves $10.50 consolidated adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint for our guide for fiscal 2020.","On slide 17, we show the impact the acquisitions will have on both an as reported and adjusted basis. On an adjusted basis, the acquisitions\u2019 lower operating margin to 16.3% for total Parker from 16.6% for Legacy Parker, impacted by $100 million of amortization expense.","For adjusted EBITDA margins, the acquisitions provide 50 basis points of improvement, moving from 18.2% for Legacy Parker to 18.7% for Total Parker. For those of you building forecast models, we have included more details regarding the LORD and Exotic impact on the total year guidance in the appendix.","You will now go to slide number 18. I will turn it back to Tom for summary comments.","Tom Williams","Thank you, Cathy. So we are very pleased with our progress. We are going to perform well with this downturn, as demonstrated by our cash flow performance and raising the floor on operating margins. And we are well on our way to being that top-quartile company we want to achieve and being best-in-class.","As just a reminder, where we are trying to drive to, we want to transform the company to achieve targets we have set out in FY \u201823 of growing organically 150 basis points greater than global industrial production growth, segment operating margins of 19%, EBITDA margins of 20%, free cash flow conversion greater than 100% and EPS CAGR over that time period of 10% plus. So again thanks to everybody all the global team members around the world for your hard work.","And with that, I will hand it over to Joule to start the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Cathy Suever","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones","Tom, it seems like you guys have taken maybe a bit more negative outlook going forward over the next three quarters here than some of your peers have. I think you mentioned you were planning on three more quarters of downturn here. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on in the end markets and your expectations around why you are thinking this downturn is as long as you guys have seemed to built into guidance here?","Tom Williams","Yeah. Nathan, it\u2019s Tom. And I am sure this is question top of mind for everybody. So let me -- I will start by going through kind of what was behind the guide, then I will finish with a summary of end markets.","So it starts first with our Q1 orders and you have seen that minus 2 total company, but in particular, minus 6 North America and minus 10 internationally. And then you got to look at other external indicators that are typically flow-through in our orders, three months to six months out.","Those things like the ISMs and the PMIs. So the U.S. ISM had 47.8 for September, that was a 10-year low as everybody knows. Europe\u2019s PMI of 45.7 for September, and of course, Germany, our third largest country at 41.7, obviously, feeling the impact of the trade related uncertainties. Asia PMIs are weak.","And so what we look, part of what influenced our forecast was the trend of orders through the quarter. So August and September were about the same, but they were weaker than July. And then as you look at October, while October\u2019s not done yet, we look at October on a daily basis, we saw further softening from that August and September rate. So put those factors into also our bottoms up latest look from the divisions and our view yielded a more challenging macro environment.","So I will give you -- I will peel back the organic piece a little bit more, and I will give you some of my thoughts as to why we did what we did. So you have seen organic at the midpoint at minus 6. So that composition is North America at minus 6, International at minus 11.5 and Aerospace at plus 4.5.","So the first half, second half organic is both minus 6, so minus 6 for first half, minus 6 for the next half. And so given that organic growth was minus 3 in Q1, that implies that our low point or the bottoming out of Parker is somewhere between Q2 and Q3 in this guidance.","And we also looked -- and you remember I talked about the pressure curves last time and we had baked about a 15-month duration. This now looks like it\u2019s an 18-month duration, a whole fiscal year, that\u2019s a difference versus the prior guide.","When we look at the four phases of growth that we have talked about in the past. We have got -- the markets are definitely moving through those phases. The largest phase is now in Phase 4, decelerating growth at 48%. That last quarter, that was at minus 10. So that\u2019s encouraging that you are starting to move through that. When we look at Phase 3, which is accelerating decline, that used to be 67% last quarter. Now it\u2019s 28%. So that\u2019s also an important point.","So that\u2019s -- all these things are signaling some kind of a bottoming for us about the midpoint of our FY \u201820, so maybe now just to kind of walk on the prior guide to the new guide. So the prior guide was minus 1.5 at the midpoint, again, I am talking about organic and the new guide\u2019s minus 6, so that\u2019s up 450-basis-point step down. Our order step down 200 basis points, again, I am focused on the industrial piece, where North America and international step down 200 basis points.","And then we had to try to project out those ISMs and PMIs I just described that are pretty negative and they are going to flow through on orders anywhere over the next couple of months to maybe a maximum of six months. And then, also, looking at the October orders that weekend from what you see in September.","So, that kind of made up the balance that you got 200 that\u2019s already declined with orders. The balance of 250 made up of that projecting those PMIs and ISMs into our future orders and what we saw in October. So that kind of gives you a walk down.","So maybe if I give you comments on the end markets for Q1. I will start with the positives. Aerospace continues to be very strong, lawn and turf, forestry and marine, and pretty much all the others are negative. So probably the best way for me to summarize the others is to take them into major buckets.","So distribution I recognize is not a market but it\u2019s an important channel for us. Distribution actually got a little bit better. I am talking about going from Q4 to Q1 year-over-year. It came in Q1 at about a minus 2. And in Q4, it was minus 2.5.","That composition, North America got better, Europe stayed about the same and Asia-Pacific got worse. The industrial end markets stayed relatively the same both were minus 9, minus 9 in Q4 and minus 9 in Q1.","And the mobile market is where we saw the step down. Mobile markets went from a minus 3 in Q4 to a minus 6. In particular, what stepped down in mobile was ag, construction, heavy-duty truck and material handling. So, that\u2019s a quick run through -- that\u2019s at the global level what I was describing as far as the end markets and what caused us to move the guidance like we did.","Nathan Jones","I appreciate the transparency and the color there. Just moving away from things that are happening in the short-term here, I am sure there will be plenty of questions for that on you. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about what\u2019s changed in the Win Strategy 3.0 from Win Strategy 2.0?","Tom Williams","Yeah. And I\u2019d be happy to do that, because that\u2019s going be very exciting for the company. And obviously, when we have you all together, we will go through this in a lot more detail, but if I would just paraphrase the key points, so underneath engagement, going to continue to expand the whole ownership concept with the idea that the more people we have thinking and acting like an owner the better the company\u2019s going to perform.","But a big change on people is Kaizen and we will take you through all the things we are doing on Kaizen as far as our approach to it, who we are working with and the results we are seeing. Under customer experiences, a lot more emphasis on digital leadership, and we will expand what we mean by that ad a new metric, which is not too dissimilar to what we had before, but we have a new metric called composite likelihood recommend, which is going to be a mixture of on-time delivery and feedback from customers and distributors.","Earnings and profitable growth, we have this new strategic initiative called strategic positioning, which we will give you more color on. New product blueprinting underneath innovation and two new metrics for innovation, product vitality and mix and gross margin for the product vitality and we will explain more about that when we are in person.","And then underneath simplification, a very new powerful concept called simplified design, where we focus on simplifying the design of our products to reduce the building material complexity, the inventory and planning and scheduling complexity, and the ability to produce it, recognizing about 70% of our product costs are tied up in how we design it.","So we will talk a lot more about that when we have you all there. We will be somewhat careful on simple by design, because I don\u2019t want to teach my competitors how to do that, but we will give you enough color since you all know that it\u2019s real and there\u2019s some big enhancements to the company both on a growth and a margin standpoint.","Nathan Jones","I appreciate all the color and all the transparency there. I will pass it on. Thanks very much.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Nathan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ann Duignan","Hi. Good morning. I am not sure if there were any questions left after all of that color. You gave us global end markets, industrial versus mobile, would you mind breaking those up by region, please, or any notable differences across the major markets that have decline ag, construction, heavy duty, material and handling?","Tom Williams","Yeah. Ann, this is Tom. So I will give you the high points by region. So North America was about 3% organic decline, on the positive side was machine tools, heavy duty truck, forestry and lawn and turf, flat was distribution on automotive. And then on the negative side, we had low single digits was mining, telecom and life sciences, mid single-digit decline, these are all declines, refrigeration, mills and foundries and tires.","And then switching to the mobile markets, mid single-digit declines was construction and marine and mid-teen declines was ag, material handling and rail. So, again, I had mentioned that distribution fared better North America than any of the other regions as far as how it performed.","Then in Europe came in about a minus 7 for the quarter. On the positive side was refrigeration, power, semicon, life science and oil and gas. And then on the negative side, starting with the industrial end markets we had a couple that were greater than 20%, mills and foundries, machine tools, obviously, Europe being more export sensitive feeling the impact of trade uncertainties. Those are very trade-centric type of end markets.","Mid-teen declines was mining, tire and rubber, distribution came in around minus 4.5 about the same as it was versus prior period. And mobile, we had low single digit declines in construction and ag and about 10% in heavy duty truck and auto. So, actually mobile fared okay in Europe and the industrial markets suffered worse in Europe.","And then in Asia on the positive side, Asia came in a 12% decline for Q1 and on the positive side were oil and gas, mining and marine, although, declines distribution was down about 5.5 and on the industrial space, we had about mid-teen declines out of mills, refrigeration, machine tools greater than 20 on some of those big secular end markets like powergen, semicon and, of course, telecom being somewhat impacted by the Huawei challenges.","And then on the mobile side is where we saw some of the steepest declines greater than 20 in construction, ag, material handling and rail. So you can see that mobile feeling the worst in Asia-Pacific. So that\u2019s quick spin to the regions.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And then just as a follow up, I think you have already answered this, but are you seeing any signs of, I hate to use the word we use every time coming up, but any green shoots anywhere?","Tom Williams","Well, what has been nice is that distribution got a little bit better. So we like that the fact that that went into Phase 4 and we had a number of other things moving into Phase 4, automotive and life sciences and oil and gas. So and actually powergen and semicon, even though they are down mid-teens for us, the fact they went into Phase 4, I always like when things move into Phase 4 because guess what the next phase is, accelerating growth. So that\u2019s encouraging.","And we still had the ones that were strong and continue to be strong like aerospace, lawn and turf, we are seeing some seasonal help there and forestry with all the paper related goods tied to e-commerce has continued to be strong.","So those are what I would say as indicators. Again, for us it\u2019s -- what we are signaling with this guidance is a bottom forming for us. I can\u2019t call it bottom for anybody else but a bottom for us is somewhere in the middle of our fiscal year.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I will leave it there in the interest of time. I will get back in queue. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Tiss of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joel Tiss","Hi. How\u2019s it going?","Cathy Suever","Hi Joel.","Joel Tiss","I just wonder on the last discussion and super duper color there. Can you just give us any sense of how you take -- it feels like things are a little worse now or maybe in the next couple of months\u2019 future, because of inventory reductions. How do you take the amplification of that in the near-term out of your forward guidance, I am just curious how to think about that.","Tom Williams","Yeah. Joel, it\u2019s Tom again. So the destocking it\u2019s always a tough question. But the one area where we do have good data on is North America distribution and you have heard both Lee and I talk about this in the past that it\u2019s been the destocking has been improving by about 100 bps and that\u2019s actually what happened again. So to refresh people\u2019s memory in Q3 of 2019 it was down 300 bps of destocking, Q4 was 200 bps and now Q1 was 100 bps.","So we had guided to that we felt distribution was going to at least North America was going to get into somewhat of equilibrium at the end of the calendar year, so the end of Q2. But we clearly are seeing destocking at the OEMs, especially the mobile OEM\u2019s destocking and how long that takes to play it through is very difficult, because we don\u2019t have the kind of visibility into that that we have with the U.S. distribution. But what we are guiding is very hard to split end-market demand versus destocking, what we gave you is kind of our view all-in of this impact.","Joel Tiss","And then just like a strategic question and not so much thinking about a forecast, just thinking about how do we think about Parker\u2019s earnings resiliency going forward, like beyond the obvious, okay? Aerospace is a bigger part of the company, but like some of the ways that you guys think about it, if that could help us? Thank you.","Tom Williams","Yeah. Joel, Tom. That\u2019s a good question and I am actually glad that you asked it. Because we have been working very hard at this, as you might imagine and there\u2019s a number of factors. First, it would start with some of the portfolio moves that we have made over the last number of years. CLARCOR, LORD and Exotics, so let me give you some for instances.","So when we look at our order entry without getting into things that I don\u2019t want to disclose publicly, our filtration platform is holding up much better than the rest of the industrial platform and that was by design, with CLARCOR, with the density in aftermarket. So that is -- it\u2019s living up to its billing and what we had hoped for.","LORD is coming in that -- with about a 4% organic growth and that compares to what we just told you or guiding to a minus 6 for Parker. And Exotics\u2019s growth is coming in around 11% and so that\u2019s better than Parker and better than Parker Aerospace. So you have got some portfolio things that are -- that we are doing that drives resilience and enhance organic growth.","And then you have heard us talk about what we have been doing on distribution, growing international distribution in particular and we have changed that mix from one, we started with Win Strategy 2.0. We were at 35% international mix and distribution and now it\u2019s 40%. So that doesn\u2019t seem like a lot. But moving that number, 100 bps a year, is meaningful, that enhances margins and it provides more resilience, again, because our channel there is servicing primarily aftermarket.","We are doing a lot of things on innovation, which will give you a lot more color with 3.0 when we see it all in March. But the new product blueprinting, product vitality and mix, our gross margin that we are tracking on these products are all designed, because if you look at our innovation growth, it is growing faster than the base business. So it\u2019s going to hold up better in a downturn.","The things we are trying to do to drive customer experience are really important because you can\u2019t really grow with a customer if you don\u2019t give them a good experience. And then all the things we have been doing operating-wise, simplification, lien, supply chain, et cetera and now Kaizen to make the company more agile and just a better operating company. So those would be the things that I would say on the topline and then just from operating standpoint, how we are going to get to those FY \u201823 targets.","Joel Tiss","Great. Thank you very much.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Joel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning. I guess just a couple questions. I guess the first one, just understanding the guide. The international -- or the implied international adjusted margins I guess fall off a little more than I would have expected in the remaining nine months of the year. Understanding there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. But is there any way you can sort of help me -- help us with what the puts and takes are there besides increasing amort? And then, just obviously the cash flow in the quarter was very strong and as we are in sort of a slowdown here, leverage becomes more topical. So just, Tom, how we should think about cash flow for 2020, whether there\u2019s any structural improvements we should be looking for. Thank you.","Tom Williams","So, Jamie, let me start. I will have Cathy add on as far as debt and maybe comment on cash flow. One thing I want to try to make sure everybody understands. This new guide has got still some really good decremental margins in it and we have always -- if you benchmark companies, which I know you all do this, a minus 30 decremental is still best-in-class decremental. So I am just going to read to you total decrementals for the company, Q2 through the rest of the year.","So Q2 -- and these are approximate, these are at the midpoint, there\u2019s going be a range around these numbers, 27% decremental, Q3 a 28% decremental, Q4 a 23% decremental. So we end up with a full year of about a 25% decremental. So, those are really, I think, very excellent performance given that if you look at industrial, it\u2019s going to be down minus 6 North America and minus 11.5 on international.","That\u2019s why international\u2019s is a little bit worse. On its decrementals, North America is coming in around 24 and internationals at 29. And it\u2019s because it\u2019s about a 2x difference on volume and so that\u2019s creating a lot more challenges.","And then, in addition to the volume side, international has currency, which we have always struggled to identify currency impact on financials and we have -- we basically decided not to try to figure -- to try to communicate that because you can\u2019t get a consistent number with it. But we do all know that when currency becomes a headwind to us, it becomes a pressure point on margins. So that\u2019s another factor for international.","On cash flow, I will hand it over to Cathy. I would just - I would have shareholders rest assured that that 18 years of 10% plus CFOA is going to turn into 19 years, because we have got a proven track record of being able to work with working capital.","And these operating margins, like you heard me talk about in the opening comments are 180 basis points better than our last downturn. So we have better operating margins and we will work the working capital like we normally do. Cathy, have you got anything to add on.","Cathy Suever","Yeah. Jamie, we finished quarter end at a leveraged gross debt-to-EBITDA of 3.6. We did bring in a small amount of additional debt in the form of term loan when we -- to be ready to -- to close LORD this past week and so it\u2019s going to go up slightly. But if you look historically, we do have a great track record of managing the working capital very well during a down cycle.","So, we are pretty confident. In addition to that, both LORD and Exotic have a history of very strong cash flow stronger than Parker, so they will be great contributors to it. And we are confident we would be at a level that we have - that we were with CLARCOR when we closed that deal and we brought that down very quickly and we feel that we can do the same, even though we are seeing things slowdown Also keep in mind, we do carry about $1 billion of international cash, so our net debt-to-EBITDA was actually 2.1 at the end of the quarter.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color.","Cathy Suever","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Raso","Hi. Thank you. Just looking at the organic growth first half, second half, obviously, the second half, a big change from used to be up 1 to negative 6 now. Can you take us through your thoughts on how you see orders playing out underneath that decline? I mean, it seems like the second quarter, you are expecting the biggest organic decline, but the second half is still pretty healthy at down 6. I mean, healthy meaning a large decline. So, I am just trying to get a sense of how you are viewing the order patterns underneath that negative 6 in fiscal second half?","Tom Williams","Yeah. David, it\u2019s Tom. And that\u2019s where the forecast gets far more challenging the he further that you go out. But really we are trying to project some of those macro indicators that I mentioned in my comments. U.S. ISM, Germany\u2019s number, Asia\u2019s PMI, rest of Europe PMI\u2019s, et cetera, recognizing as we plotted those historically, they tend to lag and impact our orders three to six months out.","So we know what we saw weakening in October, which that\u2019s going to influence Q2 and then, these other macro indicators three to six months out, starts to impact the second half and so that was the thought process behind that.","But it does become more challenging as we try to figure that out, because our backlog doesn\u2019t carry us outside of Aerospace. It doesn\u2019t carry us out that far, so we had to kind of look at historical trends and lagging periods between these macro indicators of what we do.","David Raso","Yeah. I am just trying to think how you thought about managing your own inventory through the end of the year and that interplay between, okay, the second half\u2019s a lot weaker than what we thought, but we do see some bottoming process and that\u2019s how we are managing, be it not even just inventory but how you are thinking about pricing. That usually gets announced January 1st and so forth. I mean, is it fair to say at this stage you are not thinking of the orders improving much in the back half fiscally and just the comps get a lot easier. So, I think for a lot of people seeing the cut through the organic is obviously not pleasant. But if you felt the orders were improving in the back half to some degree, you can call it temporary. So what you are speaking to the businesses is it\u2019s kind of a temporary macro environment. I know it\u2019s hard to call. I was curious if you had some sense of where you are headed and how you are managing the company for that fiscal second half. It doesn\u2019t sound like you are planning for orders to be say, up in the latter part of the year, is that a fair assessment in how you are trying to manage?","Tom Williams","Yes. David, I think that\u2019s fair. We would project that orders would continue to be weak because our orders, organic growth in orders are typically within a month or two of each other when you plot it historically.","So for us on inventory, inventory is never good. It\u2019s always it\u2019s a waste when you are running a lean operation. So we are continuously whether we have volume going up or volume going down we are looking to optimize inventory period all the time and the kinds of efforts that we are doing in unity with our Parker lean process we will continue to look work at managing inventories down.","Now obviously when orders go down, you need to update all your planning tools. You plan for every part, which is part of our lean system, so we are doing that. And then on pricing, I will let Lee comment on pricing with what we are doing with that.","Lee Banks","Well, David, maybe I will put price and costs together. I would say costs inputs, it\u2019s a mixed bag, there\u2019s some going down, some going up. But from a price cost standpoint, as always, we just try to stay margin neutral and that\u2019s what we are planning going forward.","David Raso","Okay. And just to make sure just to wrap up here, the first quarter organic was in line with your expectations maybe 20 bps even better. I actually thought the orders weren\u2019t even that bad in the first quarter relative to some of the fears out there. But then, obviously, you took a big chunk out of the rest of the year on organic sales and even your thoughts on orders. So the surprise I guess must have really been this last month that you really thought to see at least some beginning of bottoming process. So is that fair, it\u2019s really been the last month that really drove the change in the guide.","Tom Williams","David, it\u2019s Tom again. So there\u2019s two things, you are right, October, but then also the sequencing we saw within the quarter. The fact that August and September got worse from July. So we were starting to see a weakening through the quarter then another step down in October. That\u2019s why we have changed the guide.","David Raso","All right. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Cathy Suever","Yeah. Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Andrew Obin","Yeah. Hi. Good morning.","Cathy Suever","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on cash flow and it\u2019s not more a question but a lot of companies that do deals have shifted to reporting sort of cash earnings, given a massive discrepancy between your cash flow generation and reported earnings. Have you guys considered moving to reporting cash numbers and what has the feedback been from your investors?","Tom Williams","Yeah. Andrew, it\u2019s Tom. It\u2019s good question. We have thought about it and we have reached out to shareholders and it\u2019s been pretty uniform from shareholder feedback saying don\u2019t make that change. I continue to obviously we will adjust for a onetime cost and the things that we would normally be doing but other than that, continue to report on a GAAP basis.","And if you think about it, just it creates a more, a bigger hurdle that business needs to absorb to generate returns on behalf of the shareholders and I think that was the feedback I heard from shareholders is we want you to incorporate that bigger challenge into how you run the place. But it\u2019s a good comment, I know there have been good companies that have made that change, at this point we have elected to stay with what we have been doing.","Andrew Obin","Thank you. And then just a question, as your numbers have decelerated, what has the feedback been from LORD and Exotic, what have they experienced relative to expectations when you announced the deals?","Tom Williams","Yeah. So, Andrew, it\u2019s Tom again. So actually they have held up really nicely. LORD and the outlook that we have just given you is coming in at about a 4% organic growth and we had in our model, about 5.5%. That\u2019s what I was verbally said during the announcement that was kind of our five-year CAGR.","So if you think of everything that\u2019s going on that\u2019s changed from when we made that announcement to today, that\u2019s pretty good. And again, that 4% positive compares to minus 6% for Parker. That\u2019s why we like LORD so much. It\u2019s why we bought them. It\u2019s accretive from a growth standpoint.","And then when you look at Exotic, Exotic\u2019s coming in at a little over 11.5. we -- in our model that we built for the DCF, we had about a 7.5% CAGR, so that\u2019s held up nicely. I would say two things, A, little better F-35 sales and we modeled a more conservative 737 Max. We have modeled Exotic going down to 42, but Boeing has not done that yet with Exotic and probably won\u2019t because Exotic with its long lead time for materials.","When you look at what Boeing\u2019s done with their management supply chain, the rest of Parker Aerospace, for the most part, at 42, but as they have managed long lead time type of suppliers, Exotic being one of those, they have kept them at 52 because of obvious reasons. You can\u2019t ramp back up with that kind of long lead time. So that\u2019s part of why they have overproduced on the revenue.","So in a nutshell, both acquisitions holding up on revenue, both acquisitions coming in at the EBITDA level that we expected to actually LORD slightly better on EBITDA, margins because we have pulled in the $15 million that Cathy referred to in her comments as the synergies for LORD, we are able to pull them a little bit earlier than we thought.","Andrew Obin","And if I may squeeze just one in, auto exposure with LORD, you did comment that auto is bottoming, was that referring to sort of the old Parker exposure or was that referring to LORD\u2019s exposure as well, and that will be it for me. Thank you.","Tom Williams","That was total Parker. We haven\u2019t -- that was based on Q1 so we didn\u2019t have LORD in Q1. But their auto has held up better than our auto has, so pretty comparable.","Andrew Obin","Thank you.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andy Casey","Thanks a lot. I just wanted to go back to the decrementals that you talked about, Tom. Were those all in including the acquisitions over those Parker Legacy?","Tom Williams","Parker legacy without the acquisitions and they are trying to do it with the acquisitions as apples and oranges, acquisitions are not in the prior period. We have got the $100 million of intangible amortization. So the MROS is when you look at it all-in versus prior basically nonsensical, you can\u2019t really read anything into it, which is why I gave you the ones without it.","Andy Casey","Okay. Okay. Appreciate that. And then, basically over the long-term, you had talked about 30% incrementals. The decrementals you gave were lower than that, which is good. When you embed the two new acquisitions that seem to be a little bit similar to CLARCOR, a little bit more resilient, would the downside over the long-term relative to the mid to high 20% decremental that you gave kind of even shrink further?","Tom Williams","Well, I think, there is definitely that potential, because to your point they will be more resilient. Their higher margins as well. So they should help us with that. And we are going to work to make them even better than they are today. The whole goal of these is to take the best of what we do and the best and of course, we is not all of us and the best of what the acquisitions had and to make it even better.","So I still think, again, for purposes of bottling, I don\u2019t want to get too far over my skis, I would just encourage you to continue to use the plus or minus 30 as still best-in-class, and of course, our goal is we try to do better than that.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you very much.","Cathy Suever","Okay. Thanks, Andy. Joule , I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning. Hey. Just two from me, if you don\u2019t mind, just first back on the acquisitions. At the time they were announced, I thought LORD\u2019s run rate sales were about $1.1 billion and Exotic was about $450 million. And when I look at what you laid out here, it looks like they are both actually kind of on an annualized basis tracking flattish, is there something in timing or do I have this basis wrong?","Tom Williams","Jeff, it\u2019s Tom. I think the main thing would have -- when we gave it, it was based on calendar year over calendar year. Now these numbers are FY in Parker\u2019s fiscal year, so the prior periods are not comparable.","Jeff Sprague","Those growth rates you gave us though, Tom, were for the year in your plan or just in the quarter, those organic\u2026","Tom Williams","Yeah. The growth rates I gave, Jeff, are for our FY \u201820. So it would be comparing the period of time they are in part of Parker in our FY \u201820 and then using the same Parker fiscal year at FY \u201819 for them to go back and kind of reconstitute that, the two acquisitions.","Jeff Sprague","Then just one other question on incrementals, if you don\u2019t mind, and perhaps, it goes to the FX point you were making, Tom, but the decline in the 6% organic growth sales decline is about $650 million in sales, I think, Cathy said $800 million, if I think about it on a core basis, and $1.44 of EPS would gross-up to about $230 million. So that\u2019s a 35% decremental on the core business, if I think about it relative to the walk that you gave us where you showed Legacy Parker versus deals, am I missing something there, or is it FX?","Cathy Suever","Yeah. Jeff, it\u2019s the FX differential, so the number I quoted was top-line total drop that we had in our guidance for the second, third and fourth quarters. And when you are quoting organic, you are probably correct that it\u2019s closer to $600 million.","Jeff Sprague","Okay. Great. Thank you for that color.","Cathy Suever","Okay. Thank you. All right. This concludes our Q&A and our earnings call. Thanks everyone -- thank you to everyone for joining us today. Robin and Jeff will be available throughout the day to take your calls should you have any further questions. Everyone have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"16742":["Parker-Hannifin Corp.

Fiscal 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Chief Financial Officer, Jon Marten. Please go ahead, sir.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Abigail, and good morning to everyone, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's second quarter FY 2016 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks.","Today's presentation slides together with the audio webcast replay will be accessible on the company's Investor Information website at phstock.com for one year following today's call.","On slide number two, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and are posted on Parker's website at phstock.com.","On slide number three for the agenda, to begin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, will provide highlights for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Following Tom's comments, I will provide a review of the company's second quarter FY 2016 performance together with the revised guidance for FY 2016. Tom will provide a few summary comments, and then we'll open the call for a Q&A session.","At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slide number four.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation today. To start, let me make a few summary comments.","It continues to be a very tough environment in many of our end markets and regions. We have responded decisively to adjust to these conditions and delivered impressive margin return on sales. We have tightened control of discretionary spending, reduced employment levels across all regions in our company and implemented reduced work schedules where necessary. This is in addition to the previously announced actions we have underway to restructure our fixed costs and simplification efforts designed to streamline our operations. On both of those fronts, we made excellent progress in the second quarter.","Given the current headwinds, we are very pleased with the way our teams have responded, as evidenced by the strong margin performance and our ability to control decremental margin on return on sales for the past three quarters. We expect strong decremental margin return on sales to continue through our fiscal year-end.","Moving on to specifics for the second quarter, sales declined 14% as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by approximately 4% and organic sales declined 10%, reflecting end market weakness.","Total order rates for the second quarter declined 12% compared with the same quarter last year. Despite this downturn, I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 12.2% or 13.5% on an adjusted basis.","During the second quarter, we delivered decremental margin return on sales of 17.2% adjusted, which represents excellent performance in this current business climate. This is really a testament to the way we are fundamentally changing Parker's operating structure.","In previous downturns, in which we've experienced such a significant reduction in sales volume, we would not have been able to maintain such strong margin performance. The primary drivers of our margin performance include: savings from restructuring we have done in prior periods; immediate and decisive actions on cost containment; and the benefits of a range of simplification initiatives that we have implemented.","Regarding simplification, we have announced a total of 28 division consolidations. We continue to review our organization and process to reduce overhead costs and simplify processes. This has also helped us to reduce corporate G&A costs.","Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33 or $1.52 adjusted for business realignment expenses. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 9.8%.","During the second quarter, we repurchased $90 million in Parker shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $400 million. We have now repurchased $1.74 billion under our previously announced $2 billion to $3 billion Parker share repurchase plan over two years, which began in October 2014.","Moving on to the discussion on key market trends, as projected in the second quarter, we saw continued pressure on natural resource markets, such as oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, as the prices of commodities continued to move lower. Our distribution channel remained affected by these markets, particularly those with exposure to oil and gas.","We continued to experience general industrial activity weakening due to the knock-on effect from natural resource markets. These challenging markets outweighed positive growth in other markets such as power generation, air conditioning, lawn and turf, rail, and heavy-duty truck.","In summary, our second quarter sales were in line with our October guidance. And Lee will provide some more color on our end markets in the Q&A portion of the call.","Now switching to our outlook; for fiscal year 2016, we are narrowing the range of our guidance for earnings to $5.90 to $6.30 per share on an adjusted basis, which maintains the earnings midpoint of $6.10 per share. It also means that our implied guidance for the second-half of the fiscal year has been adjusted downward for sales and earnings to reflect weaker order entry levels that we experienced in the second quarter.","We will continue to aggressively manage costs in this challenging environment. Our primary focus will be on maintaining strong decremental margin performance and positioning Parker to weather this downturn and emerge stronger as conditions improve. We are also continuing with actions to execute the many growth opportunities we have identified under the new Win Strategy.","So just to reinforce, our long-term financial objectives to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2020 are: targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production; we're also targeting 17% segment operating margins; and progress towards these goals is expected to deliver a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period.","We are excited about opportunities we have to position Parker as a top quartile company, compared with our proxy peers. Growth initiatives are underway to further expand our distribution network, commercialize new products and systems, improve the customer experience, expand our service offerings, and to leverage e-Business and Internet of Things capabilities.","During the second quarter, we developed a comprehensive long-term plan to accelerate our e-Business capabilities. We see opportunity to leverage our distribution channel as part of our strategy, grow our business and create a better customer experience. Parker's Internet of Things initiative gained significant momentum in the quarter. We hosted a global Connectathon that garnered dozens of rich Internet of Things application ideas.","In summary, execution of the new Win Strategy is expected to deliver top quartile performance versus our proxy peers. So for now, I'll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Tom.","And at this time, please refer to slide number five. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.33 versus $1.80 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.19 and compares to $0.04 for the same quarter last year.","On slide number six, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.84 for the second quarter FY 2015 to $1.52 for the second quarter of this year. The impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.11 per share.","Increases to adjusted per-share income include lower corporate G&A expense equating to $0.11 due to reduction in long-term incentive accruals as well as our simplification efforts, as Tom mentioned. A reduced tax rate for the quarter contributed $0.02, driven by the passage of the U.S. extenders from which the company recognized R&D credit.","Reductions to adjusted per-share income include lower adjusted segment operating income of $0.39 per share due to the impact of foreign currency and the continued weakening of end market demand and increased interest and other expense that totaled $0.18 per share as compared to the prior year in which various one-time favorable adjustments were recognized.","Moving to slide number seven, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter, total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 9.6% over the same quarter last year; there was a modest 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than plan, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $139 million or 4.4% in the quarter.","Total company segment operating margins for the second quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 13.5% versus 14% for the same quarter last year. Restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were $35 million versus $9 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $366 million versus $439 million last year reflects the impact of reduced volume and unfavorable mix from the continued weakening of several industrial end markets.","Moving to slide number eight, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the second quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 15.2% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact in currency of 1.3% in the quarter.","Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15% of sales versus 16.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred totaled $20 million as compared to a nominal spend in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $174 million as compared to $227 million, driven by reduced volume as a result of softening trends in key end markets.","I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on slide number nine. Organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 7.1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 10%.","Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 11% of sales versus 12.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $14 million as compared to $9 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $109 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of the foreign currencies as well as weaker end markets.","I'll now move to slide number 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased nominally at 0.7% for the second quarter. Currency posed a modest negative impact of about 0.4%. Sales for the period were maintained as a result of higher aftermarket sales volume, which offset modest year-over-year declines in OEM sales.","Operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 14.8% of sales versus 12% in the prior year. Nominal realignment expenses were incurred for the period, adjusted operating income was $82 million as compared to $67 million, reflecting the favorable mix of higher aftermarket sales volume this quarter combined with reduced development costs as a percentage of sales.","Moving to slide number 11, with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency.","The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders were a negative 12% for the quarter-end, reflecting the further softening of the Industrial's segments stemming from natural resource related end markets, as Tom mentioned.","Diversified Industrial North American orders decreased to negative 15%. Diversified Industrial International orders decreased to negative 10% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders improved to a negative 11% for the quarter, which continues to be impacted by lumpy prior-year comparables.","On slide number 12, we report cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $347 million, but when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was 9.8% of sales. This compares to 8.4% of sales for the same period last year.","In addition to the pension contribution, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $572 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $172 million. $68 million was expended for acquisitions closed during the first quarter. No acquisitions were announced in the second quarter, and we have $75 million for CapEx equating to approximately 1.4% of sales year-to-date.","Slide number 13, provides for FY 2016 guidance as outlined. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $100 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2016. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 12.6% to negative 9.3% or negative 9.9% at the midpoint as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is negative 7.9%.","Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 3.4%, which is nearly all attributable to the International Industrial segment. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of December 31, 2015, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the balance of FY 2016.","For total Parker, adjustment segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.4% and 14.6%. This compares to 14.9% for FY 2015 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins, given the magnitude of the end market softness and order decline. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and our category other is $484 million for the year at the midpoint. Our full-year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full-year guidance is 137.1 million shares.","For the full-year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is $5.90 to $6.30, or $6.10 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $100 million to be incurred in FY 2016. Savings from these business realignment initiatives continue to be projected in the amount of $70 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins.","Some additional key assumptions for full-year 2016 guidance are: sales are divided 49%, first-half, 51% second-half; adjustment segment operating income is divided 49% first-half, 51% second-half; adjusted EPS is $3.04 in the first-half and $3.06 in the second-half; Q3 FY 2016 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.40 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.17 of business realignment expenses.","On slide number 14, you'll find the reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.10 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS guidance. Increases include $0.12 from reduced tax rate, $0.13 from reduced corporate G&A, interest, and other, and $0.05 from fewer shares outstanding. This is fully offset by a decrease of $0.30 reduction in segment operating income, reflecting further reduced volume and unfavorable mix forecasted within key industrial end markets.","Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions or divestitures that might be closed during FY 2016. For consistency, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates.","This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jon. We expect the difficult environment to continue through the rest of our fiscal year. As our margins here today indicate, we are responding well. We are making meaningful progress with our restructuring initiatives, which remain on track for the year. We also continue to find opportunities to streamline operations through our simplification initiatives.","I am very encouraged by the response of our partner team members. It has been just about one year since Lee and I took full responsibility for the company. It's certainly been a challenging year from a market perspective. However, our teams have not only adapted quickly to the challenges before them, but they have also embraced a new path forward for Parker, and are working hard to build a stronger and better Parker for the future under the direction of the Win Strategy.","I look forward to sharing more with you on our progress throughout this year. At this time, we are ready to take questions. So, Abigail, if you would like to get us started?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. This is James Picariello filling in for Jeff. Just a quick question on order trends. Can you speak to maybe the pace of what you're seeing through January and how that maybe compares to, in December and November?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","This is Jon. I think, James, the pattern is consistent with what we saw during Q2. I think what we're seeing in January is consistent with what we're seeing in guidance. January is, of course \u2013 the first two weeks of January are a little bit \u2013 very difficult to judge, but I think from what we can tell so far that we're consistent with the guidance that we've got together for Q3. So, nothing really remarkable to give you an answer on there.","James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And just to follow-up. On Aerospace, what's the visibility in terms of the mix between OE and aftermarket for the back half? Just trying to get a better understanding for the margins?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Well, it would be, in general, we have good visibility for the OE, and the question is always in the aftermarket. What is included in our guidance is 65% OE, 35% aftermarket. That's what we've been running consistently for the last several quarters. There's a little bit of variation periodically, but that's what we're projecting here for the balance of the year.","James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Nicole.","Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, I guess, I'll ask the question that someone's bound to ask is, can you guys go through your usual spiel on how the end markets progressed during the quarter?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","Nicole, this is Lee. Like I've done before in the past, I'll just kind of walk around the regions, and I'll make some comments on the end markets and I'll also comment on our distribution channel.","I think one common thread that hasn't changed is the whole natural resource driven markets, ag, mining, construction equipment, oil and gas, they really by and large continue to be challenging everywhere around the world.","So, starting off with North America, I think, oil and gas, in terms of distribution continues to be the big story when you think about distribution in aggregate. Having said that, if I focus on distribution that doesn't have heavy content in oil and gas, we've got positive year-over-year growth. But what's happened with oil and gas and its pervasiveness through the distribution base that is still very difficult.","Looking at, really, air conditioning, refrigeration markets in North America, we've seen good North America residential air conditioning growth. This is a result, obviously, of the continued strengthening in the housing market. We've seen share gains on our behalf and then really an increase in product content which has to do with the SEER efficiency changes that incurred last year. So, we're really happy what's happening in those markets.","Commercial air-conditioning and refrigeration markets really have been down year-over-year, but we are expecting growth in the balance of calendar 2016 and moving into 2017.","And then lastly, if I look at the aftermarket channel in this segment, which would be different than the industrial distribution, we really remain solid year-to-date growth and this is really based on the markets but also a big part of some new products and some smart service toolkits that we've introduced into that market segment. So, very positive there.","Touching back on North America oil and gas, as I mentioned in my distribution comments, we continue to see extreme weakness, double-digit declines across all of our end customers. Our customers, and I've had plenty of these conversations, are not signaling any significant improvement until the end of calendar year 2016 or early 2017. And all of them have very active restructuring plans to be profitable in today's oil prices.","Turning to agriculture, we continue to see topline declines, which is consistent I think in contraction and production schedules at our major customers. So, very weak on the agricultural equipment side.","On energy, wind and energy storage business for us remains robust with major customers maintaining a healthy backlog. And then the decommissioning of U.S. coal and oil-fired plants continues at a fairly brisk pace and has brought some good opportunity for us on natural gas conversion projects.","On heavy-duty truck, Class 8 truck, this market has been very good and growing for us. And it was excellent, but consistent with industry forecasts, we are lowering our forecast by at least 20% from the 2015 levels going forward.","On the mobile side, mobile equipment, the traditional construction equipment markets continue to be soft in North America. A highlight here has been some really nice wins in the turf business; the market is up and has been a bright spot as we continue to win new business there.","And then lastly, I'll just talk about in-plant automotive, our key North American distribution that covers in-plant automotive is up year-over-year versus \u2013 Q2 versus prior. But we are expecting a slowing of CapEx spending in this area, which will have an impact on the machine tool builders who cover this area. So that's North America.","In Europe, there's \u2013 well, I'll comment on Europe. So, if I talk about distribution, weak overall with Q2 down versus last year. But, I think, what I have to highlight here is if you pull out distribution that's tied to oil and gas, which is really UK, Norway \u2013 it's up year-over-year. And we have seen steady progress outside oil and gas-related distribution.","We continue to see strong distribution growth in emerging regions and this is a highlight; if I look at Germany, it's ahead of last year to-date. It obviously has much less oil and gas exposure than other countries.","Oil and gas for the region, investment in North Sea is almost at a standstill, looking at the UK capital investment, North Sea has dropped significantly. But, we are still finding opportunities. We've had some nice wins in point of use for clean diesel wins in some emerging markets. Really systems that eliminating high water content using our fluid conveyance and filtration technologies.","Agriculture is still pretty much the same as North America, production rate is low. In energy, very excited about some recent wins for energy grid tie systems and it really is a complement to our growth and the Renewable Energy segments.","Class 8 truck continues to remain strong. I was looking at this, I think this is the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in that area, so we're very positive about that. And then the mobile construction equipment markets, we actually have seen some stability there with a little bit of modest growth from Q1 to Q2.","Turning to Asia, distribution as a total is flat to moderately down year-over-year. And I attribute some of that to our continued expansion, which we highlighted in our Win Strategy, of expanding our distribution points around the world. And we are doing that in the region.","Oil and gas, again, is a contraction across the region. It's of note that we do see some positive success with some project builds in China and I think with a lot of these state-owned oil and gas companies, they still continue to invest, maybe at somewhat of a reduced rate.","On energy, in the region, really I'm speaking to China mostly, renewable, wind, solar and hydro is growing rapidly, but traditional thermal powers, coal, gas, nuclear is still taking a major share.","On rail, and this really speaks to China, we continue to be very bullish on the rail market; the Chinese government is making significant investments in this area. We've had \u2013 there is a strong focus on the export markets of high-speed rail, technology in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia and they continue to win business there. And for us, we've had a very good market participation in that segment, we continue to have strong participation across that rail market in China.","On mobile construction, I can't say anything has progressed positive, since the last time we talked, there continues to be a slowing rate of growth in China's construction industry and really has been a key driving factor in the deceleration in many parts of Asia-Pacific. But our customers there continue to have really tons of idle capacity and inventory on hand.","And then lastly, just talking to Latin America, it's really about Brazil. I won't go into the details. I think everybody knows, but Brazil continues to be just in very dire condition and we've seen softness in all our end markets, mining, PowerGen, oil and gas, heavy-duty truck, et cetera.","Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Lee, that was really, really helpful.","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, just one quick follow-up, if you guys don't mind. So, on 3Q, you're guiding for $1.40 EPS at the midpoint. Typically, EPS steps up Q-on-Q. I know there were some below line puts and takes within the second quarter that are probably messing up that seasonality a bit. But I'm just curious are you guys embedding a deterioration in organic growth in 3Q compared to 2Q?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me start, Nicole. This is Tom. And I'll let Jon add on. What we did for the second half is basically we took the order entry that we saw that Lee described all the regions of the markets in the second quarter, which really, Aerospace orders got better, less negative, and Industrial North America got worse by three points and International got worse by two points. So, we took that order entry and basically translated that into the second half on an organic growth standpoint. So, our second-half organic growth from our previous guide used to be minus 5% and now it's minus 7.5%. So, we dropped it 2.5 points organically and then we have the second half coming at a minus 15% decremental MROS and that's how you get the second half EPS numbers.","Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Tom. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Your line is open.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Let me just follow-up on Nicole's question and just clarify. As a clarification, what was the adjusted tax rate in the second quarter? And is the big difference between the third quarter and second quarter is a little bit of seasonality upturn being offset by a 28% tax rate assumption?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Well, first of all, the effective tax rate for the three months in Q2 was 20.3% and that's related to the passage of the extenders. Going forward into Q3, our run rate going forward is 28%, although it's just slightly higher in our Q3 that we've built in here due to a couple of items that we will account for it in the quarter, Eli.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. But that 28% versus the 20.3% is sort of like $0.12 to $0.15 or some number like that of the...","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","...difference in earnings and that almost accounts the difference between $1.52 and $1.40 that you're sort of forecasting for us.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We are not \u2013 we are down \u2013 are down in the top line versus our old guidance in Q3 and we're also down commensurately at the operating income. But I've got, like I said, a slightly higher rate in Q3 due to some discrete items that we're accounting for in our tax rate there.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","All right. And can we talk a little bit about the profitability, the lower profitability you're forecasting for the year? Most of that, I assume, is volume. Is there any changes in pricing going on in the marketplace? Are you able to hold pricing? I mean, we assume cost will continue to trend downward just because of the lower input costs. But can you a little bit, talk a little bit about what's going on in the \u2013 I assume the drop in margins that sort of are embedded it's like drop is a little volume related and that pricing looks like it's relatively stable in the industry?","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","Eli, this is Lee. I think the drop is all volume-related. Pricing has been flat. We forecasted it to be flat going forward.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And input costs are still trending downward?","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","They've been favorable.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A couple of questions related to your guidance. First, if we look back on Q2, can you give us the components of \u2013 there was quite a bit of difference between the initial $1.16 midpoint guidance and the reported $1.52. Understand tax was part of it. But what else changed?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I mean, I think at the SG&A level for the quarter as Tom said, we've got some positive variance in the corporate G&A of about $18 million versus the prior guide. And that's due to the simplification efforts and a couple one-time adjustments that won't repeat. We've also got as compared to the prior guide, a small settlement of about $4 million for a contractual issue that we had in the other expense. That's about $4 million and that accounts for about $0.02.","And, of course, Eli talked about the tax rate. And we had guided to a higher tax rate and again we did not know that the extenders was going to pass; and so of course, that turned out to be good news for us and that gave us $0.15 versus the prior guide.","And then at the operating income level, even with the reduced \u2013 projected reduced revenues, we were able to get approximately $15 million in additional operating income versus the prior guide on a slight beat in revenues.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jon. And then on that $15 million, is that repeatable \u2013 that should carry through going forward?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Well, that is built into our guidance going forward and we feel very good about our cost structure and with the simplification efforts and our restructuring efforts are bringing for us and built into our guidance is additional savings that we're going to get from the restructuring efforts that we've been going through here in the first half of this year and at the end of last year.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then a couple detail, I guess. First, on North American Industrial, did you see inventory destocking change during the quarter, meaning did it intensify, moderate or kind of stay the same versus the prior quarter?","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","Andy, it's Lee. I would say it just stayed about the same. I mean at the end of the day it's really hard for us to get a gauge on that. But it certainly didn't get worse.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Lee. And then real quick on the last one, Aerospace outlook. Are you embedding the same sort of fourth-quarter bump up that you've seen in the last couple of years?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Andy, we really are not. What we've embedded in there is the continuation of the 35% MRO, 65% OEM at around the same relative profitability that we see right now. These last couple of years we've seen these one-time settlements get agreed to. And they have impacted the number so I understand completely your question. But that's not something that we would project in our guidance going forward here and so I don't really have any context for you on that point.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Morning, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning. You know, Don used to talk about the 3-12 and the 12-12. I'm just curious about the end markets that are really weak. Are you seeing any kind of an inflection point looking at your 3-12s and your 12-12s? Anything bottoming out there, particularly in North America?","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","Ann, in all candor, I don't have my 3-12 and 12-12s in front of me. I can bring those back in the future. But, I would say the comps are going to start getting easier in some of those numbers, so it's just a matter of time. I mean obviously oil and gas, just from memory it is still decelerating. But, I would just be winging it here if I tried to give you any more context than that.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Ann, it's Tom. I think our assumption is there's really no meaningful recovery in the second half and what you see if you do the comparables it's just really easier comparables for us in the second half.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful, I appreciate it. And then you did comment on customers talking about how weak the end markets are. Were you talking about distribution customers, particularly in oil and gas, or were you talking about OEMs? If you just could tell us what are the conversations like between OEMs versus your distribution?","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","They are the same, quite frankly. Our distribution is involved with MRO but also with some projects, and handling it's very, very much the same. It's the same conversation.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there and let somebody else take it over. Thanks.","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. I guess a couple questions. One, I know someone asked before on material costs and you said it was a benefit, but could you quantify what you're assuming for material costs and your guidance versus when you initially guided? Because I'm just trying to understand the decrementals that you guys are putting up, which have been much better than expected. I get that it's the simplification initiatives and restructuring as well.","And then also, Tom, if you could just comment on the sustainability of sort of mid-to-high teen decremental margins. We haven't seen that before from Parker?","And then my last question is just balance sheet; given the depressed markets you're seeing, are any \u2013 I know when we spoke last, you said valuations on acquisitions were still quite elevated. Has there been any change in the market? Thank you.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Jamie. This is Tom. So, I'll start with the material costs side. I would say compared to our previous guidance, we're seeing a consistent gap between pricing and the material side, that our ability to maintain the decrementals is driven by the simplification and the restructuring actions. And remember that the bulk of our savings is in the second half, so that is going to help carry us.","And we feel good about this fiscal year, I'm not going to go beyond this fiscal year in trying to tell you what the margin return on sales are going to be. But for this fiscal year, we feel very good about sustainability.","We've done it three quarters in a row, and I think for everybody on the phone to help remind everybody, the way we achieved that is it was prior year restructuring that we did; all of the teams moved out very rapidly to get on top of the market adjustment. Then we launched the simplification plan which really was more strategic restructuring, in addition to the footprint restructuring we were doing that enabled us to keep these very nice basically half of what we historically have done.","And as a bit of a history lesson, if you go back to the 2001 reduction \u2013 we were \u2013 the recession, it was a minus 60% MROS. The great recession was around minus 40% and here we are in that minus 15% to minus 20% range on an adjusted basis and low-20%s even reported all in. So, I think it's sustainable and that's what we have in the plan for the next two quarters.","On the balance sheet, the acquisitions \u2013 the pipeline is active, but valuations are still high and I think what you're seeing is a delay in the reality from seller's expectations to buyers like us as far as setting a new revenue target as far as what they think for the business. That's the key valuation difference. I think everybody knows we're disciplined buyers and we buy things that are in our space, so we understand what the growth rates are. And I think the time is on our side with that. I think as time goes on and people see the new reality that they \u2013 it's maybe not going to grow what they thought it was the previous decade, but those valuations will come in more line and I think our pipeline will become more actionable at that point. So, it's lumpy, it's hard for us to predict output, but we're still working on it.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Sorry, Tom. One just quick follow-up on the simplification initiatives. Because as you look to 2017 there could be very high probability that things don't improve or that sales could decline. Based on what you're seeing with sort of the simplification initiatives, do you feel like you guys perhaps there's more there to do or you're realizing greater savings than you initially thought that again the sustainability of the decrementals could be better than what you originally thought?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that is possible. I don't want to get above my skis for 2017. We'll talk about that in August. But, yes, I mean, what we've seen with sustainability for simplification so far is that the payback is more rapid and has a better payback than traditional restructuring.","The good thing about it, and just to remind people, there is four areas we're looking at: revenue profile complexity so that's that tail of the revenue; we're looking at the bottom tail, that density of part numbers and (44:25) activity, just the cost to sustain that. We're very early days of getting into that. I mean that's a little more difficult for us to work but very early days of that.","And then the whole organization and process optimization is the second part. We still see lots of opportunities on that, so that's more strategic restructuring geared at the overhead structure of the company. The division consolidations was the third leg of it, so we're at 28 divisions so far that we're working on. We'll do more. I don't think you'll see another 28 in the next fiscal year, but you'll see us continue to work that.","And then just good old-fashioned bureaucracy. We're looking at our planning process, approvals, reports, you name it. All the things that just slows things down, and that obviously carries cost and creates better service opportunities for our customers. So early days, and I feel very good about where \u2013 what this could mean for us. And I think most everybody has seen the walk on taking us to 17% operating margins, simplification is the biggest bar on the walk. So, we clearly think there's more there.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All righty, thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Joe.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Tom, maybe staying on the simplification and restructuring spend for a second, it looks like the first couple of quarters, the spend is coming a little bit lighter than we anticipated. And so, I guess, my question is really just around your confidence on your ability to complete the actions this year and to get the roughly $70 million in benefits that you are expecting to receive from those actions. Any color there would be great.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Joe. It's Tom. So, our restructuring year-to-date is right on the money. So, we've forecasted 60% of the $100 million and we're at $57 million. So, we're very, very close to that number. And our savings are tracking and so I am very confident we're going to deliver both the cost that we had planned, the $100 million of cost and deliver the savings. And the savings is indicative of that is the marginal return on sales. We could not be delivering these kind of returns without the actions that we've taken, simplification being one of them that's helping us.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. So, yeah, maybe my numbers are off a little bit in the first half. I can follow up after the call. But, maybe one other key point is I noticed the free cash flow thus far has been pretty impressive and looks like this quarter working capital was a source of cash. I was wondering was there anything one-time or anything special \u2013 like I saw both the receivables and the inventory line down? Just curious what's driving the strong free cash flow.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Jon, here, Joe. We are very much focused on cash flow every single day here in the company here and watching as the top lines moves, what's going on there. All of our operating metrics are very good, nothing is deteriorating. We remain focused on the simplification efforts and our company is doing everything we can from a lean standpoint to improve every single process that we've got throughout the company. And we're seeing it in the cash flow statement. So, we're very proud of that.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones, Stifel. Your line is open.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Tom, Jon, Lee.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Lee, in some of your comments about the end markets, you said that North American distribution was positive ex-oil and gas. I think our checks had indicated your North American distribution overall was down about 3%. Is that pretty close to right?","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","Total North American distribution?","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. It would be down single-digits year-over-year.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, I think that implies that the direct channel from 2Q to \u2013 I'm sorry from 1Q to 2Q saw a fairly significant decline in the comp. Can you talk about any specific end markets that might have driven that?","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","I want to make sure I understand your question. You're talking about our direct customers?","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Direct or OEM, the non-distribution channel.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Nathan, it's Tom. I'll chime in. What we saw in distribution in Q2 was primarily North America took a step down, but outside of North America it held up pretty well, Europe, Asia held up pretty nicely.","So, the step down in North America really was indicative of the same step down we saw OEMs, which was the natural resource markets, a little bit of a knock-on into the general industrial space that knocked both distribution and the OEMs down. But, in general, OEMs have been down about two times what distribution has been down if you were to characterize the difference.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That helps. And then with nine months to go on the original plan for $2 billion to $3 billion of share repurchase, it looks like you're kind of gliding into more of the low end of that. Is that keeping powder dry for some expected correction in the pricing in the M&A market for you and with an eye to getting perhaps more aggressive as we go forward on M&A?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Nathan, this is Tom. Good question. I'm sure this is on top of everybody's mind. So, we feel very good about what we've done so far. We're 87% of the way through to the low end of the $2 billion to $3 billion range.","And maybe if I could just give a little color to the process that we \u2013 so every quarter, we sit down and it's really a cash allocation discussion. We look at cash generation capabilities, you know what do we think we're going to generate at closed-loop model taking a look at that. Where is the cash generated? What access do we have to the cash? And also with our goal that we'd like to maintain an A-rating as we go through this for a lot of good reasons.","But on the deployment side, we look at the best opportunities to yield the best long-term value for our shareholders comparing \u2013 recognizing, hey, we're going to do the dividends first. We're not going to move off of that, we're going to fund organic growth, but then we're going to look at the balance of share repurchase versus acquisitions to try to make that best decision.","So, it's hard for me to give you a specific number that will land on the share repurchase, because it's really an opportunistic look weighing those various tugs and pulls every quarter as we go through that closed-loop model.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Fair enough. And if I could just go off the beaten path a little bit here, you talked about 2Q developing a comprehensive e-Business plan. And also talked a little bit more about development of the Internet of Things plan. Could you give us a little bit more color on where you are with that, how long the rollout looks to take and where the benefits come from that?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Nathan, this is Tom again. So, I'm going to start on e-Business and I'm going to be a little bit coy with you here, because I'm not going to give you the kind of color that I might normally would, because I would be giving competitively sensitive information to our competitors in trying to help them be successful. Let me just suffice it to say that what we want on the e-Business side is we want a Google like experience for our customers and for our distributors when they come to that website.","And we've launched a number of things that we think will get us there, it's not going to happen overnight. We've made progress we think over the last couple of years and as we talked to our customers and distributors they see that, but we clearly recognize we're not there.","So, we see this as a potential additional growth channel, leveraging the great distribution channel that we have already. And just remembering that about 60% of the relationship between a customer and a supplier nowadays happens via that website and happens before they even talk to you. So, that's why we want this to be so important, we're investing in it, we made some organizational design changes to add some resources and add leadership to that. That was the change we made in August last year.","On the Internet of Things, that Connectathon, in case people are not familiar with what that is, it's basically an ideation process, where you gather ideas from around the company. And that coupled with the fact that we made that equity investment in Exosite, which gives us a software backbone to help all of the applications throughout the company, has really given us a program for ideas. So, we've taken that ideation process to Connectathon. We have narrowed it down to about 10 of what we think are the best most commercial actionable projects. And we think that has got multimillion-dollar type of look \u2013 tens of millions of dollars of revenue over the next three years. Most of that's not going to cut into probably towards the end of FY 2017 and FY 2018, it's probably going to take a year-and-a-half incubation here.","We do have two good examples, and Lee highlighted one of them that the smart service kit, which is helping us in the refrigeration primarily the air-conditioning market, so if you take an air-conditioning contractor today, they have a lot of mechanical tools they have to utilize to measure pressure, humidity, temperatures and so this is a patented sensor that we have. It allows you to diagnose and troubleshoot the conditions of that air-conditioning unit much more rapid, so the value for the contractors as many more calls happens during the call, they can get a print out right on their smartphone or visual on their smartphones and print it out if they want it for the customer, so they can see what's going on with their unit. So, we launched that. We've been very pleased with the initial sales.","And that's a really good example of taking a traditional market and using Internet of Things to make it even better. It makes our expansion valves and things we go in \u2013 our check valves very sticky, but then our contractors absolutely love the new toolkit. I think if you go to our website you can probably find a video of one of our contractors, a testimonial talking about it as well.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. That's helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with BoA. Your line is open.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Morning, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Can I just ask first just a very simple question? Did I hear it right that you highlighted automotive slowing or did I misheard that?","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","Andrew, I was talking about in-plant automotive, so CapEx going into the plants.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, is that related to new platforms at OEs?","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","I think there's been a \u2013 I'm not going to be that specific. But, what I've noticed is, there's been a lot of retooling activity with a lot of plants and some of that we're being told is going to start to slow down.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. So, let's not count this question. But, are you guys getting any transaction benefit? I think a year-ago, you were talking about that it takes about a year to recertify some of the plants to ship stuff from Europe to the U.S. Are you doing it? Are you being able to do it? Are we seeing any benefit from this?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Well, Andrew, you know we are constantly trying to make sure that we're producing the right parts at the right locations and the right plants. And so we are not, from a transactional standpoint, getting hurt as bad as we would have been say this time last year in terms of the margins. So that is one piece of progress that we've been making, it is not \u2013 that's one of about 10 or 15 things that are going our way that are helping us with our margins and our decrementals.","So, we don't see that getting bad. We're adjusting. It was this time last year where the euro and the Swiss franc decoupled and also when the dollar was really getting stronger. And so, we have adjusted to that where we stand right now today and that's what's built into our guidance going forward.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just a question on capital allocation, given where the high-yield markets are, given that PE can no longer play, given where the stock prices are, how do you guys feel about your M&A funnel?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Andrew, it's Tom again. Same comments that I mentioned earlier about acquisitions that the valuations right now are still a little bit high. I think it's a little bit of a delayed effect as the seller's expectations on revenue hasn't come down to earth yet. But, time is on our side. They will come down and we continue those discussions. And what we've seen over time is eventually we come to the terms with better revenue forecast.","We haven't taken action on some deals in the past mainly because of the difference in pricing and that pricing difference is primarily geared by differences in what we thought the revenue expectation was going to be for that business.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Abigail, if I could ask you please, if we could just have one more question, I see we're getting ready to run out of time here. So, thank you.","Operator","Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. How's it going?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Good, Joel.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's good. I'll make it quick. Is the run rate in your corporate G&A, is that the new level that we should be using going forward or is that a moving target that either got a benefit this quarter and is going to rise again or is it going to continue to structurally lower as we go forward?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","We're structurally going to be down slightly from our past run rate, but it was more of a couple one-time things in the corporate G&A. We're focused on about between $45 million to $48 million going forward here in the corporate G&A going forward as compared to in the mid-$50 million in Q1 and in prior years. So, this has some structural benefits from the simplification, but it would be wrong for me to not mention that there were some one-time items in Q2 for our G&A expense.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And is there a big target on the business simplification? I think you used to have 240 divisions and now you mentioned it's down by 28. Is there any sort of a goal or is it just \u2013 it's going to end up where it naturally ought to be?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Joel, just to \u2013 it's Tom. To clarify, the number of divisions that we have operating divisions is 115. So, the 28 is in the 115. So, both Lee and I, the message we've left with the group presidents is we're looking for natural combinations that helps us just be more efficient, give us the scale that we need to better grow synergies and better cost synergies. We have some divisions that I think if we looked at it in hindsight had too much technology or product charter overlap, and it made more sense to put them together. So, it's not going to be one division. We still believe in a decentralized model. We still believe in driving that P&L ownership closest to our team members. But, I think you'll continue to see us do more in 2017 not at the rate that you saw us do in 2016.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And is there a lot of other \u2013 this is the last one, sorry to take so long. Is there a lot of product line simplification underneath those business combinations or is that the next stage that you haven't dug into as deeply yet?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's what I was referring to that revenue profile \u2013 again, it's Tom, that revenue profile complexity. That is where we're very, very early days. And I think that's where the real juice and the tank here is. And that will help us in multi-years going forward.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Abigail, I made my closing remarks already.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sue and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jon Marten, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed, sir.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's first quarter FY 2016 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today is Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks.","Today's presentation slides together with the audio webcast replay will be accessible on the company's Investor Information website, at phstock.com, for one year following today's call. On slide two, you'll find our Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures.

To begin, our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, will provide highlights for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Following Tom's comments, I will provide a review of the company's first quarter FY 2016 performance together with the revised guidance for FY 2016. Tom will provide a few summary comments and then we'll open the call for a Q&A session.","At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask you to refer to slide number four.","Thomas L. Williams - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jon. And welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation today. I'm going to take a few minutes to review the quarter and touch briefly on some of our end markets and also provide an update on the new Win Strategy.","To start, a few comments on our first quarter. It continues to be a very tough environment in many of our markets. We are experiencing the negative effects of the strong dollar and we witnessed further deterioration in key end market demand. We have continued with actions to adjust to these conditions. These actions include: reduced work schedules and tight control of discretionary spending in addition to the previously announced actions we have underway with regard to restructuring and our simplification efforts under the new Win Strategy.","Sales declined 12% in the quarter, as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by approximately 6%, while acquisitions were slightly positive, resulting in an organic sales decline of 7%. Order rates declined 11% in the first quarter compared with the same quarter last year, reflecting ongoing market weakness, particularly in the natural resource-related markets.","Despite the magnitude of the decline in sales, I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 14.5%, or 15.3% on an adjusted basis. As many of you are familiar, for some time now we've been raising the floor and ceiling on margins through the past business cycles. Our Q1 results represent the best segment operating margin performance that we have had in recent history given this tough of a macro environment and represents decremental operating earnings of just 22% on an adjusted basis. It also represents a sequential improvement of 40 basis points in adjusted segment margins from the level we achieved in the fourth quarter.","There are three main drivers that impacted our margin performance. First was savings from restructuring we have done in prior years; next, the rapid response that we did on cost containment; and then lastly, the immediate benefits from our simplification initiatives. I want to take a moment to thank our entire global team for demonstrating such agility in adapting to a rapid change in demand.","Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.41, or $1.52 adjusted for business realignment expenses. Operating cash flow for the quarter includes $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding this contribution, operating cash to sales was 7.1%.","As I have said before, Parker is committed to being a great generator and deployer of cash. During the first quarter, we repurchased $310 million worth of Parker shares. We have now repurchased $1.64 billion under our previously announced $2 billion to $3 billion Parker share repurchase program over two years, which began in October of 2014.","We completed two acquisitions in the quarter, providing approximately $50 million of annual sales, including President Engineering Group in the UK, a leading producer of cryogenic valves. We also completed an equity investment in Exosite LLC, an industry-leading software provider, to enable industrial Internet of Things applications and services. We see tremendous opportunity for Parker to generate service revenues and have assigned a seasoned Parker leader to spearhead that aspect of our growth strategy.","Moving on to the discussion on key market trends. We saw continued softening in some key markets that are important to our businesses, specifically natural resource-related markets, like oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment saw continued weakness. Our distribution channel was also affected, especially those distributors who are exposed to oil and gas.","Although we knew these markets would be a drag on our first quarter, some of these markets contracted at a stronger than expected rate. These challenging market conditions outweighed positive growth trends in other market, such as power generation, heavy duty truck, rail and aerospace. And Lee Banks will provide some more color on the end markets in the Q&A portion of the call.","Now switching to our outlook. For fiscal year 2016, we are revising our guidance for earnings to the range of $5.30 to $5.90 per share, or $5.80 to $6.40 per share on an adjusted basis. Regarding our revised sales guidance, the following are the key drivers.","First, order entry levels are weaker than anticipated and have worsened sequentially through the quarter. Second, we are not forecasting any meaningful recovery in our natural resource-related end markets through the remaining of our fiscal year. And, third, we are now anticipating more softness in emerging markets and our distribution channel. These factors mean that our current guidance assumes a 5% for the whole company year-over-year decline in second half organic sales, whereas previously we had guided to a positive 2.7% increase. We continue to aggressively manage costs in this environment and, as our guidance indicates, maintain strong decremental margin performance.","As many of you know, we introduced the new Win Strategy at our Investor Day last month. A week before that, we met with the top 300 leaders of our organization to share the details of how we plan to take Parker's performance to the next level. I'm excited to see how energized our team is by our plans and I'm even more optimistic that we can achieve our long-term goals.","We are targeting 17% segment operating margins and an organic sales target to grow 150 basis points faster than industrial production growth by fiscal 2020. Importantly, we have changed our incentive compensation program with an increased emphasis toward rewarding for growth and we have pushed this program deeper into the organization.","The new Win Strategy has established four broad goals and includes detailed initiatives for each. I'd just like to take a minute to outline a quick summary of those key goals. First is, engage people. It's all about a high engagement and ownership by our Parker team members, which will drive exceptional performance. Next is premier customer experience. So moving from more of a service mindset to creating a great customer experience enables growth. Next is profitable growth, where we're implementing strategies to grow organically 150 basis points faster than the market. And then financial performance, where we're going to be a top quartile financial performing company versus our diversified industrial proxy peer group, with year-over-year earnings growth.","Our new Annual Report goes through each of these goals in detail, outlining our strategies and measures of success. As we have detailed here, many of these initiatives, such as simplification, are already underway. With the introduction of the new Win Strategy now complete, our teams are hard at work building detailed execution plans to achieve our goals. We are excited about the opportunities that will position Parker as a top quartile performing company compared to our proxy peers.","And for now, I'll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Tom. And at this time, please refer to slide number five. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.52 versus $1.89 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.11 and compares to $0.04 with the same quarter last year.","On slide number six, you'll find the significant components of the reconciliation from adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 for the first quarter FY 2015 to $1.52 for the first quarter of this year. The impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.13 per share. Reductions to adjusted per share income include: lower adjusted segment operating income of $0.41 per share driven by the impact of foreign currency and a continued weakening of the end markets demand and net increase in corporate G&A, interest and other expense that totaled $0.09 per share due largely to the increased debt issuance expenses from FY 2015 and lower currency transaction gains booked in the current quarter.","Moving to slide number seven, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the first quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 7% over the same quarter last year. There was a 0.4 contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than planned, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $187 million or 5.7% in the quarter.","Total company segment operating margins for the first quarter adjusted for realignment expenses incurred in the quarter was 15.3% versus 16.1% for the same quarter last year. Restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were $22 million versus $6 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $438 million versus $525 million last year reflects the meaningful impact of reduced volume and unfavorable mix from the continued weakening of several industrial end markets.","Moving to slide number eight, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the first quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 11.3% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 1.5% in the quarter.","Operating margin for the first quarter adjusted for realignment cost was 17.2% of sales versus 18.0% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred totaled $8 million as compared to a nominal spend in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $221 million as compared to $264 million driven by reduced volume as a result of the softening trends in key end markets.","I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on slide number nine. Organic sales for the first quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 5.8%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 12.7%. Operating margin for the first quarter adjusted for realignment cost was 13.6% of sales versus 15.5% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $12 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $141 million as compared to $195 million, which reflects the impact of the foreign currency changes as well as weaker end markets.","I'll now move to slide number 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues in Aerospace increased 2.5% for the first quarter. Currency posed a modest negative of 0.6%. The segment sales growth for the period was driven by higher commercial and military aftermarket sales volume. Operating margin for the first quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 13.9% of sales versus 12.2% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $2 million. Adjusted operating income was $76 million as compared to $65 million, reflecting the favorable mix of aftermarket sales volume in the quarter combined with reduced development costs as a percent of sales.","Moving to slide number eleven, with the detail of orders changing by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders shifted to a negative 11% for the quarter, reflecting the further softening in natural resource-related end markets. Diversified Industrial North American orders decreased to negative 12%, Diversified Industrial International orders decreased to negative 8% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders decreased to negative 16% for the quarter against notably very high prior-year comparables.","Slide number 12, we report cash from operations. For the first quarter, cash from operating activities was $5 million, but when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the quarter, cash from operating activities was 7.1% of sales. This compares to 8% of sales for the same period last year. The significant uses of cash during the quarter were: $396 million returned to our shareholders via repurchases of $310 million and dividends of $86 million. $67 million was expended for acquisitions closed during the quarter, $39 million for CapEx, equating to 1.4% of sales for the quarter.","On slide number 13 the revised full-year earnings guidance for FY 2016 is outlined. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $100 million which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2016. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 11.3% to negative 7.7%, or negative 9.5% at the midpoint as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is negative 7.2%.","Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 2.7%, which is nearly all attributed to the Industrial International segment, of course. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of September 30, 2015, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming fiscal year 2016.","For total Parker, adjusted operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.6% and 15.0%. This compares to 14.9% for FY 2015 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins, given the magnitude of the end market softness and order decline. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and other, is $511 million for the year at the midpoint. Full-year tax rate is projected to be 29%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in our full-year guidance is 138.6 million shares.","For the full year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is $5.80 to $6.40, or $6.10 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $100 million to be incurred in FY 2016. Savings from these business realignment initiatives continue to be projected in the amount of $70 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins provided. Some additional key assumptions for full-year 2016 guidance are: sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% first half, 54% second half. Adjusted EPS first half versus second half is $2.68 for the first half, $3.42 for the second half. Q2 adjusted EPS is projected to be $1.16 per share at the midpoint and this excludes $0.20 of business realignment expenses.","On slide number 14, you'll find the reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.10 per share at the midpoint from prior fiscal year 2016 EPS of $7 per share. Increases include $0.19 from reduced other expense and $0.10 from fewer shares outstanding. Key components of the decrease include a $1.14 reduction in segment operating income reflecting further reduced volume and unfavorable mix forecasted with key industrial end markets and, finally, $0.05 from increased corporate G&A and interest. Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions, divestitures that might be closed during FY 2016. For consistency, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates.","This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments.","Thomas L. Williams - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jon. We are operating in a difficult environment, but as the first quarter demonstrates, we have responded well. I'm pleased with the progress we are making with our restructuring initiatives, which remain on track for the year. We also continue to find new opportunity to streamline operations through our simplification initiatives.","What I am most encouraged by the response of our Parker team members. They are stepping up to the challenges before them and are embracing the changes we have initiated to build a stronger Parker. I am confident that we have a bright future ahead of us and I look forward to sharing with you our progress throughout this year.","So at this time, we are ready to take questions. So, Sue, you could go ahead and start us off.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","I'm wondering if we could dig in a little bit just on the change of the guidance sequentially. Obviously things sort of deteriorated through the quarter here. I think you made a comment that it kind of got worse as the quarter went along. And I'm wondering if you could just flush that out a little bit and if I am right about that.","But more importantly, what really deteriorated? Do you have more energy exposure than you originally thought? It seems like the stuff that's not commodity-related has been fairly stable, but correct me if I'm wrong there. Maybe just a little bit more color on how this progressed through the quarter and what's really driving it.","Thomas L. Williams - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Steve. This is Tom. And I'm sure that's the key question everybody has. And I'll start off by giving you an overview of how our thought process changed and what was behind revising the guidance. I'm going to hand it over to Lee to go ahead and go through the markets in more detail.","But what really changed during the quarter was order entry levels weakened more than we anticipated and September was much more worse than we had expected. And as we had mentioned in the Investor Day, those of you that were there, September is always a key month. It's really a key indicator for how the quarter is going to be. July and August are always somewhat suspect because of the levels of vacation and holidays between North America and Europe. And September is your first good indicator for the quarter and also it's a really good indicator for what the rest of the year potentially is going to look like. So September turned worse; that was the first influence.","Also based on the roll-up that we've gotten from our divisions, our customers, talking to our distributors, we're not forecasting any kind of recovery in the natural resource-related markets in the second half of our year, which we originally were forecasting some kind of recovery there. So oil & gas, construction, ag, and mining are soft and actually are softer than we had expected and they're going to continue that way through the remainder of the fiscal year.","We're also anticipating more softness in the emerging markets. We had anticipated China and Brazil; they were soft. They have softened worse through the course of the quarter. And then what you were referring to, Steve, about kind of the oil & gas impact, clearly oil & gas impacted North America the most. But there's clearly a knock-on effect that is felt throughout the rest of our end markets, in particular for our distributor channel which is a big part of the company. It felt the reduction in oil & gas and it has felt it across the whole board. So we've seen distribution soften quite a bit in the quarter and that's a change for us for what we think the full year is going to be.","So in general, we had forecasted softening in the first half with some small lift in the second half. That was our original guidance. So now what we're saying is that the first half is going to be softer than we thought before and we don't see any kind of recovery in the second half and the second half will be soft as well.","So with that kind of as a overarching summary, I'm going to let Lee go through the end markets in more detail.","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","Great, Tom. Thanks, Steve. So just kind of reiterating what Tom said, if you look at it, it's continued softness in some of these natural resource-driven markets and then the continued softness regionally and by country in Europe, China and Brazil. And then let's not forget about currency; it continues to be a major headwind.","If we look at North America, maybe starting there, we mentioned in Q4 a slowdown in distribution. And it's clear that that slowdown continued in Q1. I would say it was largely attributed to those distributors with exposure to oil & gas, but you couldn't help but see a knock-down effect in some of other distribution with some of their order entry and business. We do continue to see destocking in the channel. Our best bet is we'll continue to see that destock through Q2.","As I mentioned earlier, distribution outside of oil & gas, in some areas it's okay and in some areas it's just moderate to slightly negative. So maybe it's an effect of a strong dollar in some key markets, but it's certainly not as robust as we saw last year.","And then if I look oil 7 gas, we continue to see contraction across all sectors, but specifically the upstream sectors. Offshore activity and land-based activity continue to be very soft. The last rig count numbers I saw was down 57% versus prior year, so significant reduction. And I think the one thing, even though business is soft, we're encouraged really by some of the wins with new products we've had in these industries. And we are seeing great opportunities in service businesses that we've launched and are working with some of these key customers.","Agriculture, we talked about earlier, continues to be very soft. In energy, and this is really around power generation, we do continue to see positive trends there, both in traditional and renewable. In the traditional, it's really not new plants being added; it's a conversion from coal to natural gas. And that's been a great opportunity for us. And we're also very encouraged by progress with our Energy Storage business unit. which we've highlighted before in the past.","On heavy truck, Class 8 build continues to be strong, although at somewhat of a more modest rate here in Q4, but we're still expecting progress for 2015 over 2014, and the forecasts we have for 2016 continue to look good. And this is another industry where we continue to experience growth from a positive markets, but also with some of the technologies that we've introduced to aid in emission controls in that industry. On Mobile, really off-highway, continued softness in mining and construction equipment.","Turning to Europe, General Distribution is up year-over-year, but like North America, those areas impacted by oil & gas are a major headwind. We have some distributors near the North Sea that are off as much as 55% to 60%, so significant impacts there. But from a country standpoint, we do see positive year-over-year performance in countries like Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands from an Industrial standpoint.","On Construction, we do see positive trend in higher-end domestic construction equipment markets. But those customers that are focused really around export, their businesses are badly depressed, mainly by what's happening in Russia and some of the other emerging markets in the Middle East.","Oil & gas, as I mentioned earlier, that activity is very slow. We have seen a lot of major capital projects in the Middle East and North Sea have been delayed and moved out for a significant amount of time. Agriculture, continued softness. Issues continue to be compounded by really what's happening in Russia and the Ukraine. And then in truck, there really continues to be excellent strength in the heavy end of the market.","Let me just turn to Asia now, if I can. We do see continued contraction in China. I think that's a little slower at this point than what we had expected. And we're not really forecasting anything significant there in general. We've seen continued weakness in construction equipment markets there. I'm not sure it can go to zero, but it is getting close. Distribution still growing, really through added locations, but as a whole I would say we're flat to moderately down.","Power generation, I mentioned earlier. That still is a positive for us in our participation there. And I'd say one key area has been rail. China has really stepped out as a leading provider in both high-speed and metropolitan transportation. And we've been working with those customers closely and have had some great success there.","And then lastly I'll just touch on Latin America. I think you know really the story continue to be Brazil; significant currency devaluation, continued contraction in GDP. We do see positives. Again, this common theme around power generation. We see it throughout Brazil but also in countries like Chile, Colombia, et cetera.","Heavy truck contraction, it's really down 50% year-over-year in Brazil. Same thing, continued softness in construction equipment and ag. But we're also, like North America, we've made some really great progress in maintenance and services businesses with some of the CapEx that's already been deployed around oil and gas.","You got a lot there, Steve.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","I appreciate it. Just one quick follow-on. Can you guesstimate how much of the distribution exposure is in energy? And then I'll pass it on.","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","I wouldn't really be able to guesstimate right now. I would say those distributors around Southwest, Gulf and Western Canada have more exposure, but I'd be hard-pressed to give you a number right now.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Hammond from KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So decremental performance, very good in the quarter. And it seems like in the guide, you're seeing that as sustainable. So I guess as you get further into this downturn, what's your confidence level you can sustain that? And maybe just speak to what you think you're doing differently in the cost structure maybe this cycle versus last cycle to be able to hold those decrementals?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Well, Jeff, I think one of the things that we're most proud of is our ability to maintain these margins, as Tom said, given the downturn that we saw in Q1 and, like you said, as we are foreseeing for the balance of the fiscal year.","As we've been speaking about in many of our forums, we have done quite a bit of restructuring last year and the year before. That prior restructuring is serving us very well as we continue to get the savings from that this year and throughout the balance of the year. We also have been responding very quickly at each one of our operations throughout the world to the changing market conditions and we are much quicker responding today than we were in the prior downturns. And that is something that is serving us very well.","And then lastly, with the new Win Strategy and our simplification efforts that we talked about last year, that has been kicking in in a very, very good way for us. We're very enthusiastic about our ability to maintain our margins in the area that you see in our guidance. And our simplification efforts we see being a very powerful driver for us from a margin standpoint going forward here. And that is one of the very important elements of the financial performance in the new Win Strategy that we're going to be focusing on going forward here. So I would say that those are the three major changes and things that are a little bit different than we've seen in prior downturns for us.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. And then you mentioned September worsening. Can you just maybe speak to how that trended into October? And then also on the distributor destocking, I think, Lee, you said you thought that continues through calendar year end. What's really in the guidance around distributor destocking?","Thomas L. Williams - Chief Executive Officer","Jeff, it's Tom. I'll start first with September. So September worsened. We saw July come out about how we expected. August turned a little bit better, so we were a little bit optimistic. Then September got worse and that continued. And basically what we've seen in October is reflective of what we've done in our revised guidance. And I guess just on the destocking part, what's in the guidance is destocking finishing end of this calendar year, so end of Q2, early into Q3.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. I guess my question centers around just pricing as well as material costs. I think there's increased scuttle in the channel that pricing has deteriorated. So I'm wondering if you could give some color on what you're seeing and what your assumptions are in terms of pricing for 2016 and then also what your assumptions are on the material cost side. Thanks.","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Jamie. It's Lee. So overall, you're right; it's a challenging environment on pricing and it's a favorable environment on material costs. So I would say in our guidance, it's just basically flat going forward. It's going to continue to be a challenging environment. That's the best way I can characterize it for you.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","But I guess when you think about \u2013 is it specific to a certain end market or type of customer? You know what I mean? Or can you talk just more broadly competitively like what you're seeing, just any color I guess besides it's bad?","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","I would say pricing is most challenged around those markets that are down significantly. So if you think about the oil and gas markets we talked about, where there is just really no significant demand right now. We continue to have great pricing opportunities in markets outside that. But there is some momentum in some of those key end markets that do make it a challenging environment. And that, plus coupled with the fact that you have this deflationary effect going on with materials, it just makes it a \u2013 we're still positive, but it's a challenging environment.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then I guess just my second question just relates to capital allocation. I know this year your guidance implies your share count doesn't change from where we are in the first quarter. Can you just talk about has there been any change in priority or acquisition or acquisitions popping up as more favorable? I don't know if pricing is getting any better relative to like a year, 12 months to 18 months ago, when the pricing environment on acquisitions just wasn't in your favor?","Thomas L. Williams - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jamie. This is Tom. So I'll start with the capital allocation priority. So they haven't changed versus the dividends. We want to maintain that increased record. And our target is 30% pay-out to net income. And we're at that and we're above that, on going the last 12 months, we're quite a bit above that.","The next would be organic growth to fund CapEx for organic growth and innovation as well. And then when we look at share repurchase and acquisitions, it's really looking at a case-by-case basis and making the best decision that generates the best long-term value for our shareholders looking at those two in comparison.","On the share side, you saw what we did in the quarter. So we bought $310 million of shares, approximately $112 a piece. So we're now at $1.64 billion, so we're 82% of the way to the low end of our commitment. And we're still committed to that $2 billion to $3 billion range and I think we're making good progress on that.","On the acquisition front, we continue to work that pipeline. But just by nature, how acquisitions work, they're going to be lumpy, they're going to be difficult for us to predict and give you any kind of visibility to. But I would tell you valuations still from our perspective are high. And we're disciplined buyers and so there's been several properties that we've passed on because of that. And we'll just continue to work it and we'll have to see what yields out of it. But, again, it's looking at that in conjunction with share repurchase and making the best long-term decision here.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Morning, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Morning. So, hey, Jon, you called out unfavorable mix as part of the walk from the $7 to the $6.10 within the $1.14 drag versus your prior expectation. And then, Lee, you just said that you're not expecting any pricing, so I want to square those two. In other words, what's actually happened with respect to mix in three months that warranted calling that out, especially if price is only flat, right? So unfavorable mix implies there's price degradation or realization in some manner. Could you just talk to that and maybe the context? Is it significant, the $1.14? I mean, just trying to make sure I'm triangulating all these points.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. I think when I talked about mix, I talked about the change in volume. And as we go forward and we look at all of our end markets, as the volume in the higher margin end markets reduces, that is having a impact on our margins that outweighs all the other end markets that we have.","And so historically, John, North America has been progressing very well in terms of our sales growth over the last several years. What we're starting to see now, and you see it in our orders and you see it in our guidance, is that North America sales increases, this is actually now of course decreases are more pronounced in North America than they are in our International Industrial markets. And so from a mix standpoint on that volume, we are being impacted disproportionately, so.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay, so you're saying basically lower volume in North America is translating into lower realized overall profit within Industrial. I think that's what you're saying.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Right. More of a volume issue than a pricing issue here for us.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, in other words, Jon, when you look at North America rolling orders down 11%, is that all volume? Or is there also little bit of degradation \u2013 like is that all a unit volume or is there any kind of price degradation that bakes into the 11%?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","It's primarily almost all volume; it is not pricing, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So then, Lee, when you said pricing is now going to be flat, can you just remind me what was that versus? Did you previously think it was up like 0.5% or something? Or is it, kind of squaring with Jon's comments, not really that material?","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","I'm sorry, John. I lost you the last half there, but...","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Oh. Jon is making the point that it's kind of the change here, which is fine, is volume and there's associated decrementals. But you made the comment to Jamie that now you expect price to be flat. So I'm just trying to understand is, what was that versus? In other words, you had been hoping that price was going to improve, but it's now flat? Or it's actually gone a little softer? That's all. I'm just trying to make sure I'm dotting all of my i's.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, just to try to connect the dots here for you. When Lee was talking about pricing being flat, we're really talking about our process inside the company that where we take every part that we ship today in every single one of our divisions and we compare the price of that part today to that price of that same part that we shipped the exact same time last year and we calculate a sales price index. And in that sales price index that Lee is talking about, it's basically flat. And that is the flat pricing that we're seeing overall that Lee I think was referring to. Does that help?","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. He also \u2013 well, he is right there. Lee, you also made the comment that pricing is \u2013 you almost implied it was increasingly perhaps challenging. The reason I'm harping on this is price is one of these buzzwords right now that people are throwing out. And the companies are sort of not suggesting, including your own, that there's really that much realized price degradation versus the chatter of potential. I just want to make sure you're not really (42:48) more substantial.","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","So realized price degradation is not something I worry about...","Thomas L. Williams - Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","...for the company. There are certain end markets that are price challenged and there are certain markets that are not price challenged. When you kind of sum it up across the board, it is kind of a zero-sum game. But I don't worry about price degradation as a whole for the company.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Just lastly, $70 million of restructuring savings. How does that delineate over the next three quarters?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","It's a total of $20 million in the first half and $50 million in the second half, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, got it. Thanks very much.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski, Buckingham Research. Please proceed.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Josh.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","This is a follow-up to Jeff's question earlier on the decremental margin management. It looks like as it pertains to the 2Q guide, you guys actually did a little better managing that sequentially. And I would think with all the comments around destocking, particularly in distribution where you have some better mix, presumably you're also destocking in your own facilities, so maybe absorption is a little lighter, I would imagine that something between some of the input cost deflation, restructuring savings are helping bridge that.","Can you maybe talk about how that squares out, either by 1Q, 2Q, first half, second half, just so we can help square up volume versus some of the other discreet items coming through?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think that it's really hard to articulate very quickly the depth and breadth of the restructuring that we've done in the prior years and how that is impacting as the year goes on our decremental margins.","One thing to just point out, Josh, would be the early retirement that we announced in Q4 of last year. That is largely going to start having major impacts on our business in Q2. So what we did is go through each one of our operations and, with this new volume that we're looking at, make sure because we saw how favorable these decrementals look, that we've got the actions either already completed and the savings started, or that we are realizing benefits from programs that we put in place last year and the year before, frankly, in some economies, that are going to be impacting the bottom line for Q2. So we feel very good about the guidance that we gave there. And we realize that the decrementals are something that are, at first glance, could appear to be aggressive.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Is that fair, though, the earlier supposition that you guys are destocking internally to go along with what your customers are doing? So, I guess, should we look at that performance as even kind of better versus the absorption headwind?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","I think so. I think so. We're able to handle the absorption headwind with the reduced volume with the amount of restructuring that we've planned on doing. And I can't emphasize enough the power of a simplification program where we are trying to make the company a lot more efficient, a lot less reliant on indirect overhead that is really not adding value, and really being able to push our margins in directions that we've never seen before in the history of the company. And so, yes, we're able to overcome the lack of absorption overhang that we're going to see in Q2.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. Wanted to ask a question on the revenue guidance. If I take your midpoint and the comment about the split, 48% to first half, it kind of implies Q2 revenue down about 15%. And I'm trying to square that with the comment about fiscal second half being down about 5%. So could you talk about the components of that Q2 forecast, meaning organic and currency? Because I'm trying to understand the step-up from 15% down to 5% down. Is that all currency or is there something else built into the outlook?","Thomas L. Williams - Chief Executive Officer","Andy, it's Tom. I'll start and then Jon can fill in details if there's more follow-up that you have. But in the second half, that 5% I was talking about was total company. So that has the Industrial piece being down worse and Aerospace being more positive. Currency is around, for our mid-point, currency is about 2.7 points of the 9.5% for the full year. And you are about right with what you thought for Q2; we have it around 14% down on sales.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, Tom. And then one specific question, maybe Jon can help out. In the quarter on cash flow, there was about a $265 million consumption related to other assets and liabilities. And that's the highest in a few quarters. Can you kind of detail what was in that?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Well, in that case, there was \u2013 we really only did three major things in the quarter. We bought stock, and that's $310 million, we made a pension contribution of $200 million and we made acquisitions of $67 million for the quarter. So those are the major changes. There are some movements in the cash flow related to tax, the equity investment that we made in the Internet of Things company that Tom referred to and a few other things, Andy, but that's really the lion's share of the uses of cash here for us in the quarter.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Just a follow-up on that, Jon. Thank you. So the $200 million of pension funding, would that be within that $265 million?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Morning, Joe.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So my first question, I guess just trying to get my head around the top-line reduction was roughly about $1 billion in revenue. And you guys kept the restructuring plans and simplification plans at roughly $100 million. How much of that is a question of internal capacity to actually do additional restructuring, given what you have in place today, as opposed to just feeling like the $100 million is the right number and aligned and you'll be at the right place even in a lower-growth environment?","Thomas L. Williams - Chief Executive Officer","Joe, this is Tom. I think what we're finding on the restructuring is a couple things. One, we're able to do a lot of the projects less expensive than what we anticipated. So we're actually adding to the project list. We didn't change the number to you, but we're adding extra projects because we've been more efficient on the ones that we already looked at.","Simplification in general is a more efficient way of deploying restructuring spend because it's not dealing as much with footprint consolidations, plant closures and all that, which carry typically more cost. It's more focused on SG&A, the overhead piece of things. And so when you do division consolidations, you look at optimizing organization, structure, processes. When we did the early retirement, we looked at organization design changes to not have to replace people in kind, at least not one for one.","All those changes can be done more efficiently without the same level of restructuring. So we are actually doing more within that envelope of $100 million. We just didn't need to change the dollar amount because we're just being more efficient.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. That's helpful color there, Tom. Maybe just asking a little more detailed question on one of the segments. Haven't really heard much about Aero yet. Orders deteriorated double-digits now for the second quarter in a row. I'm just curious what's going on there. How should we expect that to read through to growth, not just in this year but also into next year? Because it tends to be a little bit longer cycle.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Joe, Jon here. Just to give you first top-level answer to that. Keep in mind that when we publish our Aerospace numbers, they are a 12-month rolling forecast. And last year \u2013 the comparables are tough for us for right now because last year we booked several multi-year, multi-program large orders. And those large orders that we booked ran our 12-month number way up. We were up, approximately this time last year, we were up 12%. And so we're looking at we're down 16% now. It's not really nearly as severe as it appears.","We're still confident in our growth rates going forward in the 4% level in Aerospace. So I completely appreciate the question and how that looks very unusual. We've been taking a really hard, hard look at that and we feel confident that it was just that series of multi-program, multi-year orders that we booked based on contracts that we received that were fully priced and scheduled out that drove our orders up at that point in time.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. I'll get back in queue. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","A question on the guidance first. There is a $30 million reduction in corporate expense for the year. Can you give us some more color around that?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Nathan, that is primarily \u2013 the biggest driver there is as a result of the pension contribution that we did in August, our pension expense for our underfunded plans is going down. And that's the major driver.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, that makes sense. And then on the free cash flow conversion dip down 90 basis point year-over-year, been hearing several companies talk about difficulty with collections, primarily in emerging markets in this environment. Is there any impact there to you? Or what is the reason for that 90 basis point lower conversion?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Well, if you're talking about \u2013 we really have two things going on here in the quarter. We are looking at DSO very carefully. We are not seeing any degradation whatsoever. But we are very aware of the issue and we are very focused on that. The issue for us was really in our inventories. We will see that correct in Q2 and Q3 and we'll see better cash. We always perform much better from a cash environment and we've been able to prove that over the years as things start to slow down a little bit. So we're fully confident. But I think it's mainly our performance in inventory that is the outlier there that we'll see correct as the year goes on.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then you were talking about the sales price index not changing. I know you also track a cost price index. Are you seeing any more or less favorable outcomes there?","Thomas L. Williams - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Nathan. This is Tom. Yes, we're working that hard as one of the initiatives that we have. If you remember from our walk to 17% ROS on the operating margin side is working the supply chain. And, yes, we are seeing improvements and we will continue to work that. We'll work that on the indirect side, which doesn't necessarily show up in our purchase price index, but shows up in lower expenses, which is part of helping us in our margin on returns. But, yes, we're working that hard. And when I look at SPI to PPI, it's neutral to slightly positive, that comparison.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Do you think you can hold that positive for the year?","Thomas L. Williams - Chief Executive Officer","I think so, yes.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Thanks very much.","Thomas L. Williams - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Sue, we'll just take one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And that question comes from the line of Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, yes. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So the question in terms of leverage versus lower earnings forecast, how should we think about your willingness to take on leverage in this notably weaker environment yet an environment that could down the road present M&A opportunities?","Thomas L. Williams - Chief Executive Officer","Well, Andrew, this is Tom. I think, as always, we want to make the best long-term decision for our shareholders looking at acquisitions versus share repurchase. We still are committed to our A rating, and so that's a function that we look at all the time. So when we do our cash allocation discussion every quarter, we look at cash generated versus where we are in our debt to debt equity relationship and we make the best decisions that we possibly can on behalf of the shareholders. But certainly the A rating is a controlling device that we use. And I think it's been helpful for us. And the bulk of our peers, if you look at they're all A rated. And we think that's an advantage for us to continue to do that.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And in your view, I know that rating agencies have been company-specific, but what does it mean in terms of sort of the upper band of leverage you would be comfortable with?","Thomas L. Williams - Chief Executive Officer","We typically work to a 37% debt to total cap.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Andrew. And this concludes our Q&A and our earnings call for today.

My name is Crystal, and I will be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Pamela Huggins, Vice President and Treasurer. Please proceed, ma'am.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thanks, Crystal. Good morning, everyone. It's Pam speaking, just as Crystal's mentioned. I'd like to welcome you to Parker Hannifin's fiscal year 2014 and fourth quarter earnings release teleconference.","Of course, joining me today is Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Don Washkewicz; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Marten.","For those of you who wish to do so, you can follow today's presentation with the PowerPoint slides that are presented on Parker's website at www.phstock.com. For those of you not online, the slides will remain posted on the company's investor information website at www.phstock.com as well, and they'll be on there 1 year after today's call.","At this time, reference Slide #2 in the slide deck, which is the Safe Harbor Disclosure Statement addressing forward-looking statements. And again, please take note of this statement in its entirety if you haven't already done so. This slide also indicates, as required, that in cases where non-GAAP members have been used, they have been reconciled to the appropriate GAAP numbers, and they are also posted on Parker's website.","Slide #3. We have the agenda here today. It consists of 4 parts. First, Don Washkewicz, Chairman, CEO and President will provide highlights for the quarter and the year. Second, I'll provide a review, including key performance measures, again, for the year, as well as the fourth quarter, concluding with the guidance for fiscal year 2015.","The third part of the call will be our standard Q&A session. And for the fourth part of the call, Don will close with some final comments.","So at this time, I'll turn it over to Don and ask that you reference Slide #4 titled Highlights, Fiscal Year 2014.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Thank you, Pam, and good morning to everyone on the call. It's great that you were able to take the time to join our call today as we close out our 2014 fiscal year and update you on our progress.","This was a transitional year for Parker, and there was a lot of noise in the numbers, as you've seen, and we'll get into that a lot more in the Q&A.","However, the significance of this year was that we were able to complete the largest series of restructuring efforts in our history and still deliver strong operating performance that we projected going into the fiscal year. This positions us extremely well heading into fiscal 2015, and sets us up for a continued excellent performance beyond that, and I'm talking about especially into 2016, considering the additional restructuring that we're undertaking.","I'm very pleased with where we stand today.","Talk a little bit about 2014, the entire year. We witnessed slow economic conditions early in the year but saw improvement as the year progressed. We were able to deliver record sales in this slow growth environment. We also experienced increased year-over-year growth in orders for every quarter in fiscal year 2014.","Our total segment operating margin was strong at 13.5%, or 14.3% adjusted for restructuring, and that was led by North American margins of 16.7% on an adjusted basis, and we're certainly very pleased with that performance. Earnings per share for the year increased 10%.","The adjustments in this year's earnings included charges related to asset write-downs, a gain associated with our joint venture with General Electric Aviation, and our restructuring activities, all of which that we discussed in prior quarters. Our restructuring activities required a significant amount of management attention, and our team was able to follow through on our commitments to complete those actions.","In total, we incurred $104 million in pretax restructuring expenses, and that translates into about $0.49 per diluted share.","Operating cash flow for the year was $1.4 billion, or 10.5% of sales, and I'm really pleased with this. This is the 13th consecutive year we generated greater than 10% operating cash flow. So ever since we launched the win strategy, cash flow has been greater than 10% for every fiscal year thereafter.","Our use of cash priorities remains the same, as we've stated in the past. Number one is dividends, that's our first priority; acquisitions would follow that; and then, certainly, share repurchases, in that order.","We're increasing the dividend 7 -- or we have increased, I should say, the dividend 7% this year, and that extends our long-standing dividend increase record to 58 consecutive fiscal years. We also repurchased $200 million of our own shares throughout the year, and that's a result of our 10b5-1 program, and that program will continue in fiscal 2015.","Just a couple of highlights on the quarter. We'll go in a little bit more detail later, but sales were a quarterly record in the fourth quarter at $3.53 billion. So that was good. Earnings for the quarter were $1.98 per diluted share or $2.06 adjusted for $0.08 per diluted share in restructuring expenses.","On top of that, we incurred additional onetime restructuring related costs in the quarter, estimated at $0.10 per diluted share, and we can discuss that further, give you some idea as to what those expenses were in the Q&A session.","Segment operating margins were strong at 14.5%, or 15% when adjusted for restructuring and, of course, as you know, 15% has been our target for some time. So we're leaving this fiscal year at a pretty nice level here.","Operating cash flow was also a quarterly record at just over $500 million, or 16% of sales. Once again, we're in an excellent position entering in the New Year.","Just a comment on the outlook. Looking forward to fiscal 2015, we're anticipating another record year and have initiated guidance for adjusted earnings in the range of $7.25 to $8.05 per diluted share, or $7.65 at the midpoint. Keep in mind that the estimates are adjusted for approximately $0.25 per diluted share in additional restructuring efforts in 2015.","Pam will now take you through a little bit more detailed review of the results.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thanks, Don. If everybody would reference Slide #6, I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. If you go all the way to the far right side of this slide, adjusted EPS is detailed for fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2013.","These numbers are adjusted for restructuring expenses, the joint venture gain and the asset write-downs that we previously discussed in prior earnings calls.","So adjusted for the items just mentioned, earnings per share for the full year of fiscal year 2014 came in at $6.94 and this compares to $6.33 last year.","Immediately to the left, adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter are detailed. And fourth quarter earnings are adjusted for restructuring expenses as well. And it came in at $2.06 versus $1.80 for the same quarter last year, an increase of $0.26 or 14%.","Restructuring, as Don said, was $0.08 for the quarter, and this compares to $0.02 last year. Full year restructuring cost for fiscal year 2014 was $0.49 and this compares to $0.07 for fiscal year 2013.","So just to clarify, because I know there were some confusion around this, that the $2.06, the $0.08 has been added back to the $1.98, it does not include the additional $0.10 that was called out in the press release.","So now moving to Slide #7 addressing the earnings per share. This lays out the significant components of the WAC from the adjusted earnings per share of $6.33 that I just mentioned moving to the $6.94 for fiscal year 2014. Here, you can see that the significant items comprising the increase in earnings per share in fiscal year 2014 versus last year is increased segment operating margin of $0.43, so healthy on the operating margin line, and lower below-the-line expenses of $0.13, and this is mainly due to less pension expense that is cost-light, in the other line, below segment operating margin and lower interest cost. The lower tax rate also contributed $0.05.","So moving to Slide 8, addressing the quarter and again, laying out the components of the WAC from the adjusted earnings per share of the $1.80 for the fourth quarter last year to the $2.06 for the fourth quarter of this year. And again, these numbers are adjusted for restructuring cost.","The significant component comprising the increase again, segment operating margins of $0.13, and this is mainly due to North American aerospace offset by international, $0.05, and lower below-the-line expenses of $0.10, again, due to lower pension expense of $0.05 and lower incentive compensation included in corporate G&A of $0.05. And then, of course, the lower tax rate contributed $0.03.","So moving to Slide #9. And again, I'd ask -- this is a busy schedule, obviously, but if you go all the way to the right, the highlighted blue box, sales adjusted for the joint venture is shown, and it shows an increase in sales for the full year of 2.5% versus fiscal 2013.","Acquisitions and currency offset for the most part, resulting in little over 2% organic growth. In the fourth quarter, however, which is detailed in blue on the left, you can see that adjusted organic or reported sales increased 4%. So it did pick up in the fourth quarter, 3.8% on an organic basis and 4.4% on a reported basis, so happy to see that.","The difference between organic and reported is currency, which was positive in the quarter, adding another 0.6%","So looking at the adjusted margins for the full year. Excluding restructuring costs, they're at 14.3% versus 13.9% last year, nice improvement. And for the fourth quarter, adjusted margins reached 15%, and this compares to 14.7% for last","[Audio Gap]","Restructuring cost in the quarter, $18 million, which is the $0.18 that we talked about versus restructuring cost last year of $4 million. And as you know, restructuring costs for the year, as Don mentioned, $104 million. However, $2 million of that $104 million fell below the line in other, and $102 million, as detailed on this page, is included in segment operating income.","The higher segment operating income this year of $1,892,000,000 versus $1,804,000,000 last year, it's really due to higher volume in industrial North America and international, favorable product mix in North America and then realignment savings, or restructuring savings and international, offset by restructuring-related expenses.","So let's move to Slide 10 and address the segments, starting with North America. Again, on the right side of the page, for the full year, North American reported revenues increased slightly to $5.69 billion, and that's from $5.68 billion last year. Adjusting for the unfavorable currency impact of 0.5%, mainly Canadian currency and the contribution from acquisitions of almost 1 point organic growth increase, close to 1%.","Looking to the left and addressing the quarter. Organic and reported revenues increased 4% in the fourth quarter of this year. Acquisitions had no impact on this segment, and the currency impact was minimal.","Adjusted operating income for 2014 increased to $949 million from $911 million in fiscal year 2013. That's a 4% increase, mainly the result of higher volume, favorable product mix and, of course, tight cost control.","Adjusting -- adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter increased to $269 million from $251 million for the same quarter last year, and again, mainly the result of higher volume.","So moving to Slide #11, addressing Diversified Industrial, international. Here, for the full year, organic revenues increased 3%. Currency had no impact, and acquisitions increased revenue by a little less than 1%. So as such, reported revenues increased 3.5% for the year, moving from $5.1 billion last year to $5.3 billion this year.","The increased sales in this segment were due to higher volume in Europe, where sales actually increased 5.5%.","For the fourth quarter, organic sales increased 1%. Currency contributed 2% to sales, resulting in a reported sales increase of slightly over 3%.","Adjusting for realignment cost, operating margin for the full year increased to 12.7% from 12% as the result of this higher volume that I just mentioned and then, of course, savings on the realignment activities, which were partially offset by realignment-related expenses.","For the quarter, adjusted operating margins declined from 12.4% to -- of sales to 11.2%. And again, this is due to the restructuring-related expenses that we've been mentioning and the unfavorable product mix, partially offset by the higher volume and the savings from the restructuring activities.","Our restructuring costs in this segment were $17 million in the fourth quarter versus $3 million a year ago.","So now moving to aerospace, reported in organic revenues, adjusted for the previously announced joint venture, increased slightly more than 4% in the year. The impact of acquisitions and currency, of course, negligible in this segment, as it usually is. And revenues increased mainly due to higher commercial OEM business.","For the quarter, revenues increased 8.6%, and this is mainly due to higher commercial OEM business. Operating margins for the year were relatively flat due to a higher mix of OEM versus MRO business, less defense business, of course, and unusual new program expenses.","Adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter increased to $105 million from $86 million for the same quarter last year, again due to the higher volume. And then we had multiple settlements relating to contractual negotiations included in those numbers.","So let's move to orders. And just to remind everyone, these numbers represent a trailing average, and they're reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, of course, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency.","Diversified Industrial uses a 3-month average, while aerospace systems uses a 12-month average. So as you can see from the slide, total orders were positive 4% for the June quarter just ended. This represents 4 quarters of positive numbers. Diversified Industrial North American orders just ended, increased 6%. International decreased 4% for the quarter, but this is really a comp issue. We were up against a tough comparison.","And then aerospace, of course, increased 17% for the quarter.","So going to the balance sheet. Parker's balance sheet remains strong. Cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet at yearend was $2.2 billion, partially offset by outstanding Commercial Paper of a little more than $800 million.","DSI, or days sales and inventory, came in at 61 days, and this is a 5-day improvement sequentially versus the third quarter. And inventory now is 10.4% of sales. This is an all-time record for Parker and an improvement versus last quarter, where inventory as a percent of sales was 11%.","Accounts receivable, DSO closed at 48. This is a 2-day improvement from last quarter, as well as last year. And weighted average days payable outstanding at the end of June was 58, again, a 2-day improvement sequentially from the March quarter end.","Moving to cash flow here. If you adjust for the pension contributions of $75 million and $226 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2014 and 2013, cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion or 11.1% of sales compares to $1.4 billion last year or 10.9% of sales.","In addition to the cash flow from operation, proceeds of more than $200 million were received from investing activities. Addressing the major uses of cash in the year, $478 million returned to the shareholders via share repurchase of $200 million and, of course, our dividend payments of $278 million.","Commercial Paper outstanding paid down $515 million in the year, and we utilized $216 million, or 1.6% in connection with CapEx.","We also used $625 million in the purchase of marketable securities and other investments during the quarter.","So as a result of this and more, the cash on hand declined by about $168 million year-over-year.","So moving to guidance for fiscal year 2015. Just to address the question of why we would be providing guidance on an adjusted basis. This is the beginning of a new year for us. We've had requests do that. We looked at it very seriously, and we said that, \"Hey, we looked at the comps, we looked at the comparable companies to us, and all of them provided on an adjusted basis.\" So at your request that this year, in line with our culture of continuous improvement, we're presenting the numbers on an adjusted basis, excluding restructuring.","Sales growth is adjusted for the GE joint venture, and segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude restructuring. So on this slide, we've detailed adjusted sales growth, adjusted segment operating margins below the line items, tax, shares outstanding, and reported and adjusted earnings per share. So we're giving you a lot of information here.","Beginning at the top addressing sales. Adjusted sales are expected to increase between 2% and 5%. The majority of this growth is organic as there is no impact from acquisition carryover. The projection for currency contributes 0.4% of sales for the year. And remember, we don't forecast acquisitions that may be done next year in these numbers.","Adjusted segment operating margins. They're forecasted to be between 15.2% and 15.9%, very healthy segment operating margins, the midpoint of 15.6%. And this compares to 14.3% for 2014 on an adjusted basis.","The projection for below-the-line items, which include corporate admin, interest and other, is $490 million for the year, and the full year tax rate is projected at 29%. The number of outstanding shares that we used in the guidance is 151.4 million.","So for the full year, as Don said, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is $7.25 to $8.05, midpoint, $7.65.","And again, that excludes restructuring of $50 million, approximately, to be incurred in fiscal year 2015, and this is a partial carryover from 2014 and nearly initiated restructuring, which is going to enhance the position of this company moving into fiscal year 2016.","The effect of this restructuring on earnings per share is $0.25, with $0.07 each in the first and second quarter, $0.06 in the third quarter and $0.05 in the fourth quarter.","Just a couple of salient points with respect to guidance. Sales are divided 48%, or 6.5 -- $1 billion in the first half; 52%, or $7.1 billion second half; segment operating income, first half, second half is divided 44% in the first half, 56% in the second half; earnings per share, first half, second half, 41%, 59%, or $3.15 billion in the first half and $4.5 billion at the midpoint in the second half, and this excludes restructuring.","First quarter adjusted earnings per share is projected to be at $1.64 at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.07 of restructuring costs.","So just to show you the WAC from fiscal year 2014 up to the forecast or the guidance for fiscal year 2015. Again, the significant items comprising the increase. Segment operating margin of $1.11, and $0.74 of this is international, obviously, because of all the restructuring that's taken place in this year.","This is offset by a higher tax rate and higher below-the-line expenses of $0.16, and this is due mainly to less favorable results from market-driven benefits. We have some benefits that are highly dependent on the performance of the market, and the market was very favorable last year and we're not anticipating that it's going to be as favorable this year.","So for published estimates, we please ask you to exclude the restructuring expenses and hopefully, I explained why. So if everybody is ready, at this time, we'll commence with our standard Q&A session. Thank you very much.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So the question on international margin in the fourth quarter. You did highlight the restructuring, but can you just talk about mix? Because it seems that operating profit was still down despite higher volume. And the question we've been getting from a lot of investors, is restructuring on track? Is that really what's dragging the industrial margin -- international margin? Can you talk about it in more detail?","Jon P. Marten","Yes. Andrew, Jon here. Yes, for the international margins in Q4. One of the reasons that we decided to put in to one of the major sub-bullets in the press release that we wanted to make sure that we explained was, for the quarter, we only had $0.08 in restructuring. We had anticipated a little bit more than that. Part of that answer for the difference between those 2 numbers has to do with the FY '15 guidance and the restructuring in FY '15. But to answer your questions directly. If you remember, we have $60 million in restructuring in Q3, and that $60 million in restructuring in Q3, as we are executing on all of those restructurings, and as we are starting to get reorganized, as we are starting to take a look at exactly what is required for us in the future, given the different levels of employment, given the different configurations of our factories, started to have an impact on us in ways that we had not expected fully. And so we had some additional costs that we're not used to seeing. We called out $0.10. I'm sure we can call out more than $0.10. That impacted our international margins. We look at that as a onetime impact to our international margins for Q4 for these restructuring-related costs. And if you can imagine, trying to reconfigure our factories, trying to move product lines, trying to finalize all of the requirements of executing on all of these projects, costs were incurred, and we wanted to make sure that we explained that in a very transparent way.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just a follow-up question. Just to touch on capital allocation specifically, dividend. Over the past several months, I've seen a lot of your, well, not peers, but even machinery companies have raised their dividend payout ratios. And your dividend payout ratio now even lags, Joy, Cummins, forget about multi-industrial names. You have stated that dividend is the top priority for the company. So how do I square the fact that you have one of the most stable cash flows of anybody, and one of the lowest payout ratios than anybody? What do you guys think about that?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, this is Don, Andrew. The -- first of all, dividends is #1. There's no question about it. It's #1. We've done a lot with dividends over the last number of years. I think over the last 5 years, we were almost up 100%, somewhere in that vicinity. So it's not like we haven't done anything, and we recognize what you're talking about that we were low -- a little bit low. But the other things that have been happening here that, in a positive sense, is that we're generating a hell of a lot more money in this company. And so this is kind of a high-class problem. We're trying to catch up to where our performance has been running. In '14 -- fiscal '14, we increased the dividend of about 7%. Last year, we increased it to 10%. And I stated that, in this coming year, probably January timeframe, we'll be looking for another increase in the dividend. Our payout was -- our old target was 25%. Our new target's 30%. We're going to do that over a period of a couple of years. We're inching our way there. We're at about 27% right now, and we're going to be moving that up to 30%. But it won't happen all at one time. We're planning to do it in a logical fashion, kind of a gradual fashion, get up to 30%. So -- and of course, we want to maintain the 58-year record that we have, so we're going to continue this for the foreseeable future. I don't anticipate this ever stopping. We'll continue to raise dividends onto the future.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But 30% would only get you involved with machinery guys.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, it all depends on what else we have that we're trying to do here, too. I think the other priorities are acquisitions. We have done a lot of acquisitions in the past. We anticipate continuing to want to do acquisitions. So our priority beyond maintaining some reasonable parity with the rest of the pack is to grow the company and put the money into acquisitions and new product development, things like that. So if we don't have good places to put the money, of course, we can always go back to dividends and hit dividends a little bit harder in the future. I don't anticipate that's going to be the case, at least, not in the foreseeable future, but it could be down the road.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can we just talk a little bit more about the restructuring and the issues that you have there? Is this just simply moving product lines has been more difficult? Or are you finding that you have to do more restructuring because things are just not very bright in Europe and in rest of the world? Just a little bit more around what actually is going on in the restructuring.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes, Ann. This is Don, I guess I can maybe add a little bit to what we've said earlier. I think when you -- and I've been through enough restructurings in my career, so I can tell you pretty much first hand that this is nothing different than what we've seen in the past. We just haven't done one this big in the past. A lot of this has to do with closing facilities, opening facilities in other locations. You got more scrap, you got lower productivity in the new place. You got people that, frankly, are working at a slower pace, knowing that they're going to lose their jobs, so that's production variance in the existing locations, anticipating a move to the new location. So you've got some of that going on. There were some profit-sharing issues that we ran into through negotiations in one of the countries that cost us little bit more. This is a onetime thing. I think the -- and then we have some ongoing challenges from the standpoint that in some of the contracts that we negotiated in a particular region, some of that's hinged on to actual expense. The specific expense will depend on the ability of the employees that were let go, them finding work. So some of that is variable and still yet to be determined, but that happens as well. A couple of other things that -- areas that you got to keep in mind is the overlap. When you're closing on one factory, you're starting up in another factory or moving product lines, you're double staffing. You got to keep the staff in the old facility, while you're moving to the new facility because you got to still serve the customer while you're going through this training period. I'd like to use the example of running a product, say, at 50 feet a minute is normal in the old facility or existing facility. You don't start up at 50 feet a minute in the new facility. You start up at 10 and maybe go to 20, then 30 and 40. So over a period of time, you get up to that efficiency that you're running in the old facility. But in the meantime, you 'regenerating variances. All these variances that I'm talking about are flowing through our P&L. And believe me, they are impossible to capture. John was talking earlier about $0.10. $0.10 is just the top portion of that, that we're trying to grasp but nobody is out there monitoring every nib here as we go through this restructuring. We've got more important things to do. We just know that the number is a lot bigger than that, but we're just letting that flow through the P&Ls. The other things that you might run into as -- and I know we did, cleaning up the old factory. As you prepare -- as you clean it out and you get it ready to sell, you got to clean it up, you got to clean up the surroundings and whatever. That's all expense that flows through the P&L. And then airfreight. I could give you an example, but I won't of airfreight as to where we found some of our airfreight. It was an unfortunate situation that happened with a plane crash. But airfreight is certainly part of the challenge because you've got facilities that are not running at the same speed that they should be. Customers still want their product when they want it. So we put more product into air. All of those additional expenses end up flowing through the P&L. So I know that's a lot, but that's basically what we're facing. We're just not -- we're not able to capture every penny of that, and we're not trying to. We captured $0.10 pretty easily, but there's probably another 2x or 3x that, that flows through the P&L we're not even capturing.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, Don. That's good color. So just in summary, I just want to make sure that what you're saying is that it's not that demand is weaker than you expected in international markets and you have to cut deeper, it's just that getting through all of the changes that you've laid out is just costing you more. Is that -- am I interpreting that correctly?","Donald E. Washkewicz","That's correct. It's the inefficiencies of moving operations from the status quo to something else than a status quo. That's exactly right.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just my follow-up question. If you could give us your normal color on your 3\/12s and 12\/12s by end market, that would be great.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Okay. Well, maybe I'll start with the PMIs. I kind of like to kind of through those. Just looking at those, and we look at these on a monthly basis and on a quarterly basis, the -- right now -- and we're tracking -- we typically track all of them here, but the ones that I look at closely are the global PMI, the U.S., the Eurozone, Germany being a good representative of a stronger country in Europe and China and Brazil. So those are kind of the ones we look at. Just characterize the 3 points what we're seeing. First of all, all the PMIs are greater than 50%, which is a good sign, with one exception, and that's Brazil, which is running at about 49%. So that's good. They're all -- all of those areas that I just mentioned are greater than 50%. The largest increase, or largest PMI increase is, I should say, from March to July timeframe were in 2 areas, one was U.S. and the other was China. And both of those increased 3 points, which is a pretty strong increase. We don't often see a 3-point jump. But both in the U.S. and in China, we saw 3-point jumps. And then the largest PMI in absolute numbers right now is North America and U.S., which is running at about 57%. So that's a real strong rate of activity in North America. So that's kind of the PMI trend. If you look at some of our markets, I'm going to give you some of the strong ones. Actually, the list of strong ones are -- it's getting pretty long relative to the negative market trends and the flat ones. The strong ones would be commercial aftermarket and OEM. On the aerospace side, that's a strong segment for us. Distribution remains strong, extremely strong. I'll talk a little bit about the 3\/12s there in a minute. Machine tools, power generation, telecom, oil and gas, marine, off-highway construction and mining, all strong -- mining, of course, coming off of a low base, but you're seeing some pickup in activity there even though it's at a low level. Also strong right now when you look at the 3\/12s and 12\/12s is the heavy-duty trucks. And then lastly, on the refrigeration and air-conditioning side, both industrial and commercial refrigeration and then residential and commercial air-conditioning are both positive. So you could see that's a pretty long list. But I'd have to say being led by distribution, keep in mind, distribution is half of our North America -- half of our industrial business, rather, is distribution. Having that segment being that strong, I think, helps offset some of the weaker OEM segments that we see. So then on the negative side, or negative trends, we would have the defense part of our aerospace business, both on the OEM and MRO. Semiconductor being negative now, pharma and ag, finally turned negative, that had been going strong for some time, and that's turned negative. Forestry and then general industrial segments. So those will be the negative ones. You can see the list is relatively short. And then flat segments would be -- market segments or market trends would be life sciences, cars and light trucks, process and industrial trucks and material handling. So that would be -- those will be the flat segments. Then if we look at the regions, and you see some of this in your number, you don't see quite this detail in the order trend number but I'll just kind of highlight for you what the regions look like on a 3\/12, 12\/12. Of course, North America being very strong right now, 3\/12 track and well above 100% in the neighborhood of 106%, 107%. And then 12\/12, well above 100% as well. We see a weakening trend in Europe. Not significant but nevertheless, a weakening trend on a 3\/12, just slightly under 100%. So that's actually going to drag the 12\/12 down a little bit. 12\/12's still tracking slightly above 100%. Flat segment would be Asia. 3\/12's running around 100%. 12\/12's running a little bit above 100%, and then weakening -- what we see as a weakening trend is Latin America. And that's dropped down on a 3\/12 basis to about 90%. So when you look at the order trend numbers we give you on a quarterly basis, we don't give you quite that same detail, but I'm giving you a little bit more color here on those specific segments that you wouldn't normally see. So then looking at some of those markets that I've talked about before. On an order trend basis, again distribution being strong, the 3\/12 level on distribution runs at 110%. So you can see that's a real strong segment for us, and the 12\/12 is running around 108%. So that continues to be extremely strong. Heavy-duty truck, likewise, is running around 110% on a 3\/12, which is really good. Improving is construction, although at a lower level that we're seeing, that's slightly above 100% on a 3\/12. Semicon, I mentioned, is softening. That's running around 80% on a 3\/12. Ag is weakening. That's around 85% on a 3\/12. Again, these are our numbers, our order entry numbers, they might not match exactly what you see in the rest of the marketplace or with other peer companies or whatever. This is what we're seeing. Process markets are flat. And then aerospace, of course, is very strong at 3\/12 running around 120%, but keep in mind, there's -- a lot of these orders can be up further than this fiscal year. And in fact, in many cases, here in aerospace, they have or they are beyond this fiscal year. So that would be kind of a recap on the markets and some of the order trends.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So my first question is on the industrial international guidance and specifically the margins. If you take a baseline of an adjusted margin of 12.7% for this year, you're still looking for, at the midpoint, 250 basis points in margin expansion in industrial international. Included there are a variety of different moving parts. You called out the $0.10 in onetime costs. There's some kind of underlying incremental margin number that you're embedding, but there's also benefits that are expected to come through. So I was wondering if you could touch on those 3 key points and what your expectations are for the margin ramp for next year.","Jon P. Marten","Well, I think, Joe, in international industrial for next year, by our worksheets that we have here, we are showing that we're going to, first, recoup all the savings that we had from this year, which is, for the entire year, at around $60 million. We'll also get some of the savings that we're incurring in the restructuring that we're doing for FY '15 in the margins for international. Most of the restructuring that we're doing in FY '15 is affecting the international operations or industrial. And then with a very, very modest marginal return on sales for the industrial international at the beginning of the year, and then ramping up as the year goes on, this gets to the, what Pam was talking about, the 41, 59 EPS impact first half, second half. A major driver there is what we're expecting as the year goes on for the international margins for us. So yes, it's a big number, and we all have detailed it out very -- in a great amount of detail. And we know your notation of it, too, here because we are expecting that to really help drive our record results for next year.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, maybe just following on there -- a couple of follow-ons for that. The -- one, can you quantify the FY '15 restructuring savings that you expect to come through? And then further, it seems like you took on additional costs to the tune of $0.10, call it roughly $20 million. How do you gain comfort that while you're going through this restructuring, that you're not going continue to see additional costs pop up?","Jon P. Marten","Well, number one, Joe, that will be a risk. I mean, we feel like we've got it monitored in there for FY '15. As Don talked about, we don't do this all the time. We're not experts at it. But what we did in FY '14 was the biggest in the history of the company by a factor of more than 5x. And so we're not experts at it, but we do feel like that, as we were putting our estimates together for FY '15, that all of our operating groups around the world were in the midst of those issues. And so we've got that duly geared into our estimates for FY '15 by unit, by region for the year. And then to answer your other question, Joe, we're expecting the $50 million in restructuring for next year, $23 million in pretax savings.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you called out -- in the quarter, I think you called out some -- I think you said specifically in the aero segment, there were some multiple settlements to contract negotiations. What was the impact of that to the quarter?","Jon P. Marten","I don't have that number on the top of my head, but to give you a sense of what that is, our guidance for next year is about 150 basis points better than our return on sales for this year. So we feel like our go-forward run rate for next year is 13.5%. So whatever that 13.5% versus that result for the Q4, that would be, in round numbers, the unusual lumpy, in this case, for this quarter, good news in our results. So we wouldn't want to give you the impression that we could hit that run rate that we saw in Q4 going forward. Does that answer your question, Joe?","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. And I guess I can follow up after for the exact number.","Operator","Our next question will come from Nathan Jones from Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So Don, let's start with my side question every quarter. You've obviously got a very strong balance sheet. Haven't got any M&A across the line for about 6 quarters now. Why no buyback?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, Nathan, you haven't been paying attention. We did get one across the line.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Anything of meaningful size?","Donald E. Washkewicz","It was a tiny one, though, Nathan. But anyway, no. With respect to acquisitions, first of all, I just have to just tell you where we're at on that. We're looking at a lot, okay? There's no question, we're looking at a lot. We are in due diligence on some, okay, right now as we speak, and we expect to get some through. Still, the values are high, so it's a challenge on some of these getting to where you want to get to. For everyone 100 we look at, we maybe get through due diligence at 10. So it's hard to predict just where we're going to end up, but we do have some activity going on as we speak. And we realize that we have plenty of capacity to do these. So this is where we'd like to spend the money. But having said that, as I said in the past, and I will repeat just for everybody on the call that if we don't get these across the finish line, our priority then falls to share repurchase. And I told you last -- I think it was last year that I was going to do that by the end of this year, and this will be this calendar year, which we're closing out here in the next few months. So we would go into the share repurchase mode if I don't get enough of these acquisitions to the finish line.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Does that imply that it's your expectation or that some of these deals are pretty close to getting done?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, in all different stages, I can't -- I cannot predict because every time I think that we're just about there, sometimes things happen, and I just -- it puts the brakes on. So I can just tell you that we are in due diligence on several right now. And so we'll see. I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll get something or some of these through.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up question is on the North American industrial margin guidance for next year. You've talked on the call today about distribution being very strong, above average growth, which is obviously a much higher margin for you. You've got 5% midpoint organic revenue growth, and the margin guidance at the midpoint is flat. Is there some kind of pricing pressure or something else that's holding those margins back?","Jon P. Marten","I think that on the top level, Nathan, is our view of the marketplace that we are at all-time record high margins for us in North America. And as we were putting our guidance together for FY '15, we, of course, have our target of 30% marginal return on sales at this stage of the cycle. But we could not get to that level. We're at a little shy of that. As we dig into it a little bit deeper, there are various reasons for that. Most of the reasons have to do with our investments and some of our new technologies, our R&D that we're trying to do, trying to secure our growth for the future, and that is having an impact on the margin and return on sales in North America in our guidance for FY '15.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Could you quantify the impact of the investments in R&D?","Jon P. Marten","Well, I can tell you this, that it is broad-based. It is deep. We are focused on it in every single group. It's hard for me to give you a number right now, but that is certainly the lion's share, the vast majority of the difference for the -- our normal 30 versus what you would see right now, which is about, as you said, 18 or 15. So it's the lion's share, Nathan, but I can't get any more granular than that with you here this call today.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just to go back to an earlier question and Jon's response to it. Is the roughly flattish Q1 outlook for earnings driven entirely by an expectation that you need another quarter to clear out the international industrial issues? Or is it -- is there something else?","Jon P. Marten","Yes. There's several different issues there, Andy. One of them is, again, our restructuring that we'll be doing in Q1. One of them is our investments in the R&D that we're in the midst of in many, many of our North American operations. And then if you -- when you dig into it and you look at Q1 in our guidance versus Q1 last year, there is a significant number that is negative for us in the FY '15 guidance due to our tax rate that we're going to be using, which is 29%, and which assumes our run rate here for FY '15.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the $0.16 headwind from corporate interest and other. Could you give a little bit more color as to what's going on there?","Pamela J. Huggins","Yes. One of the things I want to mention as well, Andy. We had a pickup in pension expense last year of about $0.17, and that doesn't repeat this year. Every -- that doesn't repeat this year as well. So that is affecting the first quarter, as well as all of the quarters. So I just wanted to mention that. And then as far as corporate. We have always said that corporate runs about 1.5% of sales. Now last year, it did run a little less than that. And this year, it's running about at the 1.5% of sales. But again, it gets back to what I said earlier. We have some incentive programs that are based on the performance of the market. And the market performed very well last year, and it's not expected to perform at that same level. We haven't built that in. So that's really the difference that you're seeing there.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Can we talk a little bit more about the -- some of the top line assumptions there? I guess I'm surprised that aerospace also shows a negligible adjusted change, a couple of percent, given the concentration on orders. I think it's pushed out, or what's going on? In the slide deck, you talked about the R&D spending here. Is that what's driving the margin up? And then the same question for Diversified Industrial North America, with the long lines of favorable 3\/12 and 12\/12 curve. I guess I'm sort of a little surprised that you're running with a low- to mid-single-digit type of top line gain.","Jon P. Marten","Well, Eli, first on the aerospace answer. The major driver there that is impacting us for FY '15 is our inability to generate revenues due to the sequestration, which is now is finally catching up with us. And if you take a look at a couple of major programs, military OEM programs, they are starting to impact us in FY '15. And those 2 major programs is what is really taking our prior run rate in Aerospace at about 8%. In normal times, we'll be around 4% or 5%. We're also seeing the impact in FY '15 of the elimination of sales due to the closure of the joint venture that we did with our engine partner in FY '14. So that's impacting the numbers also as you look at the...","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","You're right. 2% to 3% was an adjusted number against the already taken out the...","Jon P. Marten","Yes. The major driver there, if you've got the GE JV in your numbers there, the major driver then is the 2 military OEM programs, JSF, C17, which are impacting us. And it is having an impact on us and has what is the major reason for taking down our historical growth rates that we've seen in the past.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Will that be for the foreseeable future? In other words, until we get some sort of change of policy, do we have to carry that into '16 the same basis?","Jon P. Marten","Certainly, the C17 is very grim right now. So that will be 1\/2 of it. The JSF could come back. But I think the growth rates for aerospace normalized going forward past FY '15 within the 5% to 6% range, not the numbers that you're seeing here for some of the gaps that we're seeing here for FY '15. And Eli, for your question on North America. We felt like that those numbers are in line with what we're seeing with our orders. I know that distributions are up significantly, but when we're doing that guidance, of course, as you know, it includes the OEM and that drives that number down a little bit. And so we felt like that's a number that really fairly represents what's been happening with the orders for North America over time, which is very, very healthy for us.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And that number is why you have relatively flat margins for North America?","Jon P. Marten","Well, relatively flat only because of our investment in R&D that we're really focusing in on. And again, Eli, we're at the 16%, 17% ROS range there, and it -- those are record levels for us. We've done that before, but we've not done appreciably higher than that before ever. We want to. We are aspirational, and we expect that, but this is not something that we would put in our full year guidance for FY '15.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mig Dobre from Robert W. Baird.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Would you care to comment about order cadence maybe through the quarter? Anything that you might have seen maybe in August thus far, rather July?","Jon P. Marten","I think that -- first, for July. July is supportive of our guidance. I don't want to give you any overly optimistic response or a pessimistic response. It's just kind of supportive of our guidance in July. And I think that's probably the question that you've -- that you're getting to. So we're looking at it very, very carefully. And of course, we're aware of the macro picture, and we understand where the markets are moving and where they're trending is done, laid out in the 3\/12. And so we are, right now, comfortable with our guidance.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Then if may press you a little bit here. I'm looking at industrial international, and I understand that the quarter had a tough comp from an order standpoint. But your orders are -- were down 4%, and you're guiding for revenue growth for fiscal '15. So I'm trying to understand, given that you're comps are getting tougher going forward, where is it that you're expecting acceleration? Any particular region or end market? What gives you that confidence?","Jon P. Marten","Yes. I think that -- on that, by region, and I appreciate you pointing out the tough comps because that's clearly an issue for us here for the international. But the -- we are seeing Asia start to very slowly but surely move up. And we are -- I've got a projection out there for a 3 -- almost 3.5% growth for Asia for us all together in FY '15, much less so in Europe and negative in Latin America.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'll just keep it short just because we're already post the hour. I guess, just, Jon, back to the balance sheet again. The M&A is taking longer to happen. The payout ratio is still below your peers. You haven't really done much on that share repurchase. I mean, is there -- as we think about the end of calendar year 2014 where you sort of -- you drew the line in the sand, is there a way for us to -- how we should think about a targeted debt-to-capital ratio? I mean, how should we think about that towards the end of the year because your balance sheet, still, is underutilized or are you sort of backing away from having a more efficient balance sheet?","Jon P. Marten","Well, good question, Jamie. No, I'd -- we'd like to ultimately have more efficient balance sheet, for sure. And like I said, it'll be a meaningful -- if we don't get the acquisitions done because it's been, like you said, 1.5 years now. We've been talking about this. We got a couple of tiny ones through, but it's not going to move the needle. So if we don't do something, it'll be a meaningful share repurchase, let me put it that way. And that will be moving in the direction of getting our leverage back up, maybe not as high as it was in the past, but it's certainly up considerably from where we are right now. And then going on into the next year, I would say that, that same trend would continue. If we don't do the acquisitions, we will be prompt and do the share repurchase and\/or dividend increases, like I mentioned before, because we do want to raise the dividend over time. But I think we'll be able to do both, especially with the level of margin performance that we're generating here, earnings performance. I think we'll be able to do both.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I'm just curious, and I apologize if this is a slightly impolite question, Don. But I think you're probably going to retire in this coming fiscal year. Please correct me if I'm wrong. But if I'm not, is there anything you'd like to tell us about what that transition might look like timing-wise or anything else?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, I knew we should have cut that question. Yes. We have a kind of a policy here, which I haven't changed. That is a 65 years age policy as far as retirement from this position. So that will happen this calendar year, this coming calendar 2015. And the exact date has not been finalized with the Board. I think those discussions are happening as we speak. Our intent would be to -- my replacement -- my intention would have my replacement come from inside the company. And I think we have some very good candidates in the company under consideration. So that's what I can tell you right now is that yes, you're correct. 2015 would be the year that I would step down as CEO. The question then going beyond that would be what -- in what capacity, if any, would I continue with the company. And of course, that has to be decided by the board as well. But for sure, the CEO -- President\/CEO title would be given up sometime this year.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So it sounds like you're telling me, calendar '15, and I said fiscal '15. Is that a distinction you're trying to make?","Donald E. Washkewicz","No. Actually, my birthday doesn't come until next fiscal. So technically, I could stay on beyond this fiscal year. But that's why I just say it's the calendar year. And if you want to, I can tell you what date, if you want to send anything.","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of Nicole from Morgan Stanley.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just a quick clarification, Pam. When you guys gave the EPS breakdown from 1 half to 2 half, did you say that was including restructuring?","Pamela J. Huggins","Yes. We gave adjusted guidance that excludes restructuring. And we're asking that you put your estimates out there under the same...","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So when you said the 41% to 59% breakdown, that was excluding restructuring as well?","Pamela J. Huggins","That is correct.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then the restructuring. Is that going to be -- it seems like you guys are expecting to realize the bulk or all of the payback next year. So is it fair to assume that the restructuring is going to be front-end loaded as well?","Jon P. Marten","Well, right now, it's about 60% front-end loaded, yes. But there will be some in the second half, Nicole, so we want to make sure that we say that to you, too.","Pamela J. Huggins","Okay. Thank you. I think at this time, we'll turn it over to Don, who has some closing comments.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. Just a couple of comments, and then I'll make some additional remarks. But first of all, some things to remember about fiscal '15 that we covered here, just kind of a recap is that, we're going to have another $50 million in restructuring. I look at that as a positive as far as the outlook for the future. And so just keep that in the back of your mind. We'll have record -- we're projecting record operating margins for next fiscal year.","We -- if you take the restructuring out, we'll be at a record. If you include it in the numbers, we'll be at -- we'll tie the all-time record for the company. So we're -- the restructuring we did this fiscal year was exactly what we needed to be working on and produced exactly the kind of results that we wanted to produce going forward to build on this foundation that we have. So I'm really excited about where we're at and what it means for fiscal '15.","I hope everybody's happy with the 15.6% numbers that we're putting out there as far as operating margins. 3% growth, I think is -- hey, if some of these segments come back, like if Europe comes back, or if Latin America comes back, or if anything comes back, I mean, it can grow from that base. But we feel comfortable with the 3% based on what we see happening out there right now.","Of course, we're going to have an opportunity to refresh that with you every quarter going forward. And if we see something strengthening, we can certainly change that top line number. But I -- we feel pretty confident now. As you mentioned, we have a strong balance sheet, and I appreciate the comments about how we're going to utilize the capacity that we have. Is hope that I was clear as to what our intent is. Yes, we do want to move our leverage up back where it used to be or closer to that point, so we will be taking actions this calendar year to do that, one way or the other.","And then I think if you -- it's not too much of a stretch. If you look at the restructuring we're planning to do on '15, and you look at the fact that we're already at 15.5%, or 15.6% operating margin, we -- and I'll be the first one to go out and say this. Maybe I'll get hit here by the rest of my team, but 16% by '16 might be in the cards. As long as we maintain some tailwind here, I think you can see we're not -- we're within striking distance of that. And that would be a fantastic accomplishment for the company. Again, I'm not here forecasting '16 for you, I just want to give you an indication of how you might be thinking about long-term forecast for the company. I think we've certainly done so much this last year to position ourselves for a great '15 and beyond that I think you're going to like the answer as we go forward.","So I want to just lastly then, just thank everyone on the call for joining us. Of course, like I said, it has been a transitional year, and it was necessary to go through this rightsizing, if you will, of our operations, particularly in Europe. Those changes are never easy, and they're not easy on the team. The management team worked very hard on this, and I'm happy to say that we accomplished what we set out to accomplish and we hit our targets that we wanted to do.","I also like to take this opportunity to thank our global team for their diligence and hard work on executing all of our fiscal 2014 plans. Like I said, we're in a much stronger position now to deliver on our goal of 15% segment operating margins and fiscal year '15 and really now, even more so, over the cycle. That's kind of where we're heading here as we move these margins up. We want it that 15% over the cycle. And I think we're well on our way to being able to do that. I want to thank everyone on the call for your continued interest and support of the company, and I want to wish everyone a great day. And then lastly, Pam will be around for the balance of the day if you have any additional questions, she'll be taking calls, along with Todd, throughout the balance of the afternoon. So have a good day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Deborah, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Pamela Huggins, Vice President and Treasurer. Please proceed, ma'am.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thank you, Deborah. Good morning, everyone. It's Pam speaking. I'd like to welcome you to Parker Hannifin's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Release Teleconference. Joining me today is Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Don Washkewicz; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Marten. For those of you who wish to do so, you may follow today's presentation with the PowerPoint slides that have been presented on Parker's website at www.phstock.com. For those of you not on the line, those slides will remain posted on the company's Investor information website 1 year after today's call, and that's the same website, phstock.com.","So at this time, reference Slide #2 in the slide deck, which is the Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements. And if you haven't already done so, please take note of this statement in its entirety.","On Slide #3, this slide is required to indicate that in cases where non-GAAP numbers have been used, again, they've been reconciled to the appropriate GAAP numbers and are posted on Parker's website at phstock.com.","To cover the agenda for today on Slide #4, the call will be in 4 parts. First, Don, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, will provide highlights for the quarter. Second, I'll provide a review, including key performance measures of the third quarter, concluding with the fiscal year 2013 guidance. The third part of the call will obviously consist of the standard Q&A session. And with the fourth part, Don will close with some final comments. So at this time, I'm going to turn it over to Don and ask that you refer to Slide #5 titled Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Highlights.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Thanks, Pam, and welcome to everyone on the call. We certainly appreciate your participation today. I'll just make a couple of comments, and then I'm going to turn it back over to Pam for some more detailed review of the quarter.","As you can see, we continue to perform very well despite a challenging global growth environment. Our results this quarter were in line with our third quarter guidance. Therefore from that standpoint, we're doing pretty well. Organic sales were down 6%, as you could see, but were offset by acquisition growth of 4%. And I would like just to keep in mind, have everyone keep in mind, as we mentioned last quarter, higher-margin sales are down and the lower-margin acquisition sales at the early part of the integration, our lower-margin business for us, so that's -- that we'll talk about a little bit later. Soft business conditions are still being seen globally. However, order trends appear to have been -- to bottom out -- have been bottomed out in pretty much all the regions. In the quarter thus far, order trends in April, we'll give you a little preview of this quarter, how it's starting up so far, are in line with our projections for the fourth quarter. So we like what we're seeing in -- early in April, still early, but the order trends look good. As a result, we've maintained our earnings guidance at the mid-point and narrowed the range for the year, and that's pretty typical of what we do after the third quarter in each fiscal year.","A few other comments on the quarter. Net income for the quarter was $257 million or $1.68 a share. And that's within our guidance and above the mid-point of the implied guidance range that we provided last quarter, which was about $1.64. So we're a little bit ahead of that. The year-over-year decline in the earnings per share is primarily due to lower organic sales, as I indicated earlier in the Industrial segment, and acquisition-related and integration costs. Total segment operating margin of 14% was very good considering the decline in volume and reflects our global team's response to a changing market condition. Everyone is doing, I think, a very, very good job managing the business through this period.","The company continued to perform very well on a cash flow basis, generating $371 million in operating cash flow in the quarter or 11.2% of sales. And I might point out that Parker is continuing a long trend of generating double-digit operating cash flows of sales even during difficult market condition, and I think that's what's so special about this company.","With respect to dividends, year-to-date, we have raised the dividend by 10% with a 5% increase in January, the last quarter that we spoke, followed by another 5% increase as announced in the press release today. So that's 10% for the year. We have now more than doubled our dividend payout in the last 5 years. And of course, as you know, we -- this continues our 57 consecutive years of raising dividends for the company. So we're very happy about that as well.","We continued our share repurchase activity as we indicated we would, buying back $49 million of Parker's stock in the quarter and bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to $206 million, and we're going to buy back another approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter, in line with the 10b5-1 program. So that's what we're going to do in the fourth quarter.","As a reminder, we made 8 acquisitions so far this fiscal year, which total almost $0.5 billion in sales. We also divested the automotive air conditioning portion of the CIC group or segment. We continue to evaluate acquisitions opportunities as we go forward. We have the capacity to pursue acquisitions should that opportunity present itself.","Innovation likewise continues as an area of focus. During the quarter, we formalized an agreement with the Shepherd Center in Atlanta to support the clinical evaluation in planned 2014, which would be this coming fiscal year, commercialization of Parker, what we call Indego. And that's a powered exoskeleton that allows people with paraplegia to walk again. So we're pretty excited about that as a new-to-the world-type product that we're going to be introducing.","Looking at the remainder of this year, the mid-point of our fiscal 2013 guidance remains the same. And we are tightening the range, and we now anticipate earnings per diluted share of $6.25 to $6.65. So we're going to end up somewhere in that range. We're not just sure where, but we'll be in the range somewhere. As a reminder, these estimates versus last year include an expected increase in pension expense of approximately $0.35 per share as a lower discount rate is required for accounting purposes that reflects current market conditions for interest rates.","So that's a quick overview of some of the highlights for the quarter. You can see where we're at. We're very pleased with the results so far as we're progressing through this fiscal year. And it looks like we've got a decent start to the fourth quarter. So if that continues, we're going to finish the year off in a pretty good shape. So with that, I'm going to turn the meeting back over to Pam, who will get in a little bit more detail.","Pamela J. Huggins","Okay. So if you just reference Slide #6 right now, I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.68, and this is -- while we don't give quarterly guidance, this was really $0.04 above the mid-point of the previously provided guidance range that we did provide. And just to talk about the beat for a minute, the beat versus the mid-point, that increase came in -- we beat on North America $0.03, Aerospace $0.01, and then below-the-line items to offset with higher other expense and lower taxes. The $1.68 is an increase of 41% sequentially, but a decrease of $0.33 or 17% versus the $2.01 from the same quarter a year ago.","So just to lay out for you the puts and takes of that $0.33 decrease. Decreased segment operating income accounts for $0.24 of the $0.33, and this is mainly due to the Industrial International and the continued softness in Europe and Asia; higher corporate general and administrative costs of $0.02, and this is due to higher market-driven employee benefits; higher other expense of $0.05, mainly as a result of higher pension costs, and we've talked about this on several calls now; higher taxes impacted earnings per share by $0.05, mainly due to the geographical earnings mix; and then, of course, less shares were outstanding, impacting the EPS favorably by $0.03, and this is the result of the share repurchases that we've done.","So moving to Slide #8 and looking at the top line. Reported revenues for the quarter were 2.5% below last year, coming in at $3.3 billion. As Don said, acquisitions added 4% to revenue in the quarter, but that was offset by the 6% decline in the base business. And we had negative currency impact of almost 1%, and that equates to about $0.03 in the third quarter for the currency impact. Segment operating margins for the quarter decreased 110 basis points from 15.1% to 14% due to the Industrial segment, while Aerospace and CIC actually saw increasing margins versus last year. So on a sequential basis, margins are up 200 basis points. We're really proud of this 14% margin in a slow growth and acquisitive environment. Please note that acquisition, divestiture, integration and related expenses are included in these numbers. And in the quarter, Parker incurred $0.01 in restructuring charges and on a year-to-date basis, $0.04. And we're expecting restructuring to come in at $0.08 to $0.10.","So now moving to Slide 9 and focusing on segments commencing with North America. North American organic revenues decreased 8% in the quarter. Acquisitions added 6% to revenues, and currency was relatively minor in this segment. So reported revenues decreased 2%. Operating income decreased from $227 million to $209 million, a 9% decrease over the prior year. And then operating margin's very strong at 16.3% for the quarter.","Continuing with the Industrial segment moving to International. Organic revenues decreased 7% for the quarter. Currency was a deduction to revenues in the quarter of 2%. This is mainly where we see our currency impact, and it was mainly due to the weakness of the yen and the real in Brazil. Acquisitions added 5% of sales, so reported revenues decreased 4% for the quarter. Operating margins decreased 290 basis points to 12.3% from 15.2%, reflecting the impact of reduced sales in Asia and Latin America and the impact of the acquisitions that Don talked about.","So moving to Slide #11 and focusing on the Aerospace segment. Aerospace third quarter reported an organic revenues, increased 7% in the quarter. Acquisitions and currency had no impact. Margins increased 180 basis points for the quarter to 13.9% from 12.1%, and this is in spite of higher non-recurring engineering charges and represents higher MRO in the quarter.","So moving to the Climate and Industrial Controls segment. This slide indicates that core and reported revenues were down 18% as currency was minimal. However, as disclosed last quarter, this segment includes the divestiture. The prior year number hasn't been restated for this divestiture. And had the restatement occurred, revenues would have decreased approximately 3%. With less revenues, segment operating margins as a percent of sales increased to 10.5% from 9.3% a year ago\t.","So now moving to Slide 13, addressing orders. Just to remind everyone, these numbers represent a trailing 3-month average, and they're reported as a percentage increase of the absolute dollars year-over-year excluding acquisitions and currency. Aerospace is reported using a 12-month rolling average. As you can see from this slide, orders declined 7% for the March quarter just ended, reflecting softness in North America and continuing weakness in international. North American orders for the quarter decreased 10%. Industrial International orders decreased 7%, and Aerospace orders were flat for the quarter. Climate and Industrial Controls orders decreased 1%. But the direction for orders in April is positive, but it's probably too soon to call it a trend.","So moving to the balance sheet. Parker's balance sheet remains strong. Notes payable and long-term debt payable 1 year -- within 1 year increased primarily due to a higher amount of commercial paper outstanding at the end of the quarter. Commercial paper outstanding at quarter end was more than offset, however, by the amount of cash on hand. DSI, days sales in inventory, was 67 days versus 57 last year, and this increase is due to inventory in connection with acquisitions. The base business inventory is actually down $40 million. Accounts receivable in terms of DSO outstanding closed at 49 days, and that's 1 day less than last year. Weighted average days payable outstanding at the end of March was 56 versus 54 at the end of June. So I think you can see pretty much that the manage -- the working capital is being managed appropriately.","Moving to Slide 15. In the quarter, operating activities generated $371 million in cash or 11.2% of sales. Just to walk through the major uses of the cash in the quarter, $225 million was utilized to retire a medium-term note that matured in February, $114 million returned to the shareholders via share repurchases of $50 million -- it was actually $49 million, I'm rounding up, and dividend payments of $64 million. $74 million or 2.2% of sales was utilized in connection with CapEx.","Now moving to guidance. The guidance for fiscal year 2013 is shown on Slide 17 -- or 16 through 18. Moving to the next slide, you can see the guidance for revenues and operating margins by segment has been provided, and I'm not going to read through all of these numbers for you here. But I will say that guidance has been provided in total for the items below segment operating income, and that is $471 million at the mid-point. This amount is a little bit higher than the prior year due to higher pension cost as a result of the requirement to lower the discount rate. And we've talked about this on several calls as well.","So summarizing the guidance on a diluted earnings per share basis. The guidance for fiscal year 2013 is projected to be $6.25 to $6.65, $6.45 at the mid-point. The components of the changes, as you can see on this slide, they really haven't changed that much. We gained $0.03 in operating income and then lost $0.03 below the line. So the fiscal year guidance remains the same last quarter versus this quarter at the mid-point. Please [ph] remember that the forecast excludes any further acquisitions or the divestitures that may be made in fiscal year 2013. And the guidance assumes the following at the mid-point: Increased revenue year-over-year basically flat and consistent with what was provided last quarter; segment operating margin of 14%, consistent with what was provided last quarter; expenses below segment operating income, including corporate admin, interest and other at the mid-point of $471 million, which I just talked about, and that has a band of 1.3% around it; and this is $5 million higher than what was provided last quarter to reflect the actual third quarter results. A projected full year tax rate of 28%. What you will see is that the third quarter came in a little lower than what we had projected last quarter and the fourth quarter a little higher, but the full year remains the same at 28%. The guidance for restructuring, we talked about last quarter, $0.05 to $0.10. Now it's $0.08 to $0.10, meaning that they'll be $0.04 to $0.06 in the fourth quarter.","A couple other salient points with respect to guidance. Sales first half to second half were divided 48%, 52%. 48% in the first half, 52% in the second half; and segment operating income first half to second half divided 45%, 55%. EPS will be higher in the fourth quarter versus the third.","So I think that pretty well summarizes what we did with guidance. We'll take any further questions with respect to that in the Q&A session. So we'll move to that right now. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Maybe just talk about the April trend. I think you said it was up. I mean, is that a year-over-year comment or kind of sequentially? And what were you seeing kind of inflection points to the good?","Jon P. Marten","I think, Jeff, Jon here, I think for April, when we were making those comments earlier, we were comparing where we are in April versus what the guidance is that we've given to you. So we're going to show up 6% in sales Q4 versus Q3. And the orders that are coming in right now are -- we feel good about, and so we wanted to give you an indication since normally we get a question on that each quarter as to how April looks so far. So it's really that simple.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you just -- maybe as you kind of went through the quarter, can you just talk regionally where you're feeling maybe a little bit better, a little bit worse?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Jeff, this is Don. Maybe I'll give you just a little bit of kind of an overview of what's happening in different regions from a couple of different perspectives. First of all, if you look at Industrial North America, and I'm talking now about some of our order trends, 3\/12s, 12\/12s, right now, the 3\/12 is like flattening out, and that's of course the precursor to the 12\/12. 12\/12 is going to follow and flatten out. So we think that we're probably here bouncing off the bottom. We're going to be bouncing off the bottom unless something major happens to move us down another notch, which I don't see happening based on these trends. The comps were tough on North America as we said earlier, so that's part of the story as far as the minus 10%. Europe is in recession, but it's stable. It's been flat at this level for some time now. As I look at the 3\/12 and 12\/12 trends, I don't see any change in either direction. So we're not seeing any major movement one way or the other on the core business in Europe. Asia, we think, is at the bottom. And there's been some comments -- we're getting some feedback that there'll be a little bit improvement there. So I don't think there's going to be a major move one way or the other over the next 3 months, but I think it's probably going to be stabilized about right where it's at. In Latin America, we've seen a little slight improvement on the 3\/12. That should pull the 12\/12 up. It's running at about 100% line right now. And so we might see a little bit of glimmer of positive movement in Latin America. So that's basically kind of what we're seeing around the world from a regional perspective with respect to our order trends. Consistent with what we're seeing with the PMI indices, which obviously we track and many of you track, what we're seeing there is that every PMI improved from the December levels, and they're all greater than 50%. So the 50% is kind of the line that everyone's monitoring if we're already ahead of that or behind that. And of course, you can be quite a bit below 50% and still be in a growth mode, but in a very slow growth mode. So everything is trending better than 50% right now, with one exception and that's Europe. And pretty much in line with the comments I just made about Europe that the PMI in Europe is running around 46.8%. It was up just a little bit from December at 46%. I think it was 46.1%. All the other regions, like I said, are over 50% and they were all up slightly over the December levels. So that's all positive.","A little bit about the markets. And the market trends pretty much are in line with everything I just said, that we have -- and I'm looking at 25 different market segments, small pieces of our total business. The most positive right now, commercial aerospace aftermarket would be one. Farm and ag really has been very strong for quite some time now. That's probably the strongest specific market segment that we deal in. And then oil and gas has been positive. Marine and residential air conditioning, I think, in line with the improvement in some housing start numbers. I think that's pretty much paralleling that. Flat segments, I'm just going to read now through some of these just for your note. Forestry, being flat; distribution, fairly flat right now, semiconductor, life sciences, process, industrial truck. Construction, relatively flat, but we think that there might be some improvement coming in the construction. Commercial air conditioning and industrial and commercial refrigeration, so you see many of our market segments that we deal in pretty much in line with, like I said, the order trends have been fairly flat. And then there's 5 or 6 negative segments as well. So that's kind of what we're seeing pretty much globally and pretty much in line with what we mentioned earlier about our activity levels in the third quarter, and then, hopefully, a little bit of a pickup maybe in the fourth quarter here. Does that help?","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","My first question is on your guidance. It looks like on the revenue guidance for these segments, there wasn't much of a change there, maybe a little narrowing of the ranges. But on the operating income guidance, each segment looks to have gone up about 10 or 20 basis points. I think in a fairly weak demand environment, that's pretty impressive to be able to raise those numbers. And I was wondering if you could talk about where the improvement is coming from.","Jon P. Marten","Well, I think, Nathan, just running through the segments, it's a little bit of a different story for each one in terms of the sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. First of all, for North America, we really looked real hard at the -- what happened with the reported order trends and where our revenue guidance was coming out here for Q4. And as we really dug into it, we're finding just a -- that we're down 100 basis points from where we were at this time last year. We know that we've got the potential to get up to the mid-17 ranges in North America from a return on sales standpoint. And as Don was saying, as some of our end markets are continuing to flatten out to slightly increase in North America in Q4, we should be able to utilize capacity better, and we should be able to generate that incremental -- those incremental basis points from an ROS standpoint. International is a bigger hill to climb for us. We have been spending around the world a tremendous amount of time working on the integration of our acquisitions, really trying to get our 2 plus 2 plus 2 plan in around the world. And we're expecting additional improvement in our acquisitions in North America as well as around the world in the international specifically. And as we see that along with the markets start to bottom out, as Don talked earlier, that will be our challenge. But we feel very confident in our revenue and our ROS going forward there. Aerospace is also showing up. And again, there is the volume and the incremental margins from the volume, and the Aerospace supports historically where we are in the commercial OEM uptick sector. And if you look at CIC, this is just a continuing trend for them, especially in some of the markets there that are finally benefiting from the housing recovery in North America really driving some of those CIC numbers. So that would be top-level kind of response to your question.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my second question on the minus 10% North America order number, was that confined to a particular month? Was it the result of OEMs turning off the spigot for a while there as their demand outlook deteriorated? Or how did that play out, OEM versus aftermarket?","Jon P. Marten","Yes. We -- I don't want to say just one particular month. January was good, February was not very good. March was very reasonable for us, and there's a couple of things impacting that minus 10%.  And again, given the guidance that we've just given, understanding that minus 10%, we were very deliberate in trying to make sure that we had everything fit together here as we were looking at the guidance going forward. The fact that we didn't change the guidance doesn't mean that we work real -- doesn't mean that we didn't work real hard trying to validate those numbers. So the minus 10% is really driven by the really tough comps from this time last year with some very high end markets. And we're seeing a few customers, and this is not broad-based, but a few customers pull down on some of their out quarter demand, not their fourth quarter demand, but demand past that fourth quarter that's also impacted that minus 10%.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Was it primarily driven by original equipment rather than aftermarket there?","Jon P. Marten","Yes. Yes.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Just wanted to ask you about the wide ranges you've got. You narrowed the range, but you still got a $0.40 range in your guidance for the year, which is -- which means you still got a $0.40 range on the fourth quarter, $1.79 to $2.19. And is it really that invisible? I mean, don't you have better idea of what you would earn than the $0.40 range in the quarter?","Pamela J. Huggins","Well, Alex, yes, we talk about that quite a bit here, and you bring up a good point. Because we start out at the beginning of the year and usually, we start out at $0.40. And then we narrow it to $0.30. And then we get down to $0.20. So you bring up a good point, and I've talked about this before on calls. I mean, we do keep the range there. But as we well know -- as you well know, because you've heard me talk on these calls long enough to know that we're really gearing towards the mid-point of the guidance. But we do keep that range because, as you well know, there's a lot of uncertainty in the world right now and it's very difficult to know exactly what's going to happen. So that's -- I really can't tell you any more than that than to tell you that we're really focused on the mid-point of the guidance.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Alex, this is Don. If it will make you feel any better, I think that in the past, we used to give the same plus or minus 20% at this point, but it was on a much lower earnings level. So as a percentage, we are getting better. I think we're at about plus or minus 3%. The only thing, like we've said before, the only thing we know for sure is we're going to be wrong, no matter what number we pick. It isn't going to be right. We don't -- we're not that good. But the percentage is shrinking over time as the earnings per share rose. So...","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Well, as a percent of the full year.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","But it's higher. It's 20% in the quarter, so...","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. It used to be higher. It used to be higher though.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","It's just your traditional conservatism, I think.","Pamela J. Huggins","Well, Alex, I think if you go back and you look at the guidance that we give at the beginning of each fiscal year and then you look at where we end up at the end of the year, it's usually pretty good.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Yes, it's usually good.","Pamela J. Huggins","We don't get credit for it, but it's usually pretty good.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","You should get credit, I agree. The second question is this. The organic revenue's down 6%. Now that's really not in line. I mean, yes, in Europe perhaps, but the rest of the world is growing. I mean, North America is growing, albeit slowly. Asia is growing much more rapidly than North America. So why would organic revenues be down 6%? Unless there is some inventory correction going on with your customers, in which case, they're going to have to rebuild inventories later, correct? So I'm just asking about that. What's your sense of why the organic growth was down 6%?","Donald E. Washkewicz","I think, Alex -- this is Don, I think obviously, there's some of that going on as far as the OEMs, the larger OEMs. And we know that in the specific market segments that, that would be happening in mining and construction and things like that. So I think you are seeing some of that responsible for that reduction.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","What about distribution? What's going on? You should have better handle on that one.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes, distribution is actually is coming in. As I indicated, when I look at those order trends for our distribution, the general trends, it's coming in pretty flat. But the 3\/12 -- the 12\/12s, I think, are running around 100% right now. 3\/12 is, I think, close to that same number. I'm just trying to find it, if I have that in my notes here. But distribution is still pretty strong, but it's not as strong as -- in other words, it's not growing at the same rate than it was before, but not bad either.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Okay. So it's actually your sales to OEMs is down, distribution sales flat in the quarter, I mean, not the order rate.","Donald E. Washkewicz","I'm talking about the order trends.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","No, but I'm really talking what you did in the quarter and why revenues were down 6% organically. Is that distribution being down as well? And if so, is that an inventory correction?","Pamela J. Huggins","Yes. Let me just add a little color on that. Yes, distribution in terms of sales for the quarter, it was down. It was in the single digits. But if you look at March versus February, it was really up. And if you look at March versus January, it was up. But yes, year-over-year, it was down in low single digits.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Okay. So was that the inventory reduction on their part is the question really?","Pamela J. Huggins","Well, I think some of it has to do with the oil and gas markets, too. The oil and gas markets have been extremely strong, and we're up against extremely tough, tough comparables. So it has something to do with that, too.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, just wanted to dig a little deeper into the international margins, sort of how they're trending relative to your expectations. And if markets continue to be weak, do you feel like you're rightsized, or that we should look for additional restructuring activity even as we sort of look into 2014, which is, for your fiscal year, not too far off? And then I guess my second question, again, sorry, on the order trends. But is -- Don, just to be more specific, as we look to Q2 versus Q1, are there any markets where you feel like OEs will continue to have to take production down? And on the flip side, which markets do you see them taking production up sequentially?","Donald E. Washkewicz","I think that -- and just answer that last part, then I'll let Jon to talk a little bit about the first part of the question. I think -- the way I characterize, we're bouncing off the bottom, okay? I don't think that -- I think the OEMs started adjusting last year, probably second quarter, October time frame. They've been through that period. They've got the adjustments pretty much in place. There may be still a little bit of that going on. But by and large, what I feel is the feedback that we're getting is that's pretty much behind us, and we're just bouncing off the bottom now. And I think that going forward, I think we should see a little bit of a lift. When that happens is anyone's guess. But I don't think it's going to be an inventory situation going forward, where there's going to be a massive reduction in inventory, and that's going to throw us into a tailspin here. I don't see that coming. I think a lot of that is behind us.","Pamela J. Huggins","Jamie, I just want to add a little color to that. It's probably not real helpful. But as I met with the group presidents and were talking to them, all of these OEMs are different. We actually have some OEMs that are saying, \"Hey, get ready. Get ready.\"","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Which ones? Tell me which one, Pam? Which ones are -- can you get more granular?","Pamela J. Huggins","Well, I don't want to go into [indiscernible] details, but I will say, specifically, I'll give you an example, one example, and it's a small example. It's on the CIC side, but there are some others. And so some of these OEMs are saying, \"Hey, get ready. It's coming.\" And then some of the others, like Don was talking about, they're saying, hey, they're kind of in a hold mode. So because we're a diversified company, there's a lot of OEMs, and they're all a little bit different.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I know, but are there any -- can you be more specific by end market, if not OEM?","Pamela J. Huggins","No, I really can't.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then just second on the international question, sorry.","Jon P. Marten","Well, are you talking about the restructuring, Jamie? Do you want me to address that?","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, no. Well, my -- I guess my question is how did the international margins come in relative to your expectations? And I guess my concern is if the markets continue to be weak, do you feel like we're currently rightsized outside of whatever you're gonna do in the fourth quarter? Should we look for additional restructuring that could impact your fiscal year 2014, which isn't too far off?","Jon P. Marten","Right. I think first answer to the question is that we continue to be challenged there in international margins. Again, they're being impacted here by some of the end-market weakness that Don and Pam were talking about, as well as the acquisitions that we're getting behind us here. And going forward here, we should be sequentially better. But to answer your question specifically, Pam alluded to earlier $0.04 to $0.05 in restructuring in Q4. But on one hand, I want to tell you, we'll be going through all the details for our FY '14 here this quarter. And we'll be really very specific when we come out in August about what we're doing in terms of restructuring in 2014. But there's no doubt that in certain end markets in certain regions that restructuring will be greater, significantly greater in FY '14 than in FY '13.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann of Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Don, I think a quarter or 2 ago, my memory isn't that great, but you had made a comment that you'd thought the acquisition pipeline was quite full, and you wanted to have a fair amount of dry powder available. And obviously, you do have a lot of dry powder. And granted you've done a few more bolt-ons here. But I guess, I'm just wondering where we stand now. Is there still a lot of opportunity in the acquisition pipeline, or how do we look at that?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. Thanks, Steve. We did 8 this year. So some are larger, some were smaller. But overall, I think we're close to $0.5 billion in revenues. We're looking at some additional opportunities, as we are always. But I mean, we have some specific ones that we're looking at. I don't know -- we try not to project whether we'll get them to the finish line or not, but there are some interesting things that we are looking at. I would say the pipeline compared to where it was a year ago is not as full as it was a year ago, and that's probably because we emptied it somewhat. But there's still opportunities out there for us to do deals and of course, we have the capacity to do it. So if something presents itself that's interesting, we will action it.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. I guess my observation would be you have the capacity to do a lot of things here, which is a good problem to have. But if you think that things are starting to turn better, why not use this opportunity to buy in a bunch more stock before it goes up, I guess is the question.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, we are, as I said, we are buying. We did increase that. And from where we were to almost 0.25 billion a year, we'll probably do 0.25 billion this year in stock buyback. We've done more in prior years. We do have capacity, of course, to do more, but my priority has been more dividends. I'm getting more pressure from a lot of our big shareholders saying that we'd like to see you do more on dividend. So it's a matter of allocation, how much do we do dividends, how much do we do share repurchase. We're trying to keep a balance here. If the acquisition opportunities do not result in a deal, then I think there's certainly a possibility we could do more repurchase going forward.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just quickly, it looks like you did a little work on CIC to sort of restructure that business and divest some underperforming assets perhaps. But that still sort of stands out on the margin side as the one that kind of needs the most work and hasn't really made the leap into the -- where the rest of the company is. And just how do we look at that strategically? Is there more to do there? Do you just have to wait for the cycle or how I look at that?","Jon P. Marten","I think, Steve, Jon here, I think we do have more to do there. There's 2 factors. One, just like the divestiture that we did and that we announced back in October 1. We continue to look at that entire group. There's many parts of that group and that segment that are doing really some very exciting things from an innovation standpoint for us, that is really helping us drive organic growth as we look into FY '14 and FY '15. But we're not done with our efforts there to get them up to a ROS and a growth pattern that we see in some of the other markets. They're impacted by the end markets there to a certain degree, which are improving. And they also have a very low capital requirement in that group, too, here. So their return on the invested capital is not as bad as those ROS numbers make it look to be here if you're just comparing those numbers for that group. So I want to leave you with the impression that more work to be done, and we are focused on it, and we're proud of the progress we've been able to make so far.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just want to clarify, if I look at the inventory relative to sales, it was -- inventory was up year-over-year. Sales were down a little bit. But if it -- if I look sequentially, sales, up; inventory, down. Is the year-over-year comparison just related to the acquisitions?","Jon P. Marten","Yes, Andy, yes. In fact, we show our numbers being up about 3 days in DSI. About half of that is really related to the acquisitions. And we're tracking along year-over-year about where we were in inventory for the entire company, but when you look -- so that's the way we're looking at it.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of David Raso of ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The question on the stock's kind of become where do you think Parker is going to guide next year. So if you can give us any insight on where are you in the internal process of starting that fiscal '14 outlook? And appreciating a lack of visibility you have, just the nature of your business and it's probably gotten even more so the last 5 years, just to give us some insight how you're going through that process. How are you thinking about fiscal '14, the feedback you're getting from your folks so far? And that might weave back into the comment of how does the balance sheet usage get influenced if we do look at next year as maybe a little better growth than this year, not negative core growth, but say modest positive core growth?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes, I think, David, I think that's -- we've gone through quite a few -- quite a bit of analysis, and our groups are going through that process right now looking at '14. I think the general feeling is it's going to be moderate. I think you used the word moderate, and that's the one I was thinking of as kind of referring to what's probably going to come out of all of these planning meetings that we're having throughout the company. I think we certainly see on the aerospace side a positive story going forward. I think that's going to stand out as probably more positive than the industrial side. But I think the industrial will be positive, but it's going to be at lower levels. It's just going to be a more moderate growth story going forward than we've seen in past years. We'd like to see this back to where it used to be, but I guess we're going to have to wait to see that happen. Europe is really the wild card. As you heard from Jon and Pam, obviously, we're going to have to do some restructuring there. We are going through restructuring now with a lot of the acquisitions. And probably a higher percentage of the acquisitions came from Europe or are in Europe, so we have more work to do there, maybe the larger dollar-size acquisitions are there. We're consolidating sales companies and so forth. So irrespective of whether it grows or not, I think, our performance will improve in that region. So we're really not going to project, I don't think, unless some groups come back with some surprise, a high growth in Europe for sure. I think when you look at Asia, I think we're going to say that we're going to have moderate growth in Asia. Of course, the entire country of China has dropped from 12% down to 7%. And we're just getting adjusted to 7% or 8% growth. That's going to be probably more normal going forward. I don't think that that's going to change, still a pretty, nice level of growth relative to other regions around the world. I don't think we're going to project a big increase in Latin America. I think it will be positive, but it will be small percentages in Latin America. And in North America, I think we'll see a modest increase as well. That's kind of generalizing. I'm not giving you any numbers, hard numbers, because I don't have them myself. But just listening to the groups and understanding where we are in the planning process so far, I think that's kind of how I would characterize what's going to happen in '14. It will be positive. It will be moderate. Some segments will be stronger than others, some regions stronger than others. It will be kind of a little bit of a mixed bag. But overall, I think, from a profitability standpoint, I think we're taking the appropriate actions. As you saw here, generating 14% operating margins in this environment is something this company has never done before at this point in the cycle. I mean, we have really done something very, very spectacular in this company generating those kind of margins I think. And David, you've been tracking us long enough to know where we were in prior cycles, and we're improving every cycle. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color. I'm not giving you any exact numbers, but that's kind of the way we look at it.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I'm just trying to frame it where if you just look at core growth next year, keep it simple, 5%, 30% incremental on it, it adds about $1 of earnings, right? So $6.45-ish gets you to mid-7s. Street's well above $8. So I'm just trying to think how much balance sheet power, internal margin improvement, something to suggest that you can tack on that much more earnings power, unless of course, macro is going to be what it's going to be, maybe the 5% can be 8%, but maybe it's 2%. I'm just thinking for planning purposes, as a CEO trying to figure out how do we grow the company beyond just what the market will throw you, is there something the street's missing other than what's your macro view on '14?","Jon P. Marten","Well, David, Jon here. Just to -- just a couple points. I'm sure I don't have the entire picture for you here, but let me just make a couple points, big macro-improvement in aerospace that we would be expecting here for next year as the trends continue to go positively and the development cycle begins to -- or continues to ebb. Of course, FY '14 is going to have a full year of that $0.5 billion in acquisitions are going to be generating, ever-increasing margins, ever-increasing cash flow, accretive EPS for us. And we will be much further along in the integration mode there. I think, as Don talked earlier, we're coming off the bottom with some signs of some very -- in almost all end markets except for a couple in Asia of continuing the exciting incremental growth in sales and margins there, too. So I would think from a highlight standpoint, that's the way we would look at a lot of the potential tailwinds that would move us up at an even greater rate than you were just referring to.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, and to be clear, I mean, I know consensus is only mid-7s. I was just saying the idea of the bullish view on the earnings growth we usually get out of the company when you go from a negative year to a positive year. So I'm just -- just to clarify I know what the street is. I'm just trying to get a feel, is there something the Street is missing besides the macro view? It's sounds like, obviously, aerospace and the margins were down internationally now for, obviously if Asia can come back and Latin America, that's where you have maybe more operating leverage and then people looking at a near 17% margin in North America. I figure out how much we grow it.","Jon P. Marten","Well, I wish I would have -- yes, I wish I would have said it that clearly the operating leverage.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I appreciate the color. I know with a short visibly company, it's not easiest thing to plan and forecast 12 months out. So I do appreciate the color.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Joel Tiss of BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And along those same lines, can you tell us how big -- roughly how big Europe is as a percent of the whole company now?","Pamela J. Huggins","Sure. It's about 25%, 24%. 24%, 25%.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. all right. So maybe we, hopefully, eventually get a little bit of a boost out of that, too.","Pamela J. Huggins","Right, right.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right. And then the other...","Pamela J. Huggins","Yes, there's lots of things to think about. I mean, lots of these markets are still down, lots of these regions are down. So to be doing 14% like we say in such as a slow growth environment, and if any of these markets or any of these regions turn, it's going to be really good for Parker. And as you well know, we really pared down on the temporaries, the people count that we rightsized our business to the demand. And so coming out of the downturn, as you well know, we do really well on the margin return on the sales side.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And is there anything else inside the whole portfolio that's worth looking at on the sales side? Or are you pretty much done with that?","Donald E. Washkewicz","I would say the pieces that we really were -- there's always -- there's still a few little pieces. But the majority of what we wanted to accomplish, we've accomplished.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So it's just more grinding it out.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes, there's some small pieces, but it's not -- they wouldn't be significant.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of MKM partners.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just wanted a little color, I guess, first question, on how demand trends are trending -- are going in China MRO versus OEM? Or are you passed the destocking? Are you seeing credit kind of flow into some of the larger projects or bigger capital equipment purchases? And then what are you seeing in distribution?","Jon P. Marten","I think in China, Josh, there's really 2 different stories. There's the, as Don talked about earlier, there's the issue with the construction equipment and mining, which does not look good right now, and that's at the bottom. And it's hard to see what's -- where the visibility of that is going to go and when for us. But there are other very important end markets in China for us that are doing very, very well, automation, railway, filtration, our engineer materials, our life sciences end markets, all of them are trending very well in China and very well in Asia altogether. So it's really end-market driven and that's what we're really seeing. We had a very good trends here most recently at the end of the quarter in China. And we will be obviously watching that very closely here as we've gotten good indications in April around this quarter.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess, just to go back to an earlier question about the margin trajectory. Can you help me understand any restructuring or one-timers or cost containment that kind of lets out in the fourth quarter? It just seems like there's about 150 basis point leap 3Q to 4Q in the Industrial businesses on somewhat less strong volume growth. Is there anything in mix seasonality or anything in the cost side, which...","Pamela J. Huggins","Yes, that's a good question, Josh, and let me just walk through some of these things just as a reminder. And I know that you -- once I say them you'll -- I know if you haven't already remembered them, you will. But first thing to remember is the natural cycle of Parker's business. We always do better in the second half. So the 48%-52% split that you're seeing, that's very normal for Parker in good times and bad. We always have that higher volume in the second half, which helps. We have less R&D in the second half in aerospace than in the first half. And then the only seasonal part of our business is really CIC. So we get that pickup from CIC in the second half. As the summer starts coming and people start replacing there air conditioning and the repair them, we get a seasonality effect on CIC. We have a lower tax rate in the second half, because as you well know, we had that sale of the business in the first half. And so our tax rate was very high in the second quarter. The other thing that takes place is stock option expense. We have less stock option expense in the second half than the first half. And we're expecting more MRO in Aerospace in the second half versus the first half. The other thing to remember is currency was negative, more negative in the first half than the second half. And while it's more negative than what we projected the last quarter, it's less than the second half. So those are some of the things...","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Maybe I wasn't clear in my question. I meant more 3Q to 4Q. I get the seasonality first half to second half.","Pamela J. Huggins","Yes, but a lot of these things that I'm mentioning also apply 3Q to 4Q.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. If it's just seasonality, then I think I'm fine. I appreciate it.","Operator","And your last question is from the line of Mitch Dobre of Robert W. Baird.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","It's actually Mig Dobre. So in the vein of the last question, trying to understand guidance a little bit here. If I look at the mid-point, the mid-point is right around $2, which would imply year-over-year earnings growth. And I'm trying to figure out exactly how we're going to get there as orders have actually decelerated. And again, if we're looking at year-over-year earnings, we certainly have seen declines in the first 3 quarters. So is it fair to assume that even though the mid-point has remained unchanged, we really shouldn't be sort of thinking as that is the most likely outcome for the year? Or what am I missing here?","Jon P. Marten","Well, Mig, yes, I think, Mig, first of all, I don't think you're missing anything. I mean, this is the key point that we focused in on here as we were preparing for the call. So it's a very logical question. But as you know, the way we operate here, first thing we do is we go down to the divisional and business unit level, and everybody forecasts going forward month by month. And we have a really good picture of what all of our people that are closest to the customers are really saying about what the volume and the margin trends can be. And so we've got those numbers that support what we're talking about in terms of our guidance that supports it very well. We also have a macro look at what the trends have been for us. We've been able to perform given where we are here in the cycle. We feel very good that the orders are bottoming, and it is counterintuitive that orders would be down and our revenues are going up. But with those revenues going up, the operating leverage that we get by utilizing our manufacturing facilities around the world in a much greater capacity is going to have a tremendous impact here for us on the bottom line. So from our bottoms-up approach, from our look at the end markets, from the positive actions we are going to get from integration of the recent acquisitions that we've done over the last 18 months and from what we're seeing in certain end markets that are still doing pretty darn well, we can get to that very easily to that mid-point of our guidance for Q4. But I don't want you to -- this is a tough call. This is an inflection point for the company and inflection of orders down versus revenues sequentially up. We had the same issue, just to give you some confidence in Q2, when we were looking at Q3. And the mid-point of our guidance for Q3 was up 8% and the revenues Q2 to Q3. And we hit that number on the top line right on the numbers, and we hit the bottom line very darn close too. So we're expecting us to be able to do it in the same kind of a trend here going from Q3 to Q4. So I hope that helps you.","Pamela J. Huggins","Yes, and then just to summarize, really, you could have asked that exact same question last quarter, and I think we proved that we could do it. So at any rate, let me turn it over to Don right now, who just has a few closing comments, and I would like to thank all of you for your attendance.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Okay. Thanks, Pam. I just want to thank, everybody, on the call for taking the time to be with us this morning. As always, I also like to take the opportunity to thank our employees for their continued commitment and the success that we've had in growing our company and responding to these economic conditions that we see ourself faced with. The team continues to execute the win strategy and adapt quickly to an ever-changing market, as we've covered here in this meeting. During this period of economic uncertainty, we will certainly remain focused on managing our costs and maintaining the strong financial position that we have and keep our focus on our long-term growth strategy and that's what we're working on today.","So thanks to everybody on our call. We want to thank you for your continued interest in Parker. And if you have any additional questions, Pam will be here the rest of the day. Feel free to give her a call. Thanks again, and have a nice day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Matthew, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And now I would like to turn the call over to Pamela Huggins, Vice President and Treasurer. Please proceed, ma'am.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, this is Pam speaking. I'd like to welcome you to Parker Hannifin's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Release Teleconference. Joining me today is the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Don Washkewicz; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Marten.","","For those of you who wish to do so, you can follow today's presentation with the PowerPoint slides that have been presented on Parker's website at www.phstock.com. And for those of you not online, the slides will remain posted on the company's Investor information website, at that same site, 1 year after today's call.","At this time, I'll reference Slide #2 in the slide deck, if you have it before you. And it's the Safe Harbor disclosure statement, addressing forward-looking statements. Please take note of this statement in its entirety if you haven't already done so.","Moving to Slide #3. This slide, as required, indicates that in cases where non-GAAP numbers have been used, they've been reconciled to the appropriate GAAP numbers and are posted on Parker's website, again at phstock.com.","Slide #4 is the agenda for today, it consists of 4 parts. First, Don Washkewicz, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. He'll provide highlights for the quarter. Second, I'll provide a review, including key performance measures for the quarter, concluding with the updated 2014 guidance.","The third part of the call will consist of a standard Q&A session. And the fourth part of the call today, Don will close with some final comments. So at this time, I'll turn it over to Don, and ask that you refer to Slide #5, titled Highlights Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2014.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Thanks, Pam. And welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation today. I'll make a few comments and then Pam is going to return for a little bit more detailed review of the quarter.","To start off, I am certainly very pleased that we continue to execute well through the first half of our fiscal year and delivered another strong quarter operationally that was ahead of expectations.","Just some highlights for the quarter. We exceeded our guidance of $1.14 for the quarter by $0.10. And just to remind everybody that our second quarter is the worst quarter in our fiscal year. That's just not this year, that's every year. So the holidays, the vacation days, the plant shutdowns and all the related things make that quarter a very, very challenging quarter and to be able to exceed our number, which we thought was bullish at the time by $0.10, we were ecstatic about that. So very pleased with that.","Even though the Street was considerably higher than our guidance, we exceeded the First Call estimates by -- as well by $0.01. Now I was reading some of the early reports this morning. It looks like we either -- we're ahead by $0.01 or down by $0.03. So it depends, I think, on what service you're looking at, but we traditionally look at the First Call. They seem to have a pretty comprehensive report and pretty consistent. So -- anyway, pretty good numbers all in all, given that it was the weakest quarter traditionally in our fiscal year.","Sales for the quarter were up 1.3%. The organic growth was 3.1%, which excludes the effect of the acquisitions, currency and previously announced joint venture agreement with GE Aviation, so nice growth. We'd love to see more, but it's heading at least in a positive direction at 3% organic.","We're pleased to see a second consecutive quarter of positive order growth, producing a 5% improvement year-over-year. And this is also the fourth consecutive month of positive order growth across all of our segments. These trends are consistent with increasingly favorable macroeconomic indicators.","Total segment operating margins improved slightly year-over-year, reaching 12.2%. And I want you to keep in mind that our second quarter again is typically our lowest, also the 12.2% includes higher restructuring expenses.","Diversified Industrial North American operation -- operating margins were in excess of 15% at 15.1%. Aerospace System margins were impacted by mix, as we recorded more OEM versus MRO sales, stemming from the large number of major platform wins we have secured in the past several years. And we've been, obviously, talking about those for some time.","Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.24, and that's adjusted for the effect of 2 nonrecurring items, the asset write-downs in the quarter and a gain in conjunction with the joint venture with GE Aviation.","As reported, earnings per diluted share were $1.66, including these nonrecurring items. So $1.66 with and $1.24 without. Just a comment on the asset write-downs. As part of our restructuring, we have identified assets that will fail to meet our future performance goals. These asset write-downs have not been completely communicated, so we will not be discussing them further at this time. The write-downs are in addition to the previously announced restructuring charges of $0.47 for the year, and we'll give you a little bit more detail on that $0.40 and how it's progressing a little further on.","These asset write-downs will positively impact our performance starting in fiscal year 2015. Cash flow, of course, is extremely important, continues to be strong. And year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of 8.5% of sales or 9.7%, just under 10%, before pension contributions. We still expect to deliver our 13th consecutive year of cash flow greater than 10% before pension contributions for the balance of this fiscal year. So we're looking forward to a real strong cash flow year again on top of that stream of cash flow year as referenced.","Just a few comments about our restructuring. Restructuring this quarter was $0.07 per diluted share, bringing us to $0.13 year-to-date. We're still projecting restructuring for the year to be the $100 million that we talked about earlier at the beginning of the year or $0.47 per diluted share as we stated originally. Pam will review how this impacts each quarter as we get into a little bit more detail.","We were also pleased, on a separate topic, that during the quarter, our board was ranked in the top 10 for overall governance capacity in an independent study of America's largest companies conducted by James Drury Partners. So we're pretty excited about that. And that is the third year in a row that we achieved that recognition, so real nice recognition for our Board of Directors.","Looking ahead to the full year, we're maintaining our guidance at the midpoint and have provided adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $6.20 to $6.60, so we're just tightening the range a little bit per diluted share for fiscal 2014. This is pretty consistent with what we've done in prior years. As we move through the year, every quarter, we make a slight compression where it's appropriate or make the adjustment as needed, and we'll continue to do that throughout the balance of this fiscal year.","This guidance does include the estimated $0.47 per diluted share in restructuring expenses, but does not include the gain on the GE Aviation joint venture of $1.68 per diluted share and the second quarter asset write-downs of $1.26 per diluted share. So that's a quick overview of the quarter, now I'm going to turn it back over to Pam and she'll give you a little bit more detail on a few of these items.","Pamela J. Huggins","Okay. Thanks, Don. As Don said, I'm going to give you a little more detail, I apologize for any duplication, but we think it's important to walk through the slides. So starting with Slide #6, and I'll begin by addressing our earnings per share for the quarter.","Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter came in at $1.66 and this compares to $1.19 for the same quarter last year, which is an increase of 39%. This 39%, however, includes the previously announced joint venture gain of $413 million or earnings per share of $1.68 recorded in the second quarter. And the second quarter asset write-downs of $192 million or $1.28 of earnings per share. If you exclude these 2 nonrecurring items, diluted earnings per share is $1.24, and this compares to $1.19 last year or an increase of 4%.","The increase, however, is 8% if you exclude the restructuring in addition to the nonrecurring items. As Don mentioned, restructuring was $0.07 in the second quarter of this year, and restructuring was only $0.02 in the second quarter of last year.","So moving to the next slide, #7, this slide lays out the significant components of the walk, from the $1.19 last year to the $1.66 reported for the second quarter of this year. You can see that the previously announced JV gain of $1.68 is partially offset by the asset write-down of $1.26. And these were both recorded in this quarter. And also on this slide, you can see that there's an additional $0.05 coming from better operating performance in North America and International.","Moving to Slide #8, if you focus on the far right, you can see -- this is an adjusted number, sales increased 3% for the quarter versus the same quarter last year. And as shown in the gold box on the left, currency reduced sales by 1% in the quarter.","Looking at segment operating margins, which are detailed at the bottom of the slide, the quarter was 12.2%, slightly ahead of last year. But on a comparable basis, this would even be higher because, again, there was more restructuring in this quarter versus last year.","So moving to Slide #9, and here, I'm going to focus on segments, commencing with Industrial North America. For the quarter, North American revenues of $1.33 billion, slightly increased almost 1% over last year. Additional revenue from acquisitions, it was relatively minor at less than 1%, offset by unfavorable currency.","Operating income in North America increased to $201 million from $190 million, that's a 6% increase over the prior year and mainly, the result of further acquisition integration and tight cost control.","So moving to segments addressing the International side of things. For the quarter, organic revenues increased 6% and currency was reduced by a little more than 1%. The increase in sales was mainly due to Europe. Operating margin increased to $134 million from $125 million. That's a 7% increase, and this is even with higher restructuring cost in this quarter versus last year. Also due -- it was mainly due to the increased volume in Europe and really good tight cost control in Asia.","So moving to Slide #11 and focusing on Aerospace. Revenues on an adjusted basis for the joint venture increased 3%, and in this segment, there really weren't any acquisitions and the impact of currency was negligible. Operating margin decreased to $45 million from $52 million versus the same quarter a year ago, and as Don mentioned, that's due to higher OEM, MRO mix in the quarter.","Moving to order rates. These numbers, as you know, represent a trailing 3-month average and they're reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year and they exclude acquisitions and currency. And -- except for aerospace. Aerospace is reported using a 12-month rolling average. But as you can see from this slide, orders were positive 5% for the December quarter just ended, representing 2 quarters of positive numbers. North American orders for the quarter increased 3%, Industrial International orders increased 6% for the quarter and Aerospace orders increased 7%, again on a 12-month rolling basis.","So moving to the balance sheet, Parker's balance sheet remains strong. Cash on the balance sheet at year-end was a little over $2 billion, offset by outstanding Commercial Paper of $1.2 billion.","DSI or days sales in inventory came in at 72 days for the quarter versus 75 for the same quarter last year. The inventory decrease in the quarter versus last year, around $67 million, and this includes additional inventory from previous acquisitions. Inventory levels at 11.1% of sales are slightly better than last year at 11.3%.","Accounts receivable in terms of DSO closed at 49, a 1-day improvement from last quarter. And weighted average days payable outstanding at the end of December was 56, a 2-day improvement from last quarter.","So moving to cash flow, from operations year-to-date, $540 million or 8.5% of sales versus 5.5% of sales last year. However, if you exclude the discretionary pension contribution in the first quarter, which is the $615 million that you see on the slide there, cash flow from operations is 9.7%. This compares to 9.1% last year.","So after increasing cash-on-hand in the quarter -- or for the year to date, $359 million. The major uses of cash are $235 million year-to-date return to shareholders via share repurchase of $100 million and dividend payments of $135 million. And then $112 million or 1.8% of sales utilized in connection with capital expenditures.","So now moving to Slide #15 and addressing guidance. You'll notice that this quarter, the guidance has been provided using a different format. The assumptions have been provided for guidance using the midpoint only. In the past, we gave you a range. So you'll see that for sales and margins, we gave you the numbers at the midpoint. The guidance for revenues and operating margins by segment, they've been provided at the top of that page. They are the first 2 sections. And addressing sales, sales are expected to increase approximately 1.5% at the midpoint for the year. But on an adjusted basis, that's 3%. This 3% is comprised of a little more than 2% organically and not quite 1% from acquisition hangover.","The adjusted number includes an adjustment for the sales with respect to the GE JV that we've discussed and the sale of the automotive air-conditioning business last year that's been discussed on previous calls.","Segment operating margins are forecasted at 13.7% at the midpoint, fairly consistent with last quarter. And also included on this slide is the projection for corporate admin and other. Excluding the nonrecurring items, it's approximately $461 million for the year.","The full year tax rate is now at 34.4%, and I'm sure you realize that this is higher than last quarter. That's due to the asset write-downs that we took in the second quarter. We've used a 29% tax rate in the third and fourth quarter, consistent with last quarter as well. The number of outstanding shares used in the guidance is 151.7 million.","So for the full year, the adjusted earnings per share guidance is $6.20 to $6.60. So the guidance has been updated from last quarter to exclude the JV gain as it's a nonrecurring item.","So just a couple of salient points with respect to the guidance. Sales first half, second half are divided 48%, 52%. Segment operating income first half, second half is divided 47%, 53%. Earnings per share, the first half, second half, 45%, 55%, and this excludes the nonrecurring items. And then the third quarter earnings per share at the midpoint is projected to be 40% -- 44% of the second half.","Restructuring costs are still projected to be approximately $100 million, in line with what we conveyed last quarter, the growth earnings per share impact is $0.47. The impact to the first half is $0.13 and the second half is projected to be approximately $0.34. However, $0.20 will occur in the third quarter.","So please remember that this forecast excludes any further acquisitions or divestitures that may be made in 2014. And for published estimates, we ask that you please exclude the joint venture gain and the asset write-down.","So at this time, I think we'll commence with the standard Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] So at this time, we'll -- go ahead, Matthew. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you just give a little more color on the aero margins, which continue to disappoint. And then it looks like if you back into the guide, a big snap back there. What gives you the confidence the margins snap back there?","Jon P. Marten","Well, Jeff, this is Jon. And we are continuing with the pattern that we saw last year, with the development programs and supporting them in Q2. As Don mentioned in his comments, we saw a mix issue that was more pronounced that we see in prior periods with the commercial aftermarket revenues just not meeting up with the expectations that we were looking for here for Q2. We know -- it's a long cycle business. We know what to expect here in the second half. We have a very detailed review that we go through each quarter. And we feel good about the OEM revenues and our margins, and we feel very good about the MRO business snapping back here in the second quarter. That's what's going to help drive the margins. And then our continued progress on the development programs is, although it's not apparent because we don't break it out by element, our continued progress on the development programs is better this year than last year. And we are expecting it to be better next year than this year. Long-cycle business, it's hard to change big trends in 1 quarter, but I appreciate your question and wanted to make sure that I gave you a complete answer there.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","But are you seeing a big acceleration in the aftermarket that would lead to better mix?","Jon P. Marten","Right now, our projections is that the aftermarket is going to accelerate in the second half. Q2 is always very tough to make a projection off of because historically, over time, always in Q2, the commercial aftermarket is lower than it is in any other part of the fiscal year, and that impacted us this quarter. We actually did a little bit better than our indicative guidance in Q2, although admittedly, at very low levels. So we have a very detailed understanding of where the aftermarket is, where the customers are and what the demand should be. And that's how we are projecting our second half, Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe, Don, since we're going to limit the questions to 1, and maybe a tiny follow-up. Maybe you could give us your normal regional color and some market color on your 3-month and 12-month moving averages?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Okay. Ann, I'll be happy to do that. Well, just keep in mind as I go through some of this that, again, we keep repeating this, but it's worth repeating that December is normally the quarter, second quarter, I should say, not just December. December is our worst month, but the quarter is typically our worst quarter as well. Just a little overview of the PMI, as I went through these the other day, I was kind of making a few notes on the PMIs. All the major indices now, PMIs have improved from September. So if we look at the September quarter compared to the December quarter, they've all improved. All of the major indices are greater than 50%, which is good news. The largest increases were in Germany and the Eurozone, and I'll just kind of tell you what some of those are for those that might not know these numbers. Globally, the number was 53.3%, that was up 1.5% from September. The U.S. had the largest absolute number as far as PMI. It was 57%. That was up 0.8%. Not up as much as the others, but as an absolute number, it was the highest. The Eurozone at 52.7%, was up 1.6% from the prior quarter. Germany was 54.3%. This was a big one. They were up 3.2%, which is a good sign for Europe because Germany has a very heavy weight in Europe as far as country and activity level. So that's a real positive. China, up 0.3%. It's at 50.5%, and Brazil, at 50.5%, was up just slightly at 0.6%. So the smallest increase was China, the largest was the U.S. at 57%. Doesn't mean nothing is happening in China. I think the big issue there is that construction -- the construction markets are flat -- I mean, really down, not just flat. They're being offset by other markets, but just not enough offset to really drag everything up. So that's kind of what we see in the PMIs. Looking at some of the specific markets, what we would see as strong, commercial and MRO aerospace, real positive, and I'll talk about this a little bit later when I talk about the 3\/12s and the 12\/12s. But distribution, good sign there on our distribution channel. I'll talk about that again. In North America, that's 50% of our activity. Power gen is strong, marine, forestry and offshore oil and gas, those are all -- what we consider strong segments, market segments for us. Weak would be the aerospace defense and MRO. Mining, of course, everybody knows about mining. That's been in the news a lot and it continues to be weak. Construction, pretty much globally still pretty weak. Land-based oil and gas being weak. Again, the contrast there is strong being offshore; weaker oil and gas being onshore. And then some flat segments, cars and light trucks, process industries, semicon is relatively flat, but it's flat at a high level. So that's not necessarily bad. And farm and ag, again is at a decent level, but a little bit flat at this time. Regionally, if we look at the regions, Industrial North America -- when I talk about these now, they're all tracking above 100% on our 3\/12. We look at our 3\/12 and 12\/12, so that's really positive, that all of these are tracking north of 100%. Our 3\/12 for North America is running close to 105%. Again, these kind of match up pretty closely with the order trends that you're seeing there. Europe, up ahead of the 3\/12 is greater than 100% at about 105%. Asia and Latin America running close to around 110%. So that's -- those are -- all those are dragging our 12\/12 numbers up, which would portend this year being better than last year and that's kind of the way the numbers are shaking out. Well, I mentioned this distribution earlier. Our 3\/12 on distribution, the way we're looking at these numbers here is north of 100%, and it's roughly around 108%. So you can see our distribution business is tending to offset some of the weaker OEM markets, which is the beauty of Parker, because half of our business being distribution, that's what we'd like to see. That distribution channel, when it's up, it has a nice counterweight to some of these OEM segments that may not be up. Heavy-duty truck is -- the 3\/12 is north of 100%. Construction equipment, of course, is well south of 100%. So that's the drag right there. Semiconductor is like 145%, so it's way up there. Process is about at 100%, and ag is just slightly below 100%. So those would be some of the specifics as far as the markets and the regions and what we see. But I think just to summarize all that, at least on these 3\/12 indices, everything kind of is looking positive for the future. Is it going to be a boomer? Probably not. But is this going to be gradual improvement in growth? Yes, most likely. So that's kind of the way we see it.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then philosophically, Don, why did you guys decide to move to a single-point guidance on your revenues? Just given the short cycle nature of your distribution business, I'm just curious.","Pamela J. Huggins","Well, Ann, our guidance is really a roll-up. You hear us say this all of the time, so this isn't anything new to you. But our roll-up is a combination of all of our divisions. And when we get to rolling, we don't want to start playing with the numbers, because it's kind of hard to hold them accountable for the numbers if you start moving them around. So while things are positive, we felt that it was prudent to stay where we're at right now, keep the guidance consistent with what we gave to you last quarter. So this is what we got from our different divisions, and we feel pretty comfortable. There is not that much of a difference, I think, in the revenue, I think most of these things are tweaks. I think when you really look at the previous guidance versus the guidance today, yes, there are some things that moved up, there are some things that moved down a little bit. But they're really tweaks for the most part. The midpoint of the guidance is exactly the same. So, and plus, we give a range. So I think you have to look at the range. You can't just look at the midpoint. Yes, it could move from -- a little bit, but that's why we give a range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess 2 questions. Don, I appreciate your color that you provided to Ann, but can you just talk about how the orders trended throughout the quarter, I guess my concern -- or what we've heard from some channel checks in other OEs that December wasn't particularly very strong in some mobile markets, where bonus depreciation is going away. So I'm wondering if you saw that in your order trends and if you can comment on what you're seeing in January. And then I guess just my follow-up question, if you can give us an update on what you're going to do with the balance sheet. We're now entering the third quarter, the repurchase. There hasn't really been any much done there, and just sort of can we -- are acquisitions still a priority in the absence of not doing a more material one in the back half of the year, how we think about share repurchase?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. I think, Jamie, and I'll let Pam and maybe Jon as a little follow-up here, too. But generally speaking, through the quarter, what we saw was a gradual increase in orders throughout that period. So yes, things got gradually better. Again, these are not huge swings one way or the other, but a gradual improvement on through the quarter. And I'll let Pam, if you want to give them more specifics or Jon.","Jon P. Marten","Well, I think just as Don was saying, as we improved -- we did improve through the quarter, so this would confirm some of the anecdotal information that you are also getting, Jamie. In particular in our Asia region, we saw very good sequential growth in orders throughout the quarter. North America, just slightly improving, and in Europe, also improving. But the standout in terms of regions for orders for us was all of Asia.","Donald E. Washkewicz","And Jamie, and I'll give you a longer answer than maybe you want, but I'll just try to cover all this at one time as far as capital allocation, just to kind of recap for everybody, kind of where our head's at here on this. Our first priority is always dividends, and with our track record of 57 years increasing dividends, we want continue that. We've increased that 114% in the last 5 years. The thing that we did last year was we had a 10% increase. We're trying to move the payout as I indicated before, it used to be a 25% target, we're trying to move that up to 30%. My projection for you is that this fiscal year, we're going to move that north of 27%, where we finished last year as far as the payout. And that could happen as soon as this month. I have to get approval from the board. We're going to be discussing this, and we could see a dividend movement as early as this month. But again, they have to weigh in and vote on that. So that's the dividend. That's our #1 priority. You won't see me change this on my watch. We're going to continue this trend. CapEx, 2.5%, we've said that before. It's been running that and we're very comfortable with that. Acquisitions, yes. We still have a target, internal target here of 4% to 5% we'd like to do in acquisitions. We are in all different stages of discussions with a number of different acquisitions all over the world. And our anticipation is yes, we'd still like to get something to the finish line here by the end of the fiscal. Whether we do or not, I can't promise you. But we don't want to leave a lot of money on the balance sheet. We're with you 100% there. So if these don't work out, I think you're going to see us be a little bit more aggressive as to how we deploy the cash with respect to maybe share buybacks, things like that. It's not like we haven't bought any shares back. We bought about $51 million back in the second quarter. That's on top of $49 million in the first quarter, which gives you $100 million for the half. And we'll do another $100 million, just routine 10b5-1 buybacks for this year. So that'll be $200 million on the share buyback. Again, if we don't see clear to doing something else with the cash, specifically acquisitions, we'll take another look at share buyback and other possibilities here. But we're with you as far as the amount of cash on the balance sheet. We're definitely there. We don't think that we're going to need to do anything else on pensions. We did $75 million in the first quarter. We don't anticipate doing much else in pensions. We're in good shape there. The very first priority is also everybody in the company, as you might expect, is to get the restructuring to the finish line. So the fact that there's a little bit of a lull here in acquisitions, frankly, gives me a little bit more comfort because I want the whole team living up to what we told you, folks, we're going to do as far as that restructuring, too. So that's not an excuse for us. It just happens that maybe we have a little lull here, and that's going to help us with the restructuring as well and get that to the finish line for you. I hope that helps you, Jamie. I know that may not be exactly what you wanted to hear, but I think in general terms, that's what we're thinking and what we'll be working on for the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","My first question is on what you said about Asia. And you said the greatest sequential order growth was in all of Asia. Now that includes China, is that true in China, as well as the rest of Asia? Or are there differences?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, I think China -- if you look at the PMI for China, I think would be the first place to look. It went up the slightest. But keep in mind that, that is the general overall average of everyone's feelings about China. I think when you get to specific markets, you'll find that there's a great diversity of things being up versus things being down. As I said before, the construction piece of that has really been a drag. So there is -- there are other good segments that are -- that can pull that up and have been pulling it up. So when we look at our business in Asia, we're north of 100%. That means that on our 3\/12 basis, we expect the year to be better than the prior year, we're almost at 110% actually for Asia in total. That includes, like you said Alex, India, Australia, China and Korea and Japan and so forth. And Japan has been a positive trend for us of late as well. So yes, certain segments are down, but overall, I think Asia is coming back nicely. Gradually, but nicely for us.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Okay. Do you think that China has still got as much potential as you did when you made your investments there or greater?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. I think it's got as much or greater. I think -- we can't write them off. I mean, this country is going to grow. They've got the engine moving. Yes, they're -- they have to slow down and take a little pause, I think, once in a while, and I think that's what they're doing. But the activity levels are still high there. I think that what we saw, Alex, as far as 13% growth rates in the past, it's probably going to be more like 5%, okay? I think they talk about 7% or 8%. I think probably 5% or -- between 5% and 7% probably is going to be more normal, what we see going forward. So we don't anticipate 13% rates. But we still anticipate a level of growth of that's going to be higher than probably most of the other regions around the world.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Yes, absolutely. I don't see anything wrong with 5% to 7%.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Now second question is this, you mentioned that your internal guidance was $1.14.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Right.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","And yet, there were estimates much higher than that, some as high as $1.35.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Right, right. [indiscernible] That ruined my Christmas, by the way, when I saw those numbers.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Well, they had been out for a while.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","The thing is, those expectations were very high and people expected you to raise your guidance for the year and that was a widespread expectation. So that's why I think the stock is off today. You don't have the kind of volatility in your stock price, so I'm wondering why you didn't guide the Street down during the quarter, so that you wouldn't get a negative surprise in the way we did in the guidance?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes, I don't know why we got a negative surprise in the guidance. The bottom line was we had been talking for the first 2 quarters about the second quarter being in the worst quarter in our year. We do this every year. We make that known out there and then yet we still get estimates that are way, way higher than us for the second quarter, and I don't understand. And I think we probably need to do a better job offline just explaining to everybody that, hey, the second quarter is -- don't get ahead of us here. And the other thing for the year, like we said before, we are -- we'll adjust the numbers and the range and all that as we go forward. And typically, what we've done this year is basically what we've done in the past years is that, we'll narrow the range as we get closer to the end. It doesn't -- it's not -- it doesn't make any sense to keep a wide range as you're getting closer to the end of the fiscal. But I didn't look at this as drop in the range or missing anything. I think we're right on target. We feel that we're right on target. Yes, we narrowed it. We reduced the top, but, hey, we raised the bottom. So I mean, look, you can't look at half of it. It's like a cup half full or half empty. I think you've got to look at both ends of the range. One end went up and the other one went down and the midpoint is the same. We look at that as consistent and if things develop as we hope they will, a little better based on all the things I've just told you in the third quarter, you'll see us move the range accordingly. We'll make the adjustments as needed.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Yes, you went up $0.10 up and $0.10 down on the...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to return to the capital allocation discussion and really appreciate that you largely answered the question already. But could you help us understand kind of the sort of milestones we should look for, given it seems like you're trying to balance 2 things against what appears to be a building industrial recovery. Those would be potential acquisition investments and then a more rapid capital redeployment. So I'm just wondering if you could kind of help us understand timing or milestones?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, I think when we talk about the acquisitions and the capital redeployment, I think that, to us, it's not a rebalancing. It's really trying to put the money where we really want to put it, and that is growing the business, okay? I want -- I'm -- I always default to trying to grow the business. I think at the end of the day, we've got to keep the top line going up. We've got to keep the operating earnings going up. So I'm not going to buy back a lot of shares if there's any hope at all that we can grow the top line faster by deploying those dollars in a different fashion, and specifically to make some good, strategic acquisitions for us. Having said that, though, I also am aware that it's not good to keep a lot of money on the balance sheet just sitting there, especially in this kind of environment. And we will -- if it looks like we can't adequately deploy a significant amount of those dollars that are sitting there, then we will take other actions. I guess that would be the best way to put it. So I don't think that's inconsistent with what I've said in the past. I think maybe I may have been a little bit more explicit about that, but it's not inconsistent with the way I'm thinking.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, Don. And then if I could sneak in a restructuring. And it looked a little lighter than we expected in Q2, but the gross restructuring for the full year, really, the guidance didn't change. So a little bit of shift out of Q2 into the second half, could you comment on -- is this just timing of projects? And then is there any change in the fiscal 2014 view for the $0.15 restructuring benefit that you guys previously communicated?","Jon P. Marten","Yes, Andy. Jon here. Yes, I think as you've touched upon it here, this is as we explained in August, this is a series of many, many projects. And some of the projects, some of the very big ones have moved from Q2 to Q3. And with our best intentions, as we laid out our sequence of events on the restructuring, as the complexities of accomplishing all of our goals for all of the projects came to light through the quarter here, we knew that we had to move it. We are still expecting $0.47 gross for the year, our $6.40 includes the savings that we're going to get from those. Obviously, those savings are moving out to the right a little bit, but we are maintaining our guidance at the $6.40 here to include a few cents less in savings that we had anticipated at the beginning of the year in August when we tried to describe the restructuring to you at that time. Please, keep in mind for us, this is a very, very big program for us by a factor of 4 or 5 than we've ever done before in 1 year. And we're really pleased with our progress, but it's just -- we're moving from 1 quarter to another at this point. And that's what's included in our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Raso of ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So the quarter on the restructuring, you had about $0.06 of EPS help by the restructuring moving to the right. I know you're not going to give us fiscal '15 guidance right now, but if you get the full $0.47 restructuring done this year, is that all the actions that are planned? I just want to make sure we understand. Is this generally supposed to be done by the end of this fiscal year?","Jon P. Marten","David, yes.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And also the projects you're looking into.","Jon P. Marten","Yes, David. Although we've slipped from 1 quarter to another, we have full commitment from our team that we're going to get this done in FY '14. That was our goal at the beginning of the year. That's still our commitment to ourselves and to our board, as well as everybody. And we have the project plans detailed out, to enable us to get there. So as I say, we're not taking this lightly. We understand the complexity of what we're trying to do in all of these projects, and we are determined to get all of the restructuring done in FY '14.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And the tax rate, x the onetime items to be consistent with the guidance, x the impairment, x GE, Aero, what is a tax rate guidance now?","Jon P. Marten","29%. 29%, David.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, on the order growth. I mean, given everything you spoke of last quarter, you highlighted all the PMI data, I would argue most folks are probably looking for order growth rates to accelerate and they basically held steady. Can you characterize what your expectations were on order growth for the quarter and what you actually received?","Jon P. Marten","Well, I think the one point to make on the order growth is that what is accelerating and by virtue of the data that we provided is our growth in international rest-of-world. Europe, as well as we were explaining to Jamie, it also accelerated within the quarter. So it's our International Industrial segment that is really driving that. That 5% overall growth includes a move from 5% to 6% in International. And North America was up at -- remained at 3% growth rate. So in general, as you well know, we will see a lag, and we are expecting continued order growth as time goes forward here. The one point to make, David, that this may be helpful to you is just, as Don talked about, so pleased with our progress on distribution and we are really and historically, we'll see that continue on. It's just such a powerful part of our cost structure and our sales -- ability to generate sales each quarter. In our guidance going forward, we -- as we looked at our entire OEM base, although the OEM progress for all of North America, as well as internationally, was good during the quarter, we did not want to move our sales guidance up for the full year until we got another quarter under our belt. And so that's why Don and Pam were trying to explain here that we'll give you a better update here after our Q3.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Well, that was -- it was interesting, the North American margins, you lowered them in the guidance, but your mix, all right, more distribution. I'm surprised you took them down. Is there something else to consider there, why the margin guidance came down despite distribution is the highlight?","Jon P. Marten","Yes, we were really very careful about looking at those North American margins. And my advice at this point, would be to don't overreact to that. We are not trying to signal anything. We were taking a roll-up of all of the businesses here for the second half and we'll see over time those margins come back up. So no, we're not seeing any shift in the OEM margins long-term at all here. We were just trying to be more precise for the year and try to give you our best information at this point in time.","Pamela J. Huggins","And just to add on to that, David. We do see that North America is going to be considerably ahead of last year even with that small tweak. So Jon said it absolutely the best way that you could.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of MKM Partners.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","So a follow-up on the restructuring question, given some of the moving pieces on timing here, how does that affect or does it affect the savings calendar for next year, i.e., do you capture all of that in '15 or does some of that start to leak out into '16?","Jon P. Marten","No, we are still going to capture '15 to remain intact. So we are not going to see a bleed-over in the restructuring into '15 and certainly, we're going to have the savings that we projected for '15 in our projections, once we come out with '15. As Don has articulated, we are very focused on this restructuring program that is going to allow us to get 15% in '15. And that's the purpose of -- in part of trying to make sure that everything that we do in '14 is a major #1 focus for us to get that restructuring done and get it completed here in Q3 and in Q4.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And then if I could just sneak in one last question for Don, Don you mentioned an appetite to revisit buyback at some greater magnitude if the M&A pipeline doesn't fill up. Are you comfortable putting a number around where the balance sheet should be from debt to cap, debt to EBITDA, however you guys want to think about it, where you would be willing to take the balance sheet, just on buyback?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, just traditionally and it really hasn't changed. When we look at our leverage on the balance sheet, if I just talk about leverage for a second. We don't want to do anything that would jeopardize our A rating on our debt. We've had that for as long as I've been at the company, 40-some years. And we don't want to jeopardize that, so all the 3 rating agencies have us A-rated on our debt. And so why I say that, then we could take our leverage up to probably 37% comfortably. I mean we've even -- we've been there before. We could maybe even go slightly above that, but we would do that in conjunction with discussions with the rating agencies if need be. So that's the first thing we do. We just say hey, we're just not going to jeopardize that. Yes, we could drop our debt rating and go to higher levels, but we're not going to do it.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Got you. And that's on a gross basis?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Or net basis? Okay. Gross.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Gross.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Nathan Jones, Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wondered if I could just follow-up on a question that David asked earlier, specifically on North American orders, which is where I thought we might see some accelerating growth. Don, you've been talking about the PMIs, the new order PMI number is above 60. Would it have been your expectation that we would have seen that manifest in some stronger demand by now?","Donald E. Washkewicz","I didn't see 60, Nathan. I saw 57 --","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The new order portion of it, which is the...","Donald E. Washkewicz","Oh, the new order portion. I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm just wondering, Don, if in your experience, you would have expected to see these kinds of forward indicators manifesting in better order growth for you at this point?","Donald E. Washkewicz","There's always usually a lag, okay? So the question is, how much of a lag? And I, frankly, I haven't gotten in to try to decipher that at all. But I think it will manifest into improvements over time. The question is, when is it going to all hit? I'm seeing it on the distribution side already. I'm seeing exactly what I would call -- but remember, distribution is more real time. They order because we've got this thing leaned out pretty good. What they need this month, they're ordering this month. So I'm seeing those orders. It's the OEM side that gets to be a little -- our ability to predict is a little bit less on the OEM side than it would be on the distribution side. So I think it's going to develop. I think it has developed on distribution and it will follow on the rest of the business, especially to OEMs in time.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up, I think if I do the math, the incrementals in Industrial International were about 40% if I take out the restructuring charges. Is that kind of an incremental level we should be looking for you to hold for the next few quarters coming off these low levels of demand?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, we had -- for the company, we -- overall, we did 30%, okay? And that's made up of --","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm just talking specifically about Europe.","Donald E. Washkewicz","You're talking about Europe.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Or International.","Jon P. Marten","Yes, I think for International, David, at the very beginning, of course, long-term our target is 30% at the very beginning of the uptick, which we are starting to see right now quite often. And normally, this is barring restructuring. We'll see MROS greater, much greater than 30% and we've done 40s in the International Industrial business going forward here also. So, and this would also include, of course, the savings that we're going to get from our restructuring that we're working on here, which is primarily in our international sector, although it's -- there is restructuring happening throughout the world for us. So I think 40% is not out of range. We wouldn't want to commit to that for a very long period of time and I would not disagree with your math that you're doing here in Q2.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So perhaps I'm the only one, but I thought your order number was good this quarter, particularly given the tougher comps. What I am surprised by a little bit is that you maintained your revenue guidance. You actually took Industrial International down slightly at the midpoint. And then going back to the margin piece, given the improving volumes, are you just seeing worse mix than you originally anticipated? Was pricing worse on the order side? I'm just trying to really understand why margins came down, specifically on Industrial North America.","Jon P. Marten","I think that for industrial North America, the margins on -- we are not trying to signal to anybody anything about North America margins. Our North America margins in our industrial sector are very high for us. They are at a high rate for FY '14. They're projected to be higher in FY '14 than in FY '13. When we get to this range of margins in North America, we start to get into territory that we have not been living in. We are so proud of the way that we've been able to execute on the win strategy and really penetrate markets that are with new products that are just doing very, very well for us and well above our expectations. But our margins in North America are just very high and -- but we hesitate to continue to project for our guidance margins that are higher than we've ever seen before in general.","Pamela J. Huggins","This is Pam speaking. One of the things to keep in mind is that we have $0.20 in the third quarter with restructuring. And as you know, when you're doing this type of restructuring, which is the biggest restructuring that we've ever done in this company, there's noise associated with that. Our forecast is a bottoms-up forecast. It's only natural that people are going to be somewhat cautious when they have the biggest amount of restructuring. And even though restructuring is mostly in International, there is a portion of that restructuring that's taking place in North America that is going to fall mostly in the third quarter. So we're not signaling [ph] that there's anything -- a problem with North America in anyway. We think that North America is going to be a good year. It's going to be ahead of last year significantly, and that is a very tweak in terms of what really came down in North America. That's why we give a range. We didn't feel that it was prudent to increase it to what it was last quarter, when we give you a range anyway. So we left it where it was because that's what we received from our operating group. So I wouldn't be overly concerned with that. I -- that's really not a problem or it's not a concern that I have.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful color. I guess just segueing on a follow-up question on the restructuring. I just want to make sure I'm clear. It's going to be a $0.20 charge in the third quarter, the remainder in the fourth quarter to get you to $0.47. I missed your comments earlier, Jon, are you expecting the benefits to still be $50 million and is that all coming through -- I'm sorry, $30 million and is that all coming through in the fourth quarter?","Jon P. Marten","No, we're not saying exactly what the savings are going to be from that. We are saying that the savings are intact for FY '15. Because we didn't get every bit of the restructuring done when we wanted to get it done, as in the shortfall that we had in Q2 because of the shift to Q3, we're not going to get those savings, but what I am saying is that despite that, we are maintaining our guidance for the year and we will be making it up in other places. And so we are fully committed to our $6.40 for the year.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So some of it is shifted to 2015 and that amount in 2015, the run rate is still $80 million?","Jon P. Marten","That's right. That is correct. Yes.","Pamela J. Huggins","Okay. I think at this time, we've reached the end of our hour here. So we'll have to turn it over to Q&A, Matthew, if you're -- we are going to end our Q&A session, excuse me. And we are going to turn it over to Don with some closing comments. Apologies.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes. Thanks, Pam. Just a few comments. First of all, I want to thank everyone on the call for joining us this morning. I certainly and I think the rest of the team here, certainly appreciates the thoughtful questions and the dialogue as far as the year. It's a complicated year. There's a lot of moving pieces. I think you can see that and it's, believe me, we spent a lot of time going over all these pieces and try to make sure that we give you the very best picture we can of what's happened and then what's about to happen. And of course, the only thing we can be sure of is that we're never going to be right. We're going to either be too aggressive or not aggressive enough, and we'll probably never hit anything right on the head. But we'll do our best and I certainly appreciate you hanging in there with us.","Our current expectation for the balance of this fiscal year is for ongoing moderate improvement. Again, we don't see this huge ramp-up like in other periods, but we didn't see a huge decline in order trends in this period like we have in the past. So you're not going to see the huge transition, but it's going to be a moderate improvement in global markets, which is still going to be a positive for us. And actually, with all this restructuring going on, I'm happy that it's not a huge ramp-up because we'd be trying to do that in the midst of a major restructuring. I think that could have been an issue. So right now, things are moving in the right direction at the right speed. I think it's going to be a good fiscal year for us as we finish it out in the next half. We also expect to complete that restructuring that we talked about and outlined for you with a full benefit, as we've indicated through our current fiscal '15. So we don't expect to have any trailing issues there throughout the balance of this year.","These factors are anticipated to drive stronger performance in the second half of the fiscal compared with the first half and traditionally, as you recall, Parker does have more of a 48%, 52% kind of mix. Our second half is always stronger than our first half, unless we're going in some massive decline in a horrible recession or something. So typically, you'll see that second half being stronger. I think those of you that have followed us, certainly realize that.","As always, at this point, I would also like to take the opportunity to thank our employees for their continued commitment and success. Our global team continues to do a great executing the win strategy and delivering the positive results that you've seen here of late. So we're really pleased with that. If you have any additional questions, Pam will be here the balance of the day. I certainly want to wish all of you, since this is our first call in the New Year, a happy and healthy New Year to everybody on the call. Goodbye, and have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions]","I'd now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Financial Officer, Cathy Suever. Please go ahead.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, James. Good morning. Welcome to Parker Hannifin's second quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks.","Today's presentation slides together with the audio webcast replay will be accessible on the company's investor information website at phstock.com for one year following today's call.","On slide number two, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor Disclosure Statement, addressing forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and are also posted on Parker's website at phstock.com.","Today's agenda appears on slide three. To begin our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, will provide comments and highlights from the second quarter. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's second quarter performance, together with the guidance for the full year fiscal 2019. Tom, will then provide a few summary comments and we'll open the call for a question-and-answer session.","Please refer now to slide number four. Tom will get us started.","Tom Williams","Thank you, Cathy, and good morning everybody. Thanks for your interest in Parker and your participation today. So I'm going to start by first highlighting Parker's business model, which Cathy mentions on slide four, specifically those competitive differentiators that really help us stand out versus other companies and versus our competition. So first on the list and first and foremost is the Win Strategy. It's our business system. It's a proven strategy that has a long track record of success.","The second will be our decentralized divisional structure. We like that structure because it's close to the action. We want our people close to the customers and close to the P&L, so that we know whether we're making money or not.","The breadth and integration of Parker's technology portfolio really creates this combination technologies that creates a unique, customer value proposition. I think this is best demonstrated by the fact that 60% of our revenue comes from customers that buy more and more of those technologies.","We make engineered products. About 85% of our products have some kind of intellectual property wrapped around them. Our products have long product life cycles, which is a great thing. We're balanced between OEM and aftermarket and support this business model only requires low operating CapEx requirements, which is very positive. We've got a great track record on cash generation and deployment and we want to continue that over the cycle going forward.","So some key takeaways for the quarter. Safety is always our top priority. We had really strong performance; 23% reduction in recordable incidents. This is building on great progress from prior quarters. My thanks to everyone for their efforts on owning safety, the leaders and all the team members of the company. And I would just remind shareholders there's a very close linkage between safety performance and financial and customer performance. And you can see that linkage as we improve safety seeing the performance in our customer and our financial metrics.","We put up a number of second quarter records. This was on sales, segment operating margins, net income and EPS. We reached 16.4% as reported on operating margins in the quarter. This is an unprecedented level of performance for the second quarter. If you were to go back years ago it would normally be a Q4 type of performance to get what we did in Q2, a really significant job for everybody around the world.","Our organic growth came in positive at almost 6%, partially offset by currency and we had strong cash flow and free cash flow conversion for the quarter driven by operating income growth and good working capital management. As a result of all this, we're increasing earnings guidance for the fiscal year and we remain confident in our ability to reach our new guidance for FY 2019 as well as FY 2023 five-year financial targets. So my thanks to the team members of Parker around the world. Great progress, great results. Thank you so much.","So, a couple more comments about the quarter. A strong quarter, nice earnings improvement year-over-year as I mentioned in the number of records. From a net standpoint our sales came in at 3%, again with almost 6% organic, which is very close to our guidance spot on. Order rates moderated. It was a combination of tougher comparables as well as growth moderating. We'll talk more about that during the Q&A.","Net income was a Q2 record, which included income tax expense related U.S. Tax Reform of $14 million. And segment operating margins again was a record 16.4% as reported. This compares if you look what was -- the previous Q2 record was 14.4%.","So if I could just comment for a second. Most of the time when you beat a margin record, you beat it by 10 to 50 basis points. So nominal type of beat. The fact that we beat this by 200 basis points is very significant. We almost never do something like that. That was remarkable. And of note is that this includes the CLARCOR intangibles as well as the cost to achieve. Again, a really outstanding result.","If I would switch now on an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins for the total company were 16.6%, which was up year-over-year 170 basis points versus Q2 of FY 2018. Aerospace had another great quarter making three straight quarters with margins over 19%. A great job of aerospace team demonstrating really nice returns on the significant amount of investments that we made there over the last decade or so. And what we've done is we've built a long-cycle, high-performing business that we're excited about now and we're excited about what the future is going to bring for the aerospace business.","On an as reported EBITDA standpoint EBITDA margins were up 120 basis points to 17.0% or 17.2% on an adjusted basis. So I spent a fair amount of time talking about margins. There's three big factors that drove margin expansion for us. Again, it starts with the Win Strategy and execution the team's doing on that. The productivity what we demonstrated in the plants and the plant closures improving there and supply chain optimization.","Cash flow switching to cash was strong. We expect to exceed 100% free cash flow conversion and operating cash greater than 10% of sales for the fiscal year. This will be excluding discretionary pension contribution. And then on share repurchase where we bought a total of $500 million in Q2. This is made up of a discretionary repurchase of $450 million and our 10b5-1 program repurchasing $50 million.","So now switching to the outlook. We're increasing EPS guidance by $0.09 at the midpoint to $11.29. This is on an as-reported basis. And we're now increasing it $0.20 at the midpoint to $11.60 on an adjusted EPS basis. This reflects the strong first half that we had and the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.","We're forecasting moderating sales growth based on our current order entry and currency impact and this has a forecasted organic growth range of 2% to 4% for the full fiscal year. We are in a great position the best position we've ever been to outperform regardless of the market environment.","Several factors underpin our confidence and ability to perform here. New Win Strategy is demonstrating a distinct step-change in performance. I think the best example is, if you would look at our margin expansion over the last four years that's a great indicator that there's clearly a step change of performance and the underpinning of that is the Win Strategy. But what really gives us a lot of confidence is that we're still in early days in the Win Strategy performance.","And I would just highlight a few opportunities there. The first is our high-performance team process which is all about creating an ownership culture of the company. As you have owners evolve and continue to care more and drive more engagement you're going to see performance improve with it. Simplification initiatives are still early days. The innovation pipeline is growing. And the combination of lean and kaizen opportunities and our supply chain strategies are going to continue to yield margin expansion as we go forward.","We are stronger as a company now than we've ever been. Our cost structure is in the best shape that it's been. And we're well-positioned to manage any kind of market dynamics and softening. The combination of our earnings growth cash flow, our strong balance sheet, gives us a number of capital deployment opportunities as we continue to drive increased shareholder value.","We continue to have confidence in our ability to reach the financial targets in FY 2023 \u2013 2020-2023 that we communicated in last year's Investor Day. And just as a reminder what those are, to grow organically 100 basis points faster than the market this will be over the cycle, segment operating margins of 19%, EBITDA margins of 20%, free cash flow conversion greater than 100%, and EPS CAGR over this time period of 10% plus.","In sum, we anticipate another record year for FY 2019 and we're making good progress towards our new five-year targets.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Cathy for a more detailed review on the quarter.","Cathy Suever","Okay. Thanks, Tom.","I'd like you to now refer to slide number 6 and I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $2.51 which is a 17% increase compared to $2.15 for the same quarter a year ago. The differences between the as-reported results and the adjusted results are as follows.","Fiscal year 2019 second quarter operating income adjustments include business realignment expenses of $0.01 and CLARCOR cost to achieve of $0.03. This compares to prior-year adjustments of $0.07 for business realignment expenses and $0.07 for CLARCOR costs to achieve. In fiscal year 2018, we also adjusted other expense to exclude a net gain of $0.05 from the sale of assets and the write-down of an investment.","Income tax expense in the current year second quarter has been adjusted by $0.11 for a tax expense related to U.S. Tax Reform. This updates the initial net one-time tax reform adjustment of $1.65 adjusted for in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.","On slide number 7, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $2.15 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to $2.51 for the second quarter of this year.","The most significant increase came from higher adjusted segment operating income of $0.41 attributable to earnings on meaningful organic growth, synergy savings from acquisitions, and increased margins as a result of Win Strategy initiatives. Lower average shares resulted in an increase of $0.07 and lower interest expense contributed $0.03.","Adjusted earnings per share was reduced by $0.06 due to higher income tax expense in fiscal year 2019 driven by higher earnings. And higher year-over-year corporate G&A expense primarily as a result of losses in market-adjusted investments tied to deferred compensation resulted in a $0.09 per share reduction.","Moving to slide 8, you'll find total Parker sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter. Total company organic sales in the second quarter increased year-over-year by 5.7%. There was a 0.5% negative impact to sales in the quarter from prior year divestiture, while currency negatively impacted the quarter by 2.2%.","Total segment operating margin on an adjusted basis improved to 16.6% versus 14.9% for the same quarter last year. This 170 basis point improvement reflects the benefits of higher volume, productivity improvements and the benefits of synergies from acquisitions combined with the positive impact from our Win Strategy initiative.","Moving to slide number 9, I'll discuss the business segments starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the second quarter, North American organic sales increased by 5% as compared to the same quarter last year. Our prior year divestiture accounted for a 0.4% loss of sales, while currency also negatively impacted the quarter by 0.3%.","Operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis was 16% of sales versus 15.1% in the prior year. This 90 basis point improvement for North America reflects the hard work dedicated to productivity improvements as well as the benefits from additional volume, synergies from acquisitions and the impact of our Win Strategy initiatives.","I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial International segment on slide number 10. Organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment increased by 3.6%. Negative impact from a prior year divestiture accounted for 0.8% of sales, while currency negatively impacted the quarter by 5.3%. Operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis was 15.7% of sales versus 14.2% in the prior year, reflecting increased volume, improved operating cost efficiencies from realignment initiatives and the benefits of the Win Strategy.","I'll now move to slide number 11 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased an impressive 12.2% for the second quarter due to strength in the military and commercial OEM businesses as well as the aftermarket businesses.","Operating margin for the second quarter was 19.7% of sales versus 16.0% in the prior year reflecting the benefits of higher volume and cost efficiencies, the impact of a favorable sales mix, the deferral of some development costs and good progress on the Win Strategy initiatives.","Moving to slide 12, we show the details of order rates by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and a reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average while the Aerospace Systems segment reports on a 12-month rolling average.","Total orders increased by 1% as of the quarter end. This year-over-year growth is made up of flat order growth from Diversified Industrial North America, a decline of 2% from Diversified Industrial International orders and a 10% growth from Aerospace Systems orders.","On slide 13, we report cash flow from operating activities. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $541 million. When adjusted for a $200 million discretionary pension contribution made during the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $741 million or 10.7% of sales. This compares to 6.8% of sales for the same period last year.","The significant capital allocations year-to-date have been $200 million for the payment of shareholder dividends; $550 million for share repurchases of common shares made up of $100 million through our 10b5-1 plan and $450 million of discretionary share repurchases completed in the second quarter; and $200 million for the previously mentioned discretionary pension contribution.","The revised full year earnings guidance for fiscal year 2019 is outlined on Slide number 14. Guidance is being provided on both an as reported and an adjusted basis. We have adjusted our sales outlook for the second half to reflect current order trends and current currency rates.","Total sales increases for the year are now expected to be in the range of minus 0.4% to plus 2.0% as compared to the prior year. Anticipated organic growth for the full year is forecasted in the range of 2% to 4%, or 3% at the midpoint.","The prior year divestiture, negatively impact sales by 0.4% and currency is expected to have a negative 1.9% impact on sales for the year. This calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended December 31 and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the remaining quarters of fiscal 2019.","For total Parker, as reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 16.7% and 17.2%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 17.0% and 17.4%. The full year effective tax rate is projected to be 23%. This anticipates a tax expense run rate of 24% for the third and fourth quarters.","For the full year, the guidance range on an as reported earnings per share basis is now $11.04 to $11.54 or $11.29 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis the guidance range is now $11.35 to $11.85 or $11.60 at the midpoint.","This updated guidance on an adjusted basis, excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $19 million or $0.11 per share for the full year fiscal 2019 with the associated savings projected to be $10 million.","The guidance on an adjusted basis also excludes $15 million or $0.09 per share of CLARCOR costs to achieve expenses. CLARCOR synergy savings are estimated to ramp to a run rate of $125 million by the end of fiscal 2019 which represents an incremental $75 million of run rate savings as we exit fiscal 2019. We remain on-track to realize the forecasted $160 million run rate synergy savings and $100 million revenue synergies by fiscal year 2020.","And finally, guidance on an adjusted basis also excludes $0.11 per share for the second quarter tax expense related to U.S. Tax Reform.","Savings from business realignment and CLARCOR costs to achieve are fully reflected in both the as-reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges. We ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison.","Some additional key assumptions for full year 2019 guidance at the midpoint are; sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half; adjusted segment operating income is divided 47% first half, 53% second half; adjusted earnings per share first half, second half is divided 46%, 54%.","Third quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $2.99 per share at the midpoint and this excludes $0.05 of projected business realignment expenses and $0.01 of projected CLARCOR costs to achieve.","On slide 15 you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of fiscal year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $11.60 at the midpoint, compared to the prior guidance of $11.40 per share.","Increases include $0.11 from stronger segment operating income, $0.03 from lower full year tax expense, and $0.20 from reduced average shares. Offsetting these increases is an $0.11 per share decrease from higher corporate G&A than previously forecasted due to market adjusted investments tied to deferred compensation and higher other expense attributed to mark-to-market accounting of equity investments in the second quarter as well as $0.03 from higher interest expense for the year. Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisitions or divestitures that might close during the remainder of fiscal 2019.","On slide 16 you'll find the components of our updated full year increased guidance relative to the outperformance in the second quarter versus our initial guidance going into the quarter. Actual second quarter earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $0.12 stronger than previously guided due to excellent operating performance, partially offset by higher corporate G&A and other expense attributable to the market investment losses previously mentioned.","For the balance of the year, we expect net incremental per share benefits of $0.08. Lower tax expense will provide $0.03 and $0.16 will occur due to the lower average shares. Offsetting these favorable items will be the impact that moderating growth will have on operating income in the second half of $0.10 per share as well as an expected net $0.01 unfavorable impact from below the line items of corporate G&A interest and other expense. All of this equates to a net increase to adjusted earnings per share for the full year of $0.20.","This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you.","Tom Williams","Thank you, Cathy. We're very pleased with our continued progress. With the execution of Win Strategy we're projecting another earnings record for fiscal 2019.","I just want to conclude by saying thank you to the global team for all the hard work their dedication and I thank our shareholders for their continued confidence in us.","And with that James I'll hand it over to you to start the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Excellent. Thank you, sir. At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning. Good morning Ann. I think maybe perhaps you could give us some color on the regions what you're seeing in the various regions and then the various end markets. We used to do the 3-12 and the 12-12 or the trends around the end markets and the regions. Perhaps we could start with that Tom.","Tom Williams","Okay. And this is Tom. I'll start. I'm going to give you maybe an overall framework and I'll hand it to Lee with more details. Let me start with the new guide and I'm going to focus on organic guide. So, we guided now to 2% to 4% as far as our range. And I'm going to put the regions in Aerospace into that range and give you where they sit.","So, on 2% to 4% Latin America would be above that range. Aerospace is above it. North America would be right at the midpoint. Asia-Pacific would be at the low end of that range. And EMEA would be flat. So, that's our view on organic growth for the full year.","Probably what's more important and interesting for everybody on the call is what are we seeing for the second half so our first six months of the calendar year 2019. So, our organic guide I'm going to kind of round the here is approximately a little less than 1% for the second half.","And the way that splits out is North America a little bit north of 1%, international about a minus 0.5% Aerospace at 2.5%. So, now if I split out international that minus 0.5% is around Latin America plus 5% Asia-Pacific flat, and EMEA about negative 1.5%. Again these are all second half numbers from us. So maybe a little bit of thoughts from me on what's behind the second half guide.","Well, let's start first with the most recent order entry and you all saw the numbers from the press release North America at 0; international minus 2; Aerospace at plus 10; Total company at 1. So, if I could step back for a second and back to where we were two years ago, we were clearly in an accelerating growth environment. That very naturally moves into a moderating growth as most business cycles do from an accelerating into a moderating growth and that's fully based on our last guide what we had projected for the second half.","However if I was to give you an analogy going from moderating to really what we guided to a slower growth I'd have you visualize a metal spring -- not spring the season, but a spring - a metal spring.","And I think that opinion and still, I think very capable of a moderate our organic growth. And it's still I think very capable of moderate growth environment. I don't think the dynamics have changed.","However, there's been some weights put on top of the spring and these weights would be the macroeconomic and geopolitical issues that we've all been talking about and reading about and listening to; and trade-related things, Brexit monetary policy, the oil and gas price softening and the government shutdown.","I'm very optimistic we are very optimistic that those weights, those macro issues will resolve themselves, maybe not all of them but several are going to resolve themselves. And that spring our organic growth guide for the second half that is currently now in slow growth environment can spring back to a moderate growth environment. The big question is when. I don't think anybody really knows the answer to that.","However, our guide assumes that those macro issues are not going to get resolved and enough time to really have much support or change to what our current second half guide is. So, that's a backdrop. I'm going to hand it over to Lee to give you more details on the markets.","Lee Banks","Okay, Ann. What I thought I would do if you don't mind is first just some color on Aerospace. I mean we were absolutely pleased with the performance in Aerospace strong organic growth. And I just thought I'd give you some color by the segments in Aerospace. So commercial OEM for us was up 11% in Q2 and we're guiding at the midpoint for 5% for the full year.","Military OEM up 24% in Q2 and a guide to 14% for the full year. Commercial MRO up 8%, a guide to 4% for the full year. And military MRO was a strong 9% in Q2 and a 3% guide for the full year. So these full year guides obviously some of this stuff is very lumpy and then there's tougher comps but that's our latest thinking right now. So we're guiding to 5.7% organic growth at the midpoint for Aerospace.","On the industrial side of the business what we did is just kind of look at this we took all our markets in Q2 how we saw them. And this is pretty consistent with Tom's comments how we're projecting them going forward. But we kind of put these markets in three buckets: growing and still stable growing, but moderating from Q1 and then soft to negative that we saw in Q2 and really was a carryover from Q1. Just reading through some of these markets that are still positive: Refrigeration is doing well. Telecom life sciences construction markets heavy-duty truck and North America and Europe fantastic build rates still.","The one area that is down significantly is in Asia China specifically and I'll comment on that later. Agriculture lawn and turf forestry material handling and I just talked about Aerospace. Moderating from Q1 and Q2 was distribution mostly North America; oil and gas mostly land-based oil and gas; and then general industrial and mining. And what we would consider soft or you could say negative and there's four of these that we would kind of put in the trade-related bucket. Mills and foundries which is -- impacts China significantly.","Automotive machine tools tires and rubber. And then there's four key markets that have been flat since Q1. Power gen, it hasn't gotten worse it's stable so I think we're bouncing along the bottom there. Semiconductor microelectronics if you will has gotten worse in Q2. Rail is stable and Marina is stable at a low level. I'll just comment quickly on the regions.","I think in North America we're still pretty bullish. Our distributor base is bullish. I'd say the only moderation we saw was really distribution that serves kind of the microelectronics markets and land-based oil and gas. It definitely took a step back. And I would say that clearly there were some rebalancing of inventory from some of our channel partners in North America in Q2.","On EMEA, you've got Turkey, Brexit tariffs and yellow jackets and they've put a lot of pressure on a lot of different areas. We're expecting slightly negative growth for the second half although we did see some rebounding in offshore North Sea oil and gas which was nice.","And we -- continued headwinds in the machinery markets mostly around Germany. And then, Asia, two great years strong comps as we talked about. I'd say overall Asia we're -- as Tom mentioned we're forecasting to be flat in the second half. So by and large we're very encouraged. As Tom mentioned, there are some pressure on some markets, but I don't get a sense everywhere that there's going to be some precipitous pullback. I just think we're in a kind of a pause, or slow growth area right now. So I'm going to stop. I just gave you a lot and go from there.","Ann Duignan","You did indeed. And I don't want to hog the call, but I just \u2013 could I just clarify without putting words in your mouth would North America distribution have been the one kind of that inflected the most during the quarter? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Lee Banks","It definitely pulled back North America. I would not say overall. I would say, those areas a little bit of re-bouncing across the channel and those areas are around land-based oil and gas pullback. But that's just off the hip, right? I don't think so. I don't think the most would be a wrong way to characterize it.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I'll leave it there. I appreciate the color.","Lee Banks","Thanks.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andy Casey","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Cathy Suever","Good morning, Andy.","Andy Casey","I'm wondering, how to view the Industrial International guidance for the second half. You're guiding the top line down a little bit. The margins are pretty resilient. And I'm just wondering is the resilience more a function of the structural cost work that you've done for that region? Is it mainly comps or is it something else?","Tom Williams","Andy, it's Tom. I think what you're seeing is a combination of things and you pointed to one of them. The restructuring that we've done \u2013 and I would characterize this for really all the regions. Obviously international we did probably more over the last several years than we had in North America. But it's a combination of that prior period restructuring so that fixed cost's in a lot better position than we've been. The new Win Strategy changes and that focus on simplification and the costs SG&A costs have come down.","Our variable costs have gotten better. The productivity in the plants, we saw continued to improve through the quarter. And our \u2013 we've continued to feel that they'll improve in the second half, which is why we \u2013 our margins are so resilient, with a little bit of softness there. And we've done a really nice job on supply chain and sort of just optimizing all the dynamics that are going on from a material inflation freight et cetera. So I think the team has done a great job of executing, but there's still a lot more opportunities there which is why we've guided to pretty good margins in the second half even with some softness in the top line.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then I think you said it, but if \u2013 investors seem to be worried about a downturn across several markets. I'm just wondering, what you would expect from Parker in terms of return performance, if the markets actually did go into a downturn. Are we looking at not only raised \u2013 increased margin performance that you've already demonstrated with this record in the second quarter, but also decreased return sensitivity to the changes and end market demand swings?","Tom Williams","Well, obviously Andy, it depends on the severity of a market swing. But I would tell you we have this continuous view on being cost leaders. Everything we're doing around the Win Strategy the execution there is on making us the most nimble and agile business that we possibly can be. And I think the best evidence of that is just plot our margins over the last four years what's happened. You've seen significant margin improvement. And of course in the second half, we're guiding to a little less sales and margins equal to or better than what we originally said in the last guide.","Now, typically over a cycle, we would expect sales would drop. That same 30% decremental I think is still a good rule of thumb. But what we've demonstrated over the last several cycles go back to 2002, I'm going to take a history lesson for those who haven't tracked the company for a long time, 2002 we had 60% drop in earnings. 2008 and 2009 it was a 40% drop. The 2015 to 2016 industrial recession contraction was a 20% drop.","And so we continue to get better. Our whole goal is to raise the floor raise the ceiling of margin performance. And while we're very proud of what we did in Q2 and very proud of and we're guiding for the first time in the history of the company to a 17% operating margin we clearly, clearly have a lot more opportunity in the future. So I'm not worried at all about any kind of softness. We've been practicing for this every day. We're ready for it.","Andy Casey","Thank you very much.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Cathy Suever","Good morning. Nathan.","Nathan Jones","Just like to dig a little bit further into the margin in North America. I think incrementals are in the mid to upper 30s in the second quarter North America versus kind of that 10 to 20 that you'd guided to for the first half, so clearly better there. And I think this is probably around the productivity improvement post-closing the CLARCOR and Parker facilities. Maybe Tom you could -- Tom or Lee you could talk a bit about the improvement in productivity there, if those businesses are now running at the levels that you expect them to run, if there's further improvement we're going to see in the third quarter? Just any color you can give us around that.","Tom Williams","Yes, Nathan. This is Tom. I would say first, you have a good ground-rooted improvement in productivity regardless of the plants that were involved in plant closures because you got all the other plants that are improving as well, Win Strategy execution and all the things that I talked about earlier in sort of my opening comments. So you got a good ground-based improvement in productivity specifically around the plants that -- and all the lines that we moved, we saw steady progress and productivity but we have more to do.","So we were pleased as you pointed out 37% more or less in North America for the quarter and beat what we had guided to what we communicated. But we expect that to continue to get better and we're guiding to an even stronger second half. So our belief that we told you last quarter about the second half being stronger than what we feel the first half would be that still holds true.","We may have gotten a little better faster. But what we've seen is there's still lots of opportunities whatnot yet at the complete rates that we need to be, so I think that bodes well to what our second half is going to be. And really I think signals -- not talking about FY 2020 yet, that signals that we have momentum in FY 2020 as well.","Nathan Jones","And maybe then just on the order -- the flat orders in North America in the quarter. Lee talked about some maybe channel rebalancing on the distribution side. Have you seen that abate into the third quarter here? Are you seeing any channel rebalancing or any OEM channel rebalancing there inventory there maybe with your OEMs anticipating a little slower growth, they tend to maybe take some inventory off the shelves? Or what your expectations are in both channels for inventory over say the next six months?","Lee Banks","Yes. Nathan, it's really hard for me to have a gauge through the OEM channel. But my feeling through the distribution channel is the rebalancing that took place is by and large done. I think there's real pull on demand that's taking place. And so, I don't feel like there's more pullback coming, given current market conditions right now.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Thanks very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. ","Julian Mitchell","Hi good morning. Maybe just following up in the industrial businesses on the cadence of the order changes that you saw in the last few months, was it in general when you look globally a big step down, very late in fiscal Q2? Or was it a steady deceleration since sort of early October?","And related to that perhaps, how should we think about the organic growth guide in the current quarter versus the fourth fiscal quarter? Is there any particular cadence on the industrial side that you would emphasize?","Tom Williams","Julian this is Tom. Let me -- I'll start first with the order trends and I'll maybe take region by region. So North America, pretty well declined equally -- equal parts through the quarter and really mirrored the -- if you'll go back to the prior year, the increases we had, so kind of a mirror image there.","I would say EMEA and Latin America was -- I'd say all the regions were pretty sequentially equal drops. EMEA and Latin America exited flat to prior, so remember our international was minus 2. Composition was EMEA and Latin America exiting flat and Asia Pacific exiting slightly negative on that end.","As far as the first half, second half, in the third quarter and Q4 on organic, we have a little bit better organic in Q3 and that's mainly because of comps with Aerospace in Q4. We had a huge Q4 in Aerospace with some big MRO activity that is unlikely to repeat. And so that's probably what's weighting it down.","But I would say in general how I articulated what we articulated as far as organic growth is not really too much different between Q3 and Q4.","Julian Mitchell","And then my second question would be around maybe switching to the balance sheet. You talked about the buyback step-up the $500 million or so in Q2. Does the demand slowdown at all, affect your appetite to undertake acquisitions? And therefore buybacks are a more logical use of cash? Or are you still equally interested in M&A as you look out over the rest of this year?","Tom Williams","Julian, maybe to start with, I'd like to cover the capital deployment from a comprehensive standpoint. So first is, dividends. We're going to keep that consecutive increase record. And we like to target 30% to 35% of net income on a rolling 5-year average.","And our dividends are going to grow because we're going to grow net income over this time period. CapEx as you -- my opening comments about one of the things that make us unique, we're pretty efficient on CapEx. We'll use CapEx to fund organic growth and strategic productivity.","So now to the heart of your question, is share purchase versus strategic acquisitions. And we like both. We will do what the best use of this for our shareholders for the long run. I think in general, acquisitions generate incremental cash, generate incremental EBITDA that would be the preference, provided that they meet our stringent and our disciplined view of acquisitions.","Over the cycle, it's important as far as where we are but what's more important is it's a strategic fit will it hit our return criteria's. We would model where we were organically into the DCF so we factor that in.","So I would just say the M&A pipeline is active. We're going to continue to look at properties really along two big things: We want a bit of consolidated choice in our space if the property is a good fit. And then all things being equal we're going to invest in engineering materials, aerospace, instrumentation, filtration; of course you've seen our -- the big investment we did in filtration.","But you saw on the last quarter, we bought shares. We didn't see a property that we could execute on that made sense. Nothing clicked. Remember the acquisition pipeline is not 100% first pass yield. It requires two people to get married. And we think we're a great value. And we know where the company's going. And we thought it was a great investment great time to buy Parker. For that matter it's never a bad time to buy Parker. So we'll continue to look at all those.","I think in general like you've heard me talk before; we want to have a balance sheet that is about the work. We have a great earnings profile. We have great cash flow. And we want to be great deployers and we're going to deploy the best possible way recognizing that our goal is to drive shareholder value over the long-term. And every quarter might be a little different, we tweak that, but I think you'll see us continue to be active.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Julian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Andrew Obin","Good morning. I guess, it\u2019s still morning. How are you guys?","Cathy Suever","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Burris","Just a question I guess for Tom and Lee. I remember maybe last year you guys were sort of stressing the fact that we're still in very early innings of the industrial cycle. And I looked at your growth and you guys have been spot on I get it. But it appear, you can just provide a sort of 5%, 6% organic growth for hydraulics for 2019; 8%. 9% for Aerospace market is guiding for a 7% for 2019.","So I'm just wondering what has happened to the cycle and why are you so different from other short-cycle industrials that I'm looking at 2019. And have you changed your view about the long run? Sorry for a long-winded question but just the difference in guidance is so stark between you and everybody else. Thanks.","Tom Williams","Andrew, it's Tom. I can't comment about everybody else. I'll just comment about what we see. We can -- if I take Aerospace, we continue to see Aerospace very strong. And we had robust orders. You saw order entry there we had a robust first half. Our second half will still be very strong sequentially. It's a 7% growth a sequentially. We had some pretty tough comparables in the second half, which makes it now look quite as strong, but I'd put up our Aerospace numbers against anybody in that space.","On the industrial side, we do tend to probably see things maybe a tad quicker than other people but we're giving you what we see right now and that's all we can do. The order entry in the prior quarter given the fact that our backlog is four to six weeks typically in the industrial piece is what you're going to yield out in the next quarter.","I still believe and as you've heard me talk about before that I still think this is a great industrial environment. I do think though that some of the uncertainties weighed on order demand, and I do think they'll resolve. Since our fiscal year ends June 30, I'm not sure they're going to resolve in time to influence our second half. Remember we're guiding only for our second half or our full year, which ends June 30 versus everybody else is guiding to a full year calendar 2019. So that's how I would describe it.","Andrew Burris","No. That's very fair. And just a follow-up question. Seeing how the channel check work is picking up very, very strong pricing even though we are seeing the slowdown you guys are talking about. Is there anything different about the industry pricing strategy in this cycle? It's just -- I've been doing it for a while and pricing seems to be as sticky as I've ever seen. Thanks a lot.","Lee Banks","Andrew, it's Lee. As you know, I mean, we're constantly measuring our input costs using our PPI metric and using our -- and seeing what's happening with inflation. There's certainly been a lot of inflation in this cycle some driven just by pure commodity pricing, some driven the extra things like tariffs, et cetera. So I think what you're seeing is just the ability to probably cover some of those input costs that are maybe a little different than past cycles.","Andrew Burris","Right. But what's driving this fundamental ability? That's a big deal.","Lee Banks","You mean for it to stick? Andrew, I think I lost you there. But I would just finish by saying that we were in a very rapid growth environment. I think supplier was paramount for everybody. And I think there's just strong brand recognition with Parker's brand throughout the channel. So not sure I get\u2026","Andrew Burris","You guys certainly doing a great job in the channel. I'll follow-up offline. Thanks a lot.","Lee Banks","Okay. Thanks.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning. I guess first question on Aerospace margins have been very strong in particular over the past three quarters. I know you're guiding for margins to deteriorate in the back half. But can you talk about mix or whether there's upside to Aerospace margins over the next couple of years and what would be driving that, I guess is my first question.","And then my second question just based on sort of what you're seeing uncertainty in the macro environment or in some of the slowdown in the markets you talked about, are you considering potentially additional restructuring actions at all and how we should sort of think about that? Or what actions you're taking to prepare if there is a downturn. Thanks.","Cathy Suever","Jamie, this is Cathy. I'll start on the Aerospace margin. We're very pleased with the margins that they achieved in the quarter and we do see a lot of improvement that they've worked hard at gaining in their infrastructure and their cost control. If you notice we did raise the guidance for their margins for the year a fair amount.","In the second half, you'll see maybe not as high as you would have expected and that's going to be driven by higher development costs in the second half than what we experienced in the first half. We're anticipating development costs for the year to finish somewhere between five in three quarters of their sales in a quarter. They did 5.5% in the first half and we're expecting closer to 6.5% in the second half just because of the timing of some of those development activities.","Tom Williams","And then Jamie, this is Tom. I'll take the market question there. Again, I would just go back to we're constantly preparing for any softness by just having the best cost structure we possibly can, but we will make market adjustments.","We're not seeing anything, yet that would warrant a change in our restructuring profile. We have a lot of levers you can pull that don't trigger that like reduction of temporary workforce, overtime reduction those type of things, recognizing that we have probably around 8% of our workforce total company that is temporary people. So, there's a number of levers we can move that won't trigger a restructuring change.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Catherine Suever","Thanks Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Raso","Hi, Good morning. Obviously, an important time for the stock and the company here in the sense of trying to show the evolution how does Parker handle a slowdown differently than in the past. And I mean this quarter obviously we're able to show weaker orders weaker organics still able to raise the guide do a good job in the quarter.","But just can you help frame a little bit thinking about really not that far away from six months from now fiscal 2020 Guide; we can all make our topline assumptions. But can you help us with -- when you look at the order patterns what you're seeing right now as you know North America -- if you look at the comparisons and you double stack them, right, the actual North American comp gets a little harder and then it begins to ease.","The international order comps start to ease from here. Can you help us level set again I know you're not going to give us fiscal 2020 guide right now but should we be thinking the order rates in North America and International are both negative in the current calendar 1Q? And then I'd like to follow up with a question on kind of cost side items or below the line items as well to think about puts and takes '20 versus 2019.","Tom Williams","David, it\u2019s Tom. As you might expect I won't get into FY 2020. But I think orders are going to be reflective of what I imagine that organic guide that I gave you for the second half meaning that a little less than 1% total company; North America up plus 1; International about minus 0.5; and Aerospace with 2.5.","So I think orders will mimic that. Obviously Aerospace orders are longer cycle lumpier so they may not look exactly like that. But I think the industrial pieces will mirror that organic guide that I gave you. And as far as below the line why don't you follow-up with that question.","David Raso","Sure. And just to be clear on your answer so it doesn't sound like you see the North American orders -- I'm not going to try to hold you to 100 200 bps here, but it doesn't sound like you see North American orders going maybe negative at all let alone any materiality. And then international orders it sounds like you also don't think that would get any worse from here. Is that a fair characterization of your answer? Just seeing what you're saying out there and knowing the comps.","Tom Williams","Yes. Again I would frac it with a little bit of a range. It's really hard to pinpoint this stuff. But I mean the numbers I gave you is our best estimate at this point based on the current order entry.","David Raso","And then on the year-over-year benefits. I know you're not going to quantify them. Just if you can help us a little bit. You're obviously going to have the share count help. The full year benefit of the plant closures and some of the approved -- improved efficiencies and I would suspect and we can debate the cost structure materials.","But you would think that for price cost maybe it even gets better as we look into the moment you have to give a guide on 2020? Can you help us a little bit maybe even prioritize for us is the biggest benefit, the plant closure efficiencies having that for a full year?","Obviously, repo versus M&A the next six months we can debate it, but it sounds like you have a nice share count health. Can you just kind of frame the puts and takes for us on those cost items and below the line items? And obviously, any other help you have on tax or anything would be great, just things that you see as of today.","Catherine Suever","David, I'll start it out here. We're forecasting some of the realignment activities that we're doing this year that we'll see $10 million of savings in the year and then that'll carry through. In terms of the integration and the synergy savings we're seeing with continuing to work on integrating CLARCOR, we've increased the run rate to up to $125 million through this -- the end of this year and that's a $75 million incremental. And we still then think that by the end of fiscal 2020 we'll be up to $160 million. So yes, we'll continue to see savings from those activities. In terms of price cost, we don't really talk about in that detail. Lee, you want to touch on that?","Lee Banks","No, I would just say on price cost David the way we track this in our -- our goal is just to be margin-neutral as we go through these.","Catherine Suever","And in terms of tax expense, we are forecasting an effective rate of 23% this year. I would expect that to be our continuing long-term rate for the next year or two unless things change significantly.","Thomas Williams","David, to a higher point here. I think what you're getting at is we got more room to go. We're going to end up 2017. We're on a mission to get to 2019. We're not stopping there. That's just a test. We're just going to stop for a minute and congratulate ourselves and keep moving. But we are very pleased with what we're seeing and I won't get into FY 2020 because we haven't done that, but we're going to continue to grow earnings and grow margins.","David Raso","Appreciate that. Thank you.","Catherine Suever","Thank you, David. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Excellent. Our final question will come from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Thank you Noel.","Joel Tiss","All right. Thank you. Just wondering just two things -- I wonder again just more of a characterization, but are the pieces largely in place for the 19% longer-term operating margins? Or are there more levers that have to be pulled? Or it just depends on what the volume profile looks like? And just help us get a sense of where you are there.","Tom Williams","Well it would be -- all the things -- Joel this is Tom. All the things that we've had in the Win Strategy all along in that infamous walk we've got that shows you where we were in FY 2018 at the IR Day to the 19%. And if I would just tell you the major ingredients without going through the numbers the CLARCOR synergy's a big part of it. All simplification program, which we didn't talk about is still early days. The whole 80-20 look at our revenue complexity is a big deal. We're down to 80 visions now 122 to 80 divisions. So 80 8-0 we continue to work that. But I would tell you that the revenue complexity side is a bigger deal.","Productivity, we have a lot of things we're doing on kaizen. We're combining lean and kaizen and some strategic CapEx investments we're making around automation those will continue to yield. We've done a great job in supply chain and we've been able to optimize the supply chain in a much more efficient way than I think maybe historically which we're pretty pleased with that. And we'll continue to leverage a fair amount of our spend that I think has not had as much visibility all indirect cost side of things.","And then, we're going to continue to have margin enhancements around change in the mix and distribution the innovation pipeline those type of things. So I think you all know us well enough. We wouldn't put out a number. Even though it was five years ago we don't think we had a roadmap to get there. So we believe in our roadmap. But I would just again emphasize that, it's not the final destination. And we got to 17% early. I'm not saying we'll get to 19% early, but our confidence is there.","Joel Tiss","And then just the last one in Aerospace. Is there any unusual mix that could put a little pressure on the margin progression over the next say 12 to 18 months?","Cathy Suever","Yes, good question Joel. We will see an increased volume of OEM activity of entry into service as some of the newer platforms are now ramping up, and that does start out at very low margins. So that will have some pressure on our Aerospace margins. But we are confident.","I mean we're forecasting a midpoint margin for this year of 19%, 19.1. And we -- the cost efficiencies that they've been working hard on I think will help balance against that mix pressure that they're going to feel in the next few years.","Joel Tiss","Okay. Thank you so much.","Cathy Suever","Thanks Joel. All right, this concludes our Q&A session and our earnings call for today. Thank you everyone for joining us. Robin will be available to take your calls, should you have further questions. Thanks everybody. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Parker Hannifin Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chris, and I will be your conference moderator for today. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will facilitate a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. And at this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to your presenter for today, Ms. Pamela Huggins, Vice President and Treasurer. Ma\u2019am, you may proceed.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. This is Pam Huggins speaking just as Chris just mentioned. I\u2019d like to welcome you to Parker Hannifin\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings release teleconference.","Joining me today is Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Don Washkewicz; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Marten.","For those of you who wish to do so, you can follow today\u2019s presentation with the PowerPoint slides that have been presented on Parker\u2019s website at www.phstock.com. For those of you not on the line, the slides will remain posted on the company\u2019s Investor Information website at the same website one-year after today\u2019s call.","At this time, reference slide number two in the slide deck which is the Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements. And again, just to remind you, if haven\u2019t already done so, please take note of this statement in its entirety.","Slide number three, this slide as required indicates that in cases where non-GAAP numbers have been used they\u2019ve been reconciled to the appropriate GAAP numbers and are posted on Parker\u2019s website again at phstock.com.","To cover the agenda today, slide four, the call will be in four parts. First, Don Washkewicz, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President will provide highlights for the quarter and for the full year.","Second, I\u2019ll provide a review including key performance measures of the fourth quarter and full year fiscal year 2012, concluding with the guidance for next year fiscal year 2013.","The third part of the call will consist of our standard Q&A session. And for the fourth part of the call today, Don will close with some final comments.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don and ask that you refer to slide number five titled Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal Year \u201812 highlights.","Don Washkewicz","Thanks, Pam, and welcome to everyone on the call. We\u2019re certainly very pleased to report our results following a strong fourth quarter and another record year for the company. I\u2019ll start-off by taking a moment to point out some of the highlights and some of the records for the quarter and then I\u2019m going to follow-up and talk a little bit about the full year.","So, first of all, the fourth quarter sales were a record at $3.4 billion, we\u2019re really pleased with the level of activity there that we\u2019re able to bring in the quarter. Net income for the quarter was $302 million or $1.96 per share on a diluted basis and we\u2019re certainly pleased with that, and that was ahead of the street consensus expectations.","The margins were strong 15.5% that also will go down in the record books as a record for the fourth quarter.","Cash flow was strong. We generated over $0.5 billion in operating cash flow in the quarter, I can remember years when we didn\u2019t generate $0.5 billion. So this is pretty exciting for the company.","We also -- so those are some of the quarter highlights, for the year then we closed out the fiscal year for Parker with a number of records as well. That includes the record sales of $13.1 billion that was up 6.5%, just and I might want to point out that most all of that was organic growth in a very tough economic environment out there.","Total segment operating margin, which is really a highlight for the year was a record exceeding 15% and that was the first time in our history and for those of you that have been tracking us for a number of years, you\u2019ll remember 10 years ago, when we launched the Win Strategy, we talked about hitting that 15% target. So we\u2019re popping the champagne corks here a little bit, in the background if you hear some corks popping that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.","But you may recall that as we went through this last 10-year period. We consistently improved margins year-on-year even in some pretty ugly periods where we had two major recessions for the company.","So, we -- in that 10-year period we dealt with two major recessions, we drove the margins up to what we see now as a record first time in the history of the company at 15%. And I know what everyone\u2019s thinking that well this must be it, now that you\u2019re at 15% only direction to go is down.","I would just point out one thing and that is, if you look at our North American industrial margins, we hit 17.6%. So we certainly don\u2019t think that it\u2019s the end of the road. I think there\u2019s more room on the topline and certainly on the operating margin line to continue to move these to higher levels. We can talk more about that later in the Q&A session.","Net income for the year was a record as well at $746, excuse me, at $745, and that increased 17% from the last year. We added $1.08 in earnings per share and that was on a 6.5% sales increase. So we\u2019re very pleased with that performance as well.","Operating cash flow for the year was a $1.5 billion or 11.6% of sales and I might point out too and I\u2019m not sure some of you may be tracking this as well but our free cash flow was greater than net income now for the tenth year in a row.","And that again includes some very, very difficult recessionary periods when you can say that we\u2019ve increased cash flow greater than net income for 10 years in a row, we\u2019ve got to be doing something right back here.","So we used the cash flow during the year to increase the dividends per share payout by 23%. We\u2019ve repurchased over 6 million shares of stock for total investment of just under $0.5 billion and we made acquisitions which added $141 million in annualized sales.","So, overall, we\u2019re in an extremely strong position for fiscal \u201813 and I would like to certainly congratulate our global team for their performance and the strong execution of the Win Strategy again in fiscal \u201812.","Now, just a couple comments. Next year despite more economic uncertainty on the horizon, we\u2019ve initiated our guidance, as you\u2019ve seen in a range from $7.10 and $7.90 per share and that\u2019s $7.50 at the mid-point and that would represent at the mid-point another record year for the coming -- in the coming year as well.","And I think most of you now have seen, if you read the release that these estimates include an expected increase in pension expense of about $0.35 per the diluted share, as a lower discount rate was required for accounting purposes and that reflected current market conditions for interest rates. So that was something that we have to subtract from our forecast because that pension expense is a reality.","So we\u2019ll talk more about that I\u2019m sure in the Q&A as well and at this point then, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Pam for more detailed review.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks Don. Please reference slide number six and I\u2019ll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter came in at $1.96, just as Don said, exceeding the mid-point of the guidance and the mean of the street expectations.","This is an increase of $0.17 or 9% versus the $1.79 from the same quarter a year ago. For the full year, fiscal year 2012, earnings came in at $1.7 -- $7.45 and this compares to $6.37 for fiscal year 2011 and this is the $1.08 that Don referenced as well or 17% increase.","So now moving to the next slide, slide number seven. Just laying out the components of the $0.17 increase in earnings per share on the segment basis for the fourth quarter. The $1.79 to the $1.96. The puts and takes are as follows.","Segment operating income added $0.12 and this is the result of increased performance in industrial North America Aerospace and Climate & Industrial Controls. And for the most part Industrial North America, the strength that we saw there was mostly offset by Industrial international weakness.","Below segment operating income or what we refer to as below the line items, earnings per share were impacted favorably by $0.08 and this was mainly due to the other line item and this is the result of favorable currency and this currency just not to be confused with translation or is more on the transactional side.","Higher taxes impacted earnings per share by $0.16, mainly due to a higher proportion of sales domestically this year. With a higher tax rate and the favorable resolution of prior year tax filings in fiscal year 2011.","Non-controlling interest and less shares outstanding impacted earnings per share favorably by $0.01 and $0.12, respectively.","Moving to slide number eight. Looking at the topline and looking at the total year. Revenues for the year increased 6.5% to $13.1 billion from $12.3 billion last year. Sales increased across all segments of the business, except Climate & Industrial Controls.","The impact to sales as the result of acquisitions was a little less than 1% and currency was a deduction to sales of approximately 1%. So, really basically offsetting one another. Therefore, organic growth was 6.7% again as Don mentioned.","While foreign currency had less than 1% negative impact on the total year, you can see that the fourth quarter alone the negative impact was more than 4-point.","So in spite of currency headwinds, segment operating margins for the year increased 40 basis points from 14.8% to 15.2%, an all time record for the company and for the fourth quarter alone, the margin was 15.5%, which is a fourth quarter record for the company.","Please note that acquisition expenses and integration charges are included in these numbers, even though the amount hasn\u2019t been carved out. Parker incurred $0.05 in restructuring charges in the year.","Now moving to slide number nine and focusing on segments commencing with the Industrial North America and again focusing just on the full year. North American reported revenues increased 12% in the year and after adjusting for acquisitions, which added 1% to revenues in the year and currency, which was relatively minor again, organic or core revenues increased 11%.","You could see that operating income increased from $746 million to $895 million, a 20% increase over the prior year. So really good performance in that particular segment.","Operating margins of 17.8%, an all time record, increased 130 basis points over fiscal year 2011, up 16.5% and an all time record.","Also of note, that fourth quarter was a very good quarter with strong margin of 18.6% and is also an all time record for the company. So 18.6% just very, very, very good for that segment.","Moving to the International segment and once again focusing on the year. Reported revenues increased 2.4% for the year. Currency was a deduction to revenues in the year of 1.6%, mainly due to the weakness of the euro, acquisitions added 0.5%. So after you adjust for the acquisitions and the currency organic revenues increased 3.5% for the year.","Operating margins decreased 70 basis points to 14.6% from 15.3% and that\u2019s mainly due to the foreign currency impact that we\u2019ve been talking about.","As you can see in the fourth quarter, this segment incurred 9 points of unfavorable currency translation and what you can\u2019t see from the slide but also present the Asia-Pacific investments being made in that region and softness in Latin America markets, particularly Brazil.","So moving to slide number 11 and focusing on the aerospace segment. Aerospace reported and organic revenues were the same, more than 9% in the year as the acquisitions and currencies had a minimal impact.","And in this segment, margins increased 90 basis points for the year to 13.8% from 12.9% last year and as you well know, this includes non-recurring engineering charges of almost 10%.","Okay. Moving to Climate & Industrial Controls, again focusing on the year. Total reported and organic revenues decreased 2% for the year. Acquisitions and currency had minimal impact and operating margins as a percent of sales were 8.7% for the year versus 7.7% last year, 100 basis point improvement. So this is really the story in Climate & Industrial Controls, much better operating performance with a little less sale.","Moving to slide 13, orders for the quarter. Just to remind you, these numbers represent a trailing three-month average and they\u2019re reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions and currency except for aerospace and aerospace is reported using a 12-month rolling average.","And as you can see from this slide, total orders declined 1% for the June quarter just ending, reflecting tougher comparisons and the softness seen in Europe, which resides in the Industrial International segment.","North American orders for the quarter just ended increased 4% and then Industrial International orders decreased 9% for the quarter. Aerospace orders increased 7% for the quarter and Climate & Industrial Controls segment orders increased 1%.","Moving to the balance sheet, slide number 14. As usual, Parker\u2019s balance sheet remains very solid. Cash on the balance sheet at year end was over $838 million and zero commercial paper was outstanding.","DSI or days sales in inventory remained at 55 days in fiscal year 2012. However, that 55 days include inventory in connection with the acquisitions that closed. So if you look at inventory as a percent of sales, it hit an all time record of 10.7% and without the acquisitions 10.4%.","Accounts receivable in terms of DSO closed at 48 days, consistent with last year but again, in spite of rising sales. Parker continues to make progress on the weighted average days payable outstanding, increasing two days over the prior year to 54.","Moving to slide 15 and most notable on this page is that the company generated cash flow from operations of more than $1.5 billion or 11.6% of sales. Now the major components of the uses of that $1.5 billion is as follows, $696 million we returned to the shareholders via share repurchases of $455 million and dividend payments of $241 million.","We utilized $304 million in connection with acquisitions and $219 million or 1.6% of revenues utilized in connection with capital expenditures. So net of these uses that I just mentioned, we also had negative FX impact of $150 million and we increased cash during the year about $181 million.","On slide 16, you can see that we have a capacity to grow the business through acquisitions and organically. The debt-to-total cap ratio is 26.1% and on a net basis, 15.4%.","So now moving to the guidance, which I\u2019m sure, you\u2019re all very interested in. 17 -- slides 17 through 19 actually detail the guidance. 7 -- on slide 17, the guidance for revenues and operating margins by segment has been provided. I\u2019m not going to read through these numbers here on the call. But they\u2019ve been detailed out there for your convenience.","Moving to slide 18, the guidance has been provided in total for the items below segment operating income and that is $489 million at the mid-point. The amount is higher than the prior year due to higher pension costs that we talked about and Don also talked about the requirement to lower the discount rates in computing the pension liabilities. So that\u2019s what\u2019s affecting that number.","Slide 19, summarizing the guidance on a diluted earnings per share basis and as you can see from this slide, for fiscal year 2013 the earnings per share is projected to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.90 and that represents a $0.05 increase at the mid-point versus fiscal year 2012 EPS.","But for your convenience for the first time, we\u2019ve included a waterfall chart on this slide reconciling the fiscal year 2012 actual earnings per share to the fiscal year 2013 guidance earnings per share, using the mid-point of the guidance.","So as you can see on the left, we have the actual earnings per share for fiscal year 2012 of $7.45 and on the far right, we have the guidance earnings per share at the mid-point for 2013 of $7.15 -- $7.50.","So if you do the walk between the $7.45 and the $7.50, so from the left to the right you can see that segment operating income at $0.45 to earnings per share for fiscal year 2013, less shares outstanding as a result of share repurchase that\u2019s $0.03, increased pension.","However, is a deduction of $0.35, tax is a deduction of $0.14 and corporate G&A at $0.06. The real story here is that pension expense is offsetting most of the segment operating income improvement.","So please be reminded that this higher pension expense is the result of the requirement to use the lower discount rate in valuing pension liabilities. As you know, yields have been deteriorating and further declined in the last quarter. Since our plan is on a fiscal year basis, the adoption of a lower discount rate is required.","Also remember that the forecast excludes any acquisitions that may be made in fiscal year 2013 and to help you even further, the guidance at the mid-point assumes the following, increased revenue year-over-year of 4%, segment operating margins of 15.3% and we talked about the expenses below segment operating income, the $489 million with a band of plus or minus 2.7%, the tax rate is projected at 28%, the guidance includes $0.05 to $0.10 of restructuring and just a couple of other salient points with respect to the guidance.","Sales in the first half, second half are divided 46%, 54%. Segment operating income, first half, second half divided 45%, 55%. And then of course their earnings per share first half to second half is 43%, 57%, due to the pension expense that\u2019s been included in the other line below segment operating income.","Also just as a reminder, first quarter EPS will be lower than the fourth quarter just ended due to lower sales in the first quarter and as you know, this follows the natural cycle of the business. There will also be less commercial after market in Aerospace and there\u2019ll be higher other expense, not only due to pension expense but due to stock option expense.","As you recall, every year in the first quarter we have higher stock option expense than we do in the other three quarters and then of course, we have the vacations in Europe that we have to deal with.","So when you get past the first quarter and you get to the second quarter. As you know, the second quarter usually is not as good as the first quarter and again that follows the natural cycle of our business, plus we have all of the holidays in the second quarter that ends up influencing those numbers.","So I think we\u2019ve walked through guidance fairly well today for you and we\u2019ll move into the question-and-answer session at this time. Chris, are you with us?","Questions-and-Answers Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel Nicolaus. You may proceed.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Good morning, Don, Jon, Pam.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning, Nathan.","Don Washkewicz","Good morning.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Can you talk about -- I\u2019m thinking about the incremental margins going forward. As you generally get to the peak of a cycle or as revenue growth starts to flatten out, you obviously see deteriorating incremental margins and you got down into the mid teens at the top of the loss cycle about 22% this year. How are you thinking about your ability to keep those incremental margins higher than they were during the last cycle?","Jon Marten","Well, Nathan, Jon, here. Our guidance by our math shows us in the high teens right now for the incremental margins. Normally, at this stage given the macro environment and what we\u2019re seeing in terms of our topline growth, we\u2019re feeling really good about our incremental margins in the high teens.","One point to really try to focus on here is that we\u2019re seeing international growth basically in our guidance at zero. With us being at a 4% growth rate, our incremental margins at 18%. If you go back and you look at history is, it has been very, very good record.","One other point to make to you, Don just talked about and Pam did too, that in FY \u201812 for the very first time in the history of the company, we hit an operating income level of 15.2%. We\u2019ve been striving for that 15.2% for 10 years.","Now, our guidance for next year indicates, as Pam said, a 15.3% number here. So again, we\u2019re looking to really drive incremental margins through, for making those bottom line numbers. I think that given the very tough macro environment, we\u2019re all very, very proud of what we\u2019ve been -- actually been able to accomplish here.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","And if I could just ask a question about Industrial and international, mid-point of guidance areas for flat revenue year-to-year, can you kind of break that down a little bit more by geography, sort of what you\u2019re expecting out of Europe versus other parts of the world?","Jon Marten","Yeah. Just in terms of the international look, just to start out here and Pam will give us some detail here. We have got, right now on the topline a 0% growth. We\u2019re -- as Don indicated, stabilizing in all of our international markets.","Don indicated that back in April and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re seeing right now for the last -- throughout the quarter and through the last four months. But when you look at the geographies internationally, we get a different picture here. So Pam, why don\u2019t you give us some color on that?","Pamela Huggins","Well. Nathan, I think just to drill in a little bit and to back up for a moment. But to talk about the guidance and what\u2019s going to happen. I mean, obviously we\u2019ve seen some softness in Europe in the latter part of this year. So as we head into the next year, we\u2019re going to continue to see that in the first half okay. But we really are projecting some growth in the second half.","And when you really look at that by region, it\u2019s really -- Latin America is starting to show some improvement here at the end. But Latin America is a very small part of the business for Parker overall. So the growth is really going to come from Europe as well as Asia in the second half.","And Asia is probably going to be a little higher than Europe. But as you well know, Europe makes up the majority of the international segment. So, yeah, we have growth forecasted in the second half for both of those regions.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And just on the increased pension expense. Is that going to require you to make a cash contribution to the pension fund? And what\u2019s the level of the funding level at the moment?","Pamela Huggins","Now that\u2019s a very good question, Nathan. Pension, we have always been on a funding level above 80%. As you well know, there are some restrictions that take place. If you\u2019re not above 80% and we have always had a goal to be above that and we still are above that.","But we will take the opportunity probably to increase the contribution in fiscal year 2013. If you go back, 2011 we made a contribution, 2013 we did not. So we will probably make a contribution in line with what we\u2019ve made in the past.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Thanks very much.","Pamela Huggins","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. You may proceed.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc","Hey, good morning. Just on the revenue ranges, can you give us a sense either in total or within the segments how you\u2019re thinking about organic growth? So if we adjust for the acquisitions you\u2019ve announced and FX headwind, I guess FX particularly within international.","Pamela Huggins","Yeah. And you\u2019re speaking about guidance, right, Jeff?","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc","Yeah. Yeah.","Pamela Huggins","Yeah. Well, as you can see at the mid-point, we\u2019re really forecasting about a 4% revenue growth. However, acquisitions account for about 2%, almost 2.5% of acquisitions. And then of course we have the currency headwinds that we have to deal with, which is almost 1.5%. So organic growth really for fiscal year 2013, it\u2019s projected to be around 3%.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay. Perfect. And then can you -- Don, you mentioned last quarter buyback and wanting to -- and certainly having the capacity to be pretty active. It looks like in the fourth quarter you did about $125 million. How are you thinking about buyback relative to the comments you made last quarter?","Don Washkewicz","Well. Last quarter, as you may recall, we had the authority to buyback basically as much as we wanted shares. And based on the price level that it was at, we did take advantage of that. And as you said, we did $123 million in the quarter. The other thing we did that you may not be aware of it. I\u2019m not sure we announced it last quarter but we did raise the 10b5-1 from $20 million at quarter to $50 million at quarter.","So we\u2019re doing $200 million a year under 10b5-1, where we were $80 million in the past. So that\u2019s a change that we did make. So, for the total year we did $455 million roughly. The year before fiscal \u201811, we did $693 million. I think that it would be safe to say we are going to do more, especially with the depressed share price that we have now.","There was a period of time here that we were in a blackout. You probably are aware and the blackout that we have, so we could not do share repurchase in the quarter or we would have done a lot more. And I think I\u2019ve explained this in the past that we look at Parker stock like we do any other investment.","When you do a discounted cash flow and we start, at the full value being $105 and then down to wherever their current market price is as being the other extreme. And so when we see the prices where they\u2019re at today, we\u2019re very anxious to do more share repurchase and it certainly fits our DCF model to do that.","So you can expect more next year. I definitely think we have the capacity to do quite a bit more. And this would be a good year to do it, because you can see that the -- we had a hit from the pension, which is going to push us in the opposite direction.","If we had that hit in this year, we would have offset all that with share repurchase because our share repurchase impact in \u201812 was about $0.46. So we would have offset the $0.35. And I think that, depending on where the share price is going forward, I think we hopefully will be able to offset that this year. That would be my intent.","On the dividends, just to go along as far as capital allocations since we\u2019re on that topic. On the dividends, we\u2019ve got a 56-year record now and increasing every year. So you can expect that we would increase dividends on a year-to-year basis going forward in the foreseeable future. And that means probably forever hopefully.","And we raised them 122% in the last five years. I think this, last year we were somewhere around 23% or thereabouts as far as a dividend increase. So you can expect to see that increase next year.","Capital expenditures are around 2.5%. I think if you\u2019re modeling something, do something in the 2.5% range I think you\u2019re going to be safe. Now that\u2019s not to say we\u2019re not looking at acquisitions. We did last 12 months. We did about $408 million in sales volume and acquisitions in the last 12 months total. So, we anticipate that we\u2019ll do more.","We have more that we\u2019re looking at. Again, we don\u2019t forecast any of that. And we don\u2019t put any additional ones other than the ones that have already announced and closed into our numbers. But we have enough capacity here.","We\u2019re in very good shape as far as what our capacity is to do more acquisitions, to do more share repurchase, pay an increased dividend going forward. I hope that answers some of that. That\u2019s kind of where my head is at and I think that\u2019s probably, what you\u2019re going to see roll out here going forward.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","And just to be clear, the guidance doesn\u2019t reflect any buyback or it reflects that $200 million 10b5?","Don Washkewicz","No. There\u2019s zero buyback reflected in the guidance.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor. You may proceed.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor","Excuse me. Thank you. Going back to the -- Pam, going back to the guidance for next year, you gave us the assumptions on what your sales would be and your margins and so on.","But you have not given us your assumptions about the different economies in the world and what they\u2019re going to be doing, whether or not you\u2019re assuming any kind of a recession in the U.S. or not. Could you just go over that? What\u2019s built into that, so we can get an idea of how to compare your guidance with our own assumptions?","Don Washkewicz","Maybe, I can make a couple of comments on some of the markets in the regions and what have you, Alex. First of all, as you can see we\u2019re expecting a better second half than the first half. We\u2019ve heard -- and again, some of this is based on just feedback we\u2019re getting from the various regions and our people in the various regions.","We think that the comments that you\u2019ve been hearing about China, probably helping support their economy there because they\u2019ve ripped it back down into a 7% growth rate. I think they\u2019re going to try to move that up. We\u2019re seeing some very early signs of that in China.","And I think that being a big part of that Asian economy, I think we\u2019re going to see -- probably not a whole lot in this first half. But we\u2019re thinking in the second half probably see a little bit improvement in that region of the world.","Likewise, you\u2019ve heard a lot recently about euro support. That hopefully, I don\u2019t think anything will happen short-term. It\u2019s in disarray over there, obviously with all the different countries having different issues as far as their debt levels and what have you. But I think Europe is right at the bottom now. Any improvement there probably would be coming later in our calendar year, heading into the second half as well.","I just think that there\u2019s going to be a little bit of a paralysis here until the elections are over. I think depending on the results of the elections, I think that could bode well for the second half as well.","If you look at the PMIs and I was looking at those yesterday. Most of those now are below 50, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re in recession necessarily but it means that the global markets are slowing. I think the global PMI now is around 49 or just under 49. So you\u2019re still growing until you get down to about 42 by definition of that metric. So we\u2019re still okay there.","U.S. is still, is right around 50, 49 and change, eurozone is flat around 45. So you can see they\u2019re, they\u2019re in the worst shape of all the regions for us and China, I think, dropped just a little bit on the PMI down to about 48.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor","So you\u2019re assuming that we muddle through here and don\u2019t go over the fiscal cliff?","Don Washkewicz","That\u2019s what kind of we\u2019re looking at. Yeah, we\u2019re looking at no disaster between now and the end of the calendar year that would be our first half, with a little bit of a pick up in the second half going into the second half of our fiscal. That\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re looking at.","If you looked at the numbers that we just pasted and we posted international at down 9% on the order trend, the order numbers. That down 9% reflects Europe down 15% but it also reflects Latin America up 7% and Asia up 1%.","So there is, as you can see, there\u2019s a little bit of sign here especially in Latin America, now that\u2019s not a huge region for us but it\u2019s still a positive sign and Asia being plus 1% on a 312, compares in the last three months orders compared to last year the same three. So that would be a little glimmer of hope that that trend hopefully will continue going forward as well.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor","Okay. Thank you.","Don Washkewicz","Alex, another -- one other thing is our backlog is up 1.5%. So, we\u2019re -- again that helps us see through this first half of our fiscal year as well. I can come back later, maybe we can talk if there is questions on some of the markets that we see that are stronger or weaker. We can talk a little bit more about those as well.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor","Okay. A couple of quick ones. First, the pension expense comes in what quarter?","Pamela Huggins","It comes across all four quarters, Alex.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor","Okay.","Pamela Huggins","You can pretty much evenly divide it between four quarters.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor","Good. And finally, the incremental margin in the North American industrial in the fourth quarter was 37.8%.","Pamela Huggins","Right.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor","What was the reason for that price increase, efficiency gains, just what was it, mix, whatever?","Jon Marten","Alex, Jon here. In the fourth quarter, the real answer in industrial North America is again just all time records in almost every metric that you can see. There\u2019s no one answer there. There\u2019s not one incident. It is across the board. It is with all of our markets. It\u2019s with all of our product groupings. And it has just been remarkable to see the progress that we\u2019ve seen there.","And we\u2019re really looking forward to a great FY \u201813 with those same mix of businesses given the cost structure that we\u2019ve been working so hard to get to by this time. So we feel very, very good about how that\u2019s working. And the good news there is there is not one answer.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor","Okay. Thank you.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. I guess.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning, Jamie.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi. Two questions. One, on the guidance specifically with regards to North America, I guess I\u2019m surprised by the topline forecast of 5% to 9% given the order trends. And I think most of the acquisitions that you\u2019ve done were more focused on the international. So, I\u2019d say I don\u2019t believe you have help there. So what gives you confidence or what are the assumptions behind the 5% to 9%? And what do you assume for price versus volume?","And then I guess my follow-up question, Don, you did answer the question on the share repurchase. But I guess, I\u2019m surprised. It was so low just given the commentary last quarter about increasing, going to the Board and increasing the authorization. So, why not something more meaningful or there is a signal that perhaps capital allocation is going in another direction. How are you thinking about larger deals in that respect? Thanks and I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Don Washkewicz","Yeah. I don\u2019t want you to leave thinking that, Jamie. We did as much as we could do in the quarter. I would have done a lot more if I could. I was in a blacked out for a big part of the quarter. And we are limited. Keep in mind, that I don\u2019t control, how much I can buyback and from the standpoint that we\u2019re limited based on the trading volume. We can\u2019t exceed a certain share buyback based on the current average trading volume. So I\u2019m very limited there.","I did as much as I could based on our criteria and the blackout period and the trading volume dynamic. I had the ability to buyback obviously, more if those conditions were more favorable for us but that we did what we could. Then don\u2019t read anymore into it than that. I would have liked to have done three times that much if I could have.","What gives us confidence in the North America. Right now, if you look at the order trends, the 3, 12 is running around 105%, which is positive North America positive. This is -- and on the industrial side, not counting the aerospace which is still positive. And the 12,12, which is the last 12 months orders or the previous 12, is running about 109%.","So those -- when we look at the forecast we\u2019re looking really at these order trends and projecting those out into the future. So we still see a very strong picture in North America, both on industrial side and on the aerospace part of that equation.","Of course, there are certain market segments that are weaker than others. But by and large that gives us some confidence that we\u2019re going to continue forward. Some of the strong segments, distribution, okay. Distribution is running on 12,12, 116%, okay. Last 12 months or the previous 12, so distribution and on the industrial side is half of our activity very strong.","The 3,12, which is the last three months or the previous year three is at 107%. So we\u2019re very -- that\u2019s going to be pulling the apple cart, so to speak up the hill quite nicely.","The other strong segment is process. They\u2019re running very strong on both the 312 and 1212. Agriculture is a very strong segment. 312 running 120%, okay. So the near-term activity level there is good. Commercial aerospace OEM and defense aerospace OEM, we anticipate both to be strong.","We think the construction equipment and heavy duty truck will remain at a high level. We don\u2019t anticipate a big growth there. But we think they\u2019re going to remain pretty much at the levels that they are.","I mentioned farm and ag. I mentioned oil and gas. I believe in distribution. On the down side, of course, the big negative for us is the semi con, which has been really in the tank. But -- and then looking at aerospace, I don\u2019t know if I mentioned aerospace. Aerospace is -- the 3,12 is running 108%, 12,12 a 107%.","So those are kind of the indicators that we look at on those order trends and kind of projecting into the future, with also the understanding that in an election year. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a major change one direction or the other, until we\u2019re through this election. And then we\u2019ll have to see where we go from there.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then Jon, just to ask the question slightly differently in North America and I know you went away from doing this but it\u2019s just helpful given the macro uncertainty. Was there any unusual activity when you look at how the -- you give us orders for the quarter but how the months sort of played out and what you\u2019re looking at in July?","Because, I\u2019m wondering if things just continue -- if things are stable throughout the three months or got worse, or -- and sort of what you\u2019re seeing in July that gives you I guess confidence behind the outlook?","Jon Marten","Jamie, I think what we\u2019ve seen here in July is a -- gives us confidence in our forecast. We\u2019re still seeing throughout the Q4 and including July with our order rates preliminary data with July of course here sitting here on the second day of the month.","We\u2019re seeing continued stabilization and continued patterns that we\u2019ve seen throughout the last six months. Certainly March through June were stable and we\u2019re seeing that same level of activity here in the month of July.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks.","Don Washkewicz","Jamie, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re the one that asked about the pricing and all that.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah. I did.","Don Washkewicz","Okay. Let me just maybe I can address that real quick. And I think everybody understands on the call that we look at two metrics here and we measure this for the entire company. One is the purchase price index and our goal is to be less than one, so we\u2019re buying at a lower price than we were in a previous period.","And the sell price index, which would indicate we want that greater than one. So that it would indicate we\u2019re selling at a higher price than we did in the prior period. And I can just tell you that the difference between those two right now, which we do track very closely for the company is slightly positive. Not tremendously positive but slightly positive, which basically says that we are recapturing our cost plus the margin okay, on any cost input increases that we\u2019ve incurred.","Looking at specifics, most of the input costs are slightly one way or another. Like for instance, steel would be slightly down. Aluminum is trending slightly down on a raw material input basis. Some of the higher tech polymers that we deal with actually the prices are maintaining at a pretty strong level, pretty high level I should say.","And we think they\u2019ll probably remain high, so some supply problems in a couple areas in particular. All other ones on the polymer side are relatively flat. It\u2019s not going up or down. We saw just recently, a little trend up on copper and brass. It had been dropping but it has made a reversal in that we saw a little bit of an increase there. The oil price is $85, that\u2019s kind of flat. And nickel, which would be basically an input cost in some of our higher tech products is flat right now.","So overall, we don\u2019t -- we think we\u2019re going to stay ahead of it. Any cost changes, input changes like we have in the last 10 years, since we\u2019ve launched these strategic initiatives. We\u2019re pretty much right on top of this. And we\u2019ll make sure we recoup the input costs plus the margins so that we don\u2019t detract from our overall margin for the business.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob McCarthy with Robert W. Baird. You may proceed.","Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Hello. This is Mig Dobre in for Rob McCarthy. Good morning.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning.","Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert W. Baird","I guess, my first question, I\u2019m sort of going back to the industrial international guidance and trying to put some pieces together here. Because orders obviously have continued to weaken from the prior quarter down 9%, yet your guidance is calling at the mid point for flat year-over-year revenues.","FX headwinds are still there. And I do realize that acquisitions are a part of the equation here. But can you maybe provide a little bit of color about, how you\u2019re thinking in FX versus the acquisition contribution for the segment? And also what your thoughts are for overall organic growth first half versus second half, baked into the mid point of this guidance.","Pamela Huggins","Okay. This is Pam speaking. Let me address that a little bit for you. Don talked about the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made. And when you really look at the component breakdown of those acquisitions and where they lie within the segments, the majority or the largest part really does lie within the international segment. So there is a nice component for the year coming from acquisitions.","Of course, you do have some currency headwind. However, just to remind everybody how we look at currency is we take the right at the end of June. We do not try to forecast what currency is going to do throughout the next year. So, just as a natural fall out, the currency becomes less at the end of fiscal year 2013 than it was fiscal year 2012, when you compare the June year end rate to the prior year.","So, that plays into it a little bit. So you are right. International orders are down 9%. So when you look at the first half of the year, you do see that international kind of follows that pattern to some degree and then it does pick up in the second half. But you do have to remember that acquisitions do play a part in that first half, second half as well.","Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. I see. And then just as a follow-up here. Can you comment a little bit on the cost side here? If I\u2019m right about the guidance, it seems to imply a slight increase to operating income on flat revenue. And with all the acquisitions coming in and everything else, I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the cost base?","Pamela Huggins","And you\u2019re talking about just international?","Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Yeah.","Pamela Huggins","Yeah. If I recall correctly, we have flat sales fiscal year \u201812 to 2013. But there is some deterioration. There was some deterioration in earnings, okay. Now just looking at fiscal year 2013 and playing out on an organic basis, like I say it\u2019s fairly negative in the first half. I would say in line with the orders that you\u2019re seeing.","And then we show improvement in the second half, which is what I talked about earlier. So, I think when you\u2019re looking at the incrementals on the international, you have to make sure that you take that currency into consideration.","Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. But I guess the guidance itself does not bake in some sort of action on a cost side in international at this point.","Pamela Huggins","There are always cost improvements baked into the guidance. We always forecast a little bit for productivity improvements every year.","Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners. You may proceed.","Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 MKM Partners","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Pamela Huggins","Hi, Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 MKM Partners","Just to follow-up on the last question about the, I guess, the cadence and industrial in the rest of the world. Maybe this is putting too fine a point on it but how should we think of Europe versus Asia versus Latin America in that second half acceleration. Is it a lot of it being better, better China growth, or easier comps in Europe? Maybe even just qualitatively help us understand the big moving pieces.","Pamela Huggins","Okay.","Jon Marten","Josh, Jon here. I think that, first of all looking at the international industrial business. As we pointed out, we were down in orders here in Q4 double-digits for Europe. Don commented on that earlier. As we go throughout the year, as we see at a low level stabilizing revenues at this point.","We will see ever increasing rate starting here in our Q3, which would be in January. That\u2019s how we show that this guidance is set here for the second half.","Now, the biggest point to make about our international business is, our business in Asia, specifically in China. We are seeing positive indications of order trends in China. Asia never really went down. China did go down specifically in Q4 slightly.","We see and we are getting word of improvements as the year goes on. Given the macro situation here right now, we fully understand the risks that are built into the second half of our model here for FY \u201813. But what out weighs all of those risks, is the incredible demand that is really truly there, the underlying demand that is truly there that is going to ultimately be pulled through all of our businesses in Asia. And really be able to also help ignite demand further for us in Europe in the second half also.","So that\u2019s without going country by country with you. I mean, that\u2019s the big picture as to how we\u2019re looking at it. We\u2019re seeing flat at a low level in the first half and gradual growth in the second half. And that\u2019s how our guidance internationally is put together.","We understand, as Don mentioned, the issue with the soft landing in Asia. We understand very well the debt crisis in Europe. But we sit here and we look at our data and we look at our trends and we do a bottoms up review with all of our people around the world. And we matched all of that data that we get from a bottoms up review with the industrial production metrics that we see globally around the world. And then we try to get the best guidance that we can.","And that\u2019s how it shakes out for us this year. I think we did a pretty good job this time last year coming up for FY \u201812. And we feel confident about these numbers here for FY \u201813, as well as we did this time last year. So I\u2019m hoping that helps, Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 MKM Partners","Understood. No. That\u2019s very helpful. And just a follow-up on some of the other moving pieces. Just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding this right. About a $0.15 roughly back of the envelope impact from FX and then you said restructuring was going to be $0.05 to $0.10. One other thing you didn\u2019t touch on, which I think you held back fiscal \u201812 was an out sized investment particularly in Asia. Am I remembering that right and how should we think of that trending fiscal \u201813 versus fiscal \u201812?","Jon Marten","Well, I think first of all the estimates that you just made are about right here in terms of restructuring and FX. So, I\u2019m there with you. What\u2019s happening in Asia with us and I think I might be able to answer your question but if I don\u2019t please ask again. What\u2019s happening in Asia is this. We\u2019ve got the topline that is stabilizing here for us and ever growing into the second half.","And of course, everybody understands the -- in all of Asia, not just China but all of Asia the underlying demand that is there. But also what\u2019s happening in Asia and we\u2019ve talked about this before in prior conferences with us is that we have put in a cost structure that is giving us incremental fixed costs there as we build out and we have prepared for the future.","So, our overall margins looking backwards in FY \u201812 as compared to maybe FY \u201810 or \u201811 are down slightly, part of that due to the reduction in the pace of the increase in sales is really kind of driven by those incremental fixed costs base as we build out and prepare for the long-term and prepare for the incredible growth that we\u2019ve seen and we will be seeing as time goes on.","So that\u2019s the one item, big picture that has impacted us in Asia and impacting our margins. Now as we obviously start to grow at ever increasing rates in Asia as FY \u201813 proceeds. We will be driving incremental MROS, marginal return on sales that it will get us back to the levels that we were seeing in FY \u201810, FY \u201811 range.","Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 MKM Partners","Okay. So just so I\u2019m clear, that is you\u2019re reaching the point now where you\u2019re getting leverage off of that fixed cost investment. It\u2019s not -- there\u2019s not an incremental drag into \u201813?","Jon Marten","Yeah. I wish I stated that clearly.","Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 MKM Partners","All right. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. You may proceed.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Can we take a step back to two comments that you made. You said that Latin America, I think you said was up 7%. Just curious where you\u2019re seeing the strength there, is if there any specific market or any specific country? And then same a little bit more detail on this early signs of beginnings of a re-acceleration in China, what specifically are you seeing or hearing? Just curious.","Don Washkewicz","Well, Ann. This is Don. I would just kind of maybe read off a few of the areas in Latin America that would be posing -- posting positive trends. Machine tools would be one. General industrial, semi con interesting enough, semi con up and telecom, off highway construction, heavy trucks, lawn and turf and industrial trucks material handling type equipment. Those would be the ones that we would show as positives in Latin America regions specifically.","And there\u2019s a likely number that would be not positive but those would be the positive ones and then the other part of your question?","Pamela Huggins","And mostly in Brazil.","Don Washkewicz","Yeah. And what was the other part of it?","Pamela Huggins","That\u2019s it.","Don Washkewicz","That was it?","Pamela Huggins","Yeah.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","No. The other part was China, early signs what specific signs or what gives you some hope that China is re-accelerating?","Don Washkewicz","Well, just -- I think just what we\u2019ve heard, first of all, the order trend is still positive here for us. That would be the one thing. And then just kind of the feedback that we\u2019re getting from our team in China that the government is kind of relaxing the -- or stimulating. I should say, not the reaction but trying to stimulate a little bit more activity there.","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to back up to 10% or 12%. But I think it will go north of 7%. So, just the feedback that we\u2019re getting that the government is planning to get the economy moving at a little higher pace.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the share repurchase program, just kind of curious. I mean, wouldn\u2019t you have known what the restrictions were and how many shares you could buy back per day and the blackout periods? Wouldn\u2019t you have known that at the beginning of the quarter or before last quarter\u2019s conference call?","Don Washkewicz","Sure. Yeah. We knew all that, absolutely. That the -- so we bought back, we didn\u2019t know what the daily activity rate was going to be but we knew that we were limited to 25%. And we knew where the current price of the stock was, at least at the call relative to our -- what you might call our range, our target range and where that was relative to our DCF models.","We knew all that. And we bought back, like I said, as much as I could given the blackout and the limitations we had from those other factors. So, no absolutely we knew all of that that I\u2019ve just described.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","So was theoretically impossible that you were ever going achieve the $14 million?","Don Washkewicz","Well, yeah. Go ahead, Jon.","Jon Marten","I think Ann the one point here that perhaps you\u2019re getting to is that no. Theoretically we could have bought back all of that. But if you recall the day of that call, our stock price moved dramatically. We had a price in mind that we thought was our trigger point and we did not reach that trigger point until later in the quarter.","And this is all based on the analysis that we do as Don talked about in the DCF. And that\u2019s how we do our analysis. It was a much different picture the morning of the call last quarter versus the ensuing few weeks.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And that might have been because Don told us how much he was going to spend and how many shares he could buy back?","Jon Marten","Well.","Don Washkewicz","And that\u2019s not going away. I mean, I have the support of the Board. We indicated that we bought back in the last two years $1 billion, maybe $1.2 billion. We do have the intent to buy back more. And I know I have the support of the Board to continue on.","So I won\u2019t read any more into it than that. I think that you were hearing me on the call saying that share buyback is going to be a major emphasis this year. And we\u2019re going to continue on doing what we\u2019ve been doing in the last couple of years here for sure.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. In the interest of time, thank you. I\u2019ll take my other questions off line. Thanks.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks Ann.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies & Company. You may proceed.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Good morning guys.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Company","I think most of it has been answered. But Don I just thought I might take you up on your initial comments where you said that there was probably some more opportunity with margins over some period of time. And that you would expand upon that during the Q&A if necessary. So I\u2019d love to hear that?","Don Washkewicz","I\u2019m not sure when we really talked about that. But yeah and it\u2019s funny because we talk about it here and I\u2019m just preparing for the call. We often times get the question that we\u2019re kind of peaked out and all that. And I get that question every year for the last 10 years. I guess I\u2019ve been around here long enough. I guess you start hearing things over and over again.","So every year we\u2019re kind of peaked out. And the next year, we\u2019re going to be down. But we peak, so we set a new record and we peaked out. So couple of things that I just want to point out to people all those that are on the call, is first of all -- and I mentioned this earlier specifically with respect to North America margins that North American margins aren\u2019t at 15% that are at 17% plus. The implication there is that we should be able to do the same everywhere around the world, okay, as far as margins as we\u2019re doing in North America.","So we haven\u2019t stopped. As far as the margin growth that we\u2019ve seen over time, I don\u2019t anticipate stopping. There will be some theoretical limit at some point in time. I don\u2019t know what that number will be.","Here\u2019s just a couple of my thoughts. On these acquisitions, for those that have been tracking us long enough, the one thing that we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve done 100 and some acquisitions since I\u2019ve been around.","And in that period of time we increased our margins to over 15%. The way we did that is by executing on the win strategy. And we executed on the strategic initiatives there, the procurement, the pricing, the lien and we delivered about 600 basis points improvement in every one of those acquisitions in aggregate that we\u2019ve done over that period of time.","And that was in a period of time when everybody said you couldn\u2019t make -- acquisitions were a failed strategy. It doesn\u2019t work and all that kind of thing. And we improved our margins, integrated 100-some acquisitions. And so going forward, when we look at the acquisitions we\u2019re doing today, one thing that\u2019s going to help improve margins going forward is we\u2019re going to expect the same two plus two plus two, or 600 basis points improvement in the operating performance.","Okay. So that\u2019s one positive thing that\u2019s going forward. The other thing, if you look at what happened this year, we had one big horse on the front of the cart pulling the whole cart along. Well, actually we had a big horse and a small horse.","We had industrial North America and we had aerospace. And everybody else was sitting on the cart. They are pulling Europe along, Asia and Latin America. And so just keep in mind that as these other economies come back -- and so our margins have been depressed in these other regions.","As these other regions come back, you\u2019re going to see margin expansion in our business. So those are a few major things that are going to happen going forward. Housing starts as you know and you\u2019ve seen the impact to housing starts have on our CIC Group. And we\u2019ve reorganized, we\u2019ve restructured, we\u2019ve done all that. You can start seeing the margins starting to improve in our climate industrial control group.","And you would expect that to continue as housing starts pick up. I just saw some news in the paper the other day that it looks like there\u2019s a little glimmer of hope there on the housing recovery. Now if we can get some people back to work that would help too, maybe somebody could afford to buy a house.","But as housing starts to recover, our margins will improve and specifically in the CIC Group. But also actually across the board because housing starts, drives a lot of activity construction and what have you.","We\u2019re doing more system solutions than we\u2019ve ever done in the history of the company. We continue to do that. Of course, aerospace is in the lead and in most respects as far as systems, we know that systems is a higher value activity for the company and drives higher margins. That is going to continue going forward.","Even on the industrial side, there\u2019s a lot more activity on systems on the industrial side. We talked about Winovation. For those that have tracked the company, we\u2019re at about 3% of sales now coming through the pipeline of new to the industry or new to the world type products.","We want to get that number to 4% as that additional incremental comes through. That\u2019s additional margin business. Of course if you have something new to the world, that\u2019s going to bring with it some higher margins as you introduce those products.","You heard a little bit about globalization. That\u2019s going to drive margins higher as well. And we\u2019ve always done very well in our global emerging markets. And as we grow in those markets, we\u2019re going to drive margins higher and higher as we absorb -- as we talked a little bit about earlier the additional overhead that we\u2019re placing into those regions.","The other thing is that the amount of money we\u2019re spending in aerospace, on non-recurring engineering. We\u2019ve got major programs. We picked up about $20 billion worth of new wins over the last several years.","As we bleed that NRE off, aerospace margins will go up. As you\u2019ve seen a little indication in this coming year, I think we finished last year at 13.8%. You\u2019ll see a little improvement in this coming year and as more of those new programs are completed. That non-recurring engineering is going to help us expand those aerospace margins.","For those that have tracked us for a long time, you\u2019ll remember that aerospace peaked a number of years back when we were not doing much in the way of new product development. There was a soft period around 18%. So you can see that there\u2019s plenty of room to move aerospace margins higher as these projects complete.","We\u2019ll talk about Parker stores. You know how strong our after market program is here. We\u2019ve started with no stores back in the late 80s. By the late 90s, we\u2019re at 500 stores. We\u2019re going to be at 2,000 stores this year.","We\u2019re adding a store somewhere in the world almost every day. And those stores are just making our after market program stronger and stronger and stronger. And we\u2019re going to eventually have thousands. We\u2019re going to hit 2,000, now we\u2019ll go and add additional units. Every year we have been adding those and those were at higher margins, okay.","Those aftermarket margins are higher margins for the company. So that\u2019s going to help us expand our margins going forward. We\u2019ve launched here in the last several years a design assemble test activity or strategy, sorry not activity, a strategy for the company whereby we\u2019ve come to the conclusion that we should be manufacturing critical items and everything else we probably should basically have other people manufacturing.","And that gives us less cyclicality in our business, less gyrations going through the business cycle and yet maintains the propriety of our highly intellectual part of our business. The intellectual property still maintains that within the company.","So as we continue to do more design assemble tests and less cutting chips or what we might consider just a routine type products, not the critical ones. That\u2019s going to help mute cyclicality, improve margins overall throughout the business cycle.","I could go on and on but I think we\u2019re kind of running out of time. Those -- when you say that we\u2019ve peaked out. I just get flashbacks to some of these few things going on out there that are just nothing -- going to do nothing but expand margins going forward.","Pamela Huggins","Okay. I think at this time due to time, we\u2019re going to have to move to closing comments. Don, you have just a few closing comments?","Don Washkewicz","Yeah. Thanks, Pam. So I want to just go ahead and thank everyone that took the time to join us on the call today. I think we had some good dialogue here. As always, I want to take this opportunity to also thank our employees for their continued commitment and for delivering the outstanding performance that we did this year.","We had a record year of performance on top of a record year last year. It\u2019s just a string of records for the company. And it doesn\u2019t happen without a strong team and the team is really doing a great job executing on the win strategy and achieving those record results. And so we\u2019re certainly very, very proud of their accomplishments.","They\u2019ve also lead the transformation of Parker into what I describe or talk about as being the premier diversified industrial company that we are today and among the best performing companies in our peer group. And I think anyone on the call could certainly look at virtually any metric and put us up against the top companies in our peer group. And we\u2019re going to look very favorable by that comparison.","So very excited about the year. We\u2019re going to have another hopefully record year this coming year. I want to thank everybody for participating on the call and certainly for your continued interest in the company.","Pam will be around as always after the call to take any questions. And so with that I\u2019d just say goodbye and have a great day. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference.

Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Suever, Chief Financial Officer. Ma'am, you may begin.","Catherine Suever","Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's first quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks. Today's presentation slides, together with the audio webcast replay, will be accessible on the company's investor information website at phstock.com for one year following today's call.","On slide number 2, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and are also posted on Parker's website at phstock.com.","Today's agenda appears on slide number 3. To begin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom Williams will provide highlights for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's first quarter performance, together with the guidance for the full year fiscal 2018. Tom will then provide a few summary comments and we'll open the call for a question-and-answer session.","Please refer now to slide number 4, as Tom will get us started with the highlights.","Thomas Williams","Thanks Cathy, and good morning to everybody and thanks for joining the call, we appreciate your interest in Parker. So let me just make a few comments about general business conditions and we will talk about the quarter. So first on safety, that continues to be a top priority for the company. [Analysis] is the right thing to do obviously, but the focus on safety is driving an increased engagement from our people, which is in turn driving safety improvements across the company which is also impacting our operational improvements across the company as well, so I'm very encouraged by all of that.","You saw the announcement on orders, broad based increase across markets and regions. The organic growth was greater than industrial production growth for the last three quarters in a row so we're excited about that. The Win Strategy initiatives continue to generate improvements in both growth and operating margins. If I would characterize business confidence in general, feedback from our customers [indiscernible] a very positive, so there is a nice general business confidence out there from an environmental standpoint.","So it's actually been about two years, since we announced and introduced the new Win Strategy, so thought I will reflect back. I know it's kind of hard to imagine since it's been two years, but a lot has happened in two years. I think back the two years ago, we're in debt or pretty tough industrial climate, actually our second biggest down turn in sales in the history of the company and we performed better than we ever hard in any previous downturn. But if you're looking for evidence on whether the new Win Strategy is working, I think if you look at the results of the last two years, I think it is clear and objective evidence that the strategy is working, you can see the numbers.","The good news for all of our people who are listening, the people within Parker and our shareholders, this is still early days of implementation. There is lots of upside with the new Win Strategy and we're excited about that. So I wanted to say first of all thank you to all the Parker team members around the world for the great progress after two years from the launch and for being a partner in creating the new Win Strategy because when we went around and introduced it, they were a big part of creating the strategies that we're now rolling out.","So let's move on to the quarter, great start, it's always nice to come out of blocks well. Starting with safety as we normally do, 24% reduction in recordable injuries which was great performance. And you look at the key performance metrics for the quarter, fully solid performance across all those, the sales was a first quarter record for us up 23%, organic growth slightly above 7%, order rates increased at double-digits and this is the highest level of order growth that we've had for a quarter, since Q4 of fiscal 2011. The segment operating margins continue to make nice improvements and EPS for the quarter that was a first quarter record as well. When you look at the change in the EPS, EPS increased 36% as reported and 48% on an adjusted basis, so really nice increases there and we are on track to deliver strong operating cash flow going forward.","So just a quick comment or two on capital deployment priorities; so dividends continues to be our number one focus, increasing the dividends and maintaining our long standing track record of dividend increases. We're going to continue to invest in organic growth with our CapEx, it's the most efficient way to grow the company and we're going to maintain the 10b5-1 plan that we have in place for a consistent share buyback program and we're continuing to focus on bringing down the debt.","So I want to talk about the outlook; so outlook was increased from an adjusted EPS standpoint by $0.60 at the midpoint from $8.80 to $9.40. This reflects the first quarter [beat] that we had and increased organic growth estimates that we baked into the guidance. So for that we've increased total Parker organic growth from our previous guide at 3.7% to another new guide as 5.5% organic growth total company.","So now going forward, obviously we're going to continue driving the new Win Strategy and I'm going to just make a quick comment or two about each one of the four goals, starting first with engage people. So this is really all about creating an ownership culture, because if you're an owner and if you think like an owner and act like an owner, it creates a level of intimacy, level of accountability with your area of responsibility that drives much better results.","Second is premier customer experience; so we're going to focus on going from a service mindset to an experience mindset, have holistic experience interaction with our customers and our distributors. So obviously to create quality and delivery that's being easier to do business with that's being digital leaders in our space, so that's Internet of Things, the fee business those type of areas.","Third goal is profit growth; so we want to grow organically faster than the market, that's the global industrial production mix. And we're doing that through our growth initiatives and the Win Strategy as well as the new incentive plan that rolled out a couple of years ago that really underpins driving that kind of behavior on growth.","Fourth goal is financial performance; so 17% segment operating margins is still our focus. Growing EPS 8% year-over-year or higher. And the focus there for financial performance as well as big four initiatives we have under our new financial performance; the simplification, lean enterprise, strategic supply chain and value pricing. So one comment about CLARCOR, I'm sure it'll come up with the Q&A. Integration is going very well. Synergies are track, we've communicated to you. And really the new filtration group is really acting as one team and we're very proud of how that team has functioned and really it's one Parker team, it's no longer a separate CLARCOR or a separate Parker team, it's just one combined Parker team.","So in sum, we're looking forward to and anticipating a record year. And we're really driving continues improvement across the board. And so with that I'm going to give it back to Cathy to give you more details on the quarter.","Catherine Suever","Thanks, Tom. I'd like you to now refer to slide number 5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $2.24 compared to a $1.61 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of 39%. For year-over-year comparison purposes, first quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings per share have been adjusted by a total of $0.14. Operating income adjustments include business realignment expenses of $0.04 and CLARCOR costs to achieve of $0.03. The low operating income has been adjusted by $0.07 per share for a loss related to an investment. Prior year first quarter earnings have been adjusted for business realignment expenses of $0.06.","On slide 6, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, to $2.24 for the first quarter of this year. The most significant increase came from higher adjusted segment operating income of $0.62 attributable to earnings on meaningful organic growth, income from acquisitions and increased margins as a result of our new Win Strategy initiatives. I'd like to point out that this $0.62 improvement is net of incremental depreciation and amortization expense, taken on with the CLARCOR acquisition.","A lower income tax rate due largely to the stock option expense tax credit equated to a year-over-year increase of $0.12, while lower other expense primarily due to lower pension expenses equated to a favorable $0.06. Adjusted per share income was reduced by $0.11 due to higher interest expense and $0.06 due to higher corporate G&A, primarily as a result of higher performance compensation expense.","Moving to slide number 7, you'll find total Parker sales and segment operating margins for the first quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter increased year-over-year by 7.4%. There was a 13.9% contribution to sales in the quarter from new acquisitions, while currency positively impacted the quarter by 1.4%.","Total segment operating margins on an adjusted basis improved to 16.0% versus 15.4% for the same quarter last year. I would like to remind that the fiscal year 2018 operating margins include incremental depreciation and amortization from a prior quarter acquisition, so better comparison will be the EBITDA margins. EBITDA margins for the same periods on an adjusted basis improved to 17.0% in fiscal 2018 from 15.0% in fiscal year 2017. This 200 basis points EBITDA margin improvement reflects the benefits of higher volume, combined with positive impacts from our new Win Strategy initiatives.","Moving to slide number 8, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the first quarter, North American organic sales increased by 9.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. Acquisitions contributed 26.4% to sales, while currency also positively impacted the quarter. Operating margin for the first quarter on an adjusted basis was 16.7% of sales versus 17.5% in the prior year.","I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial International segment on slide number 9. Organic sales for the first quarter in the Industrial International segment increased by 11.7%, acquisitions positively impacted sales by 7.3%, while currency positively impacted the quarter by 3%. Operating margin for the first quarter on an adjusted basis was 15.7% of sales versus 14.2% in the prior year.","I'll now move to slide number 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased 5.5% for the first quarter. Reduced volume in OEM sales and commercial aftermarket sales, were partially offset by strength in the military aftermarket during the quarter. Much of this reduced volume was timing related and increased year-over-year volume is anticipated for the rest of the fiscal year. Operating margin for the first quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 14.7% of sales versus 13.1% in the prior year, reflecting the impact of greater aftermarket sales mix and timing of development costs during the quarter.","Moving to slide number 11, we show the details on order rates by segments. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders continue to be strong improving a positive 11% for the quarter end. This year-over-year improvement made up 10% from the Diversified Industrial North American orders, 15% from the Diversified Industrial International orders and 4% from Aerospace Systems orders.","On slide number 12, we report cash flow from operating activities. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $239 million or 7.1% of sales compared to 4.2% of sales for the same period last year or 12.2% last year adjusted for the $220 million discretionary pension contribution made in fiscal year 2017. The significant capital allocations year-to-date have been $88 million for the payment of shareholder dividends, $79 million or 2.4% of sales for capital expenditures and $50 million for the company's safe harbor repurchases of common shares.","The full year earnings guidance for fiscal year 2018 is outlined on slide number 13. Guidance is being provided on both an as reported and an adjusted basis. Total sales increases are expected to be in the range of 14.2% to 17.8% as compared to the prior year. Anticipated full year organic growth at the midpoint is 5.5%. Acquisitions in the guidance are expected to positive impact sales by 8.3% and currency is expected to have a positive 2.3% impact on sales.","We have calculated the impact of currencies to spot rates as of the quarter ended September 30, 2017. We have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2018. For total Parker, as reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 15.3% and 15.7%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 16.1% and 16.5%.","The full year tax rate is now projected to be 28% down from our previous guide of 29% as a result of a favorable stock option tax credits realized in the first quarter. For the full year, the guidance range on an as reported earnings per share basis is now $8.45 to $9.05 or $8.75 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is now $9.10 to $9.70 or $9.40 at the midpoint.","In addition to the loss related to the sale of an investment of $14 million or $0.07 per share, this guidance on an adjusted basis excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $58 million for the full year of fiscal 2018. Savings from business realignment initiatives are projected to be $25 million. In addition, guidance on an adjusted basis excludes $52 million of CLARCOR costs to achieve expenses. CLARCOR synergy savings are estimated to be $58 million in fiscal year '18.","We remain on pace to realize the forecasted $140 million run rate synergy savings by fiscal year '20. Savings from all business realignment and CLARCOR costs to achieve are fully reflected in both the as reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges. We ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison.","Some additional key assumptions for the full year 2018 guidance at the midpoint are, sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half; adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% first half, 54% second half; adjusted EPS first half, second half is divided 45%, 55%; second quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.96 per share at the midpoint; and this excludes $0.09 of projected business realignment expenses and $0.09 of projected CLARCOR costs to achieve. When comparing to Q2 FY '17 results, please remember that last year included $0.21 gain per share on the sale of a product line which was not adjusted out.","On slide number 14, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components for fiscal year 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $9.40 per share at the midpoint, compared to the prior guidance of $8.80 per share. Increases include $0.43 from stronger segment operating income, $0.16 from a reduced tax rate and $0.05 from lower projected corporate G&A. Offsetting these increases is a $0.04 per share decrease from higher interest and other expense than previously forecasted. Please remember that forecast excludes any acquisitions or divestitures that might close during the remainder of fiscal 2018.","This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments.","Thomas Williams","Thanks, Cathy. So we're very pleased with the start of the year. I think what we have going on here is a combination of couple of factors; sales growth, the lower cost structure that we have been working on past but we will continue to work on to lower even further, integration of CLARCOR and the execution of the Win Strategy. All of these forced together are combining to provide a very powerful combination that's driving us to project a record year in fiscal 2018. So again thank you to the global team for all your hard work, all your efforts and your dedication.","And I want to hand it off to Chelsea to start the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Adam Farley","Hi good morning, this is Adam Farley on for Nathan. So it looks like the -- one of the big changes in revenue guidance came from International Industrial, going out to 16.9% at the midpoint. What regions are driving this growth and what end markets are also driving the growth?","Thomas Williams","So Adam let me start that and then hand it over to Lee to give you more details. But what's changing in our guide is just looking at order entry over the last three months. Well it was interesting order entry was pretty consistent throughout the quarter both in North America and in international. But in international particularly we saw Asia continue to be strong, Europe, Middle East and Africa region was growing in the low teens and Latin America was kind of in the low single digits. So that combination was pretty strong. Aerospace grew plus 4%, that against a pretty tough comp of plus 14%. So when you put that all in and we looked at what we were projecting for the year and our feedback from customers and distributors, we looked at -- I'm looking at Industrial only, so we raised the whole guidance for the company at 5.5%. But if you look at the Industrial piece by itself taking North America and Africa it's about 10.5% for the first half, and then 3.7% for the second half. I recognize the second half is comparing to a plus 6% that we had in the second half of FY17. So remember we really started clicking from an organic gross standpoint of January of this calendar year and so we're comparing against this but there is still pretty nice growth on top of plus 6%. So I would say that -- let Lee comment about the details here. This is broad base for every end market and every region participating. So I will let Lee give you further color.","Lee Banks","Yeah. I think just piggy backing off Tom and maybe to give you a little added commentary on the different segments, it will continue to move in the direction we expected from the last call and order entry was really broad based and all regions participated. Maybe just walking through one of the segments just because I know the question will come up, I will start with Aerospace and then I will work my way into the Industrial markets. Aerospace did fall short of our regular expectations for Q1, but we're still forecasting growth for the year. Just breaking that down, I'd say on the headwind side, it's clearly commercial OEM was negative for us. It really was impacted by a mix of different platforms being manufactured with different [varying] amounts of content for us. But we do see that to close the gap as the fiscal year goes on. We see it being slightly negative for the year but not by much.","Commercial MRO was slightly negative for us for the quarter, but we really look at this primarily as timing. All the underpinnings of a strong MRO market are still in place and we expect growth in that market as we move through the fiscal year. And then the last headwind would be military OEM was soft. Again we see this really as timing, F-35 production will continue to accelerate as the year goes on and we're confident in that market. I'd say the positive was really strong military MRO growth which put some provisioning for new platforms and then just an increase in spares for some of the fleets being used today. So that's kind of a high level on Aerospace.","On Industrial, as we look through our end markets and we have a heat map by region, it's really hard to find any significant market a natural positive year-over-year order entry growth during the quarter. Really just to highlight some of those markets, if you talk about natural resource end markets we continue to see growth during the quarter. This would include agriculture in some areas but mostly construction equipment, mining very strong, oil and gas land based North America continues to be strong. I'll talk more about that in a second. Micro electronics industry is really broad based and strong. And Class A truck in North America very strong.","Just a little bit about oil and gas. Rigs have nearly doubled since last year, although some did come out. But really all these rigs are coming out of cold storage and they're all being refurbished which is great for our distribution base. And we also see an appreciable pick up in quotes and order entry activities. So that continues to be very good. We're also continuing [to see] rebound activity from our distributor partners around the world. They're very optimistic. I think one of the telltale signs for me when I talk to our distributor partners, when they see an increase in project activity from end customers, that's a real sign for us that capital is starting to be a lot loose in the economy and they've all seen an increase in project work.","It's not just strictly MRO work. I'd say the only notable end markets we saw around the globe, was really in power generation. This really has to do with the mix of turbines being applied today and in marine. And then just real quickly on some regional commentary. I talked about North America but we're very encouraged by the increasing end market activity. I talked about the natural resource end markets and our distributor base been very positive across the country.","EMEA we continue to see strong year-over-year order entry growth. And we are forecasting a second year of organic growth for EMEA which is -- we feel really good about. And then Tom mentioned on Asia, very strong. China continues to lead with strong industrial and natural resources end markets. And then really the strength of China from our opinion has been led by continued infrastructure investment and the strong housing market. So I would just say we're encouraged by what's happening with our end markets both domestically and internationally and really there is just a very strong clear positive global sentiment to growth right now.","Adam Farley","All right. That's great. Thank you so much. I will pass it along.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Tiss","That's going to take me a second, I was not prepared. Can you say that if CLARCOR was accretive or dilutive to the operating margins, including the amortization?","Catherine Suever","Yeah. Joel at the beginning of the year, we gave guidance that we see $0.20 of accretion from CLARCOR for the year, we're on track for that. That includes the impact of depreciation and amortization as well as the additional interest that we are incurring because of the deal, so accretive $0.20 on the year.","Joel Tiss","I meant on the operating margins, what was the change in the operating margins from putting CLARCOR in there?","Catherine Suever","Yeah. They are in line with what you saw historically for CLARCOR and in line with our filtration group, so normal margins.","Joel Tiss","Okay. And I just wondered, why the operating cash flow was down on the year-over-year? Then I am done. Thank you.","Catherine Suever","Sure. First quarter is always our low quarter for cash from operations. We still expect the year to be at 10% or greater as a percent of sales. In the quarter we're building capital to match the higher volume that we're incurring. We're also building some inventory to prepare for some of the footprint moves that we are doing to integrate CLARCOR, so a little bit higher investment in working capital than unusual. But not out of the normal trends for us for first quarter and we will recover that through the rest of the year.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","I guess couple of questions, you sort of talked about -- sorry, the strength in the international markets. Was that all just Parker's core business or are you seeing any traction in terms of CLARCOR starting to gain some traction sort of on the international front? I guess that's my first question. And then my second question, just in terms of CLARCOR [gaining] potential revenue synergies, should we see that in '18 and how we're tracking to the savings plan that you guys laid out the $140 million?","Thomas Williams","Okay. Jamie this is Tom. The international strength, because CLARCOR's end markets and legacy Parker end markets are the same, that's all one of the same as far as the strength that we saw across international. On the revenue synergies as I've mentioned before we have always -- we also working them hard, but we have always view them continuously to make sure we deliver on our commitment to all of our shareholders on the $140 million of synergies. Regarding the -- so on the revenue synergies, if some of you are trying to bake them into FY18, I would encourage you not to do that because even if we were going to publically disclose it, which we're not, we won't see any of that stuff realistically into FY19 anyhow.","So I would just encourage you on revenue synergies to factor based on the comments we're making on end markets and regions. But on the savings target, overall $140 million, we still feel very good about that. And remember we formed these -- we've an integrated management office, we have got a great cadence around product management here. We have value creation teams all around a couple of the key synergy buckets; manufacturing, footprint, productivity, material, adjusted SG&A would be the major categories and all of them are on track. So we're very encouraged by what we've seen both the fit the technologies culturally and the projected savings. So we feel very good about them.","Jamie Cook","And sorry just a follow-up on the end market commentary. Tom, is there any markets that you're looking at based on in terms of the markets overheating or where the strength is not sustainable?","Thomas Williams","Jamie, [the last thing]\u2026","Jamie Cook","Sorry can you hear me?","Thomas Williams","Yeah, go ahead.","Jamie Cook","Just -- I know everything was very positive in terms of end market commentary, but are there any markets that you're concerned are overheating? A lot of the people talk about the strength in China not being sustainable. I'm just wondering for seeing any warning signs.","Thomas Williams","Yeah. I think in general, China is not going to continue to grow at the pace that it's growing now. And we look at some macro indicators like electrical output usage and rail -- freight rail usage. And those are -- just naturally when you look at the comparables, China is going to glide from strong double digits to something that's going to be a low double digits but it's going to continue to be very good for us. But it's going to bump up against comparables that will make it -- it's going to have to glide down some more normalized type of growth plan there.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Catherine Suever","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open.","Mig Dobre","Yes. Good morning everyone. And before I ask my question, just a quick word here. Tom and the team your performance has really been impressive over the last couple of years, especially the last 12 months. And that's coming from someone who has been on the sidelines on the stock. So I tip my hat to guys, great job.","Thomas Williams","Mig before I let you ask the question, just thank you on behalf of all of us. Go ahead and ask your question.","Mig Dobre","So here is my question. I remember last quarter one of the discussions that we had collectively was progression of organic growth and how to think about more difficult comps in the back half of the year. Looking at your order intake at least what we're seeing from this quarter is that you are able to buck those more difficult comps quite nicely. I guess from your perspective, how are you thinking about the puts and takes of these more difficult comps? Do you think the business has enough momentum to potentially ride that out?","Thomas Williams","Mig this is Tom. On the order entry remember our -- on the Industrial portion of the business, our visibility will be typically like in that [6 to 8 week] standpoint. So obviously we have a lot more visibility and confidence in the first half of the year and going into January. So, but like I mentioned before for the first half Industrial 10.5% growth, again a little bit easier comps but that's reflective of what we did internationally -- industrially this last quarter and the order pattern that we're seeing. Then the second half is in that 3.5% range. Remember again that we had 6% organic growth the first two quarters of this calendar year, the last two quarters of our fiscal year.","So I feel pretty good about that, given that on top of the 6% growth feels pretty good. Especially when we were living in a world that was negative and we all were feeling like if we got 1% or 2% growth it will be the new norm. So that kind of growth rate feels very good. It doesn't feel like we're too far over our SKUs. And then of course we'll give you an update in January, if we think there is more there than that, we'll certainly give you an update in January.","Mig Dobre","Understood. And my follow up, maybe a little more color on the margin in Aerospace. You've called out some things that helped this quarter. Maybe help us understand exactly what's kind of changing for the rest of the year in order to get to your margin guidance?","Catherine Suever","Yeah, Mig, I will take this one. In the quarter we saw a better mix of aftermarket just in general terms of the overall mix. We also were a little bit lighter than usual on our development costs. Now some of that was timing of the development costs, and will incur the rest of those costs during the rest of the year. We expect the development costs for Aerospace to still be around 7.5% to 7.8% sales for the year. They were lighter than that in the first quarter. And the mix of the aftermarket will shift back we think to normal trends in subsequent quarters.","Mig Dobre","Any sense on the dollar value or margin impact from these from this cost shift, the development costs?","Catherine Suever","The development costs roughly $10 million to $11 million light this quarter compared to the normal.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Can we talk just a little bit about CLARCOR and the integration? I mean coming into the year you have cost cuts pulling forward, costs to accelerate the integration. How should we think about that? Are we going to achieve the $140 million in synergies there, or are we going to achieve more than a $140 million? How should we think about that from our model perspective?","Thomas Williams","Ann, this is Tom, so we're still staying with the $140 million. The one thing that I do want to at least let people know, because this is obviously a part of our question, I think some of you should have seen we posted a whole -- [save the date], for our Investor Day in the spring of next year. We picked that time because that would have marked the one year anniversary of the acquisition and we like to go in a lot more detail on how we are progressing in and what we think at that point. But $140 million still feels like the right number and with a couple of more quarters we give you at the investor update, in the spring of next year, also might be lot smarter and educate us to where we think the number is going to land.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I appreciate that. That will take time. Most of my other questions have been answered, but would you be willing to share with us how big China is for Parker total?","Thomas Williams","No. You know me and I probably won't be able to give you that. But you know it is our second or third largest country you know after the U.S., with Germany and China kind of competing for that second spot. But I would look at our Asia progression. It's not just the China only story. We see really good effort across the entire region, so North Asia, Korea and Japan are probably better than I can remember in a lot of years. India is having one of our better years than any. Then South East Asia is doing strong. Australia has comeback from where it was, coming off of the bottom. So for us the part I feel good about with Asia is that it's a broad based Asia story, it's not a singular China story.","Ann Duignan","And as for better, I mean it's hard to find anything negative right now but look, [I wanted] to have sustainable as always. Is there any cloud out there that you are worried about that see, we've never seen such a coordinated recovery at top speed in the end markets before. What will you do about this?","Thomas Williams","I think your point is spot on. It is encouraging because you right, if you look at the PMIs across the regions it's very rare in my memory where you've gotten this much strong PMI activity pretty consistently across the board. But I think this is a different I think time period for Industrials. There has been a lot of data and analysis that we've done. When you look at the last 15 years for Industrials and this is going to be maybe a long way to answer to your question the '03 to '08 time period was a really strong Industrial time period, where Industrials kind of outpaced GDP driven little because of China and the whole globalization of Industrials. Then we have the great recession '08 and to '09 and '10 starting to recover a rebound to '11. And then most Industrials somewhat treaded water from '11 to '15. And then we had the industrial recession which was really natural resource led '15 and '16 and of course we have seen a recovery now start, beginning this calendar year. My feeling is this feels and as the word common sense made at the beginning that general business conditions and the sentiment from customers and distributors feels different than the previous eras I've just described, in more like an '03 to '08, but it's not going to have the same pull that China had back in that era. So I look for Industrials to break out of their kind of treading water pattern that was in the '11 to '15. Where that finally ends up nobody -- I'm not spotting up this day but this does feels slightly different. Trees don't grow to the sky so PMIs are not going to go forever. But I think what we have [influenced] have heard of a more sustainable industrial growth that what we have may be expected. I think number one we launched the new Win Strategy, we're talking about 1.5% world. Doesn't feel like that right now, but when it lands we're all going to learn over the next several quarters and years.","Ann Duignan","And then on that note are you seeing any labor inflation yet anywhere in the world? And I will leave it there. Thanks.","Thomas Williams","Ann, again I will say -- I'll continue, it's Tom. No, nothing out of the norm.","Ann Duignan","Okay appreciate. I'll get back in the queue, thanks.","Catherine Suever","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks and good morning everybody.","Catherine Suever","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Maybe still with the growth rates of [Parker] clearly really strong this quarter. And I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that typically 1Q is seasonally you tend to see inventory build for you guys in 1Q which makes a lot of sense. I'm just curious like when you think about the selling versus sell through on the distributor side, maybe you can provide a little bit of a color on where you think distributor inventories are today?","Lee Banks","Joe this is Lee. I would say last quarter we talked about a little bit of a rebound in inventory build at the distribution level. I will characterize at the distribution level and at the OEM level right now, it feels like end market pull through for the most part. People have reacted to the rapid increase in order entry and as a general statement I would say its end market pull through.","Joe Ritchie","And then if I kind of follow it on some of the questions were asked earlier around CLARCOR and the synergy targets. One thing I noticed this quarter is that you put through I think about $6 million of costs to achieve through versus $52 million for the year. Just curious was there any reason why the spend wasn't more front end loaded just to support the synergy expectations and just once again any color on that?","Catherine Suever","Yeah Joe this is Cathy. We did shift a little bit the timing of some of the footprint mergers that we had planned in the whole integration. And so as the costs were originally projected for the quarter those shifted more towards later in the year. However, we have some offsetting other favorable savings that are coming through earlier than we expected, so we're on track for the savings as we had predicted we would get. We're going to see about 40% of the savings in the first half and 60% of the savings in the second half for the year with about $58 million for the year.","Thomas Williams","Joe, this is Tom, if I could just add on. In general if I were to characterize whether its CLARCOR related or just on traditional restructuring, when we do planned closures, our teams tend to be more ambitious on thinking they are going to accelerate the timing of the closure and we tend to let them run to a more aggressive target, so they can try to get things done. But we're always conservative on forecasting their savings that came from that recognizing the planned closures and the timing and all the announcements is sometimes tricky to coordinate all that. So we were conservative on the savings projections, that's why you don't see us come out with our savings for this year and the actual costs, what Q1 was like you will see that come back up in Q2, Q3 and Q4 for the rest of the year.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That's great to hear and I know may be a last question. I know Ann just asked about wage inflation. I'm just curious whether you saw commodity inflation impact the North America margins this quarter. I know clearly there was the mix issue going on as well. But, was there any -- was there much of an impact from price costs this quarter on North America margins?","Lee Banks","Joe, its Lee, I mean the net is no. We have seen some commodity inflations such as copper, but really where we have that is an issue where we have a lot of exposure. We have got contracts with our customers that it hits a certain level we pass that through. So that's the only really volatile one that I can think of, the others are up year-over-year but they are kind of flattened out.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI.","David Raso","I'm just trying to think through sort of the back half of the year, the way you laid out the sequencing and the splits. It doesn't appear in the second half of the year, you're assuming really much by way of any real improvement on the year-over-year incrementals, even though by then you have anniversaried majority at least of the second half of your anniversary the CLARCOR deal. And just given the comments that you have about the order book and the breadth of it and so forth, I'm just trying to understand, am I reading that properly and if so where are we on ability to push price in this market?","Catherine Suever","Let me adjust the margins first David. We're currently seeing it -- we're struggling to break out with good enough numbers to share with you, what legacy Parker looks like today, because we're doing a nice job integrating CLARCOR. But as we look at it internally in very rough estimates, we're anticipating still 30% incrementals for the balance of the year or for the total year for legacy Parker. So we will have CLARCOR for the full year by the end, we're being impacted by the additional amortization and depreciation expense, but we're on track to have incrementals in the low 30s.","David Raso","Well I guess I'm just thinking the improvement, I mean if you put the all-in numbers, you're looking for a 80% incremental in the first half, and about 21% in the second half, given the natural help from anniversarying CLARCOR, I would have thought it to be a bigger improvement in the second half incrementals versus the first half? I'm just trying to think through are we not getting pricing or maybe you could give us little more color on price costs for the second half of the year. Just as people try to think of the earnings run rate exiting a fiscal year of thinking about calendar '18.","Lee Banks","David its Lee. I would say on price costs going back to the guidance we gave. We're expecting a positive separation -- our selling price index, we forecast it ever year. We expect that to be mildly positive for the year and we expect a separation between that and our purchase price index. So we're not forecasting any wild acceleration in pricing in the second half of the year.","David Raso","And on the second half, the slower growth rate in Industrial, you've mentioned it was largely calm. And is that actually the case in the guidance, there is really no slowdown per se in any of the end markets in the guide it's just a function of comp?","Thomas Williams","It's Tom, David. And that's how I would characterize it.","David Raso","All right terrific. Thank you.","Catherine Suever","Thank you, David.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Mr. Casey, your line is now open.","Andy Casey","Sorry about that. Good morning and thanks. With the broad based strength, have you seen any supply chain constraints and if you did can you give us some color on maybe what sort of components?","Lee Banks","Andy it's Lee. So anytime we have a ramp like this it was obviously noise. But there is nothing that I would consider to be abnormal. It's everything that we're managing through. So there is nothing I would strike out. And there is, really no components that I could strike out that are really causing us major problems right now.","Thomas Williams","Andy this is Tom, just to tag on. One good indicator of whether we are okay or not is if you look at our total company backlog, it's basically stayed flat even with three quarters of a pretty, strong increases from the order entry standpoint. So if any of our customers are listening, we recognize we want to do better and improve to our delivery times with our customers. But we've been able to absorb this pretty strong increase and not have our backlog go up.","Andy Casey","Okay, thank you. And then if I step back and look at the longer term Win Strategy. You talked about a whole bunch of multichannel selling techniques to get above Industrial production. You're kind of running there already. Is there any big thing left within the Win Strategy to accomplish or is it just certain parts of it are running better than you would have thought?","Thomas Williams","Andy it's Tom. I think there is still lots of opportunities. If I look at services, innovation, systems still a lot of opportunities there. Our distribution mix is still lighter than we would like to see it internationally, so there is opportunity to do that. Collectively, I'm just going to use round numbers, we're still only about 10% market share in this whole motion control space. So there is big opportunity to take share. But I would -- for us and what we want to demonstrate is that we can grow 150 basis points greater than global industrial production over the cycle. It's easier to do that at the beginning of cycle when people are refluxing -- rebounding and refluxing up. What we want to demonstrate is over a multi-year period of time can we average 150 bps, because really top quartile companies and that's also our intention to be demonstrates that over a cycle. So that's why we're really happy with three quarters in a row, believe me we're quite happy with that. The real trick will be doing it over a longer period of time.","Andy Casey","Okay thanks and then last question more kind of capital allocation. Can you comment on the pipeline, I know you're still integrating and on track with the CLARCOR acquisition integration, but I'm wondering if there are any opportunities that you're looking at?","Thomas Williams","So Andy it is Tom again. So I've mentioned earlier, so dividends will still be first on the capital deployment side of things, CapEx for organic growth, because organic growth is still the most efficient way to grow the company. We're going to do the share repurchase plan and we're going to pay down debt. But you're right at some point as we glide down the debt path we're going to have the ability to start looking at acquisitions as part of our growth strategy as well. And I would just -- obviously I can't give line of sight on anything there -- I will just let everybody know that we continue to work that pipeline, all those relationships. Those are reviewed as a long standing effort because not something we can turn the switch off, turn it back on. We're going to work those relationships and those strategies.","These are obviously targets that fit our strategic vision of our respective groups in the corporation. So we have -- we know what those are and we will continue to work them. As some of you have heard me say before, we want to be great generators of cash and great deployers of cash side and that great deployers of cash side that includes acquisition. And we will continue to [whatever characterize] have an assertive balance sheet at the appropriate time, and we will work those and we will certainly let you know when we're ready.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeff Hammond","Just on CLARCOR, I know you don't want to talk or quantify revenue synergies yet, but just as you get the groups together what are some of the early opportunities that you have identified where they are showing up as clear revenue synergy opportunity?","Thomas Williams","Jeff this is Tom, I will just characterize it at a high level. [indiscernible] the channel opportunities, number one our channels are complimentary, so you can have product line being carried on the line curve for the various channel partners. Those are regional opportunities because North America is really CLARCOR strong, since we are more balanced globally, so these are regional opportunities. And then there is OEM opportunities, CLARCOR which is we why we love this so much is 80% aftermarket business, and we are stronger on the OEM. So if we're going to leverage those OEM relationships, which may be we have a broader breadth of technologies growing in, as well as filtration that we can leverage. So those are the three broad areas, channel, region and OEM portfolio that we could go to the OEM with. And we're working those hard. Again I would just encourage the analysts to not take numbers into '18 because as we work those if and when they hit they are going to be more in the '19 area. And again I think we will give you a lot more clarity, you can certainly plan on CLARCOR update and the more extensive discussion being a big part of Investor Day in the spring.","Jeff Hammond","And then if you look at those three opportunities, which one -- where would you expect it to move the fastest?","Thomas Williams","Not going to comment on that Jeff, as you know we're working all of them equally.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Dillon Cumming","Good morning guys. This is Dillon Cumming on for Nigel, just wanted to come back on CLARCOR, you guys talked last quarter a bit about some possible margin pressures in integration and will that be through back to consolidation there, some short-term manufacturing efficiencies. Obviously margins sort of [indiscernible] here in 1Q, so are you guys still expecting some kind of pressure here at CLARCOR in the next couple of quarters or do you kind of still have a clear line of sight there, you kind of have worked through those headwinds?","Catherine Suever","Some of the inefficiencies will come when we're emerging the footprints and we did push that out, so we did less footprint merging in the first quarter than we had originally planned. And you'll see more of that come into play in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Other than that though we're on track for the synergy savings and we're seeing savings in other areas other than footprint consolidation.","Dillon Cumming","Got it that's helpful. And then maybe just a longer term question here. I think you still have a desire to kind of grow out the distribution footprint in the international segment. I just wondered if you could see how that strategy is progressing and to what extent, and are we driving some of the upside in the international sales growth in the region?","Lee Banks","This has been a key --this is Lee talking. This has been a key initiative for us as a prior refresh of our new Win Strategy. And we've got some really senior dedicated people working on this around the globe. We've had great progress throughout Asia, Southeast Asia and continued progress in EMEA and really developing parts of EMEA, the Middle East and Africa and developing parts of Europe. So bottom line is we're making great progress. I think you see that reflected in our sales and in our margins.","Dillon Cumming","Got it. Appreciate the time guys.","Catherine Suever","Okay. Thanks Dillon.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research.","Neil Frohnapple","Hi congrats on a great quarter. Pertaining to the sales guidance, I'm curious on what you're factoring in pertaining to CLARCOR organic revenue growth for this year? I think last quarter you indicated that you're expecting low-single digit organic growth. So wondering if you can provide an update on that?","Catherine Suever","Yeah. I would say now we're looking at more mid-single digits.","Neil Frohnapple","Okay. So similar to the base business.","Catherine Suever","Correct.","Neil Frohnapple","And then maybe as a follow-up to David's question. I mean could you talk more about the increased margin outlook for Diversified International. I think the implied incremental margin for the segment at the midpoint similar to the implied incremental margin in the original guidance. So is there something precluding you guys from experiencing a higher flow through to step up in organic growth expectations or is it more of a wait and see approach given how early we are still in the year?","Catherine Suever","Yeah. I would say it's early in the year still. We are seeing the margin improvement as a result of a lot of the Win Strategy initiatives we've been working. We've eliminated fixed costs in Europe and that's helping. But as the growth comes through we're hoping to see the incremental margins but it's a little early yet.","Neil Frohnapple","Okay great. Thanks, I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Thein with Citi Research.","Timothy Thein","Great. Thank you. Just circling back on the discussion earlier on the strength in Asia and which obviously has been going on for a while. Is that a region where that going back a few years you had [facilitated], obviously we are operating at extremely low rates. And I'm just wondering given the revenue pick up that you've benefited from just where those facilitated facilities are operating today? And I guess really the spirit in the question is whether there is additional costs that start creeping back in or is there still ample room within their facilities to be able to meet the higher volumes?","Thomas Williams","Tim it's Tom. So on Asia you're right. You have a good memory. Over the last 10 years we've made some investments to really -- in advance of Asia growing into those things and really have grown in some. But from additional CapEx it will be very selective. It will be more a piece of equipment here or two. We don't [lease] any brick and mortar, pretty well add what we need and with the combination of lean and some very targeted equipment purchases, we'll be in good shape.","Timothy Thein","Okay. In that region and just thinking about international margin as a whole, I'm guessing Asia is still well at least above that average relative to -- at least relative to Europe?","Thomas Williams","So Tim, this is Tom again, yes it is. And that's why as Asia grows that's why we get a nice corresponding lift international margins.","Timothy Thein","Okay. And then just Tom on the group consolidation, where are you there? Just thinking about potential -- obviously when those savings come rather quickly, I'm just curious what you're thinking in terms of the division count and where you're looking to end FY18?","Thomas Williams","Just as to refresh -- its Tom again, refresh for people on the phone. So we started as a 114 and we're going to approximately 90 for this year. And that's something that we constantly look at. It's not something we're [editing] a number, truly what makes sense logically as far as the cost synergies and our growth synergies, people are working in common end markets or common technologies. The pace of consolidation is going to slow. We're not going to continue to grow from 114 to 90, remember if you go from 114 to 90 that's 24 divisions but that will require 48 divisions to be combined, so that's roughly 45% of the company going through some kind of change process. So we will not continue at that pace. And it will be whatever makes sense for our customers and from a cost stand point. So it's going to glide down, by go out a year or so a little bit more. But the simplification actions that will become less of the big driver and more the whole revenue complexity the 80-20 look on being able to be some positive business with. Our business strategy is around the 80-20 concept of revenue complexity. That was [indiscernible] we're carry simplification to the next level going out the next several years.","Timothy Thein","Okay. Great. Thanks Tom.","Catherine Suever","Thank you Tim. Okay. We have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Steve Volkmann","I wanted to circle back to, kind of the discussion I guess everybody is obviously trying to get a sense of sort of sustainability of these current positive trends and I'm wondering, Lee you might have a view, because I think you mentioned that there was a lot of rebuild activity in oil and gas and we're seeing that in some of the mining as well. But it's sort of begs the question of sort of once you are redone rebuilding what's out there things could sort of flatten out or even slow down a little bit and I wonder, if that is something that you guys worry about or not?","Lee Banks","So obviously there is a lot of that activity going and this Lee. Steve this is Lee. But it's not the only thing going on. So I mean just -- I think the point I try to make when I survey our partners, the really one plus for me is, there is just a lot of pick up in project work happening out there in the field, which, I flow that through to just CapEx being let go with some of these major companies out there and they are working on that, so for me that's a big plus happening. So I can tell you that the activity right now is still good, with a lot of the -- with the work going on in mining, oil and gas, but it's not the only thing that's happening.","Steve Volkmann","Okay. Fair enough. And then may be a quick one just follow up for Tom, you mentioned that your new incentive compensation plan was kind of working, now that you're two years into that, I thought that was an interesting comment can you just provide a little more color on that?","Thomas Williams","Steve this is Tom, a reminder for what that is. We have a return on net assets as incentive plan which really touches almost 95% of our team members around the world and for the senior leadership team, the divisional leadership team we've added a growth element to this. So if you grow faster in a market, whatever your incentive payout would be, there would be a positive multiplier on top of that. If you grow less in a market there will be a negative hair cut to your payout. So we've rolled that out a couple of years ago. And unfortunately the timing was not appropriate because there was a negative hair cut for people, and this was really the first time in the history of the company we did that. But as you might imagine that drove a lot of attention and drove the right kind of behaviors. So what it does is it encourages people to what we set on the Win Strategy, want you to grow faster on the market and if you do that you're going to be rewarded handsomely for that. And so that's I think the incentive plan, any good incentive plan you want to drive behavior and the indicators are striving with the right kind of behavior.","Steve Volkmann","And that's starting to payout as a multiplier rather than a hair cut now?","Thomas Williams","Yes.","Steve Volkmann","Great. Thank you.","Catherine Suever","Okay. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Ms. Cathy Suever for closing remarks.","Catherine Suever","Thanks Chelsea. Thanks to everybody for joining us today. Robin and Ryan will be available throughout the day to take your call if you any more questions. Thank you everybody. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"16835":["Parker-Hannifin Corp. (NYSE:PH) Q4 2017 Earnings Call August  3, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thomas L.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instruction will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Chief Financial Officer, Cathy Suever. Ma'am, you may begin.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thank you, James. Good morning, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 earnings release conference call. Joining me today is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks. Today's presentation slides, together with the audio webcast replay, will be accessible on the company's investor information website at phstock.com for one year following today's call.","On slide number 2, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and are also posted on Parker's website at phstock.com.","The agenda for today's call appears on slide number 3. To begin, Tom will provide highlights for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2017. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2017 performance, together with the guidance for fiscal year 2018. Tom will then provide a few summary comments and we'll open the call for a question-and-answer session.","Please refer now to slide number 4, as Tom will get us started with the highlights.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks Cathy, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I'd like to share highlights on our fourth quarter, the full-year results and make some brief comments on 2018 guidance, and give you an update on our new Win Strategy.","Before getting into the financials, I'd like to start our report on the safety of the company. During 2017, we were able to reduce our recordable injuries by 22% compared to the prior year. This builds on significant year-over-year improvements in the last several years.","Our global team continues to focus on achieving our goal of zero accidents through a multi-faceted plan, which includes utilization of high performance teams. This team process generates higher levels of engagement and ownership across all of our key performance indicators.","Now, the financial highlights of the fourth quarter results. This was outstanding quarter for Parker across many measures. Fourth quarter sales were $3.5 billion, an 18% increase compared with the same quarter a year ago.","Notably, organic sales increased 6%, while acquisitions contributed 13% and currency was a slight negative. We are particularly pleased with strong organic growth of 6% for the second consecutive quarter, driven by improving conditions across many end markets.","The CLARCOR acquisition, which closed in late February, was the main factor influencing the 13% increase from acquisitions.","Order rates, which do not include the impact of acquisitions, increased 8% compared with the same quarter last year, mostly driven by a 10% increase in orders for both Industrial North America and Industrial International businesses.","Net income for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $293 million as reported compared with the same period last year. Earnings per share was a record at $2.15 as reported or $2.45 on an adjusted basis, a 29% increase in adjusted earnings per share compared with the same quarter last year.","Our overall segment operating margin performance this quarter was very strong at 15.3% as reported or 16.8% on an adjusted basis. This is excellent performance, representing a 120-basis-point increase in adjusted segment operating margin compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Keep in mind that these margins are fully burdened with additional amortization and depreciation related to the CLARCOR acquisition.","So, just a few highlights on the full year that I'd like to note. Sales increased 6% to $12.0 billion, mostly driven by acquisitions. Organic growth was 2% as demand levels were weak in the first half, but improved significantly in the second half of the year.","Full-year net income increased 22% to $983 million. Earnings per share were $7.25 as reported or $8.11 on an adjusted basis, representing a 26% increase in adjusted earnings per share compared with 2016. As a reminder, during FY 2017, we completed the sale of the Autoline product line, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $45 million or $0.21 per share.","Total segment operating margins were 14.9% as reported. On an adjusted basis, segment operating margins were 15.8%, a 100-basis-point improvement versus last year. We anticipate continued margin expansion from the new Win Strategy.","Excluding a discretionary pension contribution, full-year cash from operations was 12.7% of sales and our free cash flow conversion was 134%. As I've said before, a key focus for us is to be great generators and deployers of cash in a way that produces increased long-term returns for our shareholders. These cash flow measures demonstrate our ability to be consistently a strong generator of cash.","This was also a successful year of cash deployment. We increased our annual dividends per share, ensuring that we continue what is now 61 consecutive years of increasing our annual dividends paid. We also repurchased $265 million worth of Parker shares. Importantly, we invested in growing our business by making three acquisitions, one of which, CLARCOR, was transformational for our portfolio.","Regarding the integration of CLARCOR and the Parker filtration businesses, the team continues to make excellent progress. We see opportunities to accelerate the integration and we are pulling into FY 2018 planned costs to achieve, which were originally expected in FY 2019. Our estimated total costs to achieve remain at $90 million.","We continue to be confident that we can generate the $140 million in cost synergies originally expected from our combined filtration businesses. With our strong cash flow, we expect our gross debt to EBITDA multiple to reduce to approximately two times over the next 24 months.","Moving to fiscal 2018 guidance, we are initiating a full-year sales growth forecast in the range of 11.4% to 15% to reflect anticipated higher organic growth and the impact of acquisitions. We are estimating a reported earnings in the range of $7.88 to $8.58 per share, or $8.23 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $8.45 to $9.15 per share, for a midpoint of $8.80 per share.","Earnings are adjusted on a pre-tax basis for expected business realignment expenses of approximately $58 million and CLARCOR costs to achieve of approximately $52 million. Business realignment expenses will reflect ongoing footprint optimization and our simplification actions.","A few highlights regarding simplification. We have continued to consolidate divisions, going from 114 divisions in FY 2015 to 100 divisions in the middle of FY 2017, and we plan to be at 90 divisions by the end of FY 2018. These numbers are for our legacy business, excluding Parker.","In June, we formed a Motion Systems Group by combining the businesses of our hydraulics and automation technologies. We believe this combination leverages the strength of Parker's motion technologies into a single organization that can better address the needs of our customers.","In the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, we are further streamlining our organization to put greater emphasis on leveraging resources across the region. With this change, we are reducing the number of regions from four to two, and from 22 sales companies to 7 multi-country sales companies, all supported by a pan-regional customer service organization. Additionally, we continue with our revenue complexity efforts to reduce costs and improve the speed at which we serve our customers.","The execution of the new Win Strategy and the strategic addition of CLARCOR have resulted in a significant increase in our EBITDA margin. On an as reported basis, EBITDA margin improved 160 basis points from 13.7% in FY 2016 to 15.3% in FY 2017.","On an adjusted basis, EBITDA margins increased 200 basis points from 14.7% in FY 2016 to 16.7% in FY 2017. In one year alone, we have made significant progress toward our targeted 300-basis-point improvement in EBITDA, as a result of the CLARCOR acquisition and the new Win Strategy. We look for continued EBITDA margin expansion in the future.","So, for now, I'm going to hand things back to Cathy to give you more details on the quarter and the guidance.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Tom. I'd like you to now refer to slide number 5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter and full-year 2017.","Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.45 versus $1.90 for the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter earnings have been adjusted to exclude CLARCOR acquisition-related expenses of $0.19 per share and business realignment expenses of $0.11 per share, which compares to business realignment expenses of $0.13 per share for the fourth quarter last year.","Adjusted earnings per share for the full-year 2017 were $8.11 versus $6.46 for 2016. The 2017 earnings are adjusted for business realignment expenses of $0.30 per share and CLARCOR acquisition-related expenses of $0.56 per share for a combined total of $0.86 per share. The 2016 earnings are adjusted for business realignment expenses of $0.57 per share.","On slide number 6, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.90 for the fourth quarter of 2016 to $2.45 for the fourth quarter of this year. Increases included higher adjusted segment operating income of $0.66 per share, reflecting the improved market demand, and benefits from the new Win Strategy initiatives.","Lower income tax expense in 2017 equated to an increase of $0.04 per share, due largely to the stock option expense tax credit. Adjusted per share income was reduced by $0.11 for higher interest expense, while higher corporate G&A and other expense reduced it another $0.04.","On slide number 7, you'll find the significant components of the walk for adjusted earnings per share of $6.46 for the full-year 2016 to $8.11 for the full-year 2017. Increases in 2017 included higher segment operating income equating to $1.17, a gain of $0.21 realized in Q2 from the divestiture of the Autoline product line, lower other expense and corporate G&A of $0.16, lower income tax expense equating to $0.17, which was again driven primarily by stock option expense tax credits, and fewer shares outstanding equating to $0.08. The decrease to adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 was higher interest expense of $0.14 associated with the CLARCOR acquisition debt issuance.","Moving to slide number 8, we reviewed total Parker sales and segment operating margin for the fourth quarter and full year. Total company organic sales in the fourth quarter increased by 6% compared to last year. There was a 12.9% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisition, while currency negatively impacted the quarter by 0.7%.","Total segment operating margins for the fourth quarter, adjusted for realignment costs as well as CLARCOR acquisition-related costs, was 16.8% versus 15.6% for the same quarter last year. The increase adjusted segment operating income this quarter reflects the impact of organic growth, combined with the benefits yielded from our simplification initiatives.","For the full year, organic sales in fiscal year 2017 increased by 1.7%, acquisitions contributed 4.9%, while the effect of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact of 0.7% of sales. Total company segment operating margin for fiscal year 2017, adjusted for realignment and CLARCOR acquisition-related expenses, was 15.8% versus 14.8% in fiscal year 2016.","Moving to slide number 9, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the fourth quarter, North American organic sales increased by 7.4% compared to the same quarter last year. Acquisitions contributed 25.1%, while currency negatively impacted the quarter by 0.3%.","Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for realignment and CLARCOR acquisition-related costs, was 18.2% of sales versus 18.0% in the prior year. This improvement was driven by strong incremental margins on increased revenues and lower fixed costs.","For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year 2017 decreased by 0.2%. Contribution to sales from acquisitions was 8.8%. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of 0.3%. For the full year 2017, operating margin, adjusted for realignment costs, was 17.7% versus 16.8% in the prior year.","As a reminder, these Industrial North America results have been impacted by the CLARCOR acquisition, with approximately 85% of total CLARCOR sales recognized within North America. I'll provide further detail for the quarter and full year regarding the impact of CLARCOR acquisition in a subsequent slide.","I'll continue now with the Diversified Industrial International segment on slide number 10. Organic sales for the fourth quarter in the Industrial International segment increased by 7.7%. Acquisitions positively impacted sales by 6%, while currency negatively impacted the quarter by 1.5%.","Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for business realignment costs, was 14% of sales versus 12.6% in the prior year, again reflecting strong incremental margins on increased revenues and lower fixed costs.","For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year 2017 increased by 4.3%. Acquisitions positively impacted sales by 2.9%, while currency resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of 1.6%. For the full-year 2017, operating margin, adjusted for realignment costs, was 14% of sales versus 12.3% in the prior year.","I'll now move to slide number 11 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues were relatively flat at 0.1% increase for the fourth quarter. Modest declines in OEM volume, reflecting continued softness in business jets, were offset by positive aftermarket growth during the quarter.","Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 18.5% of sales versus 16.4% in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $112 million as compared to $99 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of favorable aftermarket mix during the current quarter.","For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year 2017 increased by 1.1% of sales and operating margin, adjusted for realignment costs, was 14.9% of sales versus 15.1% in the prior year.","On slides 12 and 13, you'll find the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results for total Parker, CLARCOR and the resulting legacy Parker for net sales, operating income and operating margin.","We wanted to provide clarity for legacy Parker and legacy CLARCOR results through fiscal year 2017. In fiscal 2018, we will be operating the CLARCOR and Parker businesses more as one company, and we will no longer be able to provide a clean split between the two.","On slide 12, you see that the fourth quarter 2017 CLARCOR sales contributed $351 million, and as-reported operating income was a negative $3 million. Adjusted CLARCOR operating income, which includes amortization, was $30 million favorable, when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses.","On an as-reported basis, legacy Parker operating margins improved 230 basis points from 14.8% to 17.1%. On an adjusted basis, legacy Parker operating margins improved 210 basis points from 15.6% to 17.7% in the fourth quarter.","On slide number 13, you'll find that the four months Parker owned CLARCOR, CLARCOR sales contributed $487 million and as-reported operating income was a negative $16 million. Adjusted CLARCOR operating income, which includes amortization, was $42 million when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses of $58 million.","On an as-reported basis, legacy Parker operating margins improved 180 basis points from 13.9% to 15.7%. On an adjusted basis, legacy Parker operating margins improved 130 basis points from 14.8% to 16.1%. The amortization related to CLARCOR intangibles is presently estimated to be $129 million per year and incremental depreciation from CLARCOR is estimated to be $16 million per year.","Moving to slide number 14 with a detail on order rates by segments. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace segments are based on a 12-month rolling average.","Total orders grew a positive 8% as of June 30. Diversified Industrial North America orders increased to a year-over-year 10% change. Diversified Industrial International orders also increased year-over-year at 10% for the quarter. And Aerospace Systems orders were positive 1% year-over-year.","On slide number 15, we report cash flow from operating activities. Full-year cash flow from operating activities was $1.3 billion or 10.8% of sales. This compares to 10.7% of sales for the same period last year.","When adjusted for the $220 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, cash from operating activities was very strong at 12.7% of sales. This compares to 12.4% of sales for the same period last year, which is adjusted for $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in 2016.","In addition to the discretionary pension contribution, the significant uses of cash in 2017 were $4.2 billion for acquisitions, $265 million for the company's repurchase of common shares, $345 million for the payment of shareholder dividends, and $204 million or 1.7% of sales for capital expenditures.","On slide 16, we show a 10-year history of Parker's free cash flow conversion rate. For the full-year 2017, Parker generated free cash flow conversion of 134%. As reflected on this slide, our free cash flow conversion has exceeded 100% for each of the past 12 years.","The full-year earnings guidance for 2018 is outlined on slide number 17. Guidance is being provided on both an as-reported and an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $58 million and CLARCOR costs to achieve of $52 million for the full year.","Total sales are expected to increase in the range of plus-11.4% to plus-15% as compared to the prior year. Full-year organic growth at the midpoint is estimated to be plus-3.7%. Acquisitions in the guidance are expected to positively impact sales by 8.4%. Currency in the guidance is expected to have a positive 1% impact on sales.","We've calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended June 30, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for fiscal year 2018. For total Parker, as-reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 15.1% and 15.5%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 15.9% and 16.3%.","The full-year guidance at the midpoint below the line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest and other expense, is $500 million. The full-year tax rate for 2018 is projected to be 29%. We've not included any projected benefit for stock option expense tax credits. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full-year guidance is 135.6 million shares.","For the full year, the guidance range on an as-reported earnings per share basis is $7.88 to $8.58, or $8.23 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is $8.45 to $9.15, or $8.80 at the midpoint. This adjusted guidance excludes business realignment expenses of $58 million and savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $25 million in fiscal year 2018.","CLARCOR synergy costs to achieve are forecasted to be $52 million for the full-year 2018. The effect of these costs on earnings per share is $0.27 per share. As Tom mentioned in his remarks, we have pulled forward some of the planned CLARCOR integration activities. As a result, we expect to have incurred slightly over 80% of the total $90 million estimated cost by the end of fiscal year 2018. The remaining 20% is expected to be incurred evenly during fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020.","CLARCOR synergy savings are estimated to be $58 million by the end of fiscal year 2018, equating to approximately 40% of the announced $140 million total expected synergy savings. We estimate an additional savings of another 40% during fiscal year 2019 and the balance of 20% in fiscal year 2020.","We remain well on pace to realize the forecasted $140 million run rate synergy savings during fiscal year 2020. Savings from all business realignment and CLARCOR costs to achieve are fully reflected in both the as-reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges we've given. We would ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison.","Some additional key assumptions for full-year 2018 guidance at midpoint are: sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half; adjusted segment operating income is divided 45% first half, 55% second half; adjusted EPS first half, second half is divided 42%, 58%; and first quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.89 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.11 per share of projected business realignment expenses and $0.10 per share of CLARCOR costs to achieve.","On slide number 18, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of fiscal year 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $8.80 at the midpoint from prior fiscal 2017 earnings per share of $8.11. The increase of $1.54 per share is from stronger segment operating income and the $0.15 increase is from reduced other expense, primarily driven by lower pension expense in fiscal year 2018.","The largest decrease to earnings per share is from $0.38 of additional tax expense in 2018, primarily driven by not recognizing any stock option expense credit for 2018, compared to a $0.26 per share benefit in 2017. Other decreases to earnings per share include higher interest expense equating to $0.23, the non-recurrence of a $0.21 per share gain from the Autoline divestiture and higher corporate G&A expense of $0.18 per share.","Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisitions or divestitures that might close during fiscal 2018.","This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Cathy. I am very pleased with the progress we are making towards our key goals. We're just now approaching two years into the implementation of the new Win Strategy. Not only are we delivering immediate results, but we continue to see opportunities that will allow us to drive ongoing EPS growth for the next several years, driven by four key factors.","First, the new Win Strategy, which continues to drive better overall operating performance. Second, lower fixed costs as a result of our restructuring activities. Third, higher levels of organic sales growth. And lastly, the CLARCOR acquisition will yield incremental earnings and synergies.","I would especially like to thank our team members around the world for their dedicated efforts and the outstanding year that we had in FY 2017. Overall, Parker is in a very strong position as we celebrate 100 years and reflect on all the great things we have accomplished and our bright future ahead of us. All signs point to a strong 2018, in which we expect to generate record levels of sales and earnings.","So, at this time, James, we're ready to take question and you can go ahead and get us started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Morning, Andy.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was wondering if maybe Lee or Tom, could you run through what you're seeing by region?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Andy, this is Tom. Maybe what I'd like to do is kind of walk through what we're thinking for the guide, because...","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","...obviously what happened on the regions is influencing the guidance. And I know that'll be a question that everybody on the phone's going to have. So let me start with the top line and I'll include the market view on that as well, Andy.","So, first, the guidance is $13.6 billion; and round numbers, organic of $4 billion, currency of $1 billion, acquisitions of $8 billion. And so we use a lot of different inputs, economic models, discussions with our teams, end market activity, of course talking to our customers and distributors.","And the way that 4% organic looks, it's 5% organic growth for the first half total Parker. If you look at just Industrial for us, it's around 6% if you add North America and International together.","And then, for the second half of our year, what we used is our traditional first half, second half splits. So we have decades of experience of data that are first half, second half split, barring some macro event in the second half, is almost always 40%, 52%.","So you take a first half at 5% organic total for the company, 6% industrial to a 48%-52% split compared to prior year, and you get to $13.6 billion. What that gives you is that yields at 2.5% organic growth for the second half. Now, that gives some insight on margins, and I'll come back to the markets that influenced that organic look. Of course then the other part on our top line is putting a full-year CLACOR in there as well.","Now, on the margin side, I want to give you some color on legacy margins. So this is base Parker business without CLARCOR, and that's going from 16.1% in FY 2017 to 17.2%, so a 110-basis-point improvement on the legacy business. So, significant improvement based on the Win Strategy, and all the activities that we're doing driving those type of margins. What that infers is a legacy MROS of around 40%. All-in, total company's is about 18%. But remember, we've got quite a bit of headwind with the amortization and depreciation from CLARCOR that Cathy went through.","So, on the end market summary that makes up that organic look, there's really a tremendous amount, and this is very similar to what we're seeing in the fourth quarter as well. For us, there's a much longer list of positive end markets than there are neutral and negative. I'm just going to run through the positives. I'm just going to list them for the sake of brevity here.","Positives are aerospace, agriculture, construction, distribution, forestry, general industrial, heavy-duty truck, lawn and turf, mining, oil and gas, refrigeration and air-conditioning, semicon and telecom. So, as I said, it's a long list but that's a great thing to have a long list of positives.","On the neutral side is automotive, power gen, rail and life sciences, and really the only market that we see as negative year-over-year is marine. Now, one comment I want to make is context to overall that end market, that's how we are doing in the end markets. I'm not trying to make a comment about the whole end markets, kind of what it's doing. It's just our projection of Parker within that end market.","So, if I could just kind of wrap up and I'll let you have a follow-up, Andy. The way I look at this, this is record sales and EPS for next year. We've got legacy margins growing 110 basis points. We've got organic growth at almost 4% versus a global industrial production index of about 2%.","So, remember, we talked about with the new Win Strategy, we want to have 150 basis points higher than industrial production growth, and we're exceeding that. And then we're accelerating the CLARCOR costs to achieve and the synergy savings, which are going to help us from a EBITDA margin accretion as well.","So I view this as a very solid guide with good assumptions.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, Tom. And then a follow-up on that 17% to legacy margin. Does that imply \u2013 I think your fiscal 2020 goals were 17% for total company.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So you're already there in the guidance in fiscal 2018. Does that just mean you have to pull up CLARCOR to get to the 17% threshold or do you expect incremental legacy growth beyond that 17%?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Well, we're not done. So we definitely expect legacy margins to continue to improve. We originally set that target of 17%. Really our goal is to get that on an as-reported basis, and that was barring some large deal like we did with CLARCOR, which we're ecstatic over.","So, ideally, I want to get it to 17% on an as-reported basis and I'd like to get the whole company to 17% with CLARCOR in it. But, remember, if you add that amortization, depreciation in the CLARCOR business itself, it has 10 points of headwind round numbers with that amortization and depreciation.","So we see continued margin expansion. All the actions that we're going to do underneath what Cathy talked about with our realignment activities are on the base business and, of course, the costs to achieve are with the combined filtration business, and continue to make us faster and more cost-effective. So we see margin expansion in the future beyond the 17% obviously.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Hi, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. So, Tom, it seems like with CLARCOR you guys are finding a lot of ways to accelerate costs and realize synergies. I guess what's the scope for initiating more spend than the $90 million you have targeted?","And then also, specifically, if I'm doing the math right, if you're expecting $40 million in benefits next year, that alone should be like, what, roughly 275 basis points or so to CLARCOR margins next year. Is that right?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Well, I'm not going to calculate 2019's yet for you, but let me just talk about the integration itself. We are clearly finding opportunities to go faster. And I think it speaks to the great fit that CLARCOR and our filtration businesses are together, great product, people, channel, cultural fit, et cetera.","And as we put the combined team together, we see opportunities to pull in some of those actions from 2019 to 2018. So, kind of the themes that we're looking at early on the savings are focused on corporate overhead, which is a little more straightforward to go after, facility rationalization, manufacturing optimization there and logistics.","And as we move into year two, which will be 2019 and 2020, still a facility lift we'll get, and now you start to bring in more of the supply chain savings and then you bring in more of the productivity savings as you get a chance to put the Win Strategy and all of those things into those divisions.","So, that's why when Cathy went through it, of the $140 million, it's $40 million, $40 million, $20 million as far as the split between 2018, 2019 and 2020. So we are very optimistic and very encouraged by what we see to continue to work that and make terrific progress.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. No, that's helpful. And it sounds like the \u2013 I guess, maybe just my follow-up there is just on growth. And talking about the first half of 2018 in Industrial and the 6% growth, the order trends are pretending faster growth in that. And so I'm just curious, maybe you could tell us a little bit about the buildup to 6% and what you saw as kind of the trends progress throughout the quarter, just to get a sense for the conservatism of that number?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Well, the trends to the quarter were pretty consistent as far as what we saw, as far as orders. When we look at April through what we saw through July, we're pretty consistent. On the International, we showed 10%. We had Asia at mid-teens, and Latin America and Europe kind of in the mid- to upper-single digits. So we saw a good progress there.","Now part of what you've got to remember is, especially when you get to Q2, you get to tougher comps with International because that's what's started turning last year for us was Asia particularly turning quicker. So, if you look at the first half of 6% is a higher Q1 upper-single digits, but moving down to mid-single digits as you move through the second quarter.","And while we're pleased with these order rates, we recognize that it's hard to continue, especially as we start to move against these comps at double-digit order rates. So they will start to glide down and will move down to some, what I will call, more nominal growth rates, which will still be terrific for us. And you leverage that on top of what we're doing and had done already on the cost structure and continue to do, is going to mean nice earnings accretion for our shareholders.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Morning, Nathan.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'll follow-up to Joe there and start maybe looking at the second half. I think you said 2.5% organic growth in the second half. Leading indicators are still positive, global economy is improving. I would have thought that potentially the order rates are going to be better in the first half and maybe drive a better organic growth in the second half. Can you talk a little bit about your assumptions that go into that 2.5% organic growth in the second half?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Nathan, it's Tom. The assumptions are pretty straightforward, 48%-52%. Decades and decades of data that has showed that's our traditional split. I recognize I'm probably not smart enough to be able to forecast FY 2018 accurately, but I've got decades and decades of experience to tell us, maybe barring some unusual event, that's going to be 48%-52%. So, when you do that kind of math and you look at comparison to 2017, that's what yields that 2.5% growth.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Does that then imply that you're assuming a relatively neutral demand environment. You're not assuming any improvement in the global economy as we go forward, say, over the next six months getting towards the second half in order to sit in that 48%-52% split. If the global economy improved, then maybe it'd be a little heavier to the second half than usual?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","I feel pretty good about the global economy right now. We've already experienced, as you've seen in our orders the last couple of quarters, this is pretty good activity right now and we look forward to continue. And the splits kind of is what drove the second half. But we feel very good. I mean, if you look across the regions, this is a great environment for Parker right now.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then just one on the order rates. Do you have any indication of whether or not there's restocking going on at the OEMs or whether this is \u2013 you're pulling through real demand here?","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Nathan, it's Lee. On the distribution level, I would say there is some modest restock taking place. There's been a surge in activity and I have North America mostly in mind when I make that comment. And then on the OE side, I would say modest but it's pretty much pull-through demand, the best we could tell at this point in time.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Nathan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Morning, Steve.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","I know you sort of do your business reviews kind of at the end of the year and curious, as you think about your portfolio and the simplification stuff that you're doing, whether there might be an opportunity to sort of further streamline the portfolio, maybe do some divestitures or something along with the process of kind of reducing the overall complexity.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. Steve, this is Tom. When we look at the portfolio, we're pretty happy with it. Now, we'll continue to look at whether we're the best owner. I think it's always a good practice. And if you look at us the last five years, we have divested of about $350 million of business that we didn't think was core or were the best owner.","But when you look at how the company has been built, we are an integrated motion and control technology company, with 60% of our customers buying from two-thirds of the company. So, obviously, our customers are voting with their hard earned wallet. This package that Parker offers makes sense to solve problems for them.","So I don't see any big things for the portfolio on that end, but we'll continue to be good stewards and look at that. But, as I mentioned in my opening comments, there's a lot of activity going on with the whole simplification actions. I'll just tick through a couple real quickly.","So the division consolidations, when we started this as part of the Win Strategy, we were at 114 divisions, this is what are corporate Parker right now. And we're going to end the fiscal year at 90 divisions in FY 2018, so 24 divisions. But to get to 24 divisions going down, we have to combine 48 divisions, so 48 divisions out of the 114 divisions, and round numbers that's like 45% of the company has gone through some kind of a consolidation process, pretty impactful that much activity.","Then we used to have separate hydraulics and automation businesses. So those housed all of our motion technologies, so hydraulics had hydraulics obviously, automation had pneumatics and electromechanical. So we looked at those and said to ourselves, it makes more sense that they be underneath one leadership on operating structure, because our customers are looking for one motion technology solution. And let's do that together, let's put all of our motion technology together. So we combined those two business groups effective in June of this calendar year.","And then I mentioned the things that we're doing in Europe, Middle East and Africa, with a much more pan-European approach on customer service and our sales structure, which is really doing a lot to kind of reduce, I would call, the higher part of the organizational structure, still keep all of our key sales people or at least most of them, and have a much more efficient sales leadership structure in Europe. But I would still say that \u2013 so those are some pretty impactful structural things we're doing this fiscal year.","But the big nut is still the whole revenue complexity, 80%-20% and looking at all of our part numbers, our code activity, et cetera, and streamlining that and that will be day-by-day, hand-to-hand combat working through that over the next several years and that'll have a continued margin lift for us as well.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. That's helpful. Thanks. And maybe just to follow up then. As I look at the difference between North America and International, we're at roughly 400 basis points now in terms of the margin. And I guess I've been doing this long enough with you to remember when you actually had some parity there a few years back, and I'm curious as you look at the two businesses and the trajectory over the next couple of years, do you expect that to close and are there any sort of structural reasons that those margins should be that different?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Steve, it's Tom again. I don't know what time period you're talking about, but in my time they've never been the same. Maybe there is some data point historically, but they've always had a difference. And the difference really kind of stems to two things.","One, the mix of OEM and distribution is higher distribution in North America, hence why one of the key growth strategies of the company is to grow that international distribution in Europe, in Asia, and Latin America to drive that. We want to grow distribution around the world, including North America. We would like to change that mix in the rest of the world. So, that'd be one big one.","And then the SG&A is higher in Europe than it is in North America. Hence, when you hear these actions that we're talking about, especially this year, are all geared at trying to lower that SG&A and get these more in line.","Remember, the mix issue between OE and distribution, that won't be solved in a year. That's going to take \u2013 took us 60 years to build the network we got in North America. I'm not going to be happy to wait that long, but obviously we're going to stay at it very aggressively. But that will take time to change the mix part of things.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you, everyone. Good morning. Thank you and good morning.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Morning, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. So, CLARCOR, what was the organic growth in the quarter. And I guess you're saying your Industrial growth you expect next year is 6% first half, 2.5% second half. What about CLARCOR? Is that going to follow the same pattern?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, John. For the fourth quarter, we had relatively low-single-digit to almost flat growth for CLARCOR itself. Part of that is because they had a really strong March and so the fourth quarter just was even, we were okay with that.","Going into fiscal year 2018, we're expecting low-single-digit organic growth for CLARCOR for the year, a little heavier first half as their seasonality is strong in the first half compared to second half, as it is for Parker.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, a little bit below the corporate average, right, of 4%. So I think that's natural if you're kind of restructuring that business, you're going to create a little bit of disruption in terms of people moving around and stuff. Is that what that is or is there something else about the CLARCOR mix, their end markets or whatnot. And I'm assuming you're not baking any revenue synergies into those assumptions.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","You're correct that we don't have revenue synergies built-in. Keep in mind, the aftermarket business doesn't tend to have the volatility or the market-driven change like OE has. Aftermarket tends to be a little bit more steady and low-single-digit growth continuously, rather than the peaks and the valleys, and they're heavy aftermarket.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So you're saying there is actually no restructuring disruption.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Well, not to the sales, but to the margins...","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","We'll certainly be building inventory for the facility consolidations and things like that. So there'll be some disruption in the margin level, but not at the sales level.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You've given us some CLARCOR numbers, but of the $8.80 midpoint adjusted, what's the EPS attributable to CLARCOR?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","We're projecting a $0.20 accretion from CLARCOR in fiscal 2018.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just lastly on Aero. I think Eaton had kind of punk (50:17) Aero numbers too. Is military just dragging that in some manner right now, or is there something else going on that \u2013 I realize Aero doesn't get a lot of attention per se. But I'm just curious kind of what's going on, because aftermarket looks pretty good, OE not as great, I mean is it military or is there something else?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","John, it's Tom. Let me just walk you through the four major buckets for Aerospace. This is looking at our 2018 guide.","So, for commercial OEM, we've got it as flat. And it's a mixture of single-aisle continuing to grow, our A350 content is very high. So, that's incremental growth for us, being offset with other weakness in wide-body like Boeing 777, and then weakness in bizjet and helicopters, which is trying to find a bottom, but still not helping us. So those kind of net out to a neutral.","Military OE is flat. The good thing is in Aero's F-35, we have a great content, F-35 missiles and the KC-46 tanker program, offset with legacy fighters starting to wean off, F-15s and F-16s. Commercial MRO at plus-3%, driven by available seat miles in air traffic around the world. And the military MRO at plus-5%, and that's F-35 provisioning and just the aging fleet and the need to do some repair and replacement. So, that nets out to 1.6%, 1.5% growth in FY 2018.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just last, how did China do? China has been really strong for lots of multi companies. How did it do kind of not just on an absolute basis, but just the cadence of business in China, did it pick up? I know you've got your own Parker expansion initiatives. Just what was going on in China in the quarter?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Again, John, it's Tom. China continued to do very strong, mid-teen growth in the quarter and virtually every end market as you get go down the list, being positive. And the Asia team in general across \u2013 in addition to China, we've got every country in positive territory, every country growing. And Asia was the first region for us that turned and had a terrific year for us last year and it looks like it'll be another strong year as well.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. I guess just a follow-up, two questions. One, Tom, I know revenue synergies aren't assumed in your numbers for fiscal year 2018, but is there potential upside in terms of CLARCOR revenue synergies in 2018 or should we think about that as more of a 2019 opportunity, even though it's not in your numbers?","And then, second, just your assumption on margins, OE versus aftermarket, and just price material cost in 2018. Some of your customers are starting to talk about passing through price. I'm wondering if you're able to do that as well? Thanks.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Okay. So I'll start with...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Revenue synergies potential.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","...revenue synergies. Yeah. Thank you. I would say, we'll start to see maybe some in 2018, but you're right, I think this is more of a 2019 exposure for us. We continue to want to use that as a contingency and more of an upside for us. We always like to exceed expectations. So I think that's an opportunity for us. But, again, I would see that more in 2019 than 2018.","Aftermarket versus OE, the traditional difference for us has been about 10 points in margin, and that's still about the same. And I'll let Lee comment on the pricing environment.","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. Jamie, I would just say our assumptions for pricing and costs are pretty flat going into FY 2018. There are some dynamics changing, but I think from a planning standpoint we're just assuming pretty flat.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Tom, going back to Industrial. I'm wondering if there is a way that you can bucket for us maybe what percentage of your business you would guess is currently operating under what you would consider a mid-cycle or a normalized volume environment?","And related to this, when we're looking at your Industrial guidance for the back half of the year, the organic growth, what exactly does that imply for this bucket? Does it mean that we're getting close to normalized volumes or is there something else we need to think about?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","So, Mig, it's Tom. It's always hard for me to do this early, mid-, late-cycle. Basically I can't figure out how to do this. So I would just suggest you that what we're seeing, if I take distribution as a good example, so distribution is high-single-digit growth right now and it's going to glide into something that's more like mid-single as we go probably into Q2 and then somewhere in that 3% to 4% as we go into the second half.","So it's going to start through the course of the next nine months, you're going to glide into some more normalized growth from what we saw. So we had two quarters in a row of 6%. We're forecasting another 6% for the first half. Again, we talked about Industrial. So, that would be 12 months of 6% growth, which is pretty good. And second half starts to become some more normalized level.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Well, then one for you maybe Cathy. Looking at the below-the-line-items guidance, so as far as I can tell, your adjusted for Autoline for 2017, you're roughly guiding for $35 million worth of higher expenses in fiscal 2018, yet your interest is $80 million higher. I understand that pension helps you a little bit. I'm trying to figure out how incremental CLARCOR costs, maybe some additional comp, wouldn't push this number higher than $500 million?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Well, I'm glad that that's the way you're thinking. We've done our best to keep costs down. We've had a lot of initiatives to simplify our SG&A costs or fixed costs, including at corporate, and these are activities. But you did hit on the Autoline gain won't be there, correct.","We are continuing to make investments that will go through the corporate G&A for things like Internet of Things, growth. We're growing our additive manufacturing and we're looking into investments into robotics. So we are continuing to make investments that will go through the corporate G&A line.","You hit on incentive compensation, we have some incentive comp plans that are market-based and they will see a little bit higher expense in 2018.","Interest expense, you had a high number there. I have $42 million incremental interest expense year-over-year. And you're right, pensions will be dropping. We saw some nice gains in our pension assets in fiscal 2017 that will benefit our expense line in 2018. And yeah, just some other puts and takes in smaller amounts.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Morning, Joel.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, guys. How's it going?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Good.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","A simple one and then a little \u2013 not really that detail. Anyway, the margins in the Aerospace division, is this kind of a new run rate? Is all the R&D still abating? And we can stay at these kind of levels and build on that, or is it just more of the mix in this quarter that kind of jumped it up so high?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","It's more of the mix, Joel. They saw some very heavy aftermarket mix in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter volume for the aftermarket does tend to be our highest quarter. So the mix was good.","Just because of the timing of some of the development costs, I don't know if you remember, in Q3, our development costs were up a bit. Those came out of Q4 kind of run rate. So, Q4, just for the quarter, had lower levels of development costs. But we expect development costs to continue to be about 7.5% of sales going forward. And margins in the fourth quarter were kind of a one-time anomaly and they will return back to where we were seeing them during most of the year.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks. And I wonder if, Lee, maybe, you're the best guy for this, if you could give us a couple of examples of, like, the revenue complexity, like, what are the things you're working on, and a couple of the \u2013 like, maybe the targets for 2018. Just give us maybe some guidepost that we can watch out for to stay updated on. Thank you.","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Well, that's a big topic, Joel. I don't know if I could it justice.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Or just a summary of a couple of topical things.","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. We've got a process inside our company we call Parker Operating Protocol, and it really gives us segmentation across our product line base. As you know, we've been building some of these products for a long time, there's a long tail. And it gives us an opportunity to reduce the complexity of that long tail by either moving into standard products or finding alternative methods to take advantage of that.","So I think what you can expect to see is, say, well, how can you measure this, you can expect to see margin expansion as we go forward in this and, quite frankly, higher opportunities as we focus on core opportunities and not be distracted by peripheral opportunities, if that makes sense.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess my question would be, if you're pulling forward the synergies costs for CLARCOR into 2018 from 2019, why aren't you pulling forward the savings?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Ann, this is Tom. When you pull forward the costs, a lot of those costs might be hitting in the final quarter of 2018. So we won't be able to see those savings. I mean, that's the quick answer.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So it's just on the margin pulling it in from one to the other.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Right.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Actually I think that was part of it. I think most of my other questions got answered along the way. So I'll leave it there and follow up offline. Thank you.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Ann. At this point, we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next and final question is from David Raso with Evercore. Your line is open.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Hi. Thanks for the extra time. First question, cadence of the orders throughout the quarter, and obviously any color on July, now that July is completely done. That would be greatly appreciated.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","David, it's Tom. Orders were pretty consistent, didn't see a lot of variation, which was good, consistently at a pretty high level throughout the quarter and July was indicative of what we reflected in the guide. So, nothing unusual in July.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","And then also thinking about the buckets of orders. I mean you have out of your old school investors more of a machinery, big mobile growth. Others thinking maybe factory floor CapEx, stationary type stuff comes in next. And then you have obviously the consumer life sciences type bucket that's little more multi-industrial, decides of course your internal improvement story.","I know you have a lot of end markets. But can you give me a little color on \u2013 if you want to even talk about even the actual quarter, not even going forward, I assume mobile is the biggest growth. What are you seeing in the factory, stationary and then some of the even non-Industrial, so to speak, the consumer and life sciences. Just for folks who get nervous about the strength of mobile second derivative slowdowns, obviously inevitable over the next few quarters. Some of those other end markets, what are you seeing from them?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","So David, it's Tom. I would just in round numbers characterize it. So distribution was high-single digits, mobile high-single digits as well, Industrial kind of in that 3% to 4% range, and then when you blend the whole things that's how you get to 6% organic growth that we had in the quarter.","And I think that's kind of to be expected in distribution right now, and high single digits I think has been influenced by some of the recovery in oil and gas, and some of the general Industrial supply chain, that supports all that. We fully expect that to kind of glide over the next couple of quarters down to a more nominal growth level.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","It's interesting mobile is not double-digit. I guess for diversity of your end markets, that's encouraging to hear, it's not just mobile. But can you help me a little bit on factory floor and stationary then? What are you actually seeing, and is it accelerating, is it big one-off-type projects? Just for a little better understanding, trying to look beyond the mobile markets.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Well, the Industrial, which would be the stationary stuff, is in that approximate 4% level.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","But I'm just saying what are you seeing there, what is driving that? Is that any particular geographies or big projects? Just trying to understand how much we can assume. Is that something still on the come, so to speak, it can stay at this level or even accelerate? Or as mobile slows, expect stationary factory to, at best, stay kind of where it is on growth?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","I think stationary is going to be pretty consistent from what I've seen so far. Remember, our stationery includes buckets that are high \u2013 it is a bit of a mixture, you've got telecom and semicon that are very high, you've got power gen that's soft right now, life science soft, but we view that it'd go on to more neutral for FY 2018. So it's a mixture of things that make up, that's the way we classify Industrial.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","That's helpful. Thank you for the extra time. I appreciate it.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Okay. Thanks, David. Okay. This concludes our Q&A and our earnings call for today. Thank you everybody for joining us. Robin and Ryan will be available throughout today to take your calls should you have further questions. Thanks everybody. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you.

Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would like to [indiscernible] Ms. Cathy Suever. You may begin ma'am.","Cathy Suever","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's second quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks. Today's presentation slides, together with the audio web cast replay, will be accessible on the company's investor information web site at phstock.com for one year following today's call.","On slide number 2, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement, addressing forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and are also posted on Parker's web site at phstock.com.","Today's agenda appears on slide number 3. To begin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, will provide highlights for the second quarter. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's second quarter performance, together with the guidance for the full year fiscal 2018. Tom will then provide a few summary comments and we'll open the call for a question-and-answer session.","Please refer now to slide number 4, as Tom will get us started with the highlights.","Tom Williams","So thank you Cathy and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining the call and of course your interest in Parker. So let me just make a few general comments and I will get into the quarter specifically. So a top focus of the company continues to be safety and the engagement of our people. These are obviously interconnected, as we improve safety for all of our team members and we have higher levels of engagement across the company, who are going to continue to drive higher and higher operating improvements.","When you look at orders for the quarter, very strong momentum across a wide range of markets and geographies, very excited about that. Organic growth was very strong, much faster than industrial production growth, and this is our fourth quarter in a row that we exceeded industrial production growth. The Win Strategy initiatives, when you look at the improvements in growth and operating margins continue to evolve, and we really feel we have got a bright future ahead of us.","If you look at the progress over the last few years, remarkable progress. But I would just characterize, that we are still early days of implementing the Win Strategy. So my thanks to everybody around the world, all the Parker team members for all your hard work and your efforts and looking forward to a bright future.","So let's get into the quarter, it was a solid quarter and really great first half of the fiscal year, and I will go through a couple of key stats. Safety performance, 22% reduction in recordable injuries, which is very nice. Sales was an all time record for the second quarter, up 26%. Organic growth was approximately a 10% increase, significantly outpacing industrial production growth, and order entry rates increased 13%, making it the highest order entry rates that we have seen since Q4 of FY 2011.","So a couple of comments on margins, because it is difficult to look at margins year-over-year, as the prior period did not have CLARCOR net, this period has CLARCOR net. So when you look at adjusted segment operating margins, they continue to improve, we came in at 14.9%. But if you were to add back the incremental depreciation and amortization from the CLARCOR acquisition, you would add 90 basis points back to that number, so what comes in to 15.8% segment operating margins, related to true underlying operating margins as a company, and that represents 110 basis point improvement versus prior year.","Another way to look at it, as you look at EBITDA margins for the quarter came in at 16.3%, again, a 110 basis point improvement, if you also adjust out for the divestiture gain that we had in last year's second quarter. When you look at adjusted EPS, it increased 26%; again, excluding the divestiture gain that we had last year and the new tax legislation was a $225 million net one time negative adjustment, Cathy will go through that in more detail in her comments.","So we look at cash and capital deployment, our goal is to be great generators and deployers of cash. You have heard me talk about that before, it's really an overarching team of the company, and we remain on track to deliver significant cash flow over the next several years.","When you look at the new U.S. tax reform; clearly in the quarter, it was a negative one-time adjustment. However, many long term positives for us to create some more competitive environment, really levels of playing field with our foreign competitors. This creates a nice share gain opportunity for us. It's going to encourage our customers' investment decisions, because the way CapEx is treated in the new tax law. It's clear we are going to encourage CapEx and in turn, will drive through more [indiscernible] content as part of that. And then there is greater flexibility and we are building within cash around the world, which is a big advantage for shareholders.","So when you think about deployment priorities, they really remain the same. However, we have greater flexibility obviously. So first on the list is continuing our history of increasing annual dividends paid. So maybe, that will clarify why that is so important to us. So obviously, our longstanding record is important; we don't want to break that. But really speaks to our ability over the cycle to consistently generate cash, which emphasizes why we are such a great long term investment for shareholders. Our target on dividends is 30% on net income over a rolling five year period of time, so obviously as our net income grows, which it will, our dividends will grow in corresponding fashion.","Second priority is CapEx for organic growth, the most efficient way to deploy capital back on behalf of shareholders, so that will be on the top of the list. The beauty of our business model and our cash flow generation, when you take those first two priorities and you complete them, we have roughly half of our cash total available to deploy. So here in the near term, we are going to reduce leverage with the CLARCOR deal. We are also going to continue our 10b51 share repurchases. But then as the debt reduces, we are going to revaluate acquisitions and discretionary share repurchases, with the goal always being that we are going to deploy capital in the best long term fashion that we can, on behalf of our shareholders. I would just remind people that we utilized overseas cash to help fund CLARCOR, so we put most of that overseas cash to work already.","So I am going to talk about the outlook; and may be just start with some headlines with the new guidance when I look at it from a full year. Now Safety, it's hard for me to predict a full year there, but injuries down 22%, obviously want to continue that trend. Sales up 17% versus prior year. Adjusted EPS up 21% versus prior and adjusted EBITDA margins forecasted to be 17.6% for the full year versus 16.3% last year, so that's a 130 basis points improvement, again excluding the divestiture gain we had last year.","Now specifically regarding EPS, we are increasing EPS, adjusted EPS by $0.45 at the midpoint. So our new range is $9.65 to $10.05, reflects the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate, our year-to-date results, regarding realignment in CLARCOR costs achieved, they are going to be at the same levels that we previously anticipated.","So now going forward, we are going to continue to drive the Win Strategy, and I am going to just make a couple of comments about each of the goals here briefly. But engage people, still our first goal, it's all about creating that cornership [ph] culture, and I would remind people that being an owner, people think differently when they think and act like and owner, and it creates a level of intimacy and accountability with your respective area of responsibility that drives results, and I would characterize our engagement process across the company as being the water [ph] that's going to lift performance up for the whole company.","Second goal is premier customer experience, and we are moving from a service mindset to an experience mindset, and we are doing that by rolling out a new metric like [indiscernible] recommend, and that's now fully deployed and we are getting great customer feedback from that and it gives us tremendous opportunity to improve. And remember, the whole purpose behind the great experience is that it leads to share gain, leads to faster growth.","Third goal, profitable growth, and we have a number of initiatives which I won't go through here. All around driving growth fast than the market. And then financial performance, that's what I would call affectionately, the big four strategic initiatives, that's simplification, lean enterprise, strategic supply chain, and value pricing, and we see tremendous upside really in all four of those categories.","Now we are really looking forward to seeing everybody for our Investor Relations day on March 7, so let me just give you a quick commercial on what the high level agenda is going to be. We are going to give you a progress report on the new Win Strategy. We are going to give you an update on our five year targets. We will give you a much more detailed review on the CLARCOR synergies, and we just characterize that the integration is going very well or what's happening, we will give you more color on that on IR day. And then we are going to give you presentations from three of our six operating groups, aerospace, engineering materials and filtration. First time we have given that level of transparency and detail, so I think you will enjoy that, we look forward to sharing that with you.","So in summary, we are looking forward to a record year, and a continuous improvement with the Win Strategy.","So with that, I am going to hand it back to Cathy for more details on the quarter.","Cathy Suever","Okay, thanks Tom. I will now refer you to slide number 5, and begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $2.15 compared to $1.91 for the same quarter a year ago. When comparing to second quarter fiscal 2017 results, please recall that, last year included a $45 million or $0.21 per share gain on the sale of our product line, which was not adjusted out.","Excluding this product line gain, adjusted earnings per share increased 26% from the same quarter last year. The respective adjustments for both years are as follows; fiscal year 2018, second quarter operating income adjustments, include business realignment expenses of $0.07 and CLARCOR cost to achieve of $0.07. This compares to $0.04 for business realignment expenses in the second quarter in fiscal year 2017. Other expense in fiscal year 2018 has been adjusted to exclude a net gain of $0.05, which includes a gain from the sale of assets, offset by the write-down of an investment. Prior year other expense was adjusted for $0.09 of acquisition related expenses. Last but not least, fiscal year second quarter 2018 has been adjusted for the net one time impact from U.S. tax reform of $225 million or $1.65. I will discuss this adjustment in more detail on slide 13.","If you move now to slide number 6, you will find a significant component of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.91 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to $2.15 for the second quarter of this year. The most significant increase came from higher adjusted segment operating income of $0.62, attributable to earnings on meaningful organic growth, income from acquisitions and increased margins, as a result of our new Win Strategy initiative. I'd like to point out that this $0.62 improvement is net of incremental depreciation and amortization expense of $0.16 taken on with the CLARCOR acquisition.","The lower effective income tax rate, equated to a year-over-year increase in earnings per share of $0.07. Adjusted earnings per share was reduced by $0.31 on the other expense line, primarily due to the non-recurring $0.21 per share gain from the sale of a product line included in the prior year. Higher interest expense was an $0.11 drag, together with slightly higher corporate G&A and share count, equating to a $0.03 per share reduction.","Moving to slide 7, you will find total Parker's sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter. Total company organic sales in the second quarter increased year-over-year by 9.5%. There was a 13.3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions, while currency, positively impacted the quarter by 3.4%. Total segment operating margin on an adjusted basis improved to 14.9% versus 14.7% for the same quarter last year. I'd like to remind you, that the fiscal 2018 operating margins include incremental depreciation and amortization from the CLARCOR acquisition. Without this incremental expense, margins would have improved 110 basis points. This margin improvement reflects the benefits of higher volume, combined with the positive impacts from our Win Strategy initiatives.","Moving to slide number 8, I will discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the second quarter, North American organic sales increased by 12.7% compared to last year. Acquisitions contributed 26.3% to sales, while currency also positively impacted the quarter. Operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis was 15.1% of sales versus 16.6% in the prior year. Current year includes 160 basis points of CLARCOR related incremental depreciation and amortization expense. Without this, margins improved 110 basis points.","I will continue with the Diversified Industrial International segment on slide number 9. Organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment increased by 10.7%. Acquisitions positively impacted sales by 6%, while currency, positively impacted the quarter by 8.1%. Operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis was 14.2% of sales versus 13.1% in the prior year. This includes 40 basis points of Parker related incremental depreciation and amortization expense.","I will now move to slide number 10, to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 0.8% for the second quarter. Strengths in both commercial and military aftermarket, more than offset weakness in OEM activity during the quarter. Operating margin for the second quarter adjusted for realignment costs saw 16% of sales versus 13.5% in the prior year, reflecting the impact of a favorable aftermarket sales mix and lower development costs during the quarter.","Moving to slide 11, we show the details of order rates by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12 month rolling average.","Total orders continue to be strong, improving to a positive 13% for the quarter end. This year-over-year improvement is made up of 15% from Diversified Industrial North American orders, 13% from Diversified Industrial International Orders and 8% from Aerospace Systems Orders.","On slide 12, we report cash flow from operating activities. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $460 million or 6.8% of sales, compared to 7.5% of sales for the same period last year or 11.5% last year adjusted for a $220 million discretionary pension contribution.","The significant capital allocations year-to-date have been $176 million for the payment of shareholder dividends, $145 million or 2.2% of sales for capital expenditures and $100 million for the company's 10b51 repurchases of common shares.","On slide 13, I will now take a moment to discuss the impact of U.S. tax reform. In the second quarter, we incurred a net $225 million charge, that includes a $287 million one-time charge for the deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, offset by a favorable $62 million adjustment to our net deferred tax liabilities to the new 21% federal rate. I need to mention, that these onetime adjustments are our best estimates at this time, however the amounts may change, as we continue to analyze the impact of tax reforms.","Due to our June 30 fiscal year, our statutory U.S. tax rate for fiscal year 2018 is blended at a 35% rate for the first half of the year, and a 21% rate for the second half of the year, which results in a 28% full year U.S. statutory rate. This reduced rate will have a favorable impact on cash for fiscal year 2018. As for the long term implications, the U.S. tax reform will result not only in increased net income, but we can benefit from improved mobility of our non-U.S. cash.","The payments of the deemed repatriation charge will commence in fiscal year 2019, where it will be a use of cash over eight years with significant balloon payments from the last three years. Based on our initial analysis, we expect our long term effective tax rate to be approximately 23% beginning in fiscal year 2019. Fiscal year 2018 is still a blended rate.","The full year earnings guidance for full year 2018 is outlined on slide number 14. Guidance is being provided on both an as reported and adjusted basis. Total sales increases are expected to be in the range of 15.3% to 18.9% as compared to the prior year. Anticipated full year organic growth at the midpoint is 6.5%, which is a 100 basis points higher than our previous guidance. Acquisitions in the guidance are affected to positively impact sales by 8.1% and currency is expected to have a positive 2.5% impact on sales.","We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we have held those rates steady, as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2018.","For total Parker, as reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 15.3% and 15.7%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 16.1% and 16.5%. Full year tax rate is now projected to be 25%, down from our previous guidance of 28%.","For the full year, the guidance range on an as-reported earnings per share basis is now $7.38 to $7.78 or $7.58 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is now $9.65 to $10.05 or $9.85 at the midpoint.","In addition to the full year net loss of $5 million resulting from the combined gain on sale and writedown of assets and the net provisional tax charge of $225 million, this guidance on an adjusted basis, excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $58 million for the full year fiscal 2018. Savings from business realignment initiatives are projected to be $25 million.","In addition, guidance on an adjusted basis excludes $52 million of CLARCOR cost to achieve expenses. CLARCOR synergy savings are estimated to be $58 million in fiscal year 2018. We continue to remain on pace to realize the forecasted $140 million run rate synergy savings for CLARCOR by fiscal year 2020. Savings from all business realignment and CLARCOR costs to achieve, as well as anticipated full year favorable effects from U.S. tax reform, are fully reflected in the as reported and the adjusted guidance ranges. We ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison.","Some additional key assumptions for full year 2018 guidance at the midpoint are; sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 45% first half, 55% second half. Adjusted earnings per share, first half second half is divided 45%, 55%. Third quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $2.59 at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.08 of projected business realignment expenses and $0.09 of projected CLARCOR costs to achieve.","On slide 15, you will find a reconciliation of the major components of fiscal year 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $9.85 at the midpoint compared to the prior guidance of $9.40 per share. Increases include $0.14 from higher segment operating income, $0.41 from a lower effective tax rate, and $0.01 from lower projected corporate G&A. Offsetting these increases is an $0.08 per share decrease from higher forecasted interest and other expense, and $0.03 per share from increased fully diluted share count. Please remember, that the forecast includes any acquisitions or divestitures that might close during the remainder of fiscal 2018.","This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I will turn the call back to you for your summary comments.","Tom Williams","Thank you, Cathy. So we are pleased with the strong first half of the year that we have had. A combination of our sales growth, the lower cost structure that we have built, integration of CLARCOR and execution of the Win Strategy, that combination is projecting for us to have the best fiscal year that we have ever had in the history of the company, with an all time sales record. So my thanks to everybody around the world Parker team for all your hard work and efforts into creating that.","So at this point, let me hand it back to Kevin. We will start the Q&A part of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning everyone.","Cathy Suever","Good morning Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Can you maybe -- let's just touch on the North American margins for a second. Clearly, it's going to be the pretty big focal point today. And you guys have talked a little bit about the impact from the CLARCOR and dilutive impact that's having to your margins. But did that number change at all on a quarter-by-quarter basis, because the margins were down a little bit more this quarter than they were in the prior quarter? And then my follow on there is, can we maybe just talk a little bit more about like the other potential puts and takes to margins and what impacted them this quarter?","Tom Williams","Okay, so Joe, this is Tom. Maybe to help everybody, I am going to run through the margins and give you back the incremental D&A, depreciation and amortization, when we have no CLARCOR deal. Cathy did that and I am going to summarize it again just so you have it. So North America, if you add that back, the 160 basis points of incremental depreciation and amortization, North America's operating margin for the quarter would have been 16.7%. International, you add back 40 basis points, international's margins would have been 14.6%. Aerospace, obviously not impacted, 16.0%. Total Parker, you add back 90 basis points, 15.8%.","So when you look at it all in, North America still was higher by 10 basis points versus prior year. There are some challenges that we have faced in the quarter and faced a little bit when you just look at the mix of order entry and sales that we have. When you look at our -- we are tickled pink with our sales growth.","But then, the mobile part of the sales growth is drawing at a faster clip than industrial and distribution. So we have got mobile growth at approximately 20% for the quarter, Industrial, high single digits, and distribution in the low teens. So that mix is putting a little bit of margin headwind for us, and we had a number of plant closures, and when you look at our restructuring; restructuring dollars are not always at equal level of complexity. You know, if you close down a headquarters, like when we closed down Franklin, it's a little more straightforward as -- as the headquarters for CLARCOR, for those of you who aren't familiar. It's a little more straightforward, as far as how you incur those costs.","We are right now in the heat of the restructuring for CLARCOR, in particular, around the manufacturing footprint consolidations. So to give you some color in it, so plant closures last year, 23 plant closures for the total company. This year, 39. So that level of plant closures, and there is inefficiencies that you are impacted by both ends of that equation. So plant A that's getting closed down, obviously has some impact when you announce it. Things don't work quite as well, if you have announced the plant closure. And then plant B, is it's coming up to speed in efficiencies that yields line rates, etcetera, just take a little bit of time to come up.","So we have incurred all that and the margins still grew 10 basis points. Again, making it apples-to-apples the depreciation and amortization. But that gives you some color as to some of the dynamics that we are feeling from a margin standpoint.","Joe Ritchie","That's helpful Tom. I guess maybe the follow-on there is, is this quarter then the trough from -- that we should expect from like -- from an inefficiency perspective, from the plant closure perspective, or is this something that could potentially be a headwind to North America margins for the next couple of quarters?","Tom Williams","Well it's in our guide, North American margins for the full year at 17.2% for the full year, which is a pretty nice performance, with all of this. But yes, because we are right now in the thrills of this, we experienced it this quarter, we probably are going to see for the next two quarters. Remember, this is a three year synergy plan that we were laying out. The bulk of it, the heavy lifting from a footprint standpoint is this last quarter we just experienced really the next six months. But even with all that, we have got margins at very nice levels.","EBITDA, which is a nice way to look at it, because it takes out the depreciation and amortization, growing to 17.6% versus 16.3% last year. I guess, I would just remind everybody, when we announced the deal, December 1 of 2016, not that I remember that date [indiscernible], that's an important date for the history of the company. We announce -- we were to tackle a 300 basis point EBITDA margin improvement. And at that time when we made the announcement, we were sitting at 14.7% EBITDA margin. So we have almost accomplished that 290 basis points. Remember we told you 300 bps was a five year look in the combined company. So we have done it basically in two years almost.","So I am very proud of what we have done from a margin standpoint. We have a few of those challenges that I just mentioned, but we are putting up some pretty nice numbers in the further heat [ph] of the CLARCOR synergy plan.","Joe Ritchie","That's helpful. If I could maybe sneak in one more, just on -- again, just the kind of end of the calendar year. We have been hearing from some of our companies that because organic growth surprised to the upside and clearly, like the growth in North America was extremely strong, that there were higher rebates as well to distributors that flushed out in the fourth quarter -- least accounted the fourth quarter. Did you guys experience any of that, just given 50% of your business sells through distribution?","Lee Banks","This is Lee. You know, we did have great sales during the quarter and order entry continues to accelerate. But there is nothing meaningful regarding rebates or anything that's factored in to what you have seen.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, got it. Thanks guys. I will get back in queue.","Cathy Suever","Thanks Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","Hi. Good morning.","Cathy Suever","Good morning Ann.","Ann Duignan","[Indiscernible] my question has been answered, it would have been on the North American margins. So the color was top [indiscernible] at least. Maybe switching gears a little bit to Aerospace, can you talk about your mix of business today, and where do you see that going? If I recall, you are pretty strong than the 747, pretty strong than the A380, I mean programs that might be ending, and also very strong with Embraer and whether your relationship with Embraer would change, if Boeing were to acquire Embraer. So just little bit of background on the Aerospace business please?","Cathy Suever","Ann, I will start out. In the quarter, we had an unusually strong mix of aftermarket, both commercial and military. And that came with higher margins, since our aftermarket typically has higher margins, but it was also a very favorable mix of aftermarket. It was a little unusual in the quarter, however in the third quarter, we see our strongest aftermarket activity. So third quarter should be a similar mix, but it's not necessarily a full year mix that we would normally see.","Yeah, we have platforms that are slowing down. Wide body, we see a lot of slowness in the market. But keep in mind, that we are very diverse in our portfolio, and there are also new programs coming on. So as some of them are shutting down or slowing down, we are also seeing growth in like the A350 and in platforms like the Global 5000. So I think our portfolio mix helps balance the impact that you are describing, and you won't see a significant impact.","Ann Duignan","Okay. So you are suggesting that fiscal Q3 should be strong margins and then taper off? Is that what I should read in the near term?","Cathy Suever","The Q3 tends to be our strongest quarter for aftermarket. It's when the OEs, the large airlines are typically having the planes brought in for a repair. So three will be good, yes.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I will leave it there and get back in queue. Thank you.","Cathy Suever","All right. Thanks Ann.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO.","Joel Tiss","Hey guys, how is it going?","Cathy Suever","Hi Joel.","Joel Tiss","I will just glue both of my questions together. I just wonder if, maybe Tom or whoever, if you could talk a little bit about -- it seems like the order strength is a lot higher than what you are hinting at earlier in the year for your second half? I think your implied order growth was pretty close to flat, and I just wondered why more of that? Is there anything happening that would undercut your confidence on the sustainability of that? And second if Lee could just kind of run around the world and give us some of the highlights of the different businesses? Thank you.","Tom Williams","Okay, Joel. I will start off -- this is Tom, and I will hand it to Lee in a second here. On the order entry, I think in our sales forecast; so we revised our guidance, basically up 100 basis points on organic from 5.5 to 6.5, kept acquisitions, kept currency, same assumptions. So the new guide, up 100 bps.","In the second half in particular, we have raised it from the previous guide, it was 3.7% to 5.0%. So that's what we are forecasting for the second half of the year. And I would just remind everybody, we don't feel anything weakening from a macro standpoint, Lee will cover that momentarily. We feel good about the macro markets and all that. Our sales numbers sort of based on the comps we have versus the prior year last year, second half of FY 2017 plus 6% organic growth. So our plus 5% forecast is building on top of the plus 6%. So that's just the comparable math -- the mix of the numbers. We feel good about the macro conditions.","I will let Lee kind of take you through the world.","Lee Banks","Joel, it's Lee. So I am not going to comment on Aerospace. I think Cathy did a great job on that. I would just say industrially, as you look through all our end markets, it's really hard to find any significant markets did not continue to show positive year-over-year order entry growth during the quarter. And some of these markets fall a long way, especially when it comes to natural resource end markets. And they continue to show growth during the quarter. We saw strong growth in construction equipment, mining, oil and gas, which is mostly land based, almost all land based, frankly. And then other markets like semiconductor, microelectronics, heavy duty truck and distribution was strong.","Land based oil and gas, if I think about the Americas, the amount of active rigs continue to expand, and I think what's really positive is, we are starting to see quote activity with some customers that we haven't seen much in the past. So they are doing more than just refurbishing what's in the field.","We also saw a great continued rebound from our distributor partners around the world. Almost every region, double digit order entry, which is really nice, and they continue to be very optimistic. The only notable market that we see contraction in and it has been significant has been large frame power jet. I mean, that has gotten a lot of press and it's real, so that has had a negative impact.","And just commenting on the regions, I won't take you through all the markets. But North America continue to be very encouraged by all the increasing end market activity. It just seems that it's somewhat firing on all cylinders. I think there is some worry about maybe in-plant automotive activity, but we haven't seen much dampening on that yet, but we are keeping an eye on that.","Throughout EMEA, continued strong order entry growth, this would be the second year, we are forecasting organic growth, in which there was a long trough there, we didn't see that. And then in Asia, Japan, Korea, China continue all to be very strong, Southeast Asia is really good, so I am encouraged by what's happening there. And then just lastly on Latin America, it seems that there is some good positive momentum in Brazil, despite all the politics. So we are hopeful, there continues the turnaround.","So I would just say, we are really happy with what's happening in the Embraer, it's both domestically and internationally, and I think in some cases, we are pretty early stages, because of how far some of those industries have fallen.","Joel Tiss","That's really super. Thank you.","Tom Williams","Thank you.","Cathy Suever","Thanks Joel.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Cathy Suever","Hi John.","John Inch","Cathy, hi. The tax rate was a little lower in the second quarter. I don't think you talked about it. What was that about?","Cathy Suever","Sure. So let me just reiterate for the year. We expect it to be 25%. We are at a 28% blended rate for U.S. federal. In December, we adjusted everything to that new blended rate. So as part of that, you do a catch-up of what you had booked provisionally in the first quarter, and you catch up the year for the six months to your assumed effective rate for the full year. So you get a little bit of a double benefit in December from the lower tax rate for the year.","John Inch","So even though tax -- okay. So I am just trying to understand, tax reform though is a calendarized impact. You are saying, this is actually a function of tax reform, is that what you are saying?","Cathy Suever","Yeah, correct. It was effective January 1, but for us, it become half effective. So what they require us to do, is take the number of days that we would be at a 35% rate, and the number of days we'd be at a 21% rate, and that come to a 28% effective rate for our full fiscal year.","John Inch","Okay, that makes more sense. I got it. Thank you. What about the mix of orders? Tom, you talked about stronger OE and that's -- you talked about the ramp down I guess, in terms of the plants, but the stronger OE is sort of pricing [ph] margins a little bit to the downside. Is that embedded in the mix of orders that you are seeing, so we would expect that kind of OE mix to still prevail over the coming quarters?","Tom Williams","John, it's Tom. Yes, it would and that's what factored into our guidance, part of why we left margins, the same as our prior guide, because of that. But over time, that's going to start to stabilize. And those things, the high spike and mobile activities is going to start to stabilize at a lower number, and I think this imbalance, I guess, [indiscernible] order entry, shift a little bit more to mobile, become more in check, as we go throughout the next several quarters.","John Inch","Right. So mobile is clearly accelerating and I think you could make that claim globally. What's happening with respect to distribution then, at the high single digit? I think you called out that run rate, is that actually accelerating at a lesser cadence, or is it sort of steady?","Tom Williams","I wouldn't characterize. I am going to let Lee chime in -- as in, add. Distributions in the low teens is what it's at. But I would characterize it as stable. High levels of growth [ph] stable, and it will glide down into something in the mid-single digits in the second half, mainly just because of comps in the prior year.","John Inch","CLARCOR also, I think we took your guide from what $0.20 to $0.33, was that all tax? Or is the business actually getting better?","Cathy Suever","I am sorry, I didn't quite understand what you are asking John?","John Inch","The EPS accretion from CLARCOR. I calculated, it looks like it is about $0.33 for fiscal 2018, and I thought you had said it was going to be about $0.20. Maybe that's not true. I am just wondering, are you expecting CLARCOR accretion benefits to improve from what you had last said, I think last year, right?","Cathy Suever","Yeah John. We are still at about a $0.20 accretion for CLARCOR for fiscal 2018.","John Inch","Fiscal 2018? Okay.","Cathy Suever","Yeah.","John Inch","Last I guess, just wanted to ask Tom just a strategic question. Is there an opportunity to maybe migrate? If you look at the -- your sort of a distribution of your customers, maybe some of your smaller ones at the tail, is there an opportunity to migrate those in your OE bucket, more to the distribution side to perhaps free up some of your own overhead that other operating costs, you know what I mean to, try and drive further Parker-Hannifin productivity over time?","Tom Williams","Clearly John, you hit the nail on the head. What you are referring to is really part of our simplification program, and the element in particular, as you talked about, was the revenue complexity side of things, that 80-20 will look at all of our revenue and our products. And clearly, when we look at that tail, that's one of the areas we are looking at, and we moved some of that product to distribution, so distributors would do a better job of servicing the customers in that regard, could we look at self-service there, can we look at alternative part numbers that might be higher running part numbers that runs at a plant. So there's a variety of tools that we are looking at, but yes, you nailed one of the things we are looking at.","John Inch","And is that -- I am assuming like, where are you at in terms of beginning to implement that? Is this still very preliminary, or have you actually started? Just [indiscernible], obviously you have done a great job with respect to the margin expansion that you called out, so we are all trying to think about the next level, and we can obviously compare Parker versus ITW or other companies with higher margins. So the thought process is really around just various levers you may be able to pull over time, to help drive your overall profitability higher from here?","Tom Williams","Yeah, we see more opportunity obviously, and that's something we will go into more detail at IR Day. But when I think about simplification, lean, strategic supply chain, value pricing, all those things underneath the financial performance initiatives, I would characterize them as all having lots of upside. The revenue complexity piece that we just were talking about, the first inning, clearly the first inning. So lots of upside there.","John Inch","Got it. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Cathy Suever","Thanks John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Hi guys. Good morning still I guess.","Cathy Suever","Good morning Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on -- [indiscernible], just a question on international margins, just in your outlook, you are actually modeling them now a little bit lower than before, and I was wondering if that's the impact of mobile mix and what else is going on there? Is the dynamic there similar to what you guys are seeing in North America?","Tom Williams","Yeah Andrew, it's Tom. It would be the mobile mix, because most of our heavy plant closures are in North America. A little bit in Europe, but North America is stealing more of the plant closures. So Europe, the international piece, we change the guide by 10 bps, and it's mainly the mobile mix.","Andrew Obin","And just a question in terms of dealing with high volumes and maybe this is sort of a three-pronged question; just focused on distributors, do they need to change their behavior, do you have enough capacity, and finally, working capital impact? Just because volumes are going up a lot faster than you guys thought?","Lee Banks","Andrew, it's Lee. I think if I understood your question, is we have to do anything different to handle the -- ","Andrew Obin","That's exactly right. And working capital requirements, exactly.","Lee Banks","No. I'd say from a working capital requirement standpoint, obviously when you have a huge influx in business in tax receivables for a period of time. But I would say, the biggest working capital requirements we have had throughout the quarter, really the first half of the year, have been with all these plant closures. So there has been a conscious build of inventory in some areas that we don't impact your customers.","I would say with revenue, with our OEM customers, there is nothing that we do differently. Some of these customers, we categorize our products with high runners, running through the shop, and distribution would follow many times too in the same category. So there would be nothing different, it's just the level of activity would heighten up with the value streams running -- not at capacity, but running a lot higher demand than they have run in the past.","Andrew Obin","Good problems to have. Thanks a lot.","Lee Banks","Thank you.","Cathy Suever","Thanks Andrew.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. I guess two questions, one, in the quarter, and guess as you look at your -- the remainder of the year, are there any different assumptions around price costs or your ability to get price in a market? Can you just talk about how that's going? And then my second question, sorry, back to North America Industrial; Tom, I appreciate the comments you had made about CLARCOR in closing or plants and stuff like that, and that will impact margins or incrementals over the next two quarters. But as we shift to fiscal year 2019, with most of that done, can we start to think about North America achieving more normalized incremental margins, or given where we'd be in the cycle, could you get above average incremental margins, versus your longer term target? Thanks.","Tom Williams","Jamie, it's Tom. I will start with your last question and I will let Lee talk about price costs. So yes, once we get through a lot of this heavy lifting, we would expect things to normalize. The other part that's going to help us, once we anniversary CLARCOR and we can look at the total company, apples-to-apples, it's going to be lot easier, and our Q4 is the first time when we get apples-to-apples and even with all the plant closures in that, which will still be happening in Q4, we see that getting to the 30% MROS type of level. So yes, the short answer is, you will see us get back to normal type of marginals. So I will let Lee talk about -- go ahead Jamie.","Jamie Cook","Sorry, no. Just to clarify, so 30% or given where you are in the cycle and what some of the restructuring could we theoretically do better than that? Because 30%, I would assume is like more your normalized, but given their structuring and you are still early in the cycle, I would think you know, because it would still be the back half of calendar year 2018? [indiscernible] we could do better than that?","Tom Williams","Well, the number I gave of 30% in Q4 is with all that noise and all the plant closures, with the mobile mix not necessarily helping us. So I think [indiscernible] to the underlying marginals at a pretty high level.","Jamie Cook","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you, Tom.","Lee Banks","Then Jamie, on price costs, I would tell you that there clearly is inflation on the horizon. I mean, you can see materials indexes, we have seen it in copper, we have seen it [ph] etcetera. We have been through these cycles before. I would say at this point in time, from a price cost standpoint at a corporate level we are good. But we are definitely taking actions to stay ahead of this, as we go forward.","Jamie Cook","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. I will get back in queue.","Lee Banks","Thank you.","Cathy Suever","Thanks Jamie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Good morning everyone.","Cathy Suever","Good morning Nathan.","Nathan Jones","I am going to beat the North American margin horse one more time. Tom, you talked about the facility closures, up from 20 to -- or 23 to 39 this year. Is it possible for you to quantify the impact of the disruption that that's had, need to build inventory, that kind of stuff? And are you going to be backed down to -- I don't know, 23 in 2019, will you be done through this? What's the kind of stepdown in the facility closures that you are looking out for 2019?","Tom Williams","For 2019, so we haven't worked all of that. But clearly the bulk of the CLARCOR activity will be through. There might be some residual things that we are doing, plant closures on CLARCOR in 2019. But we haven't [indiscernible] what the rest of the business at that point. But clearly, this is a spike in plant closures with them.","Now we have a rule, strict policy in how they count for making adjustments, and so, we only count adjustments that you can put clear plant closure costs on, severance, and those kind of things. So we don't try to add up manufacturing efficiencies and production rates and yields and all that kinds of things. And to be honest with you, I would be just giving you a number that would be [indiscernible] and wouldn't be a good factual number. But I think anybody that has closed the plant, knows exactly what I am talking about, and you feel it on the sending plant and you feel it on the receiving plant.","So it is real and typically any plant closure, even a well laid out plant closure, feels that for three to six months. And so that's -- we are in the middle of that. We fully expected that this is the biggest acquisition we have ever done, with the largest synergies we have ever done, and we feel very good about it. But you are kind of right now in the heat of the battle. The supply chain savings, SG&A, logistics, those are more straightforward. If I was to characterize, it's like the slope of a treadmill, those are at a lower slope; when you close a lot of factories, it's a higher slope of the treadmill, and I would just commend the teams, that I know are listening to this. Closing these number of factories, and what we have done from a margin standpoint, taking care of customers, is really terrific work what the team is doing.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Then my follow-up is on one of your prepared comments, where you said you feel that the change in the tax bill would open up share gain opportunities for you, and drive customer CapEx. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about where you see those share gain opportunities? And I know it's very early on the customer CapEx side, but maybe what your expectations are on that front?","Tom Williams","Yeah Nathan, it's Tom again. The CapEx is just a general comment. If you encourage people what the kind of tax laws, with an immediate expensing for tax purposes of CapEx for the next five years. That has to be somewhat additive to the current macro environment. So I take a current, very favorable macro environment, add that encouragement there, and I think it bodes well for CapEx in general. How it all plays through, and exactly what areas, that's yet to be determined. But we feel good about that.","As far as the gaining share, the point there is, we have a number of foreign competitors, which I won't highlight, which have had a distinct advantage forever. And now that we have a level playing field, I like our chances. I like our chances going toe-to-toe with them with a level playing field, and I will bet on us any day of the week. So that's how I was referring to the share gain, is that we don't have one arm behind our back any more, and let the better person win the order.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Cathy Suever","Thanks Nathan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning.","Cathy Suever","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","A lot of talk obviously about integration and plant closures CLARCOR related. I am wondering now if you step back and look at the CLARCOR footprint, you have also done a lot of restructuring here over the last several years, and now we are hitting a pretty big business inflection. How do you feel about the footprint right now, actually adequacy of the footprint than what's the trajectory of your own CapEx looking like the next year or two?","Tom Williams","Jeff, it's Tom. I think our CapEx will continue to be about 2% of sales. We have been running at 1.7% to 2% range, and I would see it at that level, and I will expand a little bit more upon that at IR Day, kind of more of a strategic thought on that. As far as the restructuring going forward, let me just make one comment to kind of calibrate people as to what we have done with the restructuring of the company, and I will start with prophesizing this that there is a lot more that we can do. But anyhow; we are going to have a circle for the first time in the history of the company, hopefully with this guidance crossing $14 billion. So it makes you go back and look, well okay, what was the last all time high at the company, and how many people did we have? So the last all time high was $13.2 billion in FY 2012 and we had 59,000 team members. So with those guidance, where basically round numbers are going to be $1 billion higher than that, and we are going to have 2,500 fewer people than we had at that peak. So an extra billion of revenue, 2,500 fewer people.","So clearly speaks to what we have been doing, as far as the efficiencies and the structure of the company. I would just reiterate, like I said at the beginning that we still see opportunities to continue to improve that, and it still is big four that I referenced, simplification, lean, supply chain and value pricing, as margin enhancements. I doubt that we will continue to be at $110 million clip on our structure, and I think it's going to stabilize at some level. But I don't think it will be big. You have looked at this historically before the new win strategy, we have been in that $20 million to $30 million type of range in restructuring, and I would see us being a little bit higher than that; because I think there is still opportunities for us to continue to simplify the structure of the company, make it faster on behalf of our customers, and we are going to continue to work that.","Jeff Sprague","And then just briefly on M&A; obviously you are deleveraging and divesting [indiscernible] here still primarily. But do you see bolt-ons coming into your view, anywhere in the portfolio, and maybe in filtration in particular?","Tom Williams","Yeah. M&A is obviously something that we stay in -- again, it's Tom -- we stay engaged with this all the time; because the relationship building is important to do, whether you are in a position to deploy capital towards that or not. So we have that, we have the strategic candidates that we would like to add to the portfolio, and where it fits and complements our strategy, and we are working that every day, every week.","So as we start to glide down, like I mentioned earlier, our debt position, we will clearly look at that. And if I was to characterize our portfolio strategy; first, we want to be a consolidator of choice. So if it is in our space, we'd like to be at bet [ph]. Doesn't mean we will swing, but we'd like to be at bet [ph] to take a look. But all things being equal, we'd like to invest more into Filtration, Engineered Materials, Aerospace And Instrumentation part of the portfolio for a lot of strategic reasons; margins, resilience, to recycle, grow the capabilities, and those type of things. So that would be a little bit of color behind the M&A strategy.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you very much.","Cathy Suever","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond","Hey, good morning.","Cathy Suever","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Hammond","Can you just -- you talked about some of the disruption, but can you speak to kind of how you are thinking about CLARCOR cost synergy savings second half versus first half?","Cathy Suever","Yeah. We are going to have $58 million of savings that we enjoyed this year in fiscal 2018. About 35% of that went in the first half, and we expect 65% of that in the second half.","Jeff Hammond","Okay, great. And then just -- Tom, you mentioned kind of the debt paydown, what's kind of the updated timing, where you start to transition away debt reduction?","Tom Williams","Well, there is no formal timeline, a lot of it is contingent upon opportunities that present themselves, as we are looking at that. But we'd like to get closer to two times EBITDA multiple, and we started off at 3.5, when we first did the deal, and currently at 2.9. So we are making good progress, and we want to continue to demonstrate that, and when we think we are in a better position from a debt standpoint, then we will start to look again.","Cathy Suever","Jeff, I will add on to that. We do have some term debt at $450 million due in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $100 million due in the first quarter of 2019. So you can count on that term debt being liquidated.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. Thanks.","Cathy Suever","Okay, I think we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning. Thanks for letting me in.","Cathy Suever","Good morning Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just to maybe come full circle on all the North American margin questions; I know that there are usually some corporate true-up that happened in the second quarter, as is seasonally always the case. Did those look any different than normalized? I know we have beaten it [ph] at this point, but I just [indiscernible]?","Cathy Suever","Yeah Josh. Let me point out that, the majority of the impact from those true-ups from incentive comps, hits down below the line, when you are looking at segments, it's down in corporate G&A. We did have adjustments, but not anything unusual compared to other years in this quarter. So I don't think that that was a driver of what you are looking at, and it's not a margin impact.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got you. And then just on the tax rate, I guess all that implies in the second half, but still above the 25%, just given how you had a lower first half? How should we think about kind of the go forward, more of an annualized or fiscal 2019, however you want to think about it rate? Is it still kind of just 26.5% or are you really at 25%, once we get through all the initial payments?","Cathy Suever","Yeah. Let me step through, so for fiscal 2018, we are at a statutory U.S. rate of 28%. We blend that with our international rates, that gets us to about -- with all the other discretes that have come through so far, we are estimating a 25% rate for this year. Starting in fiscal 2019, we will be at a true 21% statutory rate for U.S., so that will lower our rate. We anticipate our ongoing rate starting in 2019 and forward to be closer to 23%.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got you. That's helpful color. Appreciate that.","Cathy Suever","Okay, you're welcome. All right thanks Josh. All right. That concludes our Q&A and our earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. Robin and Ryan will be available throughout the day to take your calls should you have further questions. Thanks everybody. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation.

At this time, all phone participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference maybe recorded.","I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Cathy Suever, Executive Vice President, Finance & Administration and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.","Catherine Suever","Thanks Liz. Good morning. Welcome to Parker Hannifin's fourth quarter 2019 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks. Today's presentation slides together with the audio webcast replay will be accessible on the company's investor information website at phstock.com for one year following today's call.","On slide number 2 and 3, you will find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and are also posted on Parker's website at phstock.com.","Today's agenda appears on slide number 4. We'll begin with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, providing comments and highlights from the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2019. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2019 performance together with guidance for fiscal year 2020. Tom will then provide a few summary comments, and we'll open the call for a question-and-answer session. Please refer now to slide number 5, and Tom will get us started.","Tom Williams","Thanks, Cathy. And good morning, everybody. Thanks for your participation. Looking at slide 5, we had a strong fourth quarter and completed Parker's best year ever in our history.","But before I jump into all the results, I wanted to just pause for a minute and reflect on the remarkable transformation of our company. Parker is a very different company now, delivering record performance and better able to perform through market cycles. We have a stronger portfolio of businesses following the three transformational acquisitions we've done in the last three years.","If you look at performance and go back to last five years, adjusted operating margin percentage improved 280 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margins improved over 300 basis points. We are better performer over the cycle. We've always been good on cash flow over the cycle, but we're now we're much better on EPS and margins over the cycle.","Particularly if you note, our margin performance during the '15 and '16 industrial recession and our margin performance just in last quarter Q4, a negative order growth, they all point to the improved performance that I was referring to.","On the three acquisitions, they're going to lift the company up on two levels, portfolio and performance. On the portfolio side, we wanted to add to Filtration, Engineered Materials and Aerospace, these are parts that we've talked about on the air to because of the resilience over the cycle.","On the performance side, we're adding three great businesses that are accretive to growth and the margins. Our goal here through the Win Strategy and our Capital Deployment strategy is to build a better business that generates higher growth, margins and cash flow through the business cycle, and you're seeing evidence of that already.","Ultimately, this is this is going to result in Parker being a best in class company. So my thanks to all the Parker team members who are listening in, for all their hard work last year, but really over the last several years to get us to this point.","If you turn to slide 6, part of what is transforming the company is our business model and the competitive differentiators that makes us special and we'll just talk through these bullets on this page briefly,","The Win Strategy, it's our business system, it is the engine behind our results. Our decentralized divisional structure really drives an entrepreneurial spirit in the company.","The motion and control technologies that we have really creates the breadth of our portfolio and this strategically positions us to have a big advantage versus our competition. And recognizing the fact that I've talked about before, 60% of our revenue comes from customers that buy from all of those technologies. That's a good evidence that our customers value that breadth of technologies.","Our strong intellectual property, 85% of our portfolio, and typically what we ship has some element of intellectual property tied to it. We have long product life cycles, decades long as it go, balanced OEM and aftermarket, and we have arguably the best distribution channel in the motion control space.","We have low CapEx requirements. Our lean transformation has really driven a low CapEx to drive our business and that enables us to have a very robust capital deployment process. And we're great generators and deployers of cash and you've seen us in action over the last five years in that regard.","So if you turn to slide 7, some highlights from the fourth quarter. Safety continues to be our top priority. Our reportable incidents for the quarter were down 24%. Our high performance teams are helping to drive these results. Our goal is zero incidents. That's not an aspirational goal, it's really an expectation of how we're going to run the company.","And the ownership culture that's created from the high performance team process and the start of a safety is going to be applied also to quality, cost and delivery, and that will naturally lift up the performance of the company.","All-time quarterly records for the fourth quarter: total segment operating margin, total Industrial segment operating margin, net income and EPS. Couple of notes on the quarter, sales were a negative 3.5% that was composed of a negative 2% and organic and a negative 1.5%.","Our currency orders declined 3% against some tough comparables and we had a fourth quarter record on Industrial International segment margins as well. My thanks to the International team for a great job in the quarter.","So now, I want to turn to full-year results for FY \u201819. We had a number of all-time records, of course, we only do records on a reported basis, so they are sales, total segment operating margins, net income, EPS and operating cash flow.","Couple of highlights for the full year, we came in on organic growth of 2.6% organic sales outpacing global industrial production. We had excellent improvement in segment operating margin and EBITDA margins versus the prior year.","Adjusted EBITDA margins, if you go back to when we acquired CLARCOR, we were 14.7%. We're now at 18.2%. From an EBITDA dollar standpoint, we were $1.7 billion and now we are at $2.6 billion.","That growth in margins, that growth in EBITDA dollars has really helped enable us to do both LORD and Exotic acquisitions that we've recently announced.","We achieved 17% segment operating margins, a year ahead of our original target. And the first time in our history, 17% a number that we're extremely proud of and obviously we're not stopping there, but that was a huge milestone for us to reach.","Tremendous cash flow generation, resulting in $1.7 billion in operating cash. When you do it on a percent basis, we came in at 12.1% CFOA, and excluding the pension contribution, that will be 13.5%.","Switching to cash and capital deployment, the goal and you've heard me talk about this, is to be great generators and deployers of cash. So, on the cash generation side, we ended FY \u201819 at 115% free cash flow conversion. That makes 18 consecutive years of free cash flow conversion credit of 100%.","And on deployment side, it was a big year. Dividends, our stated target is to pay out 30% to 35% of net income. And as a result of our growth in net income, we increased annual dividends paid out by 13%.","We had our 63rd consecutive year of annual increases to dividends paid out, a record we're very proud of as well, and one that we intend to keep. We announced two transformational acquisitions. And on the share repurchase side, we did $200 million on our 10b5-1 program and we purchased $600 million on a discretionary basis.","Debt reduction is going to be a higher priority going forward. Our target within three years is to get 2.0 multiple from a gross debt to EBITDA multiple, and we'll pause the M&A activity until we get there.","Just a few comments on the acquisitions that are really going to generate great value for our shareholders. We announced in the last 90 days, the acquisition of LORD Corporation and Exotic Metals; transformational to our portfolio, adding to our Engineered Materials business and on the Aerospace group with high growth and high margin businesses.","When you look at the pro forma EBITDA margin, take legacy Parker with LORD and Exotic in your forecast set out for five years, we're going to improve EBITDA margins by more than 400 basis points over that five-year period of time.","That's really going to help propel us to be in that top quartile company that we desire, and both of these companies I am referring to, LORD and Exotic, are both great cultural fits and we expect a seamless integration.","Now turning to the outlook, we are issuing guidance for FY 2020. We've got moderating market conditions, we're forecasting sales of negative 3% to flat, so minus 1.5% of midpoint and I'll talk more about that during the Q&A.","I think the effectiveness of the Win Strategy is really being observed. When you look at our FY '20 guide, historically on negative organic growth, we would be reducing margins, But with this guidance, we're expanding segment operating margins and we're posting a record EPS.","Adjusted EPS is at $11.50 to $12.30, or $11.90 at the midpoint, business realignment of $20 million, and we did not include LORD or Exotic in this FY '20 guidance. We will of course update guidance after they close.","So going forward, really if you look at the FY '19 results, FY '20 guide, coupled with the momentum that we have with the Win Strategy in our recent acquisitions, we're well on our way to achieving our FY '23 targets.","And just to remind people, those targets for FY '23 are sales growth of 150 basis points greater than global industrial production growth over the cycle, segment operating margins of 19%, EBITDA margins of 20%, free cash flow conversion greater than 100%, and EPS CAGR over that time period of 10% plus. The actions we're taking, the dedication of our global team members are really helping to generate strong returns for our shareholders.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Cathy for a more detailed review on the quarter.","Catherine Suever","Thanks, Tom, I'd like you to now refer to slide number 8. This slide presents as reported and adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019 compared to 2018.","Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased 3% compared to the prior year, reaching $3.31. Adjustments from 2019 as reported results totaled $0.14 including business realignment expenses of $0.04 and LORD acquisition and integration expenses of $0.10.","This compares to fiscal 2018 adjustments of $0.60 for business realignment expenses, CLARCOR costs to achieve, and net loss on sale and write-down of assets and a US tax reform adjustment.","For the full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2019 was $11.85, an increase of 14% compared to fiscal 2018. Adjustments from the 2019 as reported results totaled $0.37. This compares to fiscal 2018 adjustments of $2.59. The details of all of these adjustments are included in the reconciliation tables for non-GAAP financial measures.","Moving to slide number 9, you'll find the significant components of the $0.09 walk from prior-year fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to $3.31 for the fourth quarter of this year.","We gained $0.04 from lower corporate G&A, interest expense and other expense. Lower income tax expense accounted for $0.06 and lower average share count contributed $0.11.","Offsetting these gains, segment operating income decreased by $0.12 as a result of lower volume, with sales down 3.6% versus the prior year quarter, and also as a result of higher development costs incurred in our Aerospace segment.","Moving to slide 10, you'll find the significant components of the $1.43 walk from adjusted earnings per share of $10.42 for fiscal 2018 to $11.85 for this year. The largest improvement came from segment operating income. This accounted for an increase of $0.79, with total segment margins improving by 100 basis points year-over-year. $0.14 came from lower interest expense. Lower income tax expense accounted for $0.19 and reduced average shares contributed $0.31.","Slide 11 shows total Parker sales and segment operating margin for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. For the fourth quarter, organic sales decreased year-over-year by 1.9% and currency had a negative impact of 1.7%. Despite a decline in sales, the fourth quarter total segment operating margin on an adjusted basis improved to 17.6% versus 17.5% last year.","This improvement reflects productivity improvements and the benefits of synergies from acquisitions, combined with the positive impacts from our Win Strategy initiatives. For the full year, organic sales increased by 2.6% and total segment operating margins increased 100 basis points to 17.2%.","Moving to slide 12, I'll discuss the business segments starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the fourth quarter, North America organic sales were down 3.2%. Even with lower sales, operating margin improved nicely for the fourth quarter to 18.4% on an adjusted basis.","North America continued to deliver improved margins, which reflects the hard work dedicated to productivity improvements as well as synergies from acquisitions and the impact of our Win Strategy initiatives. For the full year, North America organic sales increased 1.8% and adjusted margins increased 30 basis points to 16.9%. I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial International segment on slide 13.","Organic sales for the fourth quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 4.1%. Currency also negatively impacted the quarter by 4.5%. Despite the lower sales, operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2019, on an adjusted basis, improved 30 basis points to 16.4% of sales.","This margin performance reflects our team's improved operating cost efficiencies from realignment initiatives and the benefits of the Win Strategy.","For the full year, organic sales for Industrial International increased 1.1% and adjusted operating margins increased by 110 basis points to finish the year at 16.4%.","I'll now move to slide 14 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic sales increased 6.5% during the fourth quarter primarily due to commercial and military OE growth, along with growth in commercial aftermarket.","Operating margin for the fourth quarter decreased by 200 basis points due to higher development costs in the quarter and a lower mix of military aftermarket sales as compared to the prior year.","For the full year, our Aerospace Systems segment delivered great organic sales growth of 8.5% and an impressive 210 basis point improvement in adjusted segment margin, finishing the year at 19.4%.","On slide 15, you'll find the differences in fiscal year 2019 earnings per share between our full year guidance going into the quarter compared to the actual results from the out performance in the fourth quarter.","Final full year earnings per share on an adjusted basis was $0.25 higher than previously guided. At the operations level, segment operating income finished $0.01 higher than expected driven by productivity improvements despite the lower-than-expected sales.","Lower corporate G&A, interest and other expense resulted in an additional $0.06. We benefited $0.16 from lower income tax expense due to discrete tax adjustments and additional benefits resulting from new regulations related to US tax reform recognized in the quarter. And lastly, we benefited $0.02 from lower average shares.","On slide 16, we report cash flow from operating activities. We had strong cash flow this whole year. Full year 2019 cash flow from operating activities was a record $1.73 billion.","When adjusted for a $200 million discretionary pension contribution made during the first quarter, cash flow from operations was 13.5% of sales. This compares to 11.2% of sales for the same period last year.","On slide 17, we show a history of Parker's free cash flow conversion rate. For the 18th consecutive year, Parker generated free cash flow conversion of greater than 100%, finishing fiscal year 2019 at 115%. Parker is great at cash generation even during growth periods. We're very proud of our team for their good management of working capital.","Moving to slide 18, we show the details of order rates by segment. Total orders decreased by 3% as of the quarter ending June. This year-over-year decline is a consolidation of minus 4% within Diversified Industrial North America, minus 8% within Diversified Industrial International and a positive 10% within Aerospace Systems orders.","The full year earnings guidance for fiscal year 2020 is outlined on slide 19. Guidance is being provided on both an as reported and an adjusted basis. Total sales for the year are now expected to decrease to 1.5% compared to the prior year, within a range of minus 3% to 0%.","Anticipated organic growth for the full year is forecasted in approximately the same range at a midpoint of minus 1.5%. There is no prior-year acquisition or divestiture impact and the currency impact is expected to be minimal.","We've calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended June 30, 2019. We've held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for fiscal year 2020. You can see the forecasted as reported and adjusted operating margins by segment.","At the midpoint, total Parker adjusted margins are forecasted to increase approximately 20 basis points from prior year. For guidance, we are estimating an adjusted range of 17.2% to 17.6% for the full fiscal year.","The full year effective tax rate is projected to be 23%. For the full year, the guidance range on an as reported earnings per share basis is $11.38 to $12.18 or $11.78 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is $11.50 to $12.30, or $11.90 at the midpoint.","The adjustments to the as reported forecast made in this guidance include business realignment expenses of approximately $20 million or $0.12 per share for the full year fiscal 2020, but the associated savings are projected to be $10 million.","Some additional key assumptions for full-year 2020 guidance at the midpoint are: sales are divided 47% first half, 53% second half; adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% first half, 54% second half; adjusted earnings per share, first half, second half is divided 45%, 55%. First quarter fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $2.66 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.04 of projected business realignment expenses.","On Slide 20, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of fiscal year 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $11.90 per share at the midpoint compared to the prior year of $11.85 per share. The increases include $0.07 from corporate G&A, $0.55 from other expense, and $0.13 from lower average shares.","Other expense includes $0.35 of interest income from the proceeds of the bonds that we issued in June 2019, which are being held for the LORD transaction. The remainder in other is primarily related to numerous unusual charges incurred in fiscal 2019 that are not expected to repeat in 2020.","Offsetting these increases is a $0.04 per share decrease from segment operating income. The operating income impact from the drop in sales volume will be partially offset by margin improvement throughout the year. The remaining decreases are $0.30 from higher income tax expense and $0.36 per share from higher interest expense.","The decrease due to higher income tax expense is from discrete tax items in 2019 that we do not forecast in fiscal 2020. The change in interest expense includes an additional $0.47 in interest cost from the bonds issued in June, partially offset by anticipated lower commercial paper outstanding as compared to fiscal year 2019.","This forecast does not include any results from our announced acquisitions of LORD Corporation or Exotic Metals Forming Company. We ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison and that you do not include the pending acquisitions until we are able to close the transaction.","This concludes my prepared comments. Please turn to slide number 21. I'll turn it over to Tom to provide summary comments.","Tom Williams","Thanks, Cath. So, just a couple of quick comments. We're very pleased with our continued progress, projecting record year of earnings in FY '20, and we're well on our way to delivering of being a top quartile company and being that best-in-class company that we are aspiring to be. My thanks to the global team for all their hard work, their dedication, the results from FY '19 and we're looking forward to a bright future together.","And with that, Liz, we're happy to start the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. I guess just first question, Tom, if you could just provide some context around how you're thinking about the organic growth drive for 2020, what's implied for sort of first half versus second half?","And then you know, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of, you mentioned channel inventory before, how long that continues to weigh on results versus clear the channel? So I guess start there and then - yeah, I guess, why don't we start there? That's fine.","Tom Williams","Okay, Jamie. It's Tom, Happy to do that because that's obviously probably top of mind for everybody. So let me take you through our assumptions and obviously this process that we do is we're one of the first companies to start talking about calendar '20. We take a lot of input from customers, distributors or divisions of course in our own economic models.","So, the organic growth that we talked about at the midpoint at minus 1.5%, that turns into our first half at minus 4%, which really mirrors our current order entry, on the second half, a plus 1%. So on the second half, we have a slightly better volume, little bit easier comps.","If you look at that minus 1.5% organically on a regional basis, it's North America at minus 1.5%, international at minus 4.5% and Aerospace at a plus 4.5%, I am kind of rounding to halves here as I go through it.","While it's not a predictor of our future, there's another important data point that we have looked at and that's our pressure curve history. If you look at the last 10 years, anytime to 3, 12 [ph] curve has gone less than 1, it tends to go down less than 1 for a 12 months to 18 months duration depending on where that particular business cycle is.","Our current pressure curves have been less than 1 for about 7 months. So, this guidance assumes that the 3, 12 curve crosses 1 approximately 15 months from when it started, so not too different from what we have seen in other cycles. Of course, and that's our best estimate at this time.","Let me take you through the markets that we see for FY '20, and I'll give you a little color as to what we think is driving the second half. I'm going to make just a quick clarifying comment like I usually do, and on our list markets and positive neutral negative, this is our forecast for the market. Don't take my comments as I'm speaking about the entire market, this is just how Parker is going to perform in the market.","So on a positive side is Aerospace, forestry and life sciences. Neutral, which is a pretty big section, agriculture, construction, distribution, modern tariff, material handling, oil and gas, power gen, refrigeration, semi con, telecom and ground military and defense. On the negative side is automotive, engines, heavy duty truck, machine tools, marine, mills and foundries, mining, rail and tires and rubber.","So what's driving the markets in our view in the second half besides some help on compare -- easier comparables will be the one part, which is what you were alluding to earlier, Jamie, on distribution.","The destocking that we are seeing early in Q3 and Q4 will continue for the first half, but at a diminishing rate, and then will be pretty much of an equilibrium in our view on the distribution channel come into this calendar year and that turns to a slight positive for the second half.","Life Sciences will be positive for us in the second half as well as power gen turning from negative to positive in the second half. So that's one category, things that we see moving to positive in the second half.","There is another big category of markets that are currently negative that we see is going to neutral in the second half, so they don't necessarily provide us tailwind, but they become less of a headwind, obviously. So the negative to neutral ones, first half to second half I'm just going to list these out, are construction, oil and gas, semi con, automotive, machine tools, mining, rail, mills and foundries, again, and tires. So I'm pretty optimistic.","When you look at the 312 curves, they are less than 1, but they are flattening. So that's a positive indicator. When you look at our four phases of the business cycle, we have about two-thirds of our markets that are in Phase 3, Phase 3 being the accelerating decline phase of a four-phase business cycle.","And what that signals to us is that we're moving our way through the soft patch because the next phase after accelerating decline is decelerating decline, which means you're starting to move out of that, and then the next phase after that is growth.","So in our view, there is lots of self-help here. The markets are going to turn, and it wills tart to help us, albeit a little bit later in FY '20, but will start to provide some small tailwind.","The Win Strategy is producing margin expansion for us in a negative organic sales environment. We've got the two transformational acquisitions in LORD and Exotic that bring in higher growth in margins. And just about the time that we close these deals and really get the integration really up and running is also going to be about the time these markets start to come back and start to give us some slight tailwind. So I think that all is going to align very nicely.","So I feel good about '20 and I think it all comes back to the message I started the call with that we're positioned well for the cycle, and we're going to continue to try to be the best-in-class company. So I don't give a follow-up, Jamie, or not?","Jamie Cook","No, I mean, I think I guess, just if I can have a follow-up. The implied margin resilience that we're going to see in the North American markets in 2020 even with the sales decline, just any color in particular on that and then I'll get back in queue.","Tom Williams","Yeah. So we have North America going up about 20 basis points versus '19. It's really going to be a continued win strategy efforts, the productivity that we've got, the kaizen activity that we have is all creating the capacity for us to be more resilient on the margin side. And North America's volume being down, not as bad as International, they are able to hold up the margins and in fact expand margins because of that.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thanks. I'll hop back in queue.","Catherine Suever","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is now open.","Mig Dobre","Good morning, everyone. So Tom, I want to go back to your comments early on, when you talked about the transformation of the business, this is something that we spent some time speaking to investors about.","And one of the questions that I think we often get that maybe you can help us with is when you're looking at your business mix and you look at what traditionally have been perceived as your key customers and key drivers, heavy machinery OEM build, how is your business looking today, especially when you count in LORD and you are counting in CLARCOR as well as Exotic versus, say, the way it looked in fiscal '15 in the last cycle or even the cycle prior to that? Because there is a business mix aspect here that I think is perhaps under appreciated even by me.","Tom Williams","Yeah, I think you're right. I mean that was, as you know, Mig and everybody else that's been listening on the call, almost all of my investor presentations, when I talked about capital deployment, I start talking about we're going to be the consolidator choice in this space because we like the space and we are number one. So we want to continue to add that.","But all things being equal, we'd like to invest a little heavier in filtration, aerospace, engineered materials and instrumentation, you've seen us do three out of the four so far.","And we are on purpose trying to balance out that density that you referred to that we traditionally had maybe in the Fluid Power side of the company on our fluid connectors and our motion technologies and add filtration, which is now one of our largest groups. And with Lord, Engineered Materials would be one of our larger groups, and add to Aerospace which balances out the short cycle nature of the company with a high margin business, that's got a great growth trajectory.","So clearly that portfolio, since we've added $3 billion of revenue in roughly three years, that goes into those targeted parts of the portfolio that will make us clearly more resilient.","You can't ever be - not have any reaction to the business cycle, everybody feels it. But can you dent the lows versus what you had in the past. And I think you see evidence of that. We held margins almost virtually flat during the industrial recession of '15 and '16 on the margin performance in Q4.","Those are pretty phenomenal results and that was even before, of course, Q4 had CLARCOR in it, but it's before adding LORD and Exotic. So the mix is going to continue to help us and the Win Strategy is going to continue to help us too, because we're not stopping at 17% operating margin.","Mig Dobre","I see, okay. And then if I may ask a question on Industrial International, obviously your full year guidance implies organic growth decline. I'm presuming you're sort of thinking that orders kind of keep in line with your organic guidance.","Two years in a row now of contraction in International, so from your perspective, what sort of environment are you really baking into your outlook? And I am to some degree surprised that you're not announcing some kind of restructuring of sorts, addressing basically the second year of volume decline here. Maybe you can comment on that and how your cost structure has changed in international with everything that you've done? Thank you.","Tom Williams","Yeah, so on the restructuring side, we have been restructuring International since FY '14 and we've been on a very aggressive restructuring getting International margins almost to the levels of North America, if you look at last year, 16.4% versus 16.9%, and a lot of either falls for a long time. Never thought we could ever do that.","So International has been moving because of the restructuring that we've been doing, and we've been creating a much more agile organization and the mix of improving distribution versus OEM. So that's been helping International.","So we don't feel the same need at least at these levels of sales decline to trigger some new level of restructuring. We've got the organization to where it needs to be, obviously we will do the normal variable cost reductions in temps and over time and voluntary lack of works, those type of things.","But we think we've really done a great job internationally and that's why you see the margins what we've had. I'm not sure I hit everything you wanted to cover, Mig, then.","Mig Dobre","No, you kind of did. I guess I'm wondering, in some ways, it's a little bit unusual to see two years in a row of, say, orders or volume decline here. That's actually worse than what happened in 2015, right?","So I'm trying to understand kind of that dynamic and also trying to understand if your cost structure here has become more variable than it's been in the past. That's kind of where I was going.","Tom Williams","Yeah. So Mig, that was the part of your question I missed. Yeah, International did grow at least minus 1% last year, but it was the first to start to go down, and so it felt a little bit sooner. So International declined organically last year, of course it had a lot of the currency, minus 5.5 [ph] on currency.","But we do -- I think we've been realistic with International. We've got International down about 8.5% the first half and then starting to work its way by the time we exit Q4 to almost a neutral type of positioning in Q4. So it was first to go in, and I think it will be fine. And I think the guide is pretty realistic in what we have for International.","Mig Dobre","All right. Thank you.","Catherine Suever","Thanks, Mig.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks, good morning.","Catherine Suever","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So I guess my first question and just it's going back to the inventory comments from earlier. I guess as you think about the next couple of quarters, it sounds like you're expecting destock to continue.","I guess in that context, have you heard or have you experienced any distributor like price adjustments or how are those conversations with your distributors occurring on the pricing side just given the backdrop?","Tom Williams","So let me - I'll start with the inventory, and let Lee chime in on the pricing side of things. So with at least North America, we do have good visibility into that sales out and sales-in that I referred to in the last call.","And so we look at North America, we see about a flat growth organically with about 200 basis points of destocking. So North America came in at about a minus 2% on distribution growth. That was about minus 300 bps of destocking in Q3. So we saw a little bit of improvement, about 100 basis points of improvement.","And that's really was our thinking as we go into the first half of '20, so we have about another 100 bps every quarter, hence six months to get through the destocking. And that's obviously through conversations that we have with our distributors and then we were plotting, like I referred to last quarter, for plotting that sales-out, sales-in, so we can get a little better visibility of the trend. I'll let Lee comment on the pricing side.","Lee Banks","Just commenting on distribution. Speaking about North America, I would - as Tom said, it was mixed during the quarter, really depends on the region and destocking continue.","I'd say on the pricing side, if you're asking if there still pricing power in the channel, I'm not quite sure exactly what you were asking. We're still in a slightly inflationary environment. I would say that there is still pricing taking place, and which is still promising through, there's still a lot of CapEx activity still taking place at this point in time, which is a good indicator that, and I'm speaking mostly of North America that there's still a lot of positive momentum going on.","Joe Ritchie","Yes, Lee, my comment was more around like whether your distributors were pushing back on price at all in this backdrop. And really kind of trying to understand whether that has any implications on the leverage in your North American business.","Tom Williams","No, there is really none of that taking place right now.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Got it. And then maybe just my follow-on, and just thinking about the trajectory of the aero business, the aero obviously continues to do well from an order perspective.","If you take a look at the growth expectations for 2020, and they seem a little light based on the trends that we've been seeing. And so maybe some commentary around that as we head into 2020?","Tom Williams","Okay. Joe, it's Tom. So on orders, remember, orders are long cycle or 12 months and they tend to be lumpy and you don't always translate the due dates directly out into the next fiscal year, but we were plus 10% like you've seen. That composition was minus 5% on commercial OE, plus 42% on military OE, plus 13% on commercial MRO, and plus 24% on military MRO.","So some of the things that really drove some of the big spikes for F-35 on the military OE. On the commercial side, it was 737 and 787, and really kind of a mixture of A 220 [ph] a pretty nice broad base mixture on the MRO side. And the military MRO, a lot of fighters F-18, F-119, F-101 is a bomber, but some pretty good progress on orders there.","For sales, our forecast is about 4.5%, that composition is commercial OE at plus 3%, military OE at plus 2%, commercial MRO at plus 4%, and military MRO at plus 10%, and that's our best view at this moment.","Joe Ritchie","Appreciate the color.","Catherine Suever","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Raso","Hi, good morning. Yes, my question focuses on the sensitivity of your margin guidance to volumes. What's striking me is in the first half of the year, you have total company sales down 4% to 5%, but implied margins up 10 bps. The second half of the year, your revenue is up and the margins are up 30 bps, not terribly differently. It doesn't seem like there's much volume sensitivity to the margin improvement.","Now I do appreciate the year ago comp, mix, you know, currency can mess with the analysis a bit, but I'm just trying to understand is that accurate that where you see your margin improvement coming from really isn't that volume sensitive?","Tom Williams","Well, if I take a tour of Parker, I'm just doing total MROS, so we're in that minus 15% to minus 20% range for the first half. And if I look at the second half, it's like plus over 70% now. Again, it's the loss on numbers, you got relatively modest sales increase. So you are seeing some pretty nice lift in that second half as far as MROS go.","David Raso","Well, I am just seeing the opposite, Tom, saying you would think the second half of the year has got to really carry the load on the margin improvement, because your distributors aren't destocking the same way. You have volume overhead absorption that's improving because you have revenues up, not down.","But at some sense what striking me is interesting that you're almost saying I can grow margins nothing regardless of volumes, but it's -- I won't use the word impressive, but yeah, if you can do it, it is impressive that you can have down volumes up, margins and up volumes up margins. I mean, just interesting to see this, obviously if you really can do it without a much volume sensitivity, it makes the credibility of the guide improve.","So I'm just trying to understand, am I reading it right. I know I'm doing the math right, but I'm just trying to figure out other clear things in the margin improvement this year that you would say, yeah, it's really not tied to volume at all, have confidence that we can grow margin even when bottoms are down because that's what you're implying in the first half.","Tom Williams","You're absolutely reading it right and that's part of the transformation that I spoke to at the beginning of the call. The combination of all the things we've been doing on lean, the kaizen activity really started heavy for us in the fall of last year, the Win Strategy simplification, all those type of things, the inefficiencies that we've worked through, the CLARCOR synergies that are really kicking in.","All those things and of course, the portfolio shift as far as things we're adding to the portfolio, are enabling us to be better our margins when we have softness on sales. So yes, we feel good about that.","David Raso","Yeah. I wasn't sure. Maybe the part of the reason is the price cost is, you know, particularly helpful over the next couple of quarters, because you still have some lag benefit from prior price increases, but now you get the benefit from a lower cost and that kind of goes more neutral in the second half. It doesn't seem like in the channel, you put much of a price increase if any through July 1.","So I'm not sure how much benefit maybe in your fiscal second half you'll have on price, but the carry over from the prior price increase, it should still be there the next six months, and then maybe a benefit from lower costs.","So, I am not blessing it here, but just it's impressive, if you can do that where you're not that volume sensitive. I'm just trying to get a handle on -- it seems that you believe it just with our couple of buckets to make us feel good about, that's not volume sensitive. We know what the price cost is and we know we have some inefficiencies that we're still lingering at CLARCOR that aren't there in the fiscal first half of '20. That's all I was driving at.","Tom Williams","Yeah, I think you're right, you hit on all the buckets. The inefficiencies that we have at CLARCOR were clearly more pronounced in the first half of '19. And so that helps us as we look at '20.","Some of the carry over on pricing is a little bit better in the first half. In general, if I was to do the total pricing for the year, it would be margin neutral, but we do get a little bit of help more in the first half. So I think you're right.","David Raso","All right. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Catherine Suever","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Nicole DeBlase","Yeah. Thanks, good morning.","Catherine Suever","Good morning, Nicole.","Nicole DeBlase","So, I just wanted to start with the first quarter. So the color between the first half and the second half was really helpful. But if you guys could give us a sense of what's baked in from an organic and a margin perspective in that $2.66 midpoint guidance for 1Q that would be helpful?","Catherine Suever","Sure, Nicole. I'll help you here. We're anticipating organic decline of about 3.5% for the first quarter with just a minimal impact from currency, say 0.5 point of 0.5% currency. But as you look at the margins, we're expecting year-over-year for North America to see improving margins year-over-year.","Again that relates to some of the inefficiencies we saw at the first half of last year that are improving. International, with the decline, will have lower margins than last year, a nice decremental though there, and Aerospace will see improving margins.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then secondly on Aerospace margins, it looks to me like you've embedded about 50% incrementals in 2020 guidance. Just curious how much R&D maybe contributes to that, the factors driving the pretty substantial year-on-year increase in margins to about 20%.","Catherine Suever","Yeah. A lot of that or a good portion of that has to do with the development costs and what we incurred in fiscal '19 compared to what we anticipate in fiscal '20 and especially what we incurred in the fourth quarter. So in the fourth quarter of this year, our development costs were 7.5% of sales. That was pretty high. Our overall average for the year was 5.6%.","In fiscal year '20, we expect development costs to be less than that and we're forecasting in the range of 4.5% to 5%. So lower development costs are driving some of that incremental, along with other continuous improvements the teams are making to implement productivity and Win Strategy initiatives and just improving the processes in the shops and getting more productive.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, got it. Thanks, I'll pass it on.","Catherine Suever","Thanks, Nicole.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Andrew Obin","Yes, good morning.","Catherine Suever","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Can we just touch, Just going back to the strategy question, can we talk about internal capital deployment? And it's really a two-part question. A, how do you think deploying capital in terms of sort of capital and labor, and specifically on capital, if you could talk about stuff sort of implementing robotics, 3D manufacturing, how much money are you spending, how much impact is it making?","And the second question is, given all the trade tensions, how are you guys thinking about deploying capital by geography, North America, the rest of the world, and what are you seeing in your supply chain? I know, it's sort of an expansive question, so that would be the only one from me.","Tom Williams","Andrew, it's Tom. So let me start with the CapEx side. So I think a good round number for to think about is in CapEx and this would be before for the fund organic growth as well as productivity is around 2%. And we are very active on robotics and additive.","I would just tell you that our strategy on automation robotics is to do kaizen first. We believe it was not automate waste, we're going to do kaizen, we're going to streamline the processes and optimize what we have and then we'll automate the remaining processes.","And so there is a little bit of a learning curve on learning all the automation, we've got a lot of great partners that we're working with, and we've had a number of summit sessions with all of our manufacturing engineers, and I would say the organization is really jazzed up about it. And I think this is a good strategy, we're putting kaizen first, then automation.","And as part of why I think you've seen the margin do as well as ahead is the kaizen activities are just starting to gain traction. So more robotics coming forward, but we will invest in that, that will be in that 2%. And because of our lean transformation, we don't need as much dollars. We can divert some of that what we've traditionally done into more CapEx towards robotics.","On the additive side, that's a big deal to us. We've got three centers of excellence, so we've decided strategically that we're not going to have -- this is not the kind of process you're going to have 80 of them, like one for every division.","So we have two centers of excellence for Aerospace and we've got one for the entire company, and that one for the entire company really acts as an incubator for all the Industrial divisions as well as also for Aerospace, and we're working on proprietary material powder blending and processes.","So there's a lot of good work that we're very close to having our first production parts both industrially and Aerospace to make it into the field utilizing additive. I'd tell you, the other thing on additive is designing for additives.","So we have a program working on designing it for additive world, because it's very important to design the next generation of products thinking about an additive manufacturing process versus designing it in the subtraction world.","You were asking about supply chain, we've always been, view on supply chain, and so we like to make, buy and sell in the region for the region. So maybe you're asking about China, do we feel still good about China? And we really do, I mean we've not over positioned ourselves in China where we think we're over extended. We still have low-cost centers there that we're very happy with. China is still a huge country for us and we need to be there to service that.","And so I don't think you can see us doing much big CapEx shifts like building a bunch of plants in Indonesia. We have the footprint we need and maybe just some minor tweaking up lines, but it will be immaterial.","Andrew Obin","And I'll just sneak in one more follow-up on collaborative robotics. I know that you had a big rollout program, I believe you did. Where are you in that terms sort of kaizen versus actual physical rolling out of capacity?","Tom Williams","Heavy on the kaizen activity, early days still in the collaborative robots. We have several, lots of them in all of our factories, but we particularly strategically emphasized kaizen's first.","You talk to most senseis that are experts in this kind of transformation, they will encourage to do the same thing. And it's a lot faster dollars to the bottom line and a lot more CapEx friendly.","And collaborative robotics is really CapEx -friendly as well. It's going to be a light touch on CapEx. I don't see that as an issue, but the thrust has been, let's do the kaizen, let's get the processes right first.","Andrew Obin","Really appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Catherine Suever","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ann Duignan","Yeah, hi. Most of my specific questions have been answered, but Tom, maybe I'll throw this one at you. If you look at where your end markets are today versus where we were when we went into the industrial recession in '15 and '16, it strikes me that as we look at the number of end markets that are down or negative right now, it's much more broad based.","Do you worry at all that heading into calendar year 2020, we're facing much broader decline when you include automotive, heavy-duty truck, you take the impact of Boeing 737 MAX, if that production schedule declines? It looks to me like we've got a pretty broad-based set of end market declining.","Tom Williams","Okay. Ann, it's Tom, I'll make a comment, let me touch on the MAX real quickly for a second. So the MAX for us, in our guidance we put in 42 months and because it's first fit and most of our content there is very low margin, it's immaterial to us pretty much of that schedule is to change, but I just want you to know we put it in a 42. So I think we're in good shape on that.","But I think your characterization is pretty accurate. This is a more broad based, but not as deep type of softness. The '15 and '16 industrial recession was a sharp contraction in natural resources.","So you had all the natural resource related end markets, as we all remember, went down significantly and so that was more isolated. This is a little more broader based, and my comment earlier on that we have two-thirds of our markets and accelerating decline is an indicator that we have some pockets that are unusually down, things like semiconductor, power gen. But we're hopeful on power gen, that's starting to find a bottom, and that we are also hopeful actually on semiconductors, it's starting to find a bottom as well.","Ann Duignan","And yes, I just wanted to follow up on the Boeing 737. Isn't there a risk that again that becomes more broad based? It's not just about what you supply onto the airplane, but there are a lot of kind of second derivative impacts that could impact your business.","Tom Williams","I'm not exactly sure what you're referring to, because it would just be reflecting our bill of materials there. You are talking about the general supply chain that supports Boeing?","Ann Duignan","Yeah. I am just thinking about the impact of pulling down the schedule at one large manufacturing facility and how that might impact some of your industrial Distribution businesses.","Tom Williams","Okay. I see what you are saying. I think that would be very minor. Basically, you won't be able to find it. So they shut down the plant at Redmond for 20 days or whatever on a temporary basis. It would be immaterial to us as far as the implant, things that we do on the industrial side.","Ann Duignan","Okay, I'll leave it there. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Catherine Suever","Thank you, Ann.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Catherine Suever","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Yes. So I just want to touch on international orders. We saw the year-over-year deteriorating from last quarter on an easier comp. So I'm just curious if you maybe just talk about geographically where you saw the incremental weakness? And then I've got a follow-up.","Tom Williams","Yeah Nigel, it's Tom. So on international, that composition of that minus 8%, we had both EMEA and Asia Pacific at about the same, at high-single digit declines, and we had Latin America low-single positive -- remember Latin America's small, so it's not really enough to move the needle.","And the way that trended in the quarter is that Asia Pacific weakened in May, but stayed stable in June. So May -- stepped down from April to May, but May and June were pretty well flat.","And then Europe was pretty consistent. It was in that high-single digit level the entire quarter. So, no real variation going in April to June, and in Latin America we saw some variation, but in general, slight growth.","Nigel Coe","And then in Europe, have you seen any signs of a bottom there or is it still very consistent [indiscernible]?","Tom Williams","I think my description of the markets earlier on that I went through is a pretty good indicator for Europe as well. So that's how we would characterize here. The only difference in Europe will be maybe a little weaker distribution channel than we have in North America, but that will be the key difference.","Nigel Coe","And then my follow-up is really maybe just touching on what Ann was digging into. Going back to '15 and '16, we saw North America negative 12%. And certainly, the order numbers don't support that kind of deterioration. But maybe just take a step back and characterize what you're seeing today, what you're hearing from the field from your channel partners and characterize what you're hearing today to what you saw in '15 and '16?","Tom Williams","Yeah, Nigel, this feels very different, I mean, distinctly different. '15 and '16 was a commodity-driven reduction. If you remember, the commodity prices weakened dramatically. The only equipment that went in there, the demand dried up. We had oil and gas prices dropped dramatically. So it was a very different type of downturn.","This one is, like I mentioned earlier on, is broader based. I think our forecast was realistic. Part of why we studied those pressure curves was just look at what history has shown us going back, -- data back 10 years and the financial crisis today, and that 12 months to 18 months interval was fairly consistent over those cycles. But the big difference for me is sharp spike down and natural resources before, this one a lot more broader based across a broader base of end markets, but not as severe.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Thanks.","Catherine Suever","Thanks Nigel. Liz, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Catherine Suever","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones","Thanks for fitting me in. First question, I just want to follow up on this conversation about the shallowness of this pullback and perhaps its duration. Tom, it sounds like a lot of your outlook for when we recover from this is based on historical correlations and historical outlooks for the businesses. You did say this is a difference of '15 and '16. Do you need some kind of trade resolution here in order to see that recovery? Do you need to avoid a hard Brexit, are there geopolitical things here that maybe they don't make this decline any deeper than it is that you're projecting but maybe it makes it longer than you're projecting and just how you're thinking about those kinds of things?","Tom Williams","Yeah, Nathan, it's Tom. So I want to clarify, in case anybody took my comments the wrong way. We're not using a pressure curve history as to how we predict future sales. It's just one data point on top of our customers, our distributors, our divisions, et cetera, okay? So it's just one of many additions to the regression models we have, but it's just another element that I wanted to share.","You know, I think that as far as this forecast, it does not assume any kind of trade resolution. So if we had some kind of trade resolutions, and there was a really positive, that would be upside to us.","Obviously, this doesn't -- and resolution of Brexit or however that happens, that will be immaterial to us, it's not big enough to move the needle. And we're always subject to, if there was something geopolitical event out of our control, but I can't forecast those type of things.","Let's not assume any kind of upside on trade. It's really mirroring the current order entry that we have for the full first half and then we get some help on comps. And as we went through the markets, this is all those markets that we think are going to go from negative to neutral or from neutral to positive, and then we track all these end markets and where they are in those four phases. And when you have two-thirds of them in Phase 3, that's an indicator that you're going to start to turn, your next phase is going to be [indiscernible] in decline, and that's what we put in the forecast.","So there was a whole bunch of different angles we looked at it. As you know, forecast is only as good as the most current data and we'll update you every quarter and hopefully give you even better information.","Nathan Jones","Okay. My follow-up questions, a little more longer-term on Aerospace in the margins. You guys said 5.6% in engineering expenses in 2019, 4.5% to 5% in 2020. Does that continue to decline going forward?","And then maybe you can comment on the mix as we go out a few years. I think you're fairly heavily on commercial OE at the moment, and that should switch as we go forward to a little more commercial aftermarket and clearly those are at opposite ends of the margin scale. So just any qualitative commentary you could give on how you think margins should progress in Aerospace over the next few years.","Tom Williams","Yeah. Nathan, it's Tom again. So we feel very good about margins in Aerospace in the future. The current mix of OE to aftermarket for Aerospace is 64% OE, 36% aftermarket. And you're right, that won't necessarily change much, say, over the next three years to five years.","But once you start going beyond that and we start having shop visits and you are looking at the engine content and the airframe content, that is going to gradually start to move, a point or two movement on that is a big deal to us from a margin standpoint. The NRE, that 4.5% to 5% of our guiding for FY20, I think it's a pretty good future number to use as well.","And so the other advantage that Aerospace has, besides the mix you referred to is that it still has ample opportunity just like the rest of the company on the Win Strategy. It's got opportunities on kaizen.","It has additional opportunities and that all the entry into service part that they are doing today, which your first pump versus your 100th pump versus your 500th pump, we're going to work down that learning curve and we will have some cost advantages, not in this next 12 months, but as you work through that, we're going to have cost advantages on entering to service learning. So it's a business we're very bullish on from a margin expansion.","Nathan Jones","Very helpful. Thanks for fitting me in.","Catherine Suever","Okay, thank you, Nathan. All right, this concludes our Q&A and our earnings call. Thank you everyone for joining us today. Robin and Jeff will be available to take your calls should you have any further questions. Everybody have a great day. Thank you."],"16739":["Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call April 28, 2015 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Robin Davenport - Vice President, Corporate Finance","Thomas Williams - Chief Executive Officer","Lee Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer","Jon Marten - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration","Analysts","Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research Group","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Mig Dobre - Robert W.

My name is Alex and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session toward the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Robin Davenport, Vice President, Corporate Finance. Please proceed.","Robin Davenport","Thank you, Alex. Good morning and welcome to Parker Hannifin\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today is Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Marten.","Today\u2019s presentation slides together with the audio webcast replay will be accessible on the company\u2019s investor information website at www.phstock.com for one year following today\u2019s call.","On Slide 2, you\u2019ll find the company\u2019s Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning\u2019s press release and are posted on Parker\u2019s website, at www.phstock.com.","Today\u2019s call agenda appears on Slide 3. To begin, our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams will provide highlights for the third quarter. And following Tom\u2019s comments, I\u2019ll provide a review of the company\u2019s third quarter performance together with the revised guidance for fiscal year 2015. Tom will provide a few summary comments and then we\u2019ll open the call for a question-and-answer session.","So at this time, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to Slide #4.","Thomas Williams","Thank you. Robin. And welcome to everybody on the call. We certainly appreciate your participation today and your interest in Parker. I\u2019ll take a few minutes to share our perspectives on the quarter, some near-term market trends and our outlook. Also we\u2019ll briefly discuss where we are in the process of refreshing our Win Strategy to take Parker\u2019s performance to the next level.","First, a few comments on our third quarter: Overall, we performed well, concerning an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment, which includes weaknesses in key end-markets and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Sales declined 6% this quarter primarily as a result of changes in foreign currency rates. We also saw order rates decline a minus 4% this quarter, first declines in orders since March of 2013.","Despite factors such as currency mix and end-market trends working against us, I am pleased we held total segment operating margins at 14.2%. This mostly reflects the benefits of restructuring activities we put in place previously and the ability of our businesses to adapt quickly to changing market conditions.","Earnings per share were $2.02 per diluted share representing a 26% increase from the prior year third quarter. Adjusted for restructuring expenses, earnings were $2.06 per diluted share in the fiscal 2015 third quarter, an increase of 10% compared with adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.88 in fiscal 2014 third quarter.","Year-to-date operating cash flow through the end of the third quarter was $791 million or 8.3% of the sales. We\u2019ve been active with our share repurchase program following our October announcement of our new authorization of the repurchase of $2 billion to $3 billion in shares in over two years. We remain committed to completing the share repurchase plan within that time period. To that end, we repurchased $477 million worth of Parker shares in the quarter, which brings our total for the fiscal year to-date to $1.3 billion.","A few comments on current market trends, the strong dollar and negative trends in construction, agriculture, and oil and gas impacted our third quarter fiscal year 2015 results. We continue to see positive trends in heavy-duty truck and long-term strength in our Aerospace business. And total organic growth was flat for the current quarter. And we\u2019ll provide you more details as we normally do during our Q&A session.","Regarding the guidance, declining order rates, combined with negative indicators at key end-markets and ongoing currency headwinds had influenced our outlook for the full fiscal year. Adjusted guidance has been revised to a range of $7.55 to $7.75 per diluted share and excludes $0.17 per diluted share of previously announced restructuring expenses and $0.13 per diluted share associated with the voluntary retirement program.","We believe that our voluntary retirement program is a constructive first step towards our efforts to reduce overhead to the simplification of our business processes. We will further define our enterprise focus and efficiency initiatives in August. We see an opportunity to have a more efficient overhead structure.","While managing our business through these more immediate challenges we continue to focus on the long-term. As I referenced on the last call, the Win Strategy will continue as the business system, an overarching strategy for the company. However, now it\u2019s an opportune time to refresh the Win Strategy using input from key stakeholders. Our leadership team continues to spend time with Parker customers and employees globally as well as our shareholders and investors to shape our plans.","We intend to take the company\u2019s performance to the next level which we define as top quartile performance of among our diversified industrial peers. As the details to these plans are beginning to take shape I\u2019m encouraged by what I see. And the opportunities we have to improve performance.","Later this year, we will unveil greater detail on our future plans and we have scheduled an Investor Day in New York on November 3, to share more with investors. For now, I\u2019ll hand things back to Robin to few more details on the quarter.","Robin Davenport","Thank you, Tom. At this time, please refer to Slide #5 and I will begin addressing earnings per share for the quarter.","Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $2.06 versus $1.88 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.18 or 10%. This excludes the restructuring, which originally planned at $0.08 was actually $0.04 in the quarter and compares to $0.28 for the same quarter last year.","Moving to Slide 6, you\u2019ll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.88 for the third quarter and fiscal year 2014 to $2.06 for the third quarter of this year. Income of $0.32 was realized in other, as a result of currency gains. The most significant portion is attributed to the un-pegging of the Swiss franc to the euro during the quarter. This resulted in an unexpected one-time intercompany settlement gain. Together with currency transaction gains realized from the netting of our international intercompany balances.","Additionally, the impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.14 per share offsets to adjusted per share income included lower segment operating income $0.18 per share driven by the strengthened U.S. dollar currency translation, increased interest expense of $0.07. And higher comparative corporate G&A that equated to $0.03 per share.","Moving to Slide 7, with the review of total company\u2019s sales and segment operating margin, total company organic sales in the third quarter was flat at 0.02% over the same quarter last year. There was minimal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact was higher than planned equating to a negative impact and reported sales of $205 million or 6.1% in the quarter.","As shown on the bottom of this slide, total company\u2019s segment operating margins for the third quarter adjusted for restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were 14.4% versus 14.7% for the same quarter last year. Restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were $8 million, versus $60 million last year.","The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $456 million, versus $494 million last year, reflects the meaningful impact of the strengthened U.S. dollar against foreign currency.","Moving to Slide 8, I\u2019ll discuss the business segments starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the third quarter, North American organic sales were flat as compared to the same quarter last year. There was no impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 1.1% in the quarter.","Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $237 million, as compared to $243 million driven by the impact of currency translation and unfavorable mix as a result of softening trends in key end-markets.","I\u2019ll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on Slide 9. Organic sales for the quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 2%, while acquisitions made minimal contributions currency negatively impacted sales by 13.6%. Adjusting for restructuring costs operating margins for the third quarter were 12.7% as compared to 13.7% in the prior year which reflects the impact of the strengthened U.S. dollar.","Restructuring expenses in the quarter were $7 million, as compared to $59 million in the prior year. I will now move to Slide 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 5.7% for the quarter. With no impact from acquisitions currency posted a modest negative impact of 0.8%.","The sales growth for the period was driven by higher commercial OEM and military aftermarket business. Operating margins for the quarter increased 120 basis points from 11.7% to 12.9%, due primarily to higher margin aftermarket sales volume and lower development costs.","Now moving to Slide 11, with the detail of orders, changes by segment, just as a reminder, Parker orders represented trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year excluding acquisitions, divestitures in currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average.","Total orders shifted to a negative 4% for the quarter end, reflecting the swift downturn in oil and gas, construction and agriculture, which represents three major industrial end-markets for Parker. Diversified Industrial North American orders for the current ended decreased to negative 6%. Diversified Industrial International orders decreased to negative 3% for the quarter. Aerospace systems orders decreased to negative 3% for the quarter, against notably high prior year comparable.","On Slide 12, we review the cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, cash flow from operating activities was $791 million, or 8.3% of sales. The significant uses of cash in the third quarter were returns to our shareholders of $565 million. Share repurchases totaled $477 million and dividend payments were $88 million.","Moving to Slide 13, for the revised guidance for fiscal year 2015, guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Sales growth for the full year is adjusted for the joint venture with GE Aviation that commenced at the beginning of Q2 of fiscal 2014. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude restructuring charges and additional expense estimated for the voluntary retirement program to be incurred in Q4 2015.","Beginning with sales, total adjusted sales are expected to be in the range of a negative 4% to negative 3% as compared to the prior year. This is a reduction from previous guidance provided at the end of last quarter due to the negative impact our strengthened U.S. dollar, mainly the increase in the strength of the dollar versus the euro realized during the quarter.","We calculated the impact of currency to spot rate as of March 31, 2015 and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming Q4 of 2015. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is just under 1% with minimal impact from acquisition carryover. Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 4% which is nearly all related to Industrial International.","For total Parker adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.9% and 15.1%. This compares to 14.4% for fiscal year 2014 on an adjusted basis. The guidance for below the line items, which includes corporate administrative expenses, interest and other is $395 million for the year at the midpoint. This is lower than the previous guidance due to the third quarter favorable currency-driven adjustments. The full-year tax rate is projected at 26.5% which is a modest reduction from prior guidance. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full-year guidance is 145.6 million shares.","And on the topic of share repurchase as communicated during last quarter\u2019s earning call we remain committed to the $2 billion to $3 billion share repurchase announced in October. To-date share repurchases spent totaled 67% of the low end of the announced repurchase program and we anticipate that the balance of the commitment for repurchase will be made discretionarily over the remaining 18 months.","For the full year, revised guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is reduced to a range of $7.55 to $7.75 or $7.65 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes restructuring and voluntary retirement program expenses of approximately $60 million to be incurred in fiscal year 2015. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.30 for the full year, consisting of $0.17 for restructuring and $0.13 for voluntary retirement program expenses.","Despite the reduced projected restructuring expense previously guided savings of $23 million associated with the restructuring spend remains unchanged. Savings associated with the voluntary retirement program have not been forecasted for Q4 fiscal year 2015.","On Slide 14 you\u2019ll find a reconciliation of the major components of our revised Q4 fiscal year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to $1.86 from the prior guidance of $2.43 at the midpoint. Modest increases include $0.02 from a reduced tax rate and $0.01 from favorable reduced other expense. Key components of the decrease include a $0.38 reduction in segment operating income from translational currency resulting from the strengthened U.S. dollar and $0.22 reduction in segment operating income due to unfavorable mix and volume reduction as a result of the softening of the key end-market.","Please remember that forecasts excludes any acquisitions and divestitures that may be made during the fourth quarter. For consistency, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates. Now this concludes my prepared comments. And Tom, I will turn the call back to you for your summary comments.","Thomas Williams","Thanks, Robin. As you can see, near-term challenges are shaping our immediate actions to respond to meet our financial commitments for this year. Longer term, we see a promising future and many opportunities to drive even higher levels of performance for Parker. I know there are many employees who call in to listen to this discussion and I\u2019d like to thank you for your efforts and express my appreciation for all of your hard work. I\u2019m very confident we can build on our past successes and continue to produce strong shareholder returns.","At this time, we\u2019re ready to take questions. So, Alex, if you\u2019d like to give the instruction that will be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Please proceed.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning, guys.","Robin Davenport","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just so, I guess, to parse out some of the end-market performance you guys mentioned, if you could just, I guess, first, comment on oil, and then if you had to think about the major drivers, whether it is de-stock in some of your broader distribution, oil weakness, or the strong US dollar impacting US manufacturing in general, if you could just kind of talk through some of those items and what you saw in the quarter.","Lee Banks","Hi, Josh. This is Lee. What I\u2019ll do if it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019ll just kind of walk you through the different regions and give you some color. I think before we do that I don\u2019t want to be overly dramatic in any of these end-markets. Remember, currency was the big driver of top line here. So organically we were flat for the most part.","So starting with North America, I think the headline story there that you mentioned is oil and gas. And for us it\u2019s really upstream land-based oil and gas. We\u2019ve seen a rapid decline in global oil prices which really led to a quick deceleration in CapEx across that sector. We\u2019ve notice that a big onshore rig utilization down year-over-year, which has put a lot of on some of the OEM customer servicing that sector.","So those OEM customers continue to build but at a much slower rate than they have in the past. Our MRO and services business continue to be okay. We\u2019re in touch with some of the OEM. First fit, it is down, where we\u2019ve got MRO opportunity, that kind of continues to be good and poses opportunities for us.","We talked about mining in the past that continues to be flat to down, we don\u2019t see a recovery there soon. I think one bright spot when the Americas really comes to the energy markets, we\u2019ve seen this around traditional and renewable power gen. There has been an accelerated de-commissioning and coal-fired power plants and what we have seen is an increase in gas-fired plants along with solar and wind capacity.","So net-net, there\u2019s not new capacity being added but the switch has created some opportunity for us, not only on first fit but for our MRO distribution. And in concert with that, energy storage continues to gain momentum with battery technology advancing. We started a business unit in that area with some significant orders this quarters, so that\u2019s a real promising trend for us as we move forward. I think some other end markets in North America, heavy truck continues to be good. The line of sight we have for FY 2015 is strong with the backlog and from every indication we have FY 2016 continues to be very encouraging.","Distribution in North America, I would say as a whole remains reasonably healthy. Now, that depends what distribution you touch and where it\u2019s really focused on oil and gas they\u2019ve seen softness. But on the flip side, there has been positive on the MRO markets really in plant automotive and energy. So year-over-year I would call it about neutral when it comes to North America distribution with some plusses and some minuses.","Okay, just turn into Europe. Europe by and large continues to tread water, I guess, is a good way of saying it. We did some see some volume in margin mix degradation in the quarter, really we saw that in agricultural business, truck, oil and gas and construction. We did have quite a few oil and gas projects moved out or pushed out which were bound for the Middle East, so hopefully those will come through in later quarters.","We have heard a lot of optimism from the export markets, significantly industrial machinery. We were just at the Hanover show. There is a lot of positive sentiment, but I\u2019ll be candid with you, we haven\u2019t seen that translate yet. So time will tell and see what happens there.","Turning to Latin America, obviously being impacted by the recessions in Brazil and Argentina. Negative year-over-year growth in industrial production, we are seeing significant pullbacks in heavy truck, our large OEM customers, with plant shutdowns and workforce reductions. When it comes to offshore oil and gas in Latin America, really not much happening with what\u2019s happened with Petrobras. Some pre-salt projects have been postponed due to cash shortages and other issues. So MRO services are good, as I mentioned before, but year-over-year growth there is not there.","And then lastly turning Asia, I guess the first conversation is about China. I continue to characterize that as slow industrial production growth year-over-year. Having said that, we do see positive impact in our distribution business. Some of this is growing municipal projects, but a lot of it has to do with just growing our distribution in general, so we get a little bit of benefit there. Some positives are medical equipment manufacturing, heavy truck, and power generation really run alternate energy.","And we\u2019ve talked in the past about the contraction in construction equipment and mining, and if anything, that has taken a step down, it certainly hasn\u2019t gotten any better. And I would say lastly just talking about Asia that a bright spot is Southeast Asia continues to grow. It\u2019s a relatively small base for us, but growing quickly. A lot of infrastructure investment, agricultural investment in really energy. So all our people are - and teams are focused with our customers. This is a great opportunity for us to shine with these end markets when we have softness like this and it gives us a great opportunity to create more value for our end customers.","Josh Pokrzywinski","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Lee. And I guess if I just had a one more follow-up on that, did you guys see any de-stock in the quarter anywhere? Any quantification that would be helpful and can you talk about the cadence and anything you are seeing into April?","Thomas Williams","Hey, Josh, this is Tom. We did see some de-stocking primarily like Lee was referring to distributors that would service those end markets that were the softest oil and gas, construction, ag, and that would be OEM channel, as well as distribution. I think it\u2019s going to take a couple quarters to play through. Obviously, we will stay close to it, stay close to our customers and our distributors and give you better insight in the August call. But I do think there is some more destocking that needs to play through, that\u2019s part of what you are seeing reflected in our updated guidance. And as far as current trends, the April trends, that\u2019s what\u2019s in our guidance.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Gotcha. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning. I guess my question relates to, given the weakness that you are seeing in the market and as we\u2019re approaching 2016, both Tom and Lee, I know you went through some major restructuring actions sort of last year, is there anything sort of larger that you are contemplating right now, like another round of restructuring actions, just given the weakness that you are seeing in the markets?","And then I guess just my second question is, given the weakness in the markets, are you seeing valuations come down on any acquisition opportunities and how you are thinking about acquisitions in light of weaker markets? Would you be more opportunistic, because that could potentially help 2016? Thanks.","Thomas Williams","Hey, Jamie, it\u2019s Tom. I\u2019ll try to address both of those. First, on the restructuring, you saw that we announced $0.13 for a voluntary retirement program. And that\u2019s an initial first step we\u2019re looking at is really enterprise focus and efficiency. It\u2019s really a new initiative or a continuing initiative to focus on improving our overhead costs, the overhead burden to the company, so we\u2019re working on that. You\u2019ll get more insights on the details of that in the August call, but this was an initial first step. We thought it was a constructive first step offering a voluntary retirement program.","We do think there is extra efficiencies we can get through our overhead structure, so that would be one aspect of it. Certainly, in the near term, we are doing the normal, run the business adjustments that we would normally do with short works, reducing temps, all those kind of things. But the retirement program and the overhead efficiencies is an additional step on top of the market adjustments we will be making.","On the acquisition side, haven\u2019t seen valuations turn down yet, but we are very active and we\u2019ve got reviews going monthly, reviews going quarterly with all the groups. We are starting to see activity pick up. Our desire is just like it has been historically to have 4 to 5 points of growth via acquisitions. You are right; in today\u2019s climate with softness in end markets, this is an opportune time for us to add the acquisitions and we\u2019ve got a great track record historically of being the consolidator of choice within our space and we are going to continue that. So we are very interested. Acquisitions are - it\u2019s hard to predict. They are lumpy in nature as far as coming out of the pipeline, but the activity is certainly there.","Jamie Cook","And sorry, just one follow-up on the portfolio. Are you considering - are you and Lee both considering any, as you look at Parker\u2019s organic growth, I would say investors have been disappointed over the past couple of years. A lot of it is macro, I get that, but are you considering any portfolio changes within Parker, any potential divestitures of sort of lower growth or commoditized businesses, or is that off the table?","Thomas Williams","No, I mean, I would say a couple things on the growth side. One, we always look at portfolio continuously through the business cycle. And you\u2019ve seen us in the past make adjustments, so that\u2019s something we always take a look at and there is nothing major at this point, but we always look at it and certainly we would update you if we had any changes. But on the gross side, in addition to acquisitions, Lee touched on a little bit at the end of his end markets, this is a great time for us to take share.","We are only 11% share of the total motion control space, and we\u2019ve got all of our teams around the world focused on trying to gain share by account by account, market by market, so that would be one aspect of it. The other part is, we\u2019ve rolled out a new growth incentive plan starting this year with the full impact of that being next year and it\u2019s a growth multiplier on top of our annual incentive plan, which is the RONA plan, which some of you may be familiar with our RONA plan, which is done division by division, goes all the way from the general manager down to the operator on the floor.","But what we\u2019ve added is an incentive, if you grow faster than the market, and we are defined on the market as the median of our proxy peers, there is an additional kicker to your RONA and a very nice kicker that really accelerates and encourages growth, but also if you grow slower than the market, there is a negative consequence where there is actually a deduct to your annual incentive.","So I think that comes into full play next year, so I think that will drive the right kind of behavior incentive. And I think you are familiar with our - the key things we are going after with the Win Strategy on growth, those continue. But I think the other aspect would be services. Our e-business, the Parker.com channel, while very young as far as from a commercial standpoint, I\u2019m very pleased with the progress the team has made there. We have a much better - from a customer friendliness standpoint and feedback. That website has improved dramatically, so attracting, finding, helping customers buy a product and then service them I think our website has clearly improved dramatically.","So that in addition to other service things on the asset integrity and part tracking, so there\u2019s a number of things besides I will call the traditional growth playbook that we are doing to help grow organically. But right now, I would love to do more acquisitions and we\u2019re certainly going to focus on that as well.","Jamie Cook","All right, thanks. I will get back in queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","John Inch","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Robin Davenport","Good morning, John.","John Inch","Good morning. Did any of the verticals that we talked about, did that - any of them actually sequentially improve, or was this a matter of ag, construction, oil and gas got bad and the others also sort of softened, but just softened by less? And I guess if you could parse your answer in both North America and Europe, that would be great.","Lee Banks","John, this is Lee. I would say sequentially improved. Heavy trucks in the transportation improved sequentially. Power generation sequentially and these are really North America-centric what I\u2019m giving you right now. There are some smaller ones here, semiconductor sequentially.","I would say flat would be areas like process industries had been flat sequentially. Rail has been flat sequentially, and I think that has to do probably with what\u2019s happening with the oil markets right now, and then areas like forestry. What has been negative sequentially are areas that we talked about, oil and gas, mining to name a couple.","John Inch","And Lee, would that read through in terms of what you just described, also would that map to your orders? In other words, you are sort of giving me the trend in the quarter; what about the mapping to the orders? Was there any differences there or would you (multiple speakers)?","Lee Banks","John, I would say that is pretty consistent with the order trend.","John Inch","And that I\u2019m assuming is North America. What about Europe? You are a big company in Europe. Did you find similar trends, or is it a little bit different?","Lee Banks","I would say similar. Distribution was okay. That\u2019s really driven by MRO sequentially in Europe, machine tools was up. I\u2019m always careful, because when we talk sequentially, I\u2019m talking about our Q2 versus Q3, Q2 is such a soft quarter. So I don\u2019t want to make too much of these sequential numbers, if that makes sense to you, John.","John Inch","Yes, well, I was trying to put into a context of what you normally would have expected to see sequentially considering, to your point, you\u2019ve got some seasonality and year-over-year comparison, so I think I get it?","Thomas Williams","Go ahead.","Lee Banks","Sequentially, we would always want to see Q3 bigger than Q2 I think, which was really - which we didn\u2019t expect was the deceleration in upstream oil and gas. We would not have expected that going into Q3.","John Inch","And you have said oil and gas is 6% of the company. The one thing, of course, that we knew was going to happen not pertaining to Parker specifically was the derivative impact of oil-producing states like Texas, the Dakotas, et cetera. I mean, is that what you also realized, so directly it was 6%, but the indirect perhaps was more broadly felt and is there any way to kind of put a handle around that?","Lee Banks","Absolutely, the derivatives of oil and gas had a negative impact. It is really hard to attach a number to it. We work hard to attach the 6% oil and gas, so they try and get all the periphery industries is difficult, but you could definitely see it throughout the markets in the channel.","John Inch","Maybe just one last one, if these trends don\u2019t really change much, which could be a scenario, as we roll into 2016, the one thing that seems striking is that there is going to be some relatively tough compares right, in the September and December quarters for 2016 and then, of course, we\u2019ve got global line stuff this quarter. Is there any reason to think that 2016 the first-half is actually going to improve versus the current trend based on your thinking today?","Thomas Williams","Hey, John. On 2016 is probably too early for us to comment. We\u2019re just now starting to roll up numbers for 2016, and we haven\u2019t even had our initial meetings. So what we\u2019ve got in our guidance and the comments we\u2019ve made are Q4. I did mention obviously the de-stocking we thought will continue for a couple quarters, but it\u2019s too early for us to give you an input for 2016, and we\u2019ll certainly give you a lot of detail when we do the August update.","John Inch","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Robin Davenport","Thank you, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Please proceed.","Eli Lustgarten","Good morning, everyone.","Robin Davenport","Good morning, Eli.","Eli Lustgarten","Can we get a little bit into the fourth-quarter guidance because, when I look at it, if I\u2019m interpreting correctly, the North American sales decline is in line with the order decline at the mid-single digit, but it looks like the diversified rest of the world international has a huge decline and I assume when you start talking 20% plus, you start talking about at least 15% plus is currency and then it\u2019s a bigger decline than the order weakness we saw. So it just looks like there is a very, very weak fourth quarter coming in international. Can you give us some color on what is going on in the two markets?","Robin Davenport","So, Eli, you are right, I mean, the significant driver, probably two-thirds of that is related to the currency translation. Likewise, we are also seeing that there is unfavorable mix and some volume impact as reflected through the orders as well as a result of this softness in the key end markets. So those are really the primary things that are going on with the change in revenues and then the follow-on impact on the operating margins.","Eli Lustgarten","But it is a very, very weak international quarter that is coming, particularly versus a tough comparison last year. Is that fair?","Robin Davenport","Certainly, but again a big part of that is on the currency translation.","Eli Lustgarten","And can you talk a bit about what\u2019s happening in pricing across the marketplace, both here and particularly outside North America on the products? I mean, there\u2019s not much inflation, but in these kind of demand scenarios, it seems that pricing is going to get a bit complicated across the board. You guys do better in pricing than anybody else in the industry, but can you give us some idea of what you are facing at this point?","Lee Banks","Yes, Eli, it\u2019s Lee. I would say pricing, it\u2019s a challenging environment to say the least with the - with currency movements, et cetera. Having said that, net-net, we still are positive year-over- year from a currency standpoint - but I mean from a pricing standpoint, but it is something that we work regionally and through all our channels every single week and every single day.","Eli Lustgarten","And I guess the assumption is that this fourth quarter is going to be tough. And you don\u2019t expect much business conditions other than seasonally and maybe into some restocking as we go - as we enter the second-half of calendar 2015. Is that a fair way of characterizing what is going on?","Lee Banks","I think that\u2019s a fair way of characterizing it.","Eli Lustgarten","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Robin Davenport","Thank you, Eli.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Jeff Hammond","Hey, good morning, guys.","Robin Davenport","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Hammond","Hey, just wanted to come back to, Robin, your mix comments, what\u2019s really driving that? Is it certain end markets or weaker distribution? And are you - did you see that in the quarter and in the order outlook?","Robin Davenport","So, yes, Jeff, it basically links back to the key end markets that we talked about where we saw that softening, so ag, construction and oil and gas. So those are the big impacters there.","Jeff Hammond","So those just have better mix ultimately and so that\u2019s driving the negative mix in the margins?","Robin Davenport","Certainly on the oil and gas side in particular, yes.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. Is there a way to quantify kind of the magnitude of these order declines in those three markets you called out, I mean, are we seeing like down 15% to 20%, or\u2026?","Jon Marten","Jeff, this is Jon. In terms of the magnitude of the order decline again, I think you\u2019ve got a couple of things that are going on here. The first one we\u2019ve talked about, oil and gas and we\u2019ve talked about ag. These are relatively small parts of our - of the total company, and the decline that we\u2019ve seen there is in line with what we\u2019ve seen with the macro conditions around the world. We\u2019re not really in a position to be able to give you an exact number, but they were material enough that we thought that we should just make sure that we mentioned it to give you additional color.","So they\u2019ve impacted things and as Lee and Tom have talked about, there have been other markets that have been strengthening, including aerospace and heavy-duty truck. And, again, when we\u2019re talking about what we are seeing internationally, of course, keep in mind that when we\u2019re giving guidance, we\u2019re using the currency rate at March - at the end of March. And so that\u2019s the lion\u2019s share of what\u2019s happening with those end markets. It\u2019s not the contraction of them, it is the impact that we are seeing from currency due to the sharp decline, in terms of the increased strength of the dollar here for the quarter.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. And then just - go ahead. So just finally on the M&A pipeline, it still sounds pretty lean, so maybe just speak to kind of the bias on buyback given kind of the lean M&A. Does that kind of bias you towards that high end of the $2 billion to $3 billion?","Thomas Williams","Jeff, this is Tom. We are committed to the $2 billion to $3 billion. I would say that our preference is we would really like to do more acquisitions. The output right now, we haven\u2019t had any output - but the activity is increasing significantly within the company. The cadence around it, and the number of properties that we are looking at are all increasing, so I\u2019m encouraged by that. Like I mentioned earlier, it is lumpy and it\u2019s hard to predict the output, but our goal is to still have acquisitions 4% to 5%. So that being said, the ideal mix would be we would do $2 billion approximately of the share repurchase in the billion of acquisitions over that time period that we announced. But if the acquisitions do not materialize then we will make up the difference with a share repurchase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas Williams","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Tom, your comment on overhead simplification I thought was interesting. I went back and did some analysis and looked at the past 20 years. I noticed just as a percentage of sales that you really hadn\u2019t seen much of a change in your corporate expense again as a percentage of sales. And just given the amount of growth that you\u2019ve had in the business, I would\u2019ve assumed that there was a little bit more operating leverage. And so I am just curious, how are you thinking about the aspirational target on what you can do on the simplification side to get your cost structure down?","Thomas Williams","Yes, and we do have very much - we have a keen interest in this area, we are looking at overheads across the entire company, so it would be corporate at the group level and at the divisions and looking at it in aggregate and it\u2019s really all about trying to simplify the company, have it more focused, have it be more efficient to have less of an overhead burn for every dollar of revenue that we take into the company. This is going to take multiple reviews internally, we have a number of them happening in May and June, so it\u2019s early days.","The early retirement, we felt was a really constructive first step that would be attractive to potential employees, as we try to move towards becoming more efficient from an overhead structure, even more efficient. I would say we have done historically a pretty good job there, but I think as a team collectively we are looking for opportunities to do better there. So I am not ready to give you what we think is going to come out of that, but we will in August. We will give you the details of what we think we are going to yield from this and then of course what the potential cost might be there.","Joe Ritchie","That\u2019s helpful. I guess maybe one follow-up question on the margin ramp, especially in aero, in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m just curious like whether there is any one-time items that are really going to benefit the margins in the quarter. I know that last year you had about a 350 basis point benefit from a claims settlement and so it looks like the margin guidance implies a pretty significant ramp. I am just curious if there\u2019s - what is driving that ramp in 4Q?","Jon Marten","Yes, Joe, Jon here. I think the ramp in Q4 is something that we\u2019ve seen historically. You are right, this time last year, there was a significant settlement on a few contracts. We typically are negotiating all year long and quite often, we will able to settle some outstanding either assertions that we have or issues that come up between ourselves and our suppliers, or our customers and so we have seen that pattern in last few years. There is not one particular thing though that is driving this result that we are seeing in Q4 as part of our guidance. It is more of a general bottoms-up review of each one of the operations and this is what we came out here, which will continue to bode well for us going forward.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. And maybe one last question on the restructuring benefits. What are you guys expecting for the benefits in 4Q and how do we think about 2016 at this point given all the restructuring actions you have taken thus far year-to-date?","Jon Marten","Yes, we want to - we have an estimate in for Q4 for the restructuring as it relates to the voluntary retirement program. We want to - before we commit to a savings number, we want to roll up all of the FY 2016 and we want to make sure that we understand who and how the take-up rate on the program is executed during the quarter. And so we won\u2019t know that, until we come out with our update in August, so we won\u2019t be able to give you a really good idea of something that is factual until August. And at that time, we will be very detailed in terms of what we expect in terms of the savings from the voluntary retirement program.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Robin Davenport","Thank you, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Robert Baird. Please proceed.","Mig Dobre","Good morning, everyone.","Robin Davenport","Good morning, Mig.","Mig Dobre","Sticking with international, one of the things that really surprised me is really your updated guidance. You have reduced your margin guidance by 150 basis points for fiscal 2016 after only one quarter, if you would, worth of changes in terms of end markets in the environment. This is well below your 15% target after roughly two years of restructuring. So If or one am a little bit confused as to how I should be thinking about sustainable margins for this business going forward. Any help here would be great.","Jon Marten","Two-thirds of the reduction in the guidance internationally relates to what we are seeing from a currency standpoint. Now we have seen such sharp currency trends that it takes - there\u2019s a matter of timing that is involved here, Mig. We are very optimistic long term. We will be back up at the 15% plus rate that we expect from those operations, but there is a timing issue where we\u2019ve got to make sure that we are keeping up with the trends in the marketplace. So that\u2019s about two-thirds of what is happening with the international margins.","The other one-third of it is really being impacted by what we are seeing on the ground in some of the end markets that Lee and Tom talked about those end markets that they called out are unfortunately for us having an impact on the mix and because of that, that mix issue, what we are seeing a very slight degradation for us in those margins. Historically, over the years, our margins for international as reflected in our guidance is 13.4%, and we are really seeing a slow ramp up to the 15% that we were talking about this time last year.","All the savings that we are getting from the very successful restructuring program that we executed on last year are just being masked by what we are seeing in the currency and then these new trends and some of these end markets. So we are not backing off our determination to make those businesses 15% plus going forward here. It is just a confluence of events and that is really impacting us. And like I say, almost two-thirds of it clearly related just to the currency and the impact there as the strong dollar impacts the translation of our earnings outside the U.S. into our income statement.","Mig Dobre","All right, I appreciate that. Then it is fair to say basically as we are looking out that we should be thinking about currency impact really as well as mix and maybe try to think about scaling up margins as these effects become diminished as fiscal 2016 would progress. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Jon Marten","I think so, yes. I think that is very, very, very true.","Mig Dobre","All right. And then my last question is on aerospace. An order decline here, and your orders are on an LTM basis, I think this is the first decline since the Great Recession. Can this business grow in the next 12 months?","Jon Marten","Yes, Mig. Absolutely. Please do not read too much into that. We were - had a bad comps here for this quarter. We\u2019ve got built-in growth rates due to all of our wins in excess of 5% per year and that has not changed. There was a significant - we were up mid-double digits this time last year. A lot of those orders related to FY 2016 again because of the long term nature of the business. So I can go through that with you in more detail, but we are not concerned about the impact of those order rates on the long term. We still feel very confident in our long term growth assumptions that we\u2019ve come out with.","Mig Dobre","Great. Thank you, guys.","Jon Marten","Okay.","Robin Davenport","Thank you, Mig.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Robin Davenport","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones","Just following up on the last caller, you talked about a timing issue on international margins related to FX. Can you talk about how long that takes to get through before we will start to see improvement there?","Jon Marten","We - it will take a quarter or two is what our estimates are. This is something that we are all working very hard around the world to make sure that we are reacting to. But as you know very well, Nathan, I mean to take the euro down to $1.06 for us at the end of March, that, as well as the strength of the dollar versus almost all other currencies, that has had an impact on us. And in some cases we have - not in all - but in some cases we need to make very quick turns and pivots in terms of our pricing and we are working on that.","Nathan Jones","Okay. And then obviously some different drivers this time, but some of the data starting to look a little bit like your 2012, 2013 numbers. We saw four quarters of mid-single digit order declines there, margins compressed about 200 basis points. Is there some reason why we shouldn\u2019t be thinking about that as a base case scenario going forward over the next 12 months?","Jon Marten","Well, I think the answer to that is we should not expect that as a base case. I think that what is different, the successful massive restructuring that we did last year, that is bleeding over into expected future margins that we are going to see, a program that Tom outlined in terms of our overhead efficiency that is going to make us even more efficient going forward and our ability to grow in markets that we are not talking about too much on this call that is really going to help us in the out period. So I am very, very optimistic about us going forward.","We are certainly going to see an increase in our aerospace margins as time goes on also. And because of the actions that we took in Europe, because of the markets that will continue to grow in North America and because of the aerospace segment actions and wins that we took a few years ago, I don\u2019t feel like we are going to see a repeat of that time period, so kind of a long-winded answer, Nathan, but wanted to be responsive.","Nathan Jones","Okay. And one more, you did talk about industrial machinery exports potentially improving in Europe with them becoming more competitive with lower currency. Have you started to see any impact in Europe from the lower currency over there making European economies more competitive? Any greenshoots of that or any expectation?","Lee Banks","Nathan, it\u2019s Lee. I\u2019m not ready to say that at this point in time. There\u2019s certainly a lot of hope and a lot of conversation, but to see strong evidence of that, I can\u2019t see that yet.","Nathan Jones","All right. Thanks very much.","Robin Davenport","Thank you, Nathan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Joel Tiss","[indiscernible] in, how are you doing, guys?","Robin Davenport","Good morning, Joel.","Joel Tiss","I just have - a lot has been asked and you guys have been great about answering everything. I just wondered if you guys share the historic view that the aerospace is a little bit too small of a percent of the whole company.","Thomas Williams","Yes, Joel. It\u2019s Tom. Ideally, we would like to get aerospace to be 20% of the portfolio. Today, it runs around 15% or 16%. So we would like it to be a bigger piece it acts as a counter cycle to the shorter cycle industrial part. It shares all common technologies across the company. There\u2019s parts of it that we would really like to build out, which I won\u2019t necessarily say publicly because I don\u2019t want to tip my hand as far as what we might want to be investing in, but there\u2019s a lot of it that we very much would like to build out and the aerospace team is working that as we speak, both organically and through acquisitions.","Joel Tiss","And is it safe to assume that there is nothing really big in the acquisition pipeline, or else you guys would balance the share repurchase and the acquisitions a little more?","Thomas Williams","Joel, it\u2019s Tom again. The pipeline is getting more active, and - I\u2019ll probably never be happy with the volume there, but it is getting more active, so I\u2019m pleased with that. Our sweet spot will continue to be in the $30 million to $300 million revenue range. That being said, we are a big company. We could do a bigger acquisition, but I think you will see us - the majority of activity is going to be in our traditional wheelhouse as far as revenue size.","Joel Tiss","And the last one, I just wondered why not top decile instead of top quartile? Is there anything from what you see today and what you\u2019ve seen historically that makes it more realistic to reach for the top quartile instead of the top decile of industrial profitability?","Thomas Williams","This is Tom again. Are you talking about top 10% versus top 25%, that is your?","Joel Tiss","Yes, yes. You guys have been in the top 25% probably for most of the last decade.","Thomas Williams","Yes. When we look at - it is against our proxy peers is what we are comparing to and it\u2019s a pretty competitive group and there are some metrics where we are not in the top quartile where we would like to get into the top quartile and when we give you the Win Strategy refresh November 3 for the Investor Day, we\u2019re going to give you a vision of where we would like to take the company and that will include some metric expectations and give you an idea how and how long it will take us to get there. The bottom line is we think we can take - the company has done extremely well.","The Win Strategy has been really a unifying document for the company, a defining strategy, but we think there is an opportunity to take it to the next level, which in turn will take the total company to the next level. And I can just tell you for everybody on the phone as well we\u2019ve gotten - both Lee and I have gotten tremendous interest and participation as we\u2019ve been going around talking to our employees about the new Win Strategy and there\u2019s lots of good ideas and we are encouraged by what we are hearing.","Joel Tiss","Great. Thank you very much.","Robin Davenport","Thank you, Joel. And Alex, I think we will take one more call.","Operator","Okay. Your last question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Steve Volkmann","Hi, good morning. Just slipped in, so just one quick detail maybe, Robin. The gain in Switzerland, how much was that exactly?","Robin Davenport","That was $0.19 attributed to the gain.","Steve Volkmann","$0.19. Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then, Tom, I think it was you in the initial comments talked about refreshing the Win Strategy and I guess you are going to try to sketch that out in more detail, but I am going to just see if I can get a little bit of a preview. Traditionally, we have had kind of pricing and lean and sourcing as sort of the key levers in Win Strategy. Are we adding additional levers, do we think there\u2019s a lot more room in the existing levers? Just give us a sense of how you think about that.","Thomas Williams","Yes, it is early for me to try to give you that, but I think the essence of why we are calling it the refresh, you\u2019re not going to see a sharp turn to the right as far as on the Win Strategy, it\u2019s going to be building on top of it. So I think it will be a combination of enhancements to the existing strategy and few new ones that we will put on there. And I think it\u2019s the combination, really the vision - there\u2019s a couple visions here. One, to be a top quartile diversified industrial company and that\u2019s kind of the overarching one.","The second is to an even stronger number one in our space, so we are only 11% share. If you looked in the back of the Win Strategy, we have always had a vision historically to be 20% market share. That would put us at a $20 billion company and that\u2019s - I mean that\u2019s the other part of it. So initiatives on how to get to be in top quartile and how to be significantly bigger - being significantly bigger number one - is going to frame the Win Strategy refresh.","Steve Volkmann","So is it safe to say win 2.0 is more focused on growth than on margin?","Thomas Williams","I would say it is always going to be balanced, you have to do both.","Steve Volkmann","Great. I appreciate it.","Robin Davenport","Okay. Thanks so much, Steve. So this concludes our Q&A and earnings call. I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us today. Todd and I will be available throughout the remainder of the day to take your calls should you have any further questions. And once again thank you and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jon Marten, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead, sir.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Thank you, Candace. And, again, good morning, everybody, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's fourth quarter FY 2016 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom Williams and President and Chief Operating Officer Lee Banks.

Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 performance, together with the guidance for FY 2017. Tom will then provide a few summary comments, and then we'll open the call for a Q&A session.","At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slides number 4 and 5.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everybody on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I'd like to cover the following key topics: our fourth quarter results, review our fiscal year 2017 guidance, and finally I'll highlight the progress we are making with the new Win Strategy.","Let me start with the fourth quarter and full-year results, which demonstrate the progress we are making in a difficult growth environment. Fourth quarter sales were $2.96 billion or a 6% decline compared with the same quarter a year ago. This represents the second consecutive quarter that we saw a sequential improvement in sales and a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis.","Total order rates for the fourth quarter declined 1% compared with the same quarter last year, and represented a sequential improvement from the third quarter level. By segment, North America is still weak, but our Aerospace Systems segment and international business order rates were positive on a year-over-year basis.","Net income for the fourth quarter increased 35% to $242 million on an as-reported basis, or a 29% increase to $260 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.77 as reported, or $1.90 on an adjusted basis. That represents a 33% increase compared to the same quarter last year on an adjusted basis.","Despite ongoing weakness in our end markets this quarter, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 14.8%, or 15.6% adjusted. This is tremendous performance and represents a 70 basis point improvement year over year in adjusted segment operating margins. Our adjusted decremental MROS was 2.9% for the fourth quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that our adjusted decrementals have been below 25%, which is the best level of performance I can remember in any previous downturn.","Just a few other full-year highlights that I'd like to note. Cash flow was strong in the quarter and also the year, with cash flow from operations, excluding the discretionary pension contribution, exceeding 12% of sales, reflecting the stability of our cash generation during a downturn. We also held inventories as a percent of sales essentially flat at 10.3% in fiscal 2016 versus 10.2% in the prior year. We executed very efficiently on the $109 million worth of business realignment. Even including this restructuring, our as-reported decremental MROS was 19.5% for the full year. And, notably, we accomplished all this while sales dropped $1.35 billion, which is very difficult to do.","Moving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we've repurchased $108 million in Parker's shares, bringing our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to $558 million. As we have now purchased $1.9 billion of Parker's shares since our share repurchase plan was announced in October 2014, we are on track to meet our commitments on capital deployment.","Regarding FY 2017 guidance, we are forecasting a year of sales being flat compared with fiscal 2016. Our expectation is that organic growth will be soft in the first quarter, becoming essentially flat in quarter two, with the second half showing 1% to 2% organic growth on a year-over-year basis. For fiscal year 2017, we're issuing guidance for as-reported earnings in a range of $6.15 to $6.95 per share, or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10, for a midpoint of $6.75. Business realignment expenses are anticipated to be approximately $48 million or $0.25 per share.","So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress with the initiatives across our four broad goals: engage people, premier customer experience, profitable growth, and financial performance.","Regarding our first goal, engage people. During this past year, we saw a 33% reduction in recordable injuries. We continue to target a zero-accident safety goal, not only because it's our responsibility to our team members, but also because improved safety performance can be a leading indicator of improved financial performance. Our high-performance teams are driving this improvement in safety as well as quality, cost, and delivery.","Now on the second goal, premier customer experience. On July 1 of this year, we launched our Likely to Recommend (6:33) initiative, which is designed to get direct feedback from customers and distributors on areas where we can improve. Importantly, we are gathering this feedback in a way that every site at Parker can understand and track their performance and make improvements. This is a significant initiative, because a better customer experience will drive faster organic growth for Parker. We're also making good progress in building our e-business capabilities that will deliver a best-in-class online experience for customers. And we are making progress developing our pipeline of Internet of Things applications across groups and product lines to enhance the value we bring to customers.","Now, moving to the third goal, profitable growth. We continue to drive innovative products and systems, expand distribution, and build our service business as part of our sales growth strategy. Acquisitions will play a role in our growth plans. We recently closed a transaction in Europe to acquire certain businesses of the J\u00e4ger group to strengthen our position in worldwide sealing markets as part of our Engineered Materials Group.","And lastly, our financial performance goal. Profitability in Aerospace is improving as we benefit from lower non-reoccurring engineering costs that were associated with some of the large program wins that we had, and improved operational efficiencies. Our simplification initiative is also gaining momentum across the company, as we discover more ways to streamline operations and better serve our customers. The best way to illustrate this is to look at our employment trends. The total number of Parker team members employed at the end of FY 2016 is at 2004 levels, or approximately 48,000 people. In fiscal 2004, our reported sales were $6.9 billion, whereas today, our sales are $11.3 billion with the same number of team members.","This is a tribute to our global team members who are working together to find better and more efficient ways to accomplish their jobs and serve our customers. The combination of our simplification and Lean enterprise initiatives is amplifying our ability to improve processes and make significant structural cost improvements. In addition, our strategic supply chain and value pricing initiatives give us sufficient horsepower to propel us to our profit margin goals in the future.","So, in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we will achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020. And this includes targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins. And progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate and earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period. I am very pleased at how far we've come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future as we strive to make Parker a top-quartile performing company as compared to our proxy peers. (9:30)","So for now I'm going to hand things back to Jon, let him give you more details on the quarter, the full year, and 2017 guidance.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Tom. And at this time please refer to slide number 6. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.","Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.90 versus $1.43 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.47. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.13, which compares to $0.16 for the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 were $6.46 versus $7.25 for the full year 2015. Total realignment expenses and pension termination costs were $0.57 for the full year 2016, and that compares to adjustments for business realignment and voluntary retirement expenses of $0.28 for the full year 2015.","On slide number 7, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 for the fourth quarter of 2015 to $1.90 for the fourth quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per-share income include a reduction of corporate G&A; interest and other expense equating to $0.14 per share, which is a result of savings realized from FY 2016 simplification efforts, as Tom just mentioned; one-time credits booked in Q4 FY 2016; and the comparison to a higher expense in Q4 2015 from early retirement expenses incurred, and a lower effective tax rate in FY 2016 of 28% versus 40.9% in Q4 of 2015. This all contributed to $0.30 per share. The impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company's share repurchase activity equated to an increase of $0.05 per share. A reduction of $0.02 in adjusted per-share income was a result of lower adjusted segment operating income, which was driven by the strengthened U.S. dollar currency translation and weakened end markets, which approximates a little bit more than $200 million quarter to quarter.","On slide number 8, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 for the full year 2015 to $6.46 for the full year 2016. For the full year 2016, increases to adjusted earnings per share include reduced corporate G&A expense equating to $0.20 per share; $0.13 per share due to a lower effective tax rate of 27.6% in FY 2016 versus 29.3% in FY 2015, which is due to favorable discrete benefits booked during FY 2016; and $0.36 from fewer shares outstanding, reflecting the full-year impact of Parker's enhanced share repurchase program. Decreases to adjusted earnings per share for FY 2016 were lower segment operating income of $1 per share due to the impact of the weakened end markets and higher interest and other expense equating to $0.48 per share, which compares to a sizable one-time favorable currency adjustment recognized in FY 2015 and the full-year impact of interest expense on incremental debt issued in November of 2014.","Moving to slide number 9, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year, total company organic sales in the fourth quarter decreased by 5.3% over the same quarter last year. There was minimal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than our guide, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $31 million or 1% in the quarter.","Total segment operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 15.6% versus 14.9% for the same quarter last year. Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $27 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $462 million versus $468 million last year reflects the meaningful impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from our very large simplification and restructuring actions taken throughout the year.","For the full year, organic sales in fiscal year 2017 (sic) [2016] decreased by 7.7%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The effect of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $404 million or 3.2% of sales for the full year. Total company segment operating margin for fiscal year 2016, adjusted for realignment cost incurred during the year, was 14.8% versus 14.9% in fiscal year 2015. Business realignment expenses incurred in FY 2016 was $107 million.","Slide number 10 discusses the business segments. And I'll start first with the Diversified Industrial North America segment. For the fourth quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 10.3% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a nominal impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 0.6% in the quarter. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 18% of sales versus 17.3% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $5 million, as compared to $15 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $226 million, as compared to $244 million, which was driven by the reduced volume as a result of the key industrial weak markets.","For the full year, organic sales for the fiscal year 2016 decreased by 12.4%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $60 million or 1% of sales for the full year. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment cost was 16.8% of sales versus 17% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $42 million as compared to $16 million in fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 was $832 million as compared to $972 million in the prior year.","Now, turning to slide number 11, I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segments. Organic sales for the Diversified Industrial International segment \u2013 organic sales for the fourth quarter in the segment decreased by 3%. Currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for business realignment costs, was 12.6% of sales versus 10.9% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $18 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $137 million as compared to $124 million, which, despite the weakened top line, reflects the offsetting savings resulting from realignment actions taken in the current year as well as the prior fiscal years.","For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year 2016 decreased by 6%. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $339 million or a negative 7.1% of sales for the year. For the full year 2016, operating margin, adjusted for realignment costs, was 12.3% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses totaled $61 million as compared to $27 million in fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 was $509 million as compared to $611 million last year.","And I'll now move to slide number 12 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 2.2% for the quarter. Neither acquisitions nor currency really impacted revenues. Strong growth in military OEM and military aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance. Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 16.4% of sales versus 16.9% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $1 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was flat at $99 million for both Q4 2016 and the prior year, reflecting the impact of the reduced commercial sales volume in the quarter, albeit partially offset by reduced development costs as a percentage of sales.","For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year 2016 increased by 0.5% of sales. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 15.1% of sales versus 13.5% in prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $4 million as compared to $6 million related in the prior year. And adjusted operating income for the fiscal year was $341 million as compared to $305 million last year, which was largely attributed to the reduction of development cost to slightly less than 8% of sales, together with the savings from the business realignment activities.","Going to slide number 13. Moving to that slide is a detail about order changes by segment. As a reminder, our orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year over year excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders improved to a negative 1% for the quarter-end, reflecting a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets, including oil and gas, construction, and agricultural. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased to a negative 10%. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to a positive 3% for the quarter. Aerospace System orders increased to plus 14% for the quarter.","Looking at slide number 14, we report the cash flow from operations. For the fourth quarter, cash from operating activities was very strong at $488 million or 16.5% of sales. This compares to 16.2% of sales for the same period last year. For the full year, cash flow from operating activities for fiscal 2016 was $1.170 billion or 10.3% of sales, as compared to 10.2% last year. When adjusted for the $200 million voluntary pension contribution made during the year, adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $1.370 billion or 12.1% of sales as compared to 10.2% in fiscal 2015. There was no pension contribution made during FY 2015. The significant uses of cash during the year included $158 million for the company's repurchase of common shares and $342 million for the payment of shareholders' dividends. And there was $149 million for CapEx, equating to 1.3% of sales for FY 2016.","Now, turning to guidance for FY 2017. The full-year earnings guidance for FY 2017 is outlined here. Guidance is provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2017. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to positive 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is flat. Currency in the guidance is not forecasted to impact sales. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of June 30, 2016, and we hold those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming FY 2017.","Total Parker adjusted segment operating are margins forecast to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. This compares to 14.8% for FY 2016 on an adjusted basis. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest, and other expense, is $469 million for the year at the midpoint. The full-year tax rate is projected at 29%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full-year guidance is 135.5 million. And for the full-year guidance, on an adjusted earnings per share, is $6.40 to $7.10, or $6.75 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be included in FY 2017. This is the only adjustments that we make to our guidance. It's just realignment expenses. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25 savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million and are fully reflected in the adjusted operating margin guidance range.","Some additional key assumptions for the fiscal year guidance are sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half, which is a normal distribution split for a year for us. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% in the first half, 54% in the second half. EPS in the first half versus the second half is $2.93 and $3.82 for the second half. Q1 FY 2017 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.52 at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.09 of business realignment expenses.","On slide number 16, just some influences on EPS for 2017 as compared to 2016. On slide 16, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS of $6.46 per share. Increases include $0.40 from an increased segment operating income and $0.11 from fewer shares outstanding and reduced interest expense.","Key components of the decrease include a $0.13 per share reduction from taxes, reflecting a rate from continuing operations of 29%, and $0.09 per share reduction from increased corporate G&A and other expense as a result of normalized levels, not including one-time favorable settlements realized in the prior year, primarily in Q4, in part by reduced pension expense due to the company's adoption of the spot rate methodology for calculating annual pension expense. This has a total impact of $0.11 for FY 2017. Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisition and divestitures that might close during FY 2017. For consistency, we ask that you exclude only the restructuring expenses from your published estimates.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you for your summary comments.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jon. We are very proud of the fiscal 2016 results. I'd like to thank Parker team members around the world for their efforts. These accomplishments carry even greater significance given the $1.35 billion drop in sales that occurred during the year. While we still have much more to achieve, we are positioned well for fiscal 2017 and beyond under the framework provided by the Win Strategy. Together, we are building a stronger and better Parker. I look forward to sharing more with you as the year progress.","So at this time, Candace, we're ready to take questions if you want to go ahead and open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. I guess a couple questions on the guidance. One of the things that struck me is generally when you guys guide for the fiscal year you come in well below consensus and you're sort of at the midpoint, which struck me. So any comment on that? But specifically, I'm trying to get comfortable with \u2013 can you give color on the orders in North America, which I think were down in the 10% range, which I guess surprised me. So I'm trying to bridge that with your sales guidance in North America, which seems more optimistic. And then at the same time, on a down sales year over year, you're expecting margin improvement on an adjusted basis. So if you could address those issues, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Jamie, it's Tom. Let me just \u2013 the topics are kind of interwoven, so I'll start with the guide, what was behind it. And I'll start with, in case those of you that were on the phone didn't hear my opening comments, this is going to be year of sales leveling off, which after the sharp reduction that we had last year is going to be a very refreshing change for all of our people around the world. But the way we forecasted this is Q1's going to be soft, moving to essentially flat in Q2 with 1% to 2% sales growth in the second half.","So our thoughts behind the numbers. The natural resource related end markets \u2013 so construction, ag, mining, and oil and gas \u2013 are moderating. Now, they're going to continue to be, year over year when we finish 2017, negative. But they're going to get to be less and less of a drag, especially in the second half. When you look at order entry that we had in Q4, in particular what drove our thoughts with international is that we had a positive international, plus 3%, and that was made up of Europe being basically flat, minus 1% in that area; Asia, plus 6%; and Latin America, plus 19%. So what's really driving our international sales forecast is a forecast of Europe being relatively flat and Asia-Pacific and Latin America being up a little bit, driving an international forecast of plus 2%.","Now, you talk about North America. Now, what we saw in Q4 I characterized as continued choppiness around what we saw from Q3 to Q4. I mean, during the quarter, April started off a little bit softer than we would've liked. And then May and June were a little bit better. What we're seeing for North America for the full year, to give you some context as to the negative 3% that we have out there, is that we have a first half of minus 5% and a second half of minus 1%. And what's driving that is if you look at the natural resource related end markets that I described, they really bottomed the North America in our second half of the year.","So we're not really anticipating any new catalysts \u2013 any new activity that's going to drive growth or sustainability beyond our current levels for natural resources. But what you're seeing in North America is easier comps in the second half, and we do have growth in North America in non-natural resource related markets like machine tools, telecom, life sciences, turf, refrigeration, that is going to now help to offset some of that \u2013 not completely because we're still end the North America at a minus 3%.","Now, if I could, I'm just going to give you context \u2013 our view for the total end markets for the whole fiscal 2017, and I want to put an asterisk by this. I'm not trying to describe the entire end market. I'm just trying to describe our performance in that end market. So I have them in three buckets, positive, neutral, and negative. So on the positive side, what makes up our forecast is aerospace, lawn and turf, passenger rail, refrigeration and air conditioning, semicon, and telecom. In the neutral area is automotive, distribution, and life sciences, and power generation. Now, of significance is distribution in neutral now. Well, that's not an end market, it's a big channel for us, and the fact that distribution moves to neutral helps the year stabilize quite a bit. And then under negative is construction, farm and ag, forestry, general industrial, heavy-duty truck, marine, mining, and oil and gas.","So that's the landscape, and I probably gave you more than you wanted to know, but that's what we think for 2017.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful on the top line. Sorry, just to clarify, though, because I'm trying to understand the margin story.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, all right.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Like if you could tell me the incremental savings from restructuring actions taken in 2016 that help 2017, and then the $48 million of charges in 2017, how much of that do we realize? The $48 million in cost, how much of that do we realize in savings? And I'm assuming most of that's in North America. And then I'll get back in queue. Thank you.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Jamie, Jon here. Just for the restructuring in FY 2017, of the $48 million, we're expecting $30 million in savings in FY 2017. And the restructuring savings that would have been incurred based on FY 2016 actions rolling into FY 2017 is about $25 million. So that is obviously helping our margins going forward, and it's a big driver to our future health, as Tom outlined earlier. So those are the details there. They are about half North America, half international. And one other way to describe them is that they're about one-half simplification efforts and one-half traditional restructuring, which would include some plant closures.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Josh.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Just maybe to follow up on Jamie's question a little bit. Can you talk about some of the mix dynamics that you're seeing in North America that could maybe support a bit of a margin lift here? Maybe ex restructuring, how should we think about the underlying incrementals and decrementals and the progression through the year, and maybe what you saw in the fourth quarter that gives you the confidence in that launch pad?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, if I take Q4 sequentially, I was talking about there's really kind of two things that we saw: the natural resource related end markets \u2013 Josh, this is Tom, by the way, sorry. We still saw those in that minus 10% to minus 15% range, mining, oil and gas, ag, and the distribution that had exposure to that. But what gives us confidence is when you look at the non-natural resource related end markets in Q4, those saw anywhere from flat to a plus 15%, so distribution being up mid-single digits, which is a big part of North America. Machine tools, telecom, life sciences, turf, refrigeration and air conditioning has been very strong for us and automotive about flat, slightly positive. So that was really the mix that felt us good about the North America forecast.","The other part is that we do know that the natural resource comps in those particular end markets gets much easier in the second half, which is why our first quarter for North America, we're not anticipating anything much differently than what we saw in the current quarter. Maybe a hair better because the comps get easier in the second half, is why we forecasted a better comp in the second half.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Is it fair to say that of the \u2013 and I'm sorry, Jon, I missed all the numbers that you gave for restructuring, plus carry-over restructuring. Sounded like something around $40 million, $45 million. If I take those and maybe the gap in your guidance is another $30 million or so to get to the midpoint for segment op income, fair to say that that other $30 million is mix? I mean, I guess there's really not a lot of revenue growth. Presumably, price-cost isn't an inordinate benefit this fiscal year. Just trying to bridge that extra little piece to get to the midpoint.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I mean, Josh, altogether I think you've got it. I mean, it's going to be mix. It's going to be further productivity that we're going to realize. It's going to be Lean. It's going to be the normal Parker operating protocols that we use. And we are expecting, without regard to the realignment that we did in FY 2016 and we plan to do in FY 2017, to become even more productive in FY 2017. And so, yes, that's how we bridge that gap internally here.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. So, there's not a scenario, though, where on an underlying volume basis when things are still tough, decrementals kind of ex all the productivity in Lean and restructuring are very low and then you still expect them to accelerate. It sounds like volume is neutral-ish, but there's just a lot of heavy lifting that's going on behind the scenes doing most of that op improvement.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I would say that that's correct. I mean, the volume being flat, as Tom described, in North America, maybe getting a little bit better as the year goes on, and FY 2017 is going to help us from a marginal standpoint in North America and internationally. We are seeing good productivity gains that we've made from the restructurings that we've done in FY 2016 and really, frankly, for FY 2015 also. So we feel like we are very well-positioned from a cost structure standpoint, and we are poised with any tailwinds at all at the high level to really be able to generate some impressive incremental margins, once the volume turns around.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for the color, guys. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Morning, everyone.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, I think, Jon, you're talking a little bit here about volume in natural resource markets being essentially flat and the comps get easier as the year goes on. I think we kind of entered last year with a similar expectation of some improvement in the back half of the year, which obviously didn't materialize. Could you talk about the differences between what you're seeing in the market now versus 12 months ago that gives you that confidence that you are going to see a potential uptick in the second half?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Nathan, it's Tom. I think the confidence would be, if you just took oil and gas as an example. Nobody could've anticipated going back 12 months ago the rig count reduction that happened, but now the rig counts have stabilized, and the last several weeks, minus maybe a week or two, have actually improved. We're not forecasting them to get any better, but just by the comps, and the fact that they've decelerated or are starting to hold that level, it makes our second half naturally a little bit better. I don't think we're out on a limb with North America at a minus 1% in the second half, given that we normally have a second half a little bit better, and the fact that I think we've seen the worst behind us in the natural resource areas, and those non-natural resource areas that I mentioned starting to show some growth for us. So I think that's why we picked what we did. And at this point, we're as confident as we can be. Of course, every quarter we'll update you as that changes.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Is it possible for you to parse out what you think the impact might be on North American orders from the natural resource markets? I mean, you had a nice plus 3% in international and still minus 10% in North America. How much do you think natural resource markets are impacting that in North America versus international?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Nathan, it's Tom again. It's hard to do on an order basis. I'll give you what we saw sequentially on sales. This is what I was mentioning earlier. We saw natural resources in that minus 10% to minus 15% range, including the distribution related to natural resources. And then the non-natural resources were all zero to plus 15%, depending on \u2013 refrigeration and air conditioning being the strongest given this time of year. So that's the mix. And the natural resource areas \u2013 again, that's about where we've been, give or take a little bit. And as we look to the second half of the year, those comps just get easier for us, and that becomes less of a drag. And the positive end markets start to get us to the minus 1% second half that we forecasted.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just one on how to think about the incremental margins, Tom, you mentioned in your prepared comments that you've had historically low decrementals during this down cycle, which is obviously a tribute to the business. Does it also change the profile of the incremental margins that we should be thinking about when volume returns? Is the cost structure structurally changed to the point where you would expect higher incremental margins on volume as volume comes back?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Nathan, it's Tom. I think we would. I mean, historically, when we've come out of a downturn, we would be maybe at plus 40%, and then start to \u2013 every quarter that went from the initial uptick, we start to glide down to a plus 30%, and then as you get deeper into a growth segment (42:19) you're in the 20s, potentially probably bottoming out in the upper teens. But I think what we've done structurally, and the fact that we are simpler, leaner, and have a much better cost structure, we would never been able to put up the MROSes that we put up without doing the actions that we've taken.","And just \u2013 it's worth repeating again, the all-in reported MROS, 19.5% \u2013 so that's all the restructuring \u2013 $109 million, which is the highest restructuring we've done in the history of the company. Even with all that, we put up a 19.5% MROS. So, yes, I think it can be higher. Could I peg a number? No, that would be difficult to do, but I would expect it to be higher than we've done historically.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Thanks very much for the help.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And nice job on the cost control this quarter.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","My first question is really around just distribution. So, Tom, your comments that distribution's going to be neutral \u2013 or your (43:25) expectation is neutral in 2017. Can you give us some thoughts there? I mean, clearly as we ended the quarter, the data points that we got from the industrial markets were pretty weak. We got a slightly more positive data point today from Fastenal. And so maybe just comment on what you're seeing in distribution that will give you the confidence that it actually can be neutral in 2017.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Joe. This is Tom. I'll start off, and I'd like Lee to just tag-team. I mean, the confidence here is that when we look at how the quarter came out, sequentially distribution was basically flat, and those non-natural resource related areas that we've talked about in the past in the various regions are growing mid-single digits. And we have a really on-purpose program to add distribution, especially in the emerging areas in Asia, in Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America. And our teams are working very hard at that. And when we look at the emerging markets, they're showing some positive growth in distribution. So I think that combination of all those gives us confidence that we can come in at a neutral for distribution. I don't know if Lee has anything else to add.","Lee C. Banks - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No, Joe, I'd just say commenting on North America, and I've spent quite a bit of time with these guys. There's just no doubt that there's still a big hangover from the natural resource markets, oil and gas being a big one. But have we seen that, (44:54) you do get this impression that things are flattening out. We do see some signs of MRO spend taking place, and it's really a lack of cannibalization of idle rigs that are out there. So we see activity there. And then I think there's just general encouragement through the channel that with the continued strength in the automotive end markets and continued positive PMI data that they are cautiously optimistic that there's some positive signs going forward.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, Lee, is it your sense that from an inventory standpoint, we've now gotten to levels that we need to be in order for your growth rates to reflect end market demand?","Lee C. Banks - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean, I would say in general that the whole destocking question, I don't see big evidence of that in place. That's not to say there may not be a pocket here or there. But in general I would say inventories are in line with the current activity.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then maybe one follow-on question for Jon. Can you maybe talk a little bit about your cash bridge for next year? So specifically I'm interested in your pension-funded status, whether there's going to be an additional contribution in 2017, and then any other puts and takes that you could talk about from a cash flow perspective for next year? Thank you.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Joe. I think, first, on the pension contribution, that is possible. I don't want to say that we are doing it or we're not. We're going to have to really look at that very hard, but that is possible. And, if we do it, it would be in the normal range that we've done it over the last several years, other than in FY 2015, which we didn't do anything. And I think that, from a capital standpoint here, from a CapEx, we would be at about 2% of sales. And those are the kind of the big drivers here for us. Our pension expense for next year, as I tried to mention in my comments, was going to be impacted positively in total, all together, by $0.11 impacting FY 2017 due to the spot rate methodology that we've adopted, as well as many other puts and takes that go into making those estimates and doing the accounting for that.","So the CapEx of 2%, we never forecast acquisitions, of course, and from a pension expense standpoint, it's quite possible that we would have a normal contribution there, and that's about what I can give you right now. Is there any more color that you would want at this point?","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I guess just what the funded status of your pension is today and whether you expect working capital to be positive or negative next year.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think working capital is going to be positive. Now, we're going to show sales growth in Q4, so that will be a slight drag. But we are making tremendous progress on our cost controls, as well as our inventory management. Our inventories are, with this kind of a decline in sales, are at a historic low as a percent of sales. We expect our ability to manage through inventories to more than offset the drag that we might have from the AR as our Q4 shows a little bit better.","Our funded status right now for our pension plans is at 65%, which is a little bit lower than we would want it to be, and that's pure assets to liabilities. Of course, regulatorily, we're well over 100% required, but there would be an argument to make that from a voluntary contribution standpoint that it would make sense given our assets and liability funded status at 65% right now.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Raso of Evercore. Your line is now open.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Hi. A quick clarification first before my question. The savings, the carryover plus the incremental from this year, what's the exact number again?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. The savings carryover into FY 2017, $25 million. The savings related to the FY 2017 restructuring, $30 million.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Okay. So basically the segment profit for the year, total company, has guided up about $72 million, $55 from savings and $21 million from pension. Is that essentially the number you have? (49:56)","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, those are the numbers. I hate to draw a straight line between the restructuring and the savings and our increased guidance, because there's a lot of other factors, as you well know, Dave, that go into that. But, yeah, that would be one way to look at it.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","That's a generic flat revenues, keep profit flat ideally on it, at $20 million plus for pension and $55 million for save, and that's the generic framework.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","My question was the international growth cadence. Can you walk us through \u2013 and you said it earlier, I apologize \u2013 I know you said it for North America, but I might have missed it internationally. The up 3% for the year, 3.2% to be exact \u2013 how do we get there from the down 3% we're exiting the year? Comps get easier, orders are up, but if you can help us with the cadence.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","David, it's Tom. So international, up 3%, 1 point of that is acquisitions; that's the J\u00e4ger acquisition for the year. So it's 2 points of growth for international, and our forecast is that that's Europe at flat, Asia plus 4%, and Latin America plus 15%. Now, recognize Latin America is a small number, and it's balancing off a very sharp decline. And what's supporting that is the orders that we saw in Q4 and has continued into July is that of the international orders, we saw Europe around flat. We've seen Asia orders plus 6%, and Latin America orders plus 19%. So we see some opportunities in Asia and Latin America in particular, and we see Europe as neutral. That's what's making up the plus 2% for international.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","And the cadence of that then? Could we be positive by fiscal 2Q? How quickly do we get positive to get the full year to 2%?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","At the end of the first half.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","End of first half. Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Morning, Jeff.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. So you mentioned capital allocation, you'd be kind of within your range of targets for buyback. And just with six months to go from kind of completing that, can you just update us on as we look past that how you may be thinking about capital allocation, the same or different, or do we get some formal multiyear announcement? Just flesh that out. And maybe while you're at it, touch on acquisition pipeline.","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Jeff. It's Tom. So let me start with just a clarification. We only have one more quarter left in the share repurchase plan. It was October to October, 2014 to 2016. So we'll come in at the $2 billion level of that range that we said. And what's really kind of \u2013 the factors that we've considered of what that is that 99% of our cash is permanently invested overseas. We do have a desire to maintain that A rating, and our debt to total cap is at around almost 40%. And when we started the program, we were at $13 billion company; now we're $11.4 billion. Now, we're very proud of the double-digit cash flow that we've been able to generate, but it's double digits off of a smaller number. So that's what is kind of framing why we're going to come in at the low end of the range.","Now, going forward, our desire \u2013 let me first state that we want to be great generators of cash, and I think we've done a great job there. We're going to continue to do an even better job, and we want to be known as a company that really spins off a lot of cash. On the flip side, we want to be known as a company that deploys it very effectively on behalf of the shareholders, and you've heard me say this before, but those maybe have not, I'll repeat it. First and foremost, as far as our priorities, is to continue our dividend track record. Then we're going to fund organic growth because it's the most efficient growth that you can fund. And then really it's a dynamic review on a case-by-case basis between share repurchase and acquisitions, and really with the goal of generating the best long-term value for our shareholders.","On the share repurchase, you won't see us do another announcement type of process. I think what's better for shareholders is to be active, to have a muscular balance sheet, but to tell you after the fact, because when we announce in advance, we're buying into our own wind, and I don't think that helps shareholders. I think we want to do it after the fact. That's the most effective way to use our cash and to help shareholders.","Regarding acquisitions, the pipeline is active. But I talked last quarter, and the valuations continue to be, I would call it, historically high. But I do think time is on our side here because we buy properties in spaces that we understand. So we understand the growth rates. I think sellers' expectations on growth rates is going to start to temper as they recognize that the growth rates that they think their business is going to do is not going to actually come to fruition. And I think you'll see our pipeline become more actionable. We've always been disciplined buyers. And we'll always continue to buy properties that we know we can deliver on for our shareholders. So we'll look at all that. And, again, the goal is to have a muscular balance sheet and do what's best for our shareholders.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Then just as a follow-on on international. Can you speak to what's inflecting in Asia to drive that plus 6%, and then conversely in Europe, any kind of near-term signals of deterioration around Brexit?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Jeff, I'll start on Asia. I'm going to let Jon make some comments on Brexit. But what we saw on Asia, we actually had positive sales in Asia for June and with the positive order entry that we had in Q4 and will continue into July. We saw plusses in life sciences \u2013 I'm speaking about Asia in general \u2013 passenger rail, power gen, machine tools, and probably of significance, because for the many years we've been talking about this, we've started to see some signs of life in mobile construction, in particular India and Japan, but the good thing is China has finally flattened out, and we've actually saw some new incremental orders in China. And we have all the countries across Asia growing, with the exception of Korea, and Korea just has a little more exposure to some of those global OEMs, and so that will to start to recover as well. So that's what behind our thoughts on Asia, and I'll let Jon talk about Brexit.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Just a quick comment on the Brexit impact, Jeff. We're in a position where we manufacture and ship out of the UK more than we buy into the UK. And so, since we export more than we import, we don't see that really having an impact on our near-term financials. Now, to the extent that the Brexit impact long term starts to impact the economics there, we'll be watching that very closely, but the UK overall, in terms of our sales there, will not meaningfully drive our top line numbers in any event.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks a lot, guys.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Okay, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Volkmann of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys, for two more minutes. Can I just follow up? I think, Tom, you made some initial comments about simplification plans. And I'm curious if there's kind of more to come in that area in terms of things like SKU reduction, or business unit consolidation, or maybe even have some more divestitures. I know you've done a couple of small ones here and there. Can you just talk a little bit about what that's going to look like over the next couple years?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Steve, it's Tom. I think there's really been great momentum for us across the company on simplification. I think I mentioned in my opening comments, the combination of putting simplification with our Lean enterprise efforts is really giving us an amplification of being able to look at costs and processes differently than maybe we have in the past. But, as I've mentioned before, and I'll kind of give you some comments as to where I think we can go on these, there's four big areas that we're focused on.","The first is that whole revenue complexity, or maybe another way of saying it is that product line simplification, the tail of revenue, the last couple percent of revenue. We are in very early days on that. That is probably our biggest opportunity going forward, and that will be a multiyear journey as we continue to find more efficient ways to service that tail, take care of our customers, but work on the SG&A, the speed at which we can handle those type of orders, speed at which we can service customers. A lot of organization design activity will happen related to that. So that will be a net win for our customers as well as us, but very early days on that. That's the harder part because there's thousands and thousands of part numbers to go through. That's the more complicated part of it.","We've done a lot of work organizationally and process-wise; that's the second bullet. And I still see lots of opportunities there. I think you'll see a focus on the number of levels within the company, span of controls, just putting together an organization design that is the most effective design for our customers and for our people.","On the division consolidations, I think we've taken a pretty big step already on that piece. We had 28 divisions, so basically a quarter of all of our divisions going through some kind of consolidation, down to 14. So that dropped our total count of divisions from 115 to 101. Lee is working with the presidents on that. And we don't have anything to announce because, in fairness to our people, we would not announce that in a public forum like this. But we've already taken a big step there. I think you'll see just more fine-tuning on that as we go.","And then on bureaucracy, there's lots and lots of opportunities within the company. The whole annual plan process that we redid was a huge upside for people as far as being able to free up their time to do other things. So I would say we're very pleased with where we've come so far, but there's a lot more to go on that. And if you have anything else, Steve, I'd be happy to answer any more.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Just on potential divestitures going forward?","Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh. Yeah, so we continue to look at the divestitures. That's an ongoing basis. But we like the portfolio as a whole. And you look at our nine motion control technologies, and you look at the seven operating groups. 60% of our customers buy from four or more of those seven groups. So our customers see the power of the systems we can do, the synergies that we can do, across those technologies. That being said, we still look at properties that we think potentially weren't strategic to us or where we weren't the best corporate owner. We'll continue to do that, but I would characterize that as very small, trimming around the edges type of divestitures.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. I appreciate it. Thanks.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. And Candace, I see that we're running up against it here. Could we just take one last phone call here, please?","Operator","Absolutely. Our final question comes from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Andy.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got a question on Aerospace, one backward-looking and then a little bit forward-looking. The first \u2013 can you give a little more color about the relative performance of commercial versus military, if you want to break it OE versus aftermarket in the quarter? And then also, a little more color behind what drove the 50 basis point margin decline versus last year?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. On the margin decline, basically, last year, there were a few contractual settlements in the Aerospace numbers. They did not repeat for this year. Of course, those are lumpy, and they can come sporadically. And so that's really the driver there, Andy. Now, from breaking those numbers down a little bit in terms of the sales, we are basically essentially flat in the commercial market. That's being kind of impacted by the ability for us to be in a position where our bizjet reduction is being overcome by our normal commercial increase. There's not been a significant change in the aftermarket there, and it's been basically flat for us.","From a military standpoint, both OE and commercial, that has been up low double digits for us in the quarter, and that would be reflected not only in our sales but in our orders, and again all of these data that I give to you, because it's such a long-term business, it tends to be very lumpy. Our perfect world, we would be 50% commercial, 50% military. We're not now. I mean, we are 65% commercial, and the balance military right now. And in a perfect world, we'd be 50%-50% OEM versus aftermarket, and we're at 66% OEM right now.","So that would be indicative of further aftermarket revenues to come as we are successful in our entry into service for all the commercial aircraft, and as the military ramps up over the next several years on some of the key programs that we're on. And so we have a lot of very high expectations for our performance and our growth there in Aerospace, and it's been a key to our successful FY 2016, and key to our guidance in FY 2017, too. So I hope that gives you some color there, Andy.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","It does, Jon. Thank you. And then I guess two more \u2013 I'm sorry to belabor it. But on Aerospace, on the guidance, modest growth, kind of flattish to modest growth, and margins flat to up 40 basis points. Is the margin growth or the potential expansion really mix driven, or are there other factors that are driving that?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think it's going to be efficiency. It's going to be the same adherence to all the programs that Tom has outlined before in our Aerospace segment. And it is going to be a natural mix, a positive for us here into FY 2017. Our growth on our new programs is going to be in the low single digits, and our growth in the repairs and aftermarket is going to be in the low single digits for FY 2017. And we also would expect to see our normal growth in our military aftermarket in FY 2017. So there's no one segment of the Aerospace that is driving the growth, and there's no one answer for you on the margins. It's more mix, and it's our ability to just continue to be productive in Aerospace on the margins, and it's across-the-board increases at each one of the major segments there in FY 2017, too.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And I'll follow up on that offline. On the diversified international, if I strip out \u2013 take kind of 50\/50 split on the savings literally, if I strip that out, it looks like the core incrementals are somewhere around mid-20% range. Is that just application of what you'd expect in year one of some sort of recovery after the downdraft we've seen? Or is there upside opportunity given the Lean operations relative to the past?","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think that it is a reflection of our ability to implement Lean. There is an uptick in of course the incremental returns they're going to get, because as Tom and Lee have kind of described, we're going to see an upturn in sequential revenues as the year goes on, especially in Industrial international. That's our best estimate right now. And so we will see some marginal returns there. That 20% number, it seems, off the top of my head, reasonable, but I don't want to give you the impression that there's not also a lot of favorable disposition in our international Industrial margins because of our ability to continue to penetrate markets, gain market share, and grow in ways that are really quite favorable for the company here and helping us with our guidance in 2017.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Thank you. And I think this will be the balance of our call here today. I appreciate everybody's questions. I want to thank everybody for joining us. Robin and Ryan will be available throughout the day to take your calls, should you have any further questions.

Following management's prepared remains, we will host a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.","As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Ms. Cathy Suever, Chief Financial Officer. Ma'am you may begin.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thank you, Brian. Good morning and welcome to Parker Hannifin's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Release Teleconference.","Joining me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks. Today's presentation slides together with the audio webcast replay will be accessible on the company's Investor Information website, at phstock.com, for one year following today's call.","On slide number 2, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor Disclosure Statement addressing forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and earnings presentation slides and are also posted on Parker's website, at phstock.com.","Today's agenda appears on slide number 3. To begin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, will provide highlights for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's fourth quarter and full fiscal year performance together with a review of our guidance for fiscal year 2019. Tom will then provide a few summary comments and we'll open the call for a question-and-answer session.","Please refer now to slide 4 as Tom will get us started with the highlights for the quarter and the full year for fiscal year 2018 and then continue with a brief overview of the fiscal year 2019 outlook on slide number 5.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thank you, Cathy, and good morning, everybody. Extend my welcome as well. Thank you for your time and your interest in Parker. So we're really happy to report that we delivered a record Q4 and just completed Parker's best year ever in FY 2018. My thanks to everybody around the world, the Parker team members for their hard work, their dedication and the great results. This performance was driven by a combination of the Win Strategy, the CLARCOR acquisition and some really nice organic growth that we're experiencing around the world.","So let me start with the fourth quarter highlights, and I'm going to start with safety as we normally do. On safety, injuries were down 21% really driven by our High-Performance team, which stands within the Engage People goal, which is the first goal to Win Strategy. And this is really all about creating an ownership culture as we expand the High-Performance team concept and that ownership concept beyond safety to quality costs and delivery, we're going to really see nice improvements in performance. And we're just starting that expansion as we speak today.","I'm going to give you a list of all-time quarterly records. These are all as-reported. Cathy's going to go through the numbers and more specifics, so I'm just going to give you the categories. And we use reported numbers for records because that's what we have history on going back. So, these are all-time quarterly records in the history of the company.","So, sales first of all. Segment operating margin was an all-time record, which is significant in that we are including depreciation and amortization incremental amount for CLARCOR, the restructuring the cost to achieve and still delivered an all-time record for the quarter. I think that really speaks to the underlying performance of the company. A number of fourth quarter records: net income, net income ROS and EPS.","And if I would just highlight some other things that happened in the quarter. We had some very nice organic growth, up 9%, which is more than double the growth rate for global industrial production. Strong order entry growth against some pretty tough comparables, so we were very pleased to see that. EBITDA margins were up 80 basis points on an adjusted basis year-over-year. We had an excellent quarter in international. The segment margins there were up 210 basis points year-over-year. And an outstanding quarter for Aerospace Systems; it came in at 19.9% ROS, margins 140 basis points year-over-year. And we saw a nice continued improvement in North America industrial margins.","Now moving to the full year. Again, a number of all-time records on a reported basis: sales, EPS, segment operating margins. Segment operating margins came in at 15.7% reported. I take you back to the previous all-time high that was 15.2% FY 2012. And you look at all the incremental depreciation, amortization, restructuring CLARCOR cost to achieve, it would just show you the significance of that record being 50 basis points higher than the previous all-time record, with all that headwind that we faced. Operating cash flow was also an all-time record.","Some other highlights for the full year. 8% organic sales growth, far outpacing global industrial production growth again, nice improvement in both segment operating and EBITDA margins. We had terrific cash flow generation. We came in 11.2% cash flow from operations. And really all these results demonstrate the Win Strategy is continuing to produce transformational results.","I want to move on to cash and capital deployment. You've heard me say that our goal is to be great generators and great deployers of cash. And on the cash generation side we had a very strong year. We ended FY 2018 at 127% free cash flow. On the deployment side starting with dividends, we increased dividends 15% and this makes the 62nd consecutive year of increases in annual dividends paid. This is a record that we're very proud of and it's a record we intend to keep. We intend to keep that consecutive year streak alive.","On the debt reduction, we had significant progress. If I take you back to when the CLARCOR deal closed and you looked at gross debt-to-EBITDA multiple, we were at 3.6 times at the deal close, and we finished at fiscal year at 2.1 times, so just remarkable progress in a relatively short period of time. And then on the share repurchase side, in FY 2018 we completed $200 million of share repurchase on our 10b5-1 plan. And then we were opportunistic in purchasing $100 million on a discretionary basis in Q4.","Moving on to the CLARCOR integration. It's going well, we're very pleased with it. The synergy targets remain on track. Again just to remind people the targets are $160 million for cost synergies and $100 million of revenue synergies and our plan is to achieve this at the end of year three of the integration period.","I want to move to EBITDA margin performance because I really think EBITDA margin is a great way to evaluate our performance given the incremental CLARCOR depreciation and amortization. So at the time of the CLARCOR deal announcement, we communicated a goal to increase EBITDA margins for total Parker 300 basis points over a five-year period of time. And I'm really pleased to report that we're on track to hit that 300-basis point EBITDA margin expansion almost three years early.","So going back to the deal announcement, adjusted EBITDA was 14.7% at that point. For Q4, we came in at 18.8% and for the full year of FY '18, we came in at 17.5%. So, again, almost 300 basis points from where we started. And this is really a total team effort. If you look at where the groups and divisions performed over this period of time everybody's contributed. And, again, it's a really strong indicator that the new Win Strategy is working to drive that kind of performance in EBITDA margin.","Moving to the outlook. We're issuing guidance for FY 2019 for a record year of sales, record operating margins and record EPS. Solid organic growth of approximately 2.5% to 5% growth partially offset by currency headwinds. Our adjusted EPS range is going to be $10.70 to $11.50. And we'll have some continued business restructuring and CLARCOR integration costs. However, it will be significantly lower than the costs we had in FY 2018.","So going forward, there's lots of positive momentum. I can tell you around the room we are all looking forward to FY 2019. And I'm going to run you through a list of positive items for FY 2019 just to highlight really our enthusiasm for the next year. First is the market conditions. Very positive. It's a combination of a very good macro environment and the fact that the Win Strategy initiatives especially around our profitable growth initiatives, are driving growth fast in the market.","We're going to be in a solid organic growth period. The new Win Strategy is driving improvements and the good thing about all this is it's still early days with lots of opportunities ahead of us. And the CLARCOR synergies are really going to impact FY 2019 in a very positive way.","Now, if I was to move the some of the positive things for the segments, Aerospace is coming off a tremendous year. And what Aerospace gives for us from a portfolio standpoint is a long cycle business that for the future is going to continue to improve and perform at a very high level.","The international segment had strong margin expansion FY 2018 and we look to build upon that in FY 2019. And in North America, we saw some really good productivity improvements throughout the quarter. And as forecasted, we expect gradual margin improvement in the first half of FY 2019 and some very nice tailwind in the second half for North America. The restructuring costs are going to be reduced significantly. And going into the New Year we have a much stronger balance sheet which we intend to utilize against our deployment priorities.","I'll just remind you what those are. First dividends, second is organic growth and productivity and then we look at acquisitions and share repurchase. And our goal, as always, as a leadership team is to make the base decisions on behalf of our shareholders to generate the most optimal long-term value for our shareholders. FY 2019 marks year one of our next five-year horizon that we discussed at our recent Investor Relations day. And if you take FY 2018's performance and the FY 2019 guide, it really gives us a really nice start as we look to how we're moving towards those FY 2023 targets.","So as a reminder, our targets by FY 2023 are the following: sales growth of 150 basis points greater than global industrial production growth. We want segment operating margins at 19%, EBITDA margin at 20%, free cash flow conversion greater than 100% and an earnings per share CAGR over that period of time of 10%-plus.","So with that summary, I'm going to hand it back to Cathy for a more detailed review of the quarter.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thank you, Tom. I'll now refer to slide number 6 and begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. As reported, earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $2.62 and adjusted earnings per share were $3.22. The $3.22 compares to $2.45 for the same quarter a year ago, a 31% increase year-over-year. Fourth quarter 2018 earnings have been adjusted to exclude business realignment expenses of $0.10, CLARCOR costs to achieve of $0.04, $0.39 related to a loss on the sale of a business and a net charge of $0.07 related to U.S. tax reform. Q4 of FY 2017 adjustments include $0.11 for business realignment expenses and $0.19 of acquisition-related expenses.","On slide 7 you'll find the significant components of the walk from the prior-year adjusted earnings per share of $2.45 to the $3.22 for the fourth quarter of this year. The most significant increase came from higher adjusted segment operating income of $0.44, attributable to earnings on meaningful organic growth, income and synergy savings from acquisitions and increased margins as a result of the Win Strategy initiatives.","Lower income tax expense resulted in an increase of $0.23 while lower other expense and share count contributed $0.09 and $0.04, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share were reduced by higher corporate G&A of $0.03.","On slide 8, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $8.11 for the full year 2017 to $10.42 for the full year 2018. Increases in 2018 included higher segment operating income equating to $2.28, lower income tax expense of $0.51 and a benefit of $0.01 from fewer shares outstanding.","The decreases to adjusted earnings per share for fiscal year 2018 were higher interest expense of $0.28 associated with the CLARCOR acquisition debt issuance, higher corporate G&A expense of $0.18, primarily related to increased performance incentive compensation, and increased other expense of $0.03.","Moving to slide number 9, you'll find total Parker sales and segment operating margin for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, total company organic sales increased year-over-year by 8.7%. There was a 0.4% headwind from a filtration divestiture and a 0.9% contribution to sales from currency.","Total segment operating margin on an adjusted basis improved to 17.5% versus 16.8% during the same quarter last year. This overall margin improvement reflects the benefits of higher volume combined with the positive impacts from our Win Strategy initiatives and acquisition synergies. For the full year, organic sales increased 8.4% and total segment operating margins increased 40 basis points to 16.2%.","Moving to slide number 10, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the fourth quarter, North America organic sales increased by 8.8% as compared to last year and with 0.4% drag from a filtration divestiture. Operating margin for the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis was 17.8% of sales versus 18.2% in the prior year.","Compared to last year, the current quarter reflects the additional work involved to complete footprint consolidations while also maintaining excellent customer experience during a period of higher-than-anticipated growth. During the quarter, we made steady improvement toward completing these consolidations and we saw productivity metrics improve, but some duplicate plant costs continued.","With the completion of the planned plant closures during the first half of fiscal year 2019 and continuous productivity improvements with the Win Strategy, we remain confident that we'll experience a strong second half of fiscal year 2019 for Industrial North America operating margins. For the full year, organic sales increased 10.1%, while segment operating margins were 16.6%.","I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial International segment on slide number 11. Organic sales for the fourth quarter in the Industrial International segment increased by 10.2%. The filtration divestiture created a 0.7% drag, while currency positively impacted the quarter by 2.6%.","Operating margin for the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis was 16.1% of sales versus 14% in the prior year. We continue to see progress in margins in Industrial International as a result of the Win Strategy and simplification and realignment efforts. For the full year, organic growth was 10.2% and segment operating margins increased by 130 basis points to 15.3%.","I'll now move to slide number 12 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 5.5% for the fourth quarter, driven by strength in military OEM and commercial and military aftermarket. Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 19.9% of sales versus 18.5% in the prior year, reflecting the impact of a favorable aftermarket sales mix, successful execution of the Win Strategy and more effective development costs than the prior years. For the full year, organic growth was 1.2%. Operating margins increased by 240 basis points to 17.3% for the year.","Moving to slide number 13, we show the details of order rates by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average.","Total orders continue to be strong, growing 8% as of the quarter end. This year-over-year growth is made up of 9% from Diversified Industrial North America orders, 5% from Diversified Industrial International and 10% from Aerospace Systems orders.","On slide 14, we report cash flow from operating activities. Full year cash flow from operating activities increased $298 million to $1.6 billion, or 11.2% of sales compared to 10.8% of sales for the same period last year or 12.7% last year when adjusted for a $220 million discretionary pension contribution.","On slide 15 we show a history of Parker's free cash flow conversion rate. For the 17th consecutive year, Parker generated free cash flow conversion of greater than 100%, finishing 2018 at 127%. We're very proud of our team for their great management of working capital to be able to sustain this impressive cash flow during a period of higher growth.","The significant allocations of capital in the fiscal year have been: $939 million for the pay down of debt, of which $475 million was fully retired prior to its 2020 maturity, $365 million for the payment of shareholder dividends, $300 million for repurchases of common shares, $200 million through our 10b5-1 plan and $100 million of that of discretionary share repurchases in the fourth quarter, and $248 million or 1.7% of sales for capital expenditures.","The full-year earnings guidance for fiscal year 2019 is outlined on slide number 16. Guidance is being provided on both an as-reported and adjusted basis. Total sales are expected to increase in the range of 0.7% to 3.5% as compared to the prior year. The corresponding organic growth is expected to be between 2.3% and 5.1%. The loss on sales from the fiscal year 2018 divestiture will have a negative 0.4% impact and currency is expected to have a negative 1.2% impact on sales for fiscal year 2019.","We've calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and we've held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for fiscal year 2019.","For total Parker, as-reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 16.1% and 16.7%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 16.5% and 16.9%. The full-year adjusted tax rate is projected to be 23%.","For the full year, the guidance range on an as-reported earnings per share basis is $10.50 to $11.30 or $10.90 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is $10.70 to $11.50 or $11.10 at the midpoint. This guidance on an adjusted basis excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $22 million for the full year fiscal 2019.","Savings from business realignment initiatives are projected to be $10 million. In addition, guidance on an adjusted basis excludes $13 million of CLARCOR costs to achieve expenses. CLARCOR synergy savings are estimated to ramp to a run rate of $125 million by the end of fiscal year 2019 after rising to $50 million at the end of fiscal year 2018.","We continue to remain on pace to realize the forecasted $160 million run rate synergy savings by fiscal year 2020. Savings from all business realignment and CLARCOR costs to achieve are fully reflected in both the as-reported and the adjusted guidance ranges.","Some additional key assumptions for full-year 2019 guidance at the midpoint are: sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half, adjusted segment operating income is divided 45% first half, 55% second half, adjusted EPS first half\/second half is divided 43%, 57%.","First quarter of fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $2.45 at the midpoint and this excludes $0.02 of projected business realignment expenses and $0.03 of projected CLARCOR costs to achieve. We ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison.","On slide 17, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of fiscal year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $11.10 at the midpoint compared to the prior year of $10.42. Increases include $0.62 from higher segment operating income, $0.18 from lower interest expense and $0.04 from a lower projected share count.","Offsetting these increases is a $0.10 per share decrease from higher projected tax expense and $0.06 per share from higher projected corporate G&A and other expense. Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisitions or divestitures that might close during the remainder of fiscal 2019. This concludes my prepared comments.","Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thank you, Cathy. So we are anticipating another record year in FY 2019. The Win Strategy is working well. What framed the changes to the Win Strategy when we revised it about three years ago were two overarching themes. One, we wanted to be a top-quartile performer versus our Diversified Industrial peers and we wanted to be a great generator and deployer of cash. You couple those two themes with the unique competitive advantage that we have that differentiate us versus our competitors and that's what enables us to be the number-one motion control company in the world.","So these unique advantages are the following: one, the Win Strategy, second is our decentralized divisional structure, third our global distribution service and support network which is the best in the motion control space, and the fact that almost everything we ship has some element of intellectual property tied to it. We're globally balanced and we have a portfolio that has the breadth of technologies and system capabilities that really provides a differentiating value to our customers. We're forecasting a record FY 2019, but the best thing about our future is that we know we have lots of opportunities to get better. And as we do that, we're going to continue to position Parker among the best Diversified Industrial companies in the world.","So let me just close by saying thank you to the Parker team members around the world for all the progress and their hard work. And I want to say thank you to the shareholders. Our shareholders that have had continued confidence in Parker, we appreciate that very much.","So with that, Brian, I'm going to hand it back over to you to start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And our first question will come from the line of Mig Dobre with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Joseph M. Grabowski - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. This is Joe Grabowski on for Mig this morning.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph M. Grabowski - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Maybe talk about the incremental margin in North America in the fourth quarter, kind of what the puts and takes were there. How have CLARCOR inefficiencies progressed through the quarter? Maybe start there.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, Joe. It's Tom. So we were really pleased with what we saw in North America. We saw continued improvement with our productivity metrics through the quarter. We track it line by line, plant by plant and we were very encouraged with the progress that we saw. We completed 80% of the plant closures in FY 2018. We have 20% that's going to carryover to FY 2019 due to the higher volume that we experienced. So this higher volume, this is a high-class problem that we have.","Just to help frame what I mean by higher volume, the Q4 guide that we gave for North America was approximately 6% organic growth, and we came in at almost 9% organic growth for North America. So a 30% higher growth rate than what we had anticipated.","But the productivity at the plants is improving at a pace that we're very comfortable that we're going to be able to close the plants that we've got and these carryover closures in the first half and we're going to be able to take the costs out and when you do that you're going to see a very strong second half from North America. So I was very encouraged with North America.","And maybe if I could just \u2013 while I've got the stage here, just emphasize if you look at the other segments, I think it's a really good indicator of the underlying operating performance So North America really strong performance sequentially. And if you look at International and Aerospace you saw the results there, significant progress versus prior year on a quarterly basis and on an annual basis and then total your EBITDA margin improvement. So we feel very good about what we've done on the margin side and we look forward to FY 2019.","Joseph M. Grabowski - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for the color. And then maybe my follow up would be along the same lines. What were the price cost dynamics in the quarter? Have you been able to keep up with raw material inflation through pricing? And how does that look as you progress through FY 2019?","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Joe, this is Lee. Thanks for the question. As we've talked before in the past, we've got a pretty disciplined process inside the company where we start at the division level and measure our input costs through our PPI Index and measure our sales increases through our SPI Index. So we stay on top of it. There's definitely inflation in the channel and we've been very active in neutralizing it. And I would say everything we've done has been really margin neutral, at a minimum, for the company.","Joseph M. Grabowski - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. First, just some color on the orders in for International Industrial. They were a little weaker than what I would have expected. So if you could just start with that. And then I have a follow-up question.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yes, Jamie, it's Tom. So for international first you got tougher comps there. So that's probably a big contributor to it. We saw Asia and Latin America stayed at a high level and EMEA moderated a little bit through the quarter, but still had pretty good numbers for us.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And sorry. Just a follow-up question on the last question on incrementals for 2019 second half better than first half. Is there any way you could just quantify or give a little more color? I think investors were expecting low-20s in the first half, 30s in the second half. Is that the right way to still think about it? Thanks.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, and I'll give you a range because MROS is a difficult metric to predict on a pinpoint basis. So our first half for North America for 2019 is going to be in the 10% to 20% MROS and the second half, as I mentioned, with the strong tailwind is going to be in the 40% to 50% MROS. Full year for the total company will be in that low to mid-30s putting the whole company together.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And it just seems more back-end loaded versus before. If you could just give a little color on that.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","No, I think that's about what we were anticipating. Obviously we didn't talk about FY 2019 when we were in the last quarter, but we talked about that we were going to anticipate more work with the plants for the first half of 2019. And that's where we're at. But I'm very pleased with the productivity pace. The improvements that we're making line by line and the improvements that our team members are making is going to enable us to close those factories and take the costs out that we need to and position us to be in very good shape for the second half.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. I'll get back in queue. Thanks.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, guys, when I look at the organic growth guide for the upcoming year, I know you typically will tend to guide on trend. But the trend so far on your order rates have been much better. And so how should I think about that range that you've given? The low end seems lower than we anticipated, but obviously the order trends still remain very good.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, Joe. This is Tom. Let me first start with maybe the process of how we developed the guide, so people have some context, and then I'll go through and answer your question. So first we look at order patterns, just like you described. We get input from our customers and our distributors, we obviously get forecasts from all of our divisions. We look at the economic models on industrial production growth. And then we built our own regression models that we have by our respective groups to help predict the future.","So, what I'm going to focus on is my comments on organic growth because we can't predict currency. So our range of 2.5% to 5% looks like approximately 5% for the first half and approximately 2.5% for the second half. But really the rates of growth coming down in the second half primarily because of the comparisons.","If you look at the comparison of 2019 to 2018, it's much harder than the comparison from 2018 to 2017. But I would describe this organic growth environment as one of the best ones that we've had in my recent memory with a significant number of positive end markets. And I'm going to run you through our forecast for the end markets. I'm going to put a little asterisk by my comments that this is our forecast as far as how Parker's going to perform in these end markets, not necessarily predictor of how the whole market's going to do.","But I'm going to do just three buckets: positive, neutral, negative. On the positive side, it's a very long list and I'm going to read them all because I'm excited about how long this list is. But it starts with aerospace, ag, construction, distribution, forestry, general industrial, heavy duty truck, lawn and turfs, life sciences, mining, oil and gas, rail, semicon, refrigeration and air conditioning and telecom. So that's about everything we do is in the positive bucket. Neutral is automotive and marine. And negative, as you might predict, is power gen.","So our forecast at this time is our best view of the world. And recognize that every quarter we're going to have better data, better visibility and we're going to update that for you as we go. But I would just characterize 2019 as a terrific environment for us when I think about the growth for the future.","Joseph M. Grabowski - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. That was very helpful, Tom. And obviously it sounds like the outlook remains pretty strong. And just given your visibility, I guess we'll wait and see that update later this year.","But maybe thinking about how you're thinking about the incremental margin\/EBIT bridge for the year for 2019 versus 2018, when I take a look at the midpoint of your guidance, it implies roughly $115 million in EBIT. I guess how are we supposed to think about how much of that is coming from the cost savings and the benefits associated with all the actions you've taken versus, again, how you're thinking about just the volume leverage for the rest of the year?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, Joe. Let me take this one for a little bit here. It will be a combination. So we will see savings from efficiencies as we complete the plant closures in the first half of 2019. We will continue to see productivity and efficiency come through the margins as we continue to work on Win Strategy initiatives. And just overall as we've seen some pretty high level of growth and to keep up with that, it's been at times inefficient in terms of premium freight and such and we've gotten better at that. We've seen improvement in that and we'll continue to see improvement in maintaining our customer deliveries in this growth period as we go forward. So it'll be a combination of things.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Joe, it's Tom. The bottom (35:27) numbers, our MROS forecast is in the low to mid-30s for the total company for next year's guide.","Joseph M. Grabowski - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is now open.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. How's it going?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Hi, Joel.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And I just wondered, I know it's too early to start making bigger acquisitions again and all that. Can you talk a little bit about Aerospace and how that fits in? It used to be more than 20% of the mix and now it's 15%-ish. And I just wondered, you're having great success there and I just wondered how you think about incremental acquisitions overall and Aerospace in particular.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, Joel. This is Tom. So our acquisition strategy and I mentioned this briefly at the Investor Day, one, is first to be consolidator of choice within the motion control space. So we are number one but we have only about 11% share of a $130 billion space. So we want to be at bat \u2013 not that we'll swing at everything, but we want to be at bat looking at things that make sense for us in the motion control space.","Second is, all things being equal, we want to invest in aerospace, infiltration and engineering materials in our Instrumentation Groups. Those are groups that tend to have higher margins and a little more resilience over a business cycle. So clearly Aerospace is on that list.","And maybe if I could talk about capital deployment just in a broader sense, we are in a much better position as we go into FY 2019 than we were in 2018 from a capital deployment standpoint. Our balance sheet is in a robust position at 2.1 gross debt to EBITDA multiples. So we're going to do our dividends and we're targeting 30% of net income and net income is going to keep growing, so we \u2013 which is a big growth there. We're going to invest in organic growth and productivity. I mentioned that at Investor Day, so strategic investments in productivity to drive productivity within the plants on additive and robotics and those type of things. And then to your point, we're going to look at acquisitions and share repurchase and make the best decisions we can for the shareholders.","But Aerospace, we like about a 20\/80 balance. And I would remind people, when you look at our technologies, all of our technologies are the same. We just happen to call out Aerospace as a market-facing segment because of the customer profile there. But it's the same motion control technologies that go into Aerospace that go into Semicon that go into all these other technologies \u2013 these other end markets.","So we like it and we've done a lot of work in Aerospace over the last 10 years from the R&D work that we've done, the Win Strategy, the good work that the team's done there. It's in a great position and it's going to yield nice benefits going forward for us.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then just a weird question for Lee. As you go around to all the different factories, are you finding anywhere where the cost savings \u2013 like you're reaching your efficiency goals and you're running out of things to do? Or just a little sense of where you are, what inning maybe on this overall cost reduction and efficiency improvement.","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Joel, can you believe me on one thing? I am not running out of things to do. No, I'll tell you, very proud of the team. We continue to make productivity improvements. We continue to change what we're working on in the factories. And I've used this analogy with many of you. We're in the early stages of our journey because there's constantly opportunities to eliminate waste in all the businesses and our teams are focused on doing that.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Thank you.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Joel.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Hi. Good morning.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Hi, David.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Just curious about the first half, the comment about North America being mid-teens and on the incrementals. Just trying to get a feel. I mean, the basic math I'm running here, it looks like for the whole company we're talking about $45 million in the sense of the first half incrementals are 17% to 18% for the whole company and then the back half of the year has kind of 200%. I know it's a really easy comp, so it's sort of a funny number.","But it seems like it's a $45 million number where if you added it to the first half and took it out of the second half, you'd be doing your 30%, 35% incrementals. So I'm trying to gauge the comfort, the understanding of that kind of size of a number on the ability to get that with the plant closures going into the back half. Or is there maybe some cushion in the first half? I'm just trying to understand. That's a sizable number that it's loaded in the second half. So if you can maybe help me somehow understand that a little bit better.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, David, let me spell out what we think we're going to achieve in savings from our efforts. So with the CLARCOR cost to achieve efforts, we'll be spending about $13 million throughout fiscal year 2019, and that'll be heavily weighted in the first half. Out of that, we expect to increase our margins with $75 million of synergy savings split pretty evenly first half, second half. Then in addition, we'll have our other areas of Parker working on continuing improvements through realignment. That'll be a $22 million cost for the year, fairly evenly split first half second half, and $10 million of savings heavily weighted in the second half.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Yeah, I guess it's a little less back-half loaded than maybe the math suggests. Is it also a function maybe about obviously some of the inefficiencies go away, the slower growth is maybe a little bit easier to serve? You're a little bit in scramble mode right now. But is there also some price increases for the calendar year that you're expecting? Or just to better understand, we all know that it was going to be back half loaded on the margin just trying to get incremental comfort on the pieces.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","David, it's Tom. We do feel very good about the back half. And you're right. Clearly we've been racing up to get on top of the demand, and we feel very good about what we see on the metrics productivity freight costs going down in the second half that they will start to peel-off even more as we go into the second half of FY 2019.","Pricing actions and activity has been very robust as we've worked, as Lee described, throughout the year. I think we've done a great job on that. We have been on top of it and that will clearly help us as well as we go into next year.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Okay. I'll get back in queue. Thank you very much.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Okay. Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I've got some more math for you. Cathy, I think you just said $75 million of synergy savings from CLARCOR in 2019. If I figured out 75% split North America, that's still 110 basis points of margin expansion that you would get in North America just from the CLARCOR synergy savings. I'd expect you'd have some productivity improvements some low duplicate costs going through as the year progresses. Yet the midpoint of North American guidance is only up 40 basis points.","Can you guys talk about what the additional drag on margins there is and why we shouldn't expect to see some of those margins improved a bit more than what's in your guidance?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Well, Nathan, this is Tom. If you look at it in total, these are some pretty good MROSs for North America, because it's still going to come up full year in that 25% to 30% range. And all the particulars that you're talking about the ins and outs, these are still good numbers with a second half that really reflects I think what you're saying.","The first half has still got the redundant plans and activities that we're doing there over time, et cetera, that will be running. And you're going to the second half with 40% to 50%, which is going to reflect all of the numbers that you're seeing. And so I think it's weighed down primarily because of the first half performance. But a full year in a 25% to 30% range is a very good number, given the plant closure activity we'll complete in the first half.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And I know you guys, have limited visibility into what happens in the second half of the fiscal year and you've kind of use that regression model of the 48\/52 revenue split. Can you talk about maybe what your assumptions are for first half organic revenue growth versus what second half organic revenue growth is by segment if you have those there?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Sure, Nathan. So in the first half, Tom had mentioned that we're expecting organic growth of midpoint of 5%. That breaks down close to 6.5% North America, just under 3% International and just over 6.5% for Aerospace.","In the second half, the overall organic growth is expected to be around 2.5% and that breaks down as a little bit over 3% for North America, close to 2.5% for International and just under 1% for Aerospace.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And you guys pretty much assume that current business trends maintain into the second half. And if there was any improvement in the economy these continue to grow there would potentially be upside to those numbers in the second half?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","So, Nathan, it's Tom. Yes, I would feel that that's the right way to describe it. I would not \u2013 just for everybody that's listening, I would not over-read the second half. Obviously, we get the benefit of being one of the first companies to describe 2019 and we're giving it our best visibility based on the models that we've built to describe that.","But I think this environment, I'm very encouraged by the economic environment, the activity levels we have with our customers and our distributors. So I think, obviously, the second half has got opportunities to improve.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very helpful. Thanks very much for your time.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Nathan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. A lot of my questions have been answered. But I wanted to go back to your comments perhaps on EAME (46:23) moderating a little bit through the course of Q2. Perhaps you could give us a little more color on that either by country or by end market or just any commentary that you're seeing in that region, please.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Ann, it's Tom. And I'm not going to go by country by country, but it continues to be a good region for us. I think most of what we saw was seasonal and typical Europe as they go into the summer period and the heavy holiday time for Europeans.","In general, if you were to look at how Europe trends versus our other regions, it tends to tread at a lower growth rate. So that was not unexpected. And that's really what we forecasted for Europe as we go into the next year. At a high level, it's Latin America at the highest growth rate, North America and Asia towards the top end of that range that I described 2.5% to 5%, and Europe being more towards the lower end of that range.","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","And, Ann, this is Lee. I would just add on I've personally reached out to a lot of our larger customers. They are very, very encouraged going forward. So I think some of it is just seasonal, as Tom said.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. that's helpful color. And then on the margin outlook. Aerospace 19.9% operating profit in Q4. That can come from a lot of different things, but what drove that strong margin in the fourth quarter versus the guide for the full year for 2019?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, Ann, we typically see a very nice aftermarket mix in both \u2013 mostly third quarter tends to be our highest best quarter for mix in terms of aftermarket, but the fourth quarter it came through as well for us. We had some nice military aftermarket that won't necessarily repeat and it helped the mix and the margin. We also were more effective with our development costs.","Development costs for the year came in at 6.5% which is lower than we were expecting. We've gotten more efficient with that effort. And then it was overall just productivity improvement in the operations as the team continues to realign and work on Win Strategy initiatives. So a bit of it won't continue because of the mix, but we hope to see continued improvement in margins through productivity improvements and continued efficiency in the development cost activities.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just for clarification, what were development costs previously? And is the 6.5% sustainable? Is that what's in the margin guide?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. We have been running closer to 7.25% or higher in prior years. The last couple of years have been high because of the new platforms that we've been working hard to get into service. That will now taper down as the planes are getting ready to fly and we're at a more normal operating level for development costs. We're expecting next year to average somewhere between 6.25% and 6.75% of sales for Aerospace.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good day, everyone.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. Tom, I was wondering if we could just step back maybe bigger picture. Obviously we all have our calculators and protractors out here trying to work through your arithmetic. But we're comparing a heavy transition year in 2018 to somewhat of a partial transition year in 2019, with the carryover effects you're dealing with. Just going to get on the other side of this, has the incremental margin profile with the company materially changed? And what would you guide us to as a reasonable underlying incremental once the dust settles from the sort of thing?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, Jeff. It's Tom. So, you're talking about, say, beyond FY 2019?","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","So, I think a good number is always that 30% plus or minus a little bit. And we are on a march here. We're going to get to 19% segment operating margins and 20% EBITDA margins and we're not going to stop. But that's the next bridge we want to go over. And we gave some visibility in the Investor Relations Day as to various buckets that we're going to go after.","But what I'm so encouraged by is we're in an environment now, unless we go back to the first Investor Day that we hosted for you when Lee and I both took our jobs, we thought we were living on a 1% to 2% organic growth world. And whether our 2.5% to 5% ends up being an actual number, it's still a significantly better environment for industrial companies than it was just a couple of years ago.","And you put all the changes we've outdone on the new Win Strategy around engagement and ownership, our premier customer experience, things we're doing, that experience for customers, all of the initiatives and growth, this has been the best period we've had demonstrating growth greater than the market than we probably have done in the last 10 years. And we continue \u2013 which we plan to do in 2019 and clearly set a new standard for ourselves.","And then the financial performance initiatives, we haven't talked much about simplification on the call yet, but we're early days in that because we are just now starting to tackle the 80\/20 of our revenue complexity and we've got more to do on Lean and supply chain and pricing activities. So I'm very encouraged. We had a lot of work that we're doing that is sometimes difficult to see what's happening underneath, which is why I tried to give us much color as I could to the EBITDA side of things and the fact that we hit record reported margins.","Just to put it in context, FY 2012 15.2% and the reported margin this year is 15.7%. Well that was in round numbers almost $200 million. If you add up all the incremental D&A from CLARCOR the incremental costs to achieve and the restructuring $200 million of headwind and we still put 50 basis points higher than the all-time record of the company.","I think, which is the point you're getting at, is once you start to move from that and you have less of those unusual activities which we will once we clear FY 2019, there is a very strong underlying performance. And we're the kind of group that we're not going to be happy with static performance. So it's all about continuous improvement and driving EPS to higher levels for our shareholders.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. Thank you for that. Then the one other thing I'm trying to get at with that too is I would think that 30%-ish underlying is happening as we speak and there's all this noise around that. And just adding together those puts and takes, I think a lot of us on the phone are getting to higher numbers?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yes, I think you're right. Because I think the comment \u2013 not to be too precise, but when we talked about it at IR Day, we talked about something closer more in the mid-30s because of the changes that we have made and the investment we're going to make in CapEx, tighter productivity that we'd hope to lift up in our traditional 30%, give or take, just to a little higher band going beyond FY 2019.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Sure, Joe. Good morning.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just in the guide, what's your underlying assumptions for IP? Should we just assume that it's 150 basis points below in a range there? Or how are you building up to that? And what's your view inherent in that on price cost for next year?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","I'll take the IP question and I'll let Lee discuss the price cost. And this is Tom, Joe. So, we have to build this because you don't typically get a global industrial forecast based on the Parker fiscal year. But we do our best to build it. That forecast is approximately 2.7%. So at our range of 2.5% to 5%, we would clearly be performing at greater than that.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, 2.7% is your baseline forecast for the Parker timeframe global IP?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Right.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","I'll let Lee talk about...","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Joe, it's Lee. Just maybe reiterating what I mentioned earlier. So we've got some very good processes here internally that really track input costs and sales price. And at a minimum, we'll be margin neutral going forward. We are on top of it, have been on top of it. And if you look at us in cycles past where we've had inflation, we're pretty good at making sure, at worst case, we're margin neutral.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then last for me. Cathy, I think you mentioned this on Ann's question, but the development cost for Aero next year, I think you said 6.25%, 6.75%. Can you remind me of what it was in the last couple of years?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","It's been more in the 7-plus percent range. I think we finished FY 2017 at a little \u2013 about 7.3%. The year before 7.6%. It was as high as 10% back when we first started on some of these new platforms. So we're now at a more normal, stable level as the platforms are entering service.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Nicole Deblase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Sure.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, my first question is just around tariffs. So, we've kind of extensively talked about what price\/cost looks like for you guys this year and into 2019. But if you could talk a little bit about any work you've done on the expected impact from tariffs on your business in 2019.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, Nicole. It's Tom. So, the short answer on tariffs, and I'll give you the longer one here in a second, is we're in good shape. Our supply chain model, we make, buy and service in the region for the region. So that naturally helps us. But if I just go through Section 232 and 301 here for a minute. So, 232, which is the steel and aluminum, because of the reduction in the number countries that are actually being exposed, the number of exemptions that were placed and the fact that this is down to milled products only, it's only about $1.5 million of impact for us, all of Section 232.","And in Section 301, if you take list number one and list number two and even list number three, which is the $200 billion that the President has talked about, even at the latest number bumping it up to 25% tariff, that's about $18 million even all of that. So in round numbers, if you add the 232 at $1.5 million and $18 million for 301, you're looking at approximately $20 million for us.","So it's pretty immaterial against our total direct material spend. And our process is, we're going to pass that on. We're going to cover that cost immediately. And we're not going to eat one dime of that and I think our customers understand that. And so this is small for us and we're going to cover it.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then just one on Industrial International margins. Seems like the margin expansion that you guys are forecasting year-on-year is pretty impressive on kind of I'd say pretty modest revenue growth next year. If you could just elaborate a little bit on what's driving the confidence in the MROS there, that would be helpful.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Sure, Nicole. Yeah, we've been working hard in our international operations to realign them to a more effective cost base. And they've been now getting to the point where we are enjoying the savings from that and the higher margins. So we have more to do. There's more realignment that we continue to work on and more improvements. They also have gotten better and better at the tools that we use through the Win Strategy in becoming more productive in our normal operations. And so we're seeing the benefits of all of that and we expect that to continue into fiscal 2019 despite the volume not increasing too significantly.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Nicole. Brian, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Yes, ma'am. Our last question then will come from the line from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. I guess I better make this a good one, right, since it's the last question.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","The pressure's on, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","I know. Seriously. So most of my questions have been answered. So can we talk pension? Discount rates for you, given your 30 June year-end, discount rates are significantly higher. And market returns are also healthy, positive as well. So just wondering how the pension expense in fiscal 2019 is tracking versus fiscal 2018.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, Nigel, we're forecasting \u2013 we have raised the discount rate slightly, which will benefit our pension expense. However, as we looked at the rate of return on assets that we were using, we did decide to lower that slightly, which is going to offset the benefit we got from the discount rate change. So we expect FY 2019 to be pretty comparable to our fiscal year 2018 pension expense.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just coming back to the pricing, and I'm curious whether the strength in pricing that you're talking about and the confidence in passing through the inflationary impact of tariffs, is that both through OEM and channel? So would you describe OEM pricing power as strong as channel, or is it a case of OEMs being squishy but, say, there's enough pricing power in the channel to offset that?","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Nigel, it's Lee. Definitely the distribution channel is a little more elastic than the OEM channel, but we've been effective in both channels. And there's inflation throughout it. So these are conversations nobody wants to have, but everybody understands where we have to get to. So we've been successful in both.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thanks, Lee.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Okay. Thank you, Nigel. All right. This concludes our Q&A and the earnings call for today. Thank you for joining us. Robert and Ryan will be available throughout the day to take your calls should you have any further questions.

My name is Katina, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call Ms. Robin Davenport, Vice President, Corporate Finance. Please proceed.","Robin Davenport","Thank you, Katina. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Parker Hannifin second quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today on the call is Chairman, Don Washkewicz; our newly elected Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Marten.","Today's presentation slides together with the audio webcast replay will be accessible on the company's investor information website at www.phstock.com for one year following today's call.","On Slide 2, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and were posted on Parker's website, at www.phstock.com.","So moving to Slide 3, our call agenda is outlined. We'll start with Chairman, Don Washkewicz, as he provides highlights for the second quarter. Secondly, Parker's newly elected Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, will make some introductory comments. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's second quarter performance together with the revised guidance for fiscal year 2015. Following our prepared comments, we'll open the call for Q&A session. And finally, Don will conclude today's call with some closing comments.","So at this time, I'll turn it over to Don and ask that you refer to Slide number 4.","Donald Washkewicz","Thanks, Robin, and welcome to everyone on the call. We certainly appreciate your participation today, especially in light of the fact that you're digging out of a massive snow storm, especially those up in the Northeast and Boston, in particular. So we appreciate you're participating today.","I'll take a few minutes to talk about the quarter, before I introduce Tom Williams, our new CEO, to make some additional remarks. First, a few comments on our second quarter. We had a record second quarter. Our earnings per share exceeded our expectations and has led to a solid first half and continuing positive trends for the company. While we are facing challenges in certain regions and end-markets, especially with respect to currency headwinds, we continue to execute well on what is a moderately positive economic environment.","As you can see by the numbers, the benefits of our timely global restructuring executed in the past 18 months are helping to offset weaknesses in some of the regions and end-market segments, and we'll get into that a little bit later. Having said that, we are confident in our ability to achieve another year of record results, as outlined in company's guidance for the year. So here are some second quarter highlights.","Sales were up 1% for the quarter, as strong organic growth of 4% was partially offset by significant currency headwinds. So you can see that the impact of currency was very dramatic, greater than I have ever seen in the past in this position. Order rates remain positive at 4% with growth in every segment. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive order growth, so we are very excited about that trend as well.","Segment operating margin was 13.7% or 14% as adjusted. We are very pleased with these margins, considering that the December quarter, as we have talked about in the past, is historically our weakest quarter for margins. We remain on course to deliver on our target to exceed 15% segment operating margin in fiscal year 2015. This will be, by the way, the second year in the company's history where we did deliver a 15% operation margin. The last time was in fiscal year 2012.","Earnings per share increased 8% to $1.80 and on an adjusted basis earnings increased 41% to $1.84 per share, both of which were second quarter records. Cash flow of 8.9% of sales, just shy of 9%. We expect fiscal 2015 to be our 14th consecutive fiscal year, where cash flows exceed 10% of sales and we're very pleased with that record performance as well. In addition, this is also expected to be our 14th consecutive fiscal year, where free cash flow is greater than net income.","Our capital allocation priorities remain the same, as they have been in the past, with our top priority to maintain our dividend increases. As you know, our dividends have been raised for 58 consecutive years. We have increased the dividend 31% this year. We announced that last quarter. And we've raised dividends 150% in the last five years. So you can see that the priority that we've put on dividends is significant.","We've also been active in our share repurchase program following our October announcement of a new authorization for the purchase of $2 billion to $3 billion in shares over two years. During the second quarter, as we have announced, we repurchased $817 million worth of Parker shares, and we're going to give you a little update. And as of today, we have now purchased a total of $1.2 billion in Parker shares since the October announcement, so that's effective as of today. As always, we will continue to look for strategic acquisitions to help achieve our growth goals going forward.","Regarding the guidance, following a strong first half of the year we have increased our guidance. Adjusted guidance has been increased to a range of $7.90 to $8.30 per share and excludes $0.20 of restructuring expenses.","I want to take this opportunity now to introduce Tom Williams to all of you. Tom will lead our future earnings calls. I want to congratulate Tom, who we recently announced will become our new Chief Executive Officer, effective February 1.","Tom has been highly successful in his previous role as Executive Vice President and Operating Officer for company. He brings significant experience from across Parker's businesses, having had leadership responsibility at one time for all of our product groups and all except one of our regions during the past eight years.","I would also like at this time to congratulate Lee Banks, who has been promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer. Lee too has had broad exposure to our businesses, groups and regions, as an Operating Officer for eight years, and at some point had responsibility for all, but one of our product groups and one region for the company.","Over the past 10 years, both Tom and Lee have benefited from an on-purpose management development and succession process here at the company. We are very fortunate to have the depth of talent and extensive knowledge of our company, our markets and our customers that Tom and Lee bring. They both will be part of a newly-created office of the Chief Executive that will also include our Chief Financial Office, Jon Marten. Tom and Lee have also been elected to serve on our board.","I have worked closely with Tom and Lee over many years now, and I am very confident in the strong executive leadership team that will succeed me. They have the ability and the drive to move Parker to higher levels of success and performance going forward. As Chairman, I am looking forward to a smooth transition to the new leadership.","I'll now hand the call over to Tom for a few comments.","Thomas Williams","Thank you, Don, and thank you to everyone for joining on the call today. I am honored and excited to be the new CEO of Parker. I'd like to take this moment on behalf of all of the Parker employees to thank Don for his great leadership as CEO and President of our company. His vision and his passion have completely transformed Parker and yielded significant improvements in our results over the years.","I really like our new leadership structure. As most of you know, Lee Banks and I have worked closely together, as the two Operating Officers for the company. I look forward to continuing to work side-by-side with Lee, as each of us take on our new roles as CEO and President and COO, respectively. In addition, we are fortunate to have a talented and deep leadership team that do a great job executing the win strategy.","My near-term goals are, first, to continue with the performance improvements that are underway and deliver on our financial commitments for this fiscal year. Second, to execute our current capital allocation strategy of increasing annual dividends, investments for organic and acquisition growth and share buybacks. The win strategy will continue as the business system and overarching strategy for the company. However, with new corporate leaders, it is an opportune time to refresh the win strategy.","Over the next several months we will be listening and assessing, as we formulate more detailed long-term plans for our company. Our goal is to take the win strategy and the company's performance to the next level. Don's leadership and the win strategy have positioned Parker well for future growth, and it is now my job to build upon the success and reinforce our position as the leader in motion control technologies.","I'll now hand things back over to Robin, to provide a closer look at the results.","Robin Davenport","Thank you, Tom. At this time, I'll begin to address the earnings per share for the quarter and ask that you refer to Slide 6.","Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.84 versus $1.30 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.54 or 42%. This excludes restructuring, which originally planned at $0.08 was $0.04 in the second quarter and compares to $0.06 for the same quarter last year.","On Slide 7, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 for the second quarter in '14 to $1.84 for the second quarter of this year. Notably, the key elements that contributed to the increase were, segment operating income of $0.21, reflecting improved performance across all of out segments. A reduced tax rate for the quarter that contributed $0.18, driven largely by the passage of the U.S. tax extenders bill, which afforded the company increased foreign tax credit and R&D tax credit.","Significantly, lower other for the period contributed $0.15, which included lower stock-based compensation expense and a number of favorable one-time items. And the impact of fewer share outstanding that equated to $0.04, offset slightly by increased interest expense of $0.03.","Moving to Slide 8. Total company organic sales in the first quarter increased more than 4% over the same quarter last year. There is minimal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisition and currency impact was considerably larger than planned, which reduced reported sales by $108 million or 3.5% in the quarter.","As shown on the bottom of this slide, total company segment operating margins for the second quarter adjusted for restructuring costs in the quarter were 14% versus 12.7% for the same quarter last year. Restructuring costs in the quarter were $9 million versus $13 million last year.","The higher adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $439 million versus $393 million last year, was an 11.7% improvement, is due to higher volume and a favorable mix in North America in aerospace, lower development costs in aerospace and improvements resulting from the restructuring actions taken in Europe.","Now, moving to Slide 9, focusing on the business segments, we'll commence with the Diversified Industrial North America segment. For the second quarter, North American organic sales increased 5.2% to $1.4 billion from $1.3 billion last year. There was little impact from acquisitions and a modestly negative impact from currency in the quarter. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter increased to $227 million from $201 million or a 12.9% increase, driven mainly by higher volume and favorable mix.","Continuing to Slide 10, organic sales for the quarter in the Industrial International segment were flat. While acquisitions made minimal contributions, currency was a significant reduction to sales at 7.5%. Adjusting for restructuring cost, operating margin for the second quarter increased to 12.3% from 11.5%, as a result of savings associated with the realignment actions taken last year. As compared to our previous Q2 guide of 13.5% for the quarter, nearly all of this difference is attributed to negative currency.","Now, moving to Slide 11 for Aerospace Systems. Organic revenues increased slightly more than 11% for the quarter. With no impact from acquisitions, currency posted a modest 0.4% reduction. The sales growth for the period was driven by higher commercial OEM and military aftermarket business. Operating margins for this quarter increased 310 basis points from 8.9% to 12%, due to higher margin OEM business and aftermarket sales volume.","On Slide 12, we'll detail the orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year and exclude acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while aerospace systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. The total orders were a positive 4% for the quarter; and Diversified Industrial North American orders for the quarter just ended increased 4%; Diversified Industrial International orders increased 1% for the quarter; and Aerospace orders increased 9% for the quarter.","One Slide 13, we report cash flow from operations, which year-to-date was $538 million or 8.4% sales. The significant items impacting cash in the second quarter were as follows: $910 million was returned to shareholders through share repurchases of $817 million in the quarter and dividend payments of $93 million; $1.5 billion was added to cash following the company's long-term bond issuance in November; proceeds from the bond issuance were used to fully repay commercial paper outstanding in the amount of $702 million.","So moving to Slide 14, the revised guidance for our full year fiscal year 2015 is shown. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis to align with last quarter. Sales growth for the full year is adjusted for the GE joint venture that commenced at the beginning of the second quarter in fiscal year 2014 and segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude restructuring charges.","So beginning with sales, total adjusted sales are expected to remain flat at the midpoint with a range of negative 1% to positive 1% as compared to the prior year. This is lower than previous guidance provided at the end of last quarter, due to the negative impact from currency, mainly the strengthening of the dollar versus the euro throughout the quarter.","Given the precipitous strengthening of the dollar, we have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of January 19, 2015. And we have held those rates steady, as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2015. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is 3.3%, and there is minimal impact from acquisition carryover.","Currency in the guidance is a deduction to sales of 3.4%, which is nearly all related to Industrial International. For total Parker, adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 15.6% and 15.9%. This compares to 14.4% realized for fiscal year 2014 on an adjusted basis.","The guidance for below the line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and other, is $455 million for the year at the midpoint. Now this is lower than the previous guidance, due to the second quarter favorable results, which included reduced stock-based compensation expense and one-time adjustment. The full-year tax rate is projected at 27%, which is also a reduction from prior guidance of 29%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 145.8 million shares.","Now, on the topic of share repurchase. The sizable repurchase activity during the quarter was consistent with our announcement in October. And as Don mentioned, we estimate that share repurchase spend associated with the announced program will total $1.2 billion through the end of January, at which time the company plans to revert to the established 10b5-1 spend of $50 million per quarter. To date, this represents 60% of the low-end of the announced repurchase program, and we anticipate that the balance of the commitment for repurchase will be spread over the remaining 20 months.","For the full year, revised guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is increased to $7.90 to $8.30 range, which is $8.10 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes restructuring expenses of approximately $43 million to be incurred in fiscal year 2015, which is a reduction from the previously guided $50 million in spend.","The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.20 for the full year, which is estimated to be $0.08 in the third quarter and $0.04 in the fourth quarter. Despite the reduced projected restructuring expense, previously guided savings of $23 million remain unchanged.","On Slide 15, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of our revised 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to $8.10 at the midpoint from the prior guidance of $7.75. Key contributions to the increase include, $0.28 from fewer shares outstanding, $0.24 from the reduced tax rate and $0.24 from favorable reduced other expense.","In turn, these are offset by a $0.25 reduction in segment operating income, factored largely by the impact of currency headwinds in the Industrial International segment and $0.16 from higher interest expense associated with the recent long-term debt issuance.","So let me summarize with a few key metrics, with respect to guidance. Sales are divided 49% or $6.4 billion in the first half; 51% or $6.8 billion in the second half. Segment operating income is divided first half 47%, second half 53%.","EPS, first half\/second half is 46%\/54% or $3.73 in the first half and $4.37 in the second half at the midpoint, and these numbers exclude restructuring. Third quarter EPS is projected to be $1.94 at the midpoint, and this number has been adjusted for $0.08 of restructuring costs forecasted for the third quarter.","Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisitions and divestitures that may be made going forward in fiscal year '15. And for consistency, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates.","So Katina, at this time, we will open the call for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook representing Credit Suisse.","Ben Xiao","This is actually Ben Xiao on for Jamie. Best of luck to Don and congrats, Tom and Lee. So my first question is, can you just speak to order trends by month during the quarter as well as January in North America, Europe and Asia? Was it pretty consistent throughout or were there any specific months that were stronger or weaker than expectations?","Jon Marten","I think for the quarter, for our Q2, the order trends came in as we expected. We had a very good October. We had a pretty good November, and then a very good December. So the trends in the quarter were not deeply changing from month-to-month, but we did have a very good December. So that's what led to our guidance that we ended up providing here for the balance of the year.","Ben Xiao","And then on the operating margin guidance, it looks like it's mainly currency that's impacting international. So I guess for North America the implied incrementals for the back half of the year are a bit lower than the first half. Are there any specific drivers behind that?","Donald Washkewicz","No, those are really the incrementals for North America. And you're right. First of all, you're absolutely right on international. It is almost all currency driving that change in the margins. But for North America there are certain types of R&D, certain types of investments, this is consistent with what our guidance was at the end of last quarter. And so there is not one particular item altogether, there is a series of different items built into the guidance for the second half that is impacting slightly the incrementals for North America, which are at all-time high Q2 returns.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones representing Stifel.","Nathan Jones","If I could just, the international growth has obviously been taken down primarily due to currency. Is there an organic part of that reduced guidance there or is it entirely currency?","Donald Washkewicz","Almost all of it is currency. We are seeing some organic weakness in China in the construction business going forward, and that's impacting the numbers a little bit. And also internationally in oil and gas that's impacting the numbers a little bit. But that's less than 20% of the guidance going forward here. It's almost more than 80% of the reduction there, Nathan, is currency.","Thomas Williams","Nathan, its Tom. Just to add onto that, we've seen from some of the construction OEMs that they are actually shutting down the whole month of January all the way to Chinese New Year. So that's what's impacting some of those numbers.","Nathan Jones","And then on the corporate expense, which obviously includes interest, which is going up from your previous guidance, that's still gone down $15 million overall. Can you talk about what's on the good side of that ledger?","Jon Marten","Well, going forward on that is our latest analysis of all the lines in the income statement going for the next six months. And when we put them all together, Nathan, it's really primarily stock-based compensation. There is also some charges that we take at corporate that we won't need to take, that has to do with some really technical accounting work in terms of LIFO. So that's it in a nutshell. There's not one significant thing other than stock-based compensation.","Nathan Jones","And then just on the Diversified Industrial North America revenue growth rate, you took 50 basis points out of that at the midpoint. Is that primarily related to the oil and gas business in North America, is there anything else impacting that?","Jon Marten","No, I think, overall, Don hasn't gone through the markets yet. But if we had to give one answer to it, it would be our viewpoint on the weaker oil and gas going forward and that is built into our second half. It is not a pronounced number at this point. We're watching it very closely, but that would be the major driver, Nathan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin representing Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on buybacks. So should we assume that the rest of the buybacks in the next 20 months will be completed, you'll do it and then you'll tell us the way you do it beyond $50 million a quarter, is that what we should be thinking?","Jon Marten","That's correct, yes.","Andrew Obin","Can you guys just comment on the impact of oil on Parker's numbers? A, first, maybe talk about the negatives. I know we have a lot of questions from investors, as to what exactly your oil exposure is. There is a lot of debate there, and if you could walk us through that? And, b, the positive impact. How long do you think until we see the positive impact on spares in the aerospace business?","Jon Marten","Andrew, just to start with oil and gas, and then I'll get to the aerospace later. Big picture, our most recent 12 months oil and gas exposure is about $800 million. That's about 6% of our sales, half of that is OEM, half of that is aftermarket. It is also almost half in North America and about 35% in Europe and the balance around the world. We feel really good about the diversity of our oil and gas exposure. Half of it being in the aftermarket gives us less variability that we think that we'll see there going forward.","We've made great strides in our oil and gas exposure, bringing new technology, new innovation, new products to markets that have not seen our technology before. That's what's helped us really more than double our oil and gas exposure over the last five years. And we're making inroads in that market, because of the productivity and the savings that we're bringing to our customers.","Now, of course, going forward we're keeping a close eye on how that market is going to trend. Right now, today, anecdotally of course, we are hearing some comments from our customers. It is not going to impact our Q3, and that's what's built into our guidance dramatically. We don't think that it's going to really have a dramatic impact in our Q4 either.","We do feel like that, given our exposure, given our diversity and given the different types of upstream and downstream exposure that we have to oil and gas, that we won't be hurt as badly as you might think that we would, given the $800 million in sales in the past 12 months. So file that we are going to keep everybody updated each quarter going forward. And we know that we'll have an impact, but how big that will be is impossible to say right now. We are just going to kind of continue to update you as the quarters go on. So that's the big picture on oil and gas.","On the aerospace spares, I think that in our guidance going forward we have a modest increase in our spares projected for the second half. There is no doubt that as time goes on that spares and repairs, as a percentage of our aerospace business, will increase. When that inflection point is, as to when it starts to ramp up dramatically, is a question of debate right now. It's certainly not in our FY '15.","When we pull together FY '16 and we start really making our way through the OEM super cycle that we're in right now, we'll be able to really have a better estimate as many of the new aircraft start to order spares as they get more hours on them. So I think it is clearly a tailwind for us going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Inch representing Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","Can I just ask about the diversified industrial international margin update to guidance? I think, Robin, you said it was, the down shift was due to FX, but why would actually that impact margins? Doesn't FX convert at sort of the average margins, so that it should sort of provide a read-through at a constant basis? Or are your European margins higher in terms of where you're seeing the weakness or what? I'm not sure I really follow it.","Jon Marten","Well, our FX, your right, it does convert at our average margin and so we are reducing our sales forecast going forward. We are seeing in our international business, John, some additional headwinds when it comes to reaching the sales goals that we thought that we would get and so we're not getting the absolute margins that we are looking for. But it is true that our margins are and our updated guidance are slightly down.","John Inch","So Jon, so the drag is what, like as you called out, sort of the stoppage of construction. I'm assuming there's a mix issue then with respect to whether you're seeing disruption on your margins. Is that fair?","Jon Marten","Yes, it would be in Europe. We have a very healthy oil and gas business in Europe and so that would be part of it. And also would be internationally in China with the additional issues that we are calling out here in the construction end-markets there too.","John Inch","And then why is your tax rate going down 2 points? That seems like an awful lot. If international is a little weaker, doesn't international have lower tax rates, like why would the tax rate be going down 2 points?","Jon Marten","Well, in our original guidance there are two things that are really driving that. One is the legislation that was passed in December and we've gotten a significant research and development one-time credit. We're also building in our tax rate the impact of the balance of the legislation and the extenders legislation that was passed.","But also, we updated our guidance in terms of what our international income will be vis-\u00e0-vis our total income for the year. And when we did that it is counterintuitive, but when we did do that we did end up showing a larger percentage of our international income in our tax rate, therefore, driving down the overall tax rate for the company.","John Inch","I guess I could take that offline, but is there any sound bite? Like how does that work? How do your international numbers go down, but I'm not sure I'm following that?","Jon Marten","It has to do with the mix of income by country internationally, and I can explain that to you in more detail if you would like.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie representing Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","So my first question is really on the aero segment. It looks like you had really good organic growth this quarter, good margin expansion, but as you look into the back half of the year you're still expecting a pretty significant improvement on the margin. And so if you could just provide some color on what's going to drive that improvement; is R&D as a percentage of sales, still expected to be 9%? And are there mix issues that are going to benefit that in the second half?","Jon Marten","We are seeing that R&D, as a percent of sales, is going to still be right around the 9% level here, so that would be our update for you today, Joe. I think that it is going to be additional volume through the second half that is going to drive margins further. It is also going to be a slightly better mix for us in the commercial MRO and business here vis-\u00e0-vis our OEM business going forward here too, which will be driving incremental margins for us.","Joe Ritchie","And then I guess following up maybe on Nathan's question from earlier; is it typical to see Chinese construction OEMs basically shutdown spending this early ahead of the Chinese New Year?","Thomas Williams","Joe, this is Tom. No, that is definitely very unusual. Maybe they might extend it a week, but to extend it for that period of time is definitely unusual. That's one of the impacts we included in the international segment for the second half of the year.","Joe Ritchie","And then maybe what if I could sneak in one last one on the buyback? If you could just kind of walk through your funding assumptions for the buyback, how much of the buyback or what percentage of the buyback can you fund through going out into the CP market versus free cash flow versus term debt, that would be helpful.","Jon Marten","Joe, our intent is to have our CP market, our CP balance at zero by June 30. So we are going to be funding our additional incremental stock buybacks through operating cash flow.","Joe Ritchie","And the debt that you called out at the end of last year?","Jon Marten","Well, the debt that we called out at the end of last year was used to pay down, as Robin explained on the CP and that we had an outstanding, so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond representing KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeff Hammond","So just a couple housekeeping items on the buyback. Can you give us ending diluted share count for the quarter and what your average price you paid for the $1.2 billion or so that you bought?","Jon Marten","The average price that we paid for the $1.2 billion was $126.5. And the ending share count at the end of the quarter was 148.7 million.","Jeff Hammond","And then maybe can you just address the M&A pipeline and if any of this market choppiness is likely to bring back any of these larger deals you had looked at.","Thomas Williams","Jeff, this is Tom. I would characterize the pipeline as kind of skinny right now; not as deep as we would like to have. Valuations continue to be high. However, our strategy is still to grow via acquisitions. And we've got a history of being a great acquirer and gaining a lot of synergies as we do that, so we will continue to do that. We do want to beef up that pipeline. That will be one of the things that Lee and I focus on is to increase that pipeline.","I don't see here during the share buyback period us doing a very large deal. I think we are focus on our bread-and-butter acquisitions, the normal size you've seen us do historically. Maybe after that if it made sense and the right property came along we would look at it, but I think we'll focus on our space and the sizes you've seen us do in the past.","Jeff Hammond","Jon, just back to the share count. I think you had 148.2 million for the average for the quarter. I'd expect that the ending would have come in lower than that, given the buyback activity?","Jon Marten","Well, I thought that you asked for the period ending number there, Jeff, so I would have to get back to you on the average for the quarter. I can tell you this, the average for the year that is included in our guidance is 145.8 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski representing Buckingham Research.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just first question here, I guess a lot of focus on the oil and gas business. Maybe if we can look at that from the other side in terms of price cost. Clearly commodities have come in across the board. You guys technically have pretty good pricing power through distribution. Is that something you factored into your guidance or something we should expect to see in this fiscal year?","Thomas Williams","As far as materials and price, maybe just step back for a second and talk about how we normally look at those. But we always look at Sell Price Index or SPI, and we look at purchase price index that we're paying coming in. And the goal is always to have that be slightly positive, which is what we have factored into the guidance.","When I look at materials, it's kind of a mixed bag. We've got aluminum and zinc that are slightly bit plus, I'm giving you prices versus the prior year. On the negative side, meaning prices going down in castings, copper, but remember copper is typically indexed for a lot of our OEMs and flows through on pricing and material that happens. Nickel is soft. And then bar stock is flat. So it's kind of a mixed bag, but what's in the guidance is a slightly positive help with PPI versus SPI.","Josh Pokrzywinski","And then just a follow-up on the buyback. Have you guys been able to tighten the range on total purchase over the next 20 months or are we still sticking with that $1 billion wide range at this point?","Thomas Williams","The range is really going to be predicated by what other capital opportunities are out there, primarily acquisitions. So we are committed to the minimum side for sure, the $2 billion. But if we saw acquisitions that we liked, we would stay at the low end of that at the $2 billion. If there wasn't a lot of activity that we could action, you'll see us towards the top end.","Josh Pokrzywinski","So there is a commitment though to spend $3 billion in some way, shape, or form?","Thomas Williams","That's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Magers representing Wells Fargo Securities.","Sara Magers","This is Sara on for Andy Casey. I realized that you've probably talked a little bit about the components of the higher other income, but could you give a little bit more color as to the lower stock comp expense in the favorable one-time items and within Q2 and then within the guidance? And, if possible, the split for Q3 and Q4 in the second half.","Jon Marten","Well, we see the split in Q3 and Q4 to be just about 50-50. The stock comp expense being down as we update our guidance just has to do with -- there's a lot of variables involved, but in general it has to do with our relative profitability, our relative profitability to our past, our relative profitability in accordance with our proxy peers.","And it also has to do with how we are trending long-term over a three and four-year time period. We are constantly updating those updates in accordance with the plan determinations, and as we do that it's just incumbent upon us to keep the guidance updated. That line in our income statement can be quite variable over time, so we are just trying to give you the best information that we have today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague representing Vertical Partner Investors.","Jeff Sprague","I was wondering if you could just address restructuring, a small change, but kind of with the challenging world a little surprised you dialed it back a little bit. Would that reflect that you are getting more bang for the buck or there's savings coming through at a faster rate? Maybe you could just elaborate there.","Jon Marten","Jeff, I think the really key message there is that there were -- our European restructuring program is just about complete, so the dialing back of the restructuring program has more to do with projects that we had underway outside of Europe that were dialed in for our fourth quarter. And we didn't really have much savings built, any savings built in to our FY '15 that were going to impact FY '16. And those projects are moved out of our guidance and may or may not be in our FY '16 guidance. We have not made that final determination yet, but we'll update you then.","Jeff Sprague","And I was just wondering on, maybe this gets to talking about some of the key verticals, but motion systems looks like it was relatively weak versus other parts of the portfolio. Could you address kind of what's going on there in the big buckets, ag, off-highway, other key drivers?","Thomas Williams","I will start on the technology platforms and I'll let Don go through all the markets. So first on the motion systems and really the flow of process control at the two technology platforms that were soft. If you look at all the platforms, they had the most exposure to some of the soft end-markets, farm and ag, construction and mining, so those are why those two are down.","But then what did the technology platform show you is the power of the portfolio here, so engineered materials and filtration, and aerospace were positive offsetting that because of their exposure to automotive, telecom and of course, anything related to aerospace has been positive. Truck, marine and even with early signs in oil and gas, oil and gas is still positive year-over-year for us. So the motion and flow in process control, they were soft because of those ag, construction, and mining. But I'll let Don go through the typical market review.","Donald Washkewicz","Jeff, would you like a little color on the PMIs and some of the trends and order trends?","Jeff Sprague","I think, we probably got our hands on the PMIs pretty well, but any vertical market color would be helpful, yes.","Donald Washkewicz","Maybe I will start with the regions. If we look at Industrial North America, the way I would describe it would be moderately steady growth there. 3\/12 order trends north of 100, at about 104; 12\/12 running about 105.","So Industrial North America pretty consistent with what we have been talking about as far as our order activity here has been moderate, steady growth and it has been positive. Europe is flat, 3\/12 100 to 101 in that range, pretty flat. 12\/12 running about 100, which means there is virtually no growth in Europe currently. So that's what is happening there. By the way, that does not include the headwind from the currency. This is just the underlying growth of the region.","Slower growth in Asia, 3\/12 running about 102; 12\/12 still at 107, so we would expect the 12\/12 to trend down slightly over the next several months. And we'll be updating that as we go forward. Then declining growth in Latin America, we talked about that before. Latin America is one of the toughest regions out there right now. We have a smaller position there, but it's still a tougher region, 3\/12 running about 90%.","And then I want to just comment a little bit on some of the key markets in the same fashion that I have in the past. But one thing that I do want to point out and that we tend to overlook in many cases is our distribution channel. That is one of the strongest segments we have of all segments. It represents half of our industrial business. 3\/12 trend on distribution alone is running about 110%, which is extremely strong. 12\/12 is running about 110%, so here is a segment of our business that's just going full blast and doing extremely well. So I would say that segment is very strong.","The other very strong segment out there right now is heavy-duty truck; 3\/12 cyclical or pressure curve is running about 112%; 12\/12 running about 110%, so very comparable to our distribution. Those are the two strongest market segments for us right now, doing extremely well.","We see early recovery in our numbers in the construction, interesting enough; 3\/12 on the construction side; off-highway running about 110%; 12\/12 still closer to 100%, but that would bode well. It seems like early days in a construction recovery that we are witnessing right now and that would be positive going forward. I'm not talking about Asia so much now when I'm talking about that because what Tom said is still true in Asia; there is somewhat of a slowdown there. This would be more reflective of what's happening in North America.","Another segment would be semicon market segment, that's pretty much flat; 3\/12 and 12\/12 running about 100%. I think everyone knows that ag is weakening. 3\/12 there is running around 90%; 12\/12 running about 90%, so that probably has not hit bottom yet. Hopefully that would happen within the near term. So that is a little bit of headwind going against us. And then aerospace, of course, is strong; 12\/12 running around 110% there as well, so that is doing well.","So those would be some of the pressure curves vis-\u00e0-vis be the order trend curves now, and then I will just give you some sequential activity in the different markets as I have done in the past. Markets that are trending sequentially very strong for us would be all the aerospace, both the commercial and defense side with the exception of the defense OEM. So defense aftermarket, commercial OEM and aftermarket being very positive sequentially.","I mentioned distribution being very strong. Cars and light trucks, forestry, telecom, marine are all positive sequentially. Heavy-duty trucks I mentioned before extremely strong right now, and industrial trucks and material handling positive as well, along with residential air-conditioning. The list of segments that are sequentially going down or negative is relatively short. We've got aerospace and defense, OEM business, farm and ag, which I just mentioned earlier, machine tools, general industrial, life sciences, and mining would be on the negative side.","And then kind of flat right now, but with the comments that I made earlier, still in effect, flat being off-highway construction. Again, keep in mind that North America looking a little bit positive in the early going here and Asia being more negative in construction. The other flat segments for us would be semiconductor, lawn and turf, power gen, and then commercial refrigeration, commercial air-conditioning, and industrial refrigeration.","So hopefully that was helpful. It will give you a little bit more color on some of the segments and some of the regions out there as to what's happening. But I think the take away is that, yes, there is some headwinds that we have, but the nice thing is, as Parker is so broad based in so many different market segments, there's some nice tailwinds as well that are offsetting some of the headwinds that we are seeing.","Operator","With no further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the call back to Ms. Robin Davenport for closing remarks.","End of Q&A","Robin Davenport","Thank you, Katina. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Don for his closing comments.","Donald Washkewicz","Thank you. Just a few closing comments. First of all, I want to again thank everyone on the call for joining us this morning, especially in the tough environment that you have out there for those up in the Northeast of course. I also want to thank you. I heard a lot of congratulations on the phone and I just want to thank you for those congrats, both for Tom and Lee and myself in our new assignments. I have certainly enjoyed participating on our quarterly calls over the past 15 years. Fortunately for Parker and our shareholders, they have been some of the best years in the company's history.","With Tom and Lee now at the helm, I am totally confident that they will continue the momentum we have established and improve upon the successes we have had. I am pleased to end on a positive note as we anticipate that fiscal '15 will be a record year and that we will exceed our much sought after goal of 15% segment operating margin over the cycle.","As always, I will take this opportunity to thank our employees, our global employees, our global workforce for their continued commitment and success, not only today, but during all of the years that I have led Parker. Our global team has done an amazing job executing the win strategy and delivering positive year results year-over-year. My best wishes and thanks to all of you in the financial community for your support of Parker.","I look forward to continuing to serve our shareholders, along with my fellow directors and our new management team as Chairman of the Board. Of course, if you have any additional questions, Robin and Todd will be around for the balance of the day. And so with that, I'd just want to once again thank you and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will host a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Cathy Suever, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thank you, Candace. Good morning and welcome to Parker Hannifin's first quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom Williams and President and Chief Operating Officer Lee Banks. Today's presentation slides together with the audio webcast replay will be accessible on the company's Investor Information website at phstock.com for one year following today's call.","On slide number 2, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and are also posted on Parker's website at phstock.com.","Today's agenda appears on slide number 3. To begin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, will provide highlights for the first quarter. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's first quarter performance together with the guidance for the full year fiscal 2019. Tom will then provide a few summary comments, and we'll open the call for a question-and-answer session.","Please refer now to slide number 4, as Tom will get us started with the highlights.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thank you, Cathy, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for your participation and your interest in Parker.","We're off to a great start. It was an excellent start to fiscal 2019. We delivered record performance across many measures.","Starting with safety, as we always do, our safety performance remains our top priority. We had a 20% reduction in recordable incidents for the quarter, and we're striving to create a zero-accident environment for our people. That's the goal there. And we've gotten really strong engagement from our team members around the world on safety, and you can see the difference. With the engagement of our people, you see a big difference in the performance there.","Let me start the call with some summary comments and key takeaways on how the business is doing. First, we had a number of all-time quarterly records, EPS, net income, ROS, and segment operating margins. We reached 17% operating margins for the quarter on an as-reported basis, which is really remarkable performance. It's an all-time record for us.","And if you just reflect back to Investor Day in September 2015, so this is about nine months after Lee and I took our jobs. And we had a slide that we showed you that had a walk from 14.5% operating margin to 17% as our goal, and we wanted to achieve that over a 5-year period of time. So while we're all about continuous improvement, that's a nice accomplishment. It's a nice milestone to hit, and we're really proud of the team for doing it.","We also in the business have experienced some very nice positive organic growth. The balance sheet has continued to get stronger, which is giving us more options and flexibility in how we want to deploy that capital going forward. The CLARCOR integration continues to track well, and we're raising our guidance for the fiscal year as a result of the Q1 performance.","We've reached \u2013 those goals I talked about at the 2015 Investor Day, we reached those FY 2020 5-year goals in just three years, so two years early. And if I just remind you what those goals were, we wanted to grow 150 basis points greater than market, using global industrial production as our proxy for the market, and we've been able to do that. The 17% segment operating margin, hit that. EPS of an 8% or higher growth CAGR, we've been doing that, and free cash flow conversion of greater than 100%.","So it's some nice targets, but what's best about our company and what's really exciting going forward is that we have a ton of opportunity to improve going forward, and that's going to bode well for our shareholders and our people. And as a result, we've set new 5-year targets, the FY 2023 targets, which we shared with you recently at the March Investor Day. So my thanks to everybody and all the Parker team members around the world for the great progress that we've seen and really what's going to be a great future as we look forward.","So let's go back to the quarter. It was a great quarter, nice profitability improvement. On the top line, sales growth was 3%. It was impacted by currency translation and the Facet divestiture. But underlying that, the organic growth was at 6%, which was in line with our expectations. EPS was an all-time quarterly record, which increased 33% from our Q1 record one year ago.","We saw positive order rates continue against some tough comps. We had segment operating margins, which I mentioned earlier at an all-time 17% as reported, but we also had adjusted operating margin at 17.2%. EBITDA came in 155 basis points up to 17.7% reported or 18.0% adjusted.","We were able to fund $200 million of discretionary pension contribution, which created a nice favorable tax consequence for us. This was a very timely opportunity for us to take advantage of that investment. And we're on track to deliver greater than 100% free cash flow conversion and operating cash flow exceeding 10% of sales when you exclude that discretionary pension contribution.","So looking forward, our end markets are largely positive. We'll talk more about that during the Q&A. And we're projecting a healthy organic growth outlook.","I want to make a couple comments about Aerospace. The business is performing extremely well. What you're really seeing is you're seeing prior-year investments paying off. So we have a long-cycle business with a very attractive future. I wanted to thank the Aerospace team for a really great quarter and really last year as well.","The current performance is really reflective of the hard work we've done on R&D, the Win Strategy, the entry-into-service work that we've been doing, and we've got a business that's long-cycle at a high level, but the good thing is that it's got lots of opportunities, just like the Industrial portion of the company, to continue to improve.","So as I mentioned earlier, the balance sheet is stronger, creating more alternatives when we think about what our capital deployment priorities are. And the lineup is very consistent with what you've heard me talk about in the past. We're going to continue our dividend increases. We're not going to break the continuous increase record on dividends paid. We're going to continue to invest for organic growth and productivity, which is the most efficient value creator we can do for our shareholders. We always are evaluating strategic acquisitions. And we're looking at share repurchases. We're looking at obviously continuing our 10b5-1 program, but we're going to look at evaluating opportunistic discretionary share repurchases concurrently.","Regarding CLARCOR, the integration is going well, and my thanks to the team for all the heavy lifting that they've been doing. A couple noteworthy items, all the production lines have been moved, and all the plants that we wanted to close are now closed. I'm going to say that last one again. All the plants we wanted to close are now closed. That is a huge milestone for us. That's an important turning point when we talk about improving the margins for North America.","We're working on finishing the qualifications and the production ramp-up of those recent Q1 moves. That will be happening in Q2, and we feel very good about the synergies. They're on track, and we feel good about the second half for the company and the second half in particular for North America as a result of those actions.","So on the outlook, we've increased EPS guidance by $0.30 at the midpoint to $11.20 as reported or $11.40 adjusted. This reflects our strong first quarter, the margin expansion that we've demonstrated, and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Organic growth is in the 2.5% to 5.3% range, which is consistent with what we saw in the August forecast. And the new guide reflects the effects of currency updated now versus what we felt in August, and a full-year effective tax rate of 23%.","So looking at the future. We're going to continue to drive the new Win Strategy. And just as a reminder, it's made up of four major segments, four major goals, the first being engage people. And it's all about creating an ownership culture, and we're going to focus on our high-performance team process, which is a process where we get our people engaged around four key metrics, safety, quality, cost, and delivery, which is going to drive an ownership mindset and an intimacy and inspiration and passion around hitting those performance targets in those areas, which will drive better performance.","Second is superior customer experience, and the keyword here is experience. We're going to focus on improving that likely to recommend score, which is our feedback we get directly from our customers and distributors.","Focused on growth is the third area, and we've been fortunate to grow faster than the market, and using industrial production as a proxy for the market, and we've exceeded that the last seven quarters straight. And the Win Strategy, and this is really our need for profitable growth, like innovation, distribution growth, and share gain have really seen a lot of good traction there.","Lastly, financial performance because of the progress we have made and we're ahead of the pace that we had expected, we've identified new financial targets for FY 2023. And those are, again: growing faster than the market by 150 basis points organically, which is still a best-in-class target; segment operating margins of 19%; EBITDA margins of 20%; free cash flow conversion greater than 100%; and EPS CAGR of 10%-plus.","So in sum, FY 2019 we're off to a great start. We're anticipating another record year, and this is really building an excellent foundation for us to achieve those new 5-year targets that I just referenced.","So with that, I'm going to hand it back to Cathy for some more details on the quarter.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thank you, Tom.","I'd like you to now refer to slide number 5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $2.84 compared to $2.24 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of 27%. First quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings per share have been adjusted by a total of $0.05, including business realignment expenses of $0.01 and CLARCOR costs to achieve of $0.04. Prior-year first quarter earnings per share had been adjusted by $0.14.","On slide number 6, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $2.24 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 to $2.84 for the first quarter of this year.","The most significant increase came from higher adjusted segment operating income of $0.34, attributable to earnings on meaningful organic growth, income and synergy savings from acquisitions, and increased margins as a result of Win Strategy initiatives. Lower income tax expense equated to a year-over-year increase of $0.20. Lower interest expense resulted in an increase of $0.05, while lower other expense and share count each contributed $0.03.","Adjusted per-share income was reduced by $0.05 due to higher corporate G&A, primarily as a result of losses in market-adjusted investments tied to deferred compensation compared to gains in those investments last year.","Moving to slide number 7, you'll find total Parker sales and segment operating margin for the first quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter have increased year over year by 5.7%. There was a 0.6% negative impact to sales in the quarter from a prior-year divestiture, while currency negatively impacted the quarter by 1.7%. Total segment operating margin on an adjusted basis improved to 17.2% versus 16.0% for the same quarter last year. This 120 basis point improvement reflects the benefits of higher volume, operating cost improvements, and a favorable market mix, combined with the positive impacts from our Win Strategy initiatives.","Moving to slide number 8, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the first quarter, North American organic sales increased by 6.2% as compared to the same quarter last year. A prior-year divestiture accounted for a 0.5% loss of sales, while currency also negatively impacted the quarter by 0.3%.","Operating margin for the first quarter on an adjusted basis was 16.6% of sales versus 16.7% in the prior year. This margin performance was on target to our forecast now that the final production lines have been moved. We still anticipate stronger margins in the second half of this year as productivity will continue to improve.","I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial International segment on slide number 9. Organic sales for the first quarter in the Industrial International segment increased by 4.6%. Negative impact from a prior-year divestiture accounted for 0.9% of sales, while currency negatively impacted the quarter by 4.1%.","Operating margin for the first quarter on an adjusted basis was 17.0% of sales versus 15.7% in the prior year, reflecting improved operating cost efficiencies and the benefits of the Win Strategy.","I'll now move to slide number 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 6.3% for the first quarter as a result of strength within OEM and aftermarket in both commercial and military markets. Operating margin for the first quarter was 19.5% of sales versus 14.7% in the prior year, reflecting the impact of a favorable sales mix, the timing of development costs during the quarter, and good progress on Win Strategy initiatives.","Moving to slide number 11, we show the details of order rates by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year over year excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average.","Total orders continue to be strong, growing at 5% for the quarter end. This year-over-year growth is made up of 8% from Diversified Industrial North American orders, 3% from Diversified Industrial International orders, and 3% from Aerospace Systems orders.","On slide number 12, we report cash flow from operating activities. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $159 million. When adjusted for a $200 million discretionary pension contribution made during the quarter, cash flow from operations was 10.3% of sales. This compares to 7.1% of sales for the same period last year.","The significant capital allocations year-to-date have been: $101 million for the payment of shareholder dividends; $50 million for the company's Safe Harbor repurchase of common shares; and $200 million for the previously mentioned discretionary pension contribution. Making this discretionary contribution in the quarter allowed us to realize a higher tax benefit that we would in the future.","The full-year earnings guidance for fiscal year 2019 is outlined on slide number 13. Guidance is being provided on both an as-reported and an adjusted basis. Total sales increases are expected to be in the range of plus 0.5% to plus 3.3% as compared to the prior year. Anticipated full-year organic growth at the midpoint is plus 3.9%. The prior-year divestiture negatively impacts sales by 0.4%, and currency is expected to have a negative 1.7% impact on sales for the year. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended September 30, 2018, and we've held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2019.","For total Parker, as-reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 16.4% and 17.0%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 16.6% and 17.2%. The full-year effective tax rate is projected to be 23%. The first quarter tax rate was favorably impacted by discrete items, which we don't forecast. We are anticipating a run rate of 24% for quarters two through four, as we continue to assess the impact of U.S. tax reform and the related regulations.","For the full year, the guidance range on an as-reported earnings per share basis is now $10.90 to $11.50, or $11.20 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is now $11.10 to $11.70, or $11.40 at the midpoint. This guidance on an adjusted basis excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $22 million for the full year fiscal 2019, with the associated savings projected to be $10 million.","In addition, guidance on an adjusted basis excludes $13 million of CLARCOR costs to achieve expenses. CLARCOR synergy savings are expected to ramp to a run rate of $125 million by the end of fiscal year 2019. This represents an incremental $75 million of run rate savings as we exit fiscal year 2019. We remain on pace to realize the forecasted $160 million run rate synergy savings by fiscal year 2020.","Savings from all business realignment and CLARCOR costs to achieve are fully reflected on the as-reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges. We ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison.","Some additional key assumptions for full-year 2019 guidance at the midpoint, our sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% first half, 54% second half. Adjusted EPS first half\/second half is divided 46%\/54%. Second quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $2.38 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.04 of projected business realignment expenses and $0.02 of projected CLARCOR costs to achieve.","On slide number 14, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of fiscal year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $11.40 per share at the midpoint compared to the prior guidance of $11.10 per share. Increases include $0.17 from stronger segment operating income, $0.08 from lower other expense, $0.04 from a reduced share count, and $0.03 from lower full-year tax expense. Offsetting these increases is a $0.02 per share decrease from higher corporate G&A than previously forecasted due to market-adjusted investments tied to deferred compensation. Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisitions or divestitures that might close during the remainder of fiscal year 2019.","On slide number 15, you'll find the components of our full-year increased guidance relative to the outperformance in Q1 versus our initial guide for Q1. Actual first quarter earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $0.38 stronger than initially projected due to $0.16 from segment operating margins, $0.15 from lower tax expense, $0.05 from lower interest and other expense, and $0. 01 from a reduced share count.","For the balance of the year, we expect incremental per-share benefits of $0.03 from a lower share count, an additional $0.01 from stronger segment operating income, and $0.01 from reduced corporate interest and other expense. Offsetting these favorable items is higher anticipated tax expense of $0.13 for the remainder of the year as we complete our analysis of the impact of U.S. tax reform. This equates to a net increase to adjusted earnings per share for the full year of $0.30.","This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Cathy.","So we're very pleased with the start of the year. The combination of our sales growth, lower cost structure, integration of CLARCOR, and execution of the Win Strategy, and we're projecting another record year in fiscal 2019.","So again, just in closing, my thanks to the global team. All of our groups around the world are doing a great job and are exceeding our expectations, and I want to thank our shareholders for their interest and their confidence in us.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Candace to start the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Joel Tiss of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Wow, I never get first place. How is it going?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Good morning, Joel.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. So I just wondered if you could give us a couple of factors that give you visibility and confidence to raise the full year, and maybe if it's appropriate for Lee to give his run around the world because we're starting to hear other companies are hinting at slowdowns in some markets, as you know, auto, China, stuff like that. So I just wondered where you guys \u2013 where is it coming from? Thanks.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Joel, this is Tom. So I'll start with a couple opening comments, and I'm going to hand it over to Lee to go through the markets in more detail.","But I would just say one of the things that are giving us confidence is when we look at the order pattern. So orders are doing well against some very tough comparables. But if I look at North America through the quarter and including October, North America was stable at some nice levels through the entire quarter.","What we liked was EMEA. If you remember, last call I made a comment about EMEA softening a little bit and moderating, but I wasn't sure whether it was the holiday period. But what we saw in September and October that EMEA strengthened and stabilized at a low single-digit level for us, which is a good thing for the Europe area.","Asia-Pacific did moderate through the quarter and Latin America remained strong. So really that mixture, in particular the fact that EMEA got better through the quarter, gives us the confidence. And when we look at all the end markets, and Lee will take you through this, they really held up quite well despite some of the geopolitical issues that you read about. So I'll let Lee take you through the regions and give you a high-level view of what we see.","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Okay. Thanks Tom. So, Joel, I think just to tag on what Tom had to say, I think we were encouraged that organic growth moved in the direction that we expected from our last call. And I'll start with Aerospace, if I can, and then just walk through. But with Aerospace we were pleased with the quarter. We saw nice growth in the commercial OEM segment. It was up 6% year over year. And we're forecasting the growth for this year, which will get you to our organic midpoint of about 5% at the midpoint. And a lot of that has to do just with comps going forward.","Military OEM was strong. That was up 12% in the quarter. There are a lot of factors leading into that. F-35 ramp-up production increased Department of Defense spending, so all positive for that. So that was up 12% in the first quarter, and we're forecasting full-year growth of 7% at the midpoint.","Commercial MRO was good. Revenue passenger miles continue to be up. We were up 6% in the first quarter. We are forecasting 2% for the full year at the midpoint. A lot of that, again, has to do with comps as we go forward. And then lastly, the military MRO was strong, 5% in the first quarter, and again, adding onto that 4% for the full year, again comps. So it gives you an organic midpoint for the full year for Aerospace at 4.7%.","On the Industrial side, just characterizing what Tom had to say, we look at North America being at the high end of that 5.3% to 2.5% growth range, Asia-Pacific and Europe at the lower end, Asia-Pacific a little bit ahead of Europe, and Latin America being above the range. So Latin America is strong but it's small, as we talked about.","I think what was positive was we continue to see year-over-year order entry growth in most of our end markets. The rate of growth is colored by the region. I'll talk a little bit more about that as I go through this. But in general, all natural resource end markets continued to grow during the quarter.","So this includes agriculture, construction equipment, mining, oil and gas, and mostly land-based in North America when it comes to oil and gas. Although what's positive is we continue to see increased activity in Gulf of Mexico offshore. And even in the North Sea now, there's a lot of activity and quoting taking place, so that's positive. When I look at oil and gas rigs, they continue to expand. There's just a lot of appreciable pickup in quotes and order entry activity, which is really great both at the OEM level and with our distribution partners.","Distribution around the world is really strong. A lot of this has to do with our on-purpose initiatives to grow distribution, which we've talked to you about for the last three years. I'm really pleased with what's happening there. And then one telltale sign about the health of the economy is when you see an appreciable increase in CapEx requests to our distributor partners and that's still strong. So for me, that bodes well going forward.","I would say the only notable end markets that we saw contraction in the quarter, which was well publicized, is around large-frame gas turbine power generation market. Microelectronics activity fell throughout the quarter. We do expect that hopefully to rebound going forward.","And then like you said, everything that touches automotive is down. It's not a big deal for us but it can affect some tangential markets, and we do a lot of in-plant automotive work. And then mills and foundries are down. I think a lot of that has to do with excess capacity in Asia, mostly China, but some of it is probably tariff-related too. Not a big deal for us, but it was noticeably down.","So just talking about North America, I talked about it being robust. I'm really happy with what's happening in North America. The sentiment of our distributor base continues to be very positive across the country, and our OEM activity is very strong. EMEA, as Tom mentioned, a little worried in August and September, but things started to strengthen and stabilize. And I feel good about where that is right now, and the feedback we get from our customers is positive.","And then Asia, I would just say we moderated during the quarter, but we're coming off a couple years of really, really strong comps, so growth is still there. China continues to grow, some markets different than others. Road construction, specifically excavator markets, are very strong, which are big categories for us, so net positive. And I talked about automotive, that slowed during the quarter, but again, not a big deal for us.","So in summary, we're encouraged by what's happening with our end markets. I'm going to echo what Tom said. I think we're presently pleased with the activity in the markets. With all the trade and tariff noise out there, things seem to continue to move along. And bottom line is we're forecasting higher organic growth this year on top of a pretty good growth year last year. I hope that helps.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes, awesome color. I think I took enough time, thank you so much.","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Joel.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, hi. Thanks for all that great color, I'm trying to digest it here. But as a follow-up, could you give me more insight or more color on the comments you made about CapEx requests for distributors remain strong? What exactly do you mean by that?","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Ann, typically what happens with our distributor partners when they're working with customers in their region, they may get some projects that would be capital-intensive for that customer, so it would be capital appropriation. And it just tells me that companies are spending as opposed to just MRO activity at a facility.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, I got you. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just could you give us a little bit more color on EMEA just in terms of end markets and regions, just as you walk around the different countries on that large continent or continents?","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","I think what's positive, what's been down is a lot more quoting activity and the activity with our distribution base around oil and gas markets. So that's North Sea activity in Norway. Germany continues to be strong, and mobile construction equipment industries continue to be strong. I think automotive, which is well-publicized, is down; again, not a huge impact for us other than what I mentioned before, but that would be the noticeable thing. So despite all the noise with Italy and Brexit, things continued to grow at a very low single-digit rate.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I think from the comments that you've made and the visibility that you have, I think what you're telling us today is that even if dollar orders stayed as is, you would still deliver year-over-year growth in orders through the remainder of the year. Is that a fair comment?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","The numbers I gave you are organic numbers with our best guide on FX impact. If there's a bigger FX impact, obviously that would lessen that organic guide number right now.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, I got you. Okay, I'll leave it there because I think you answered most of the questions I would have asked in your first question.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thank you, Ann.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Good morning. We had a pool in my office if Adam was going to ask about Ag. I'm not going to ask about Ag, just a question on Aerospace and International. A), it does seem that Aerospace margins and incrementals were fantastic, and you alluded that it's a combination of the factors. But what changes in Aerospace during the year for the margins not to have this kind of strong performance? What goes away?","And the second thing on International, once again, International margin is above North America, which is unusual. Once again, what changes in International over the year for this gap to go away?","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Okay, I will start with Aerospace, and I'll let Tom take the International margins. But Q1 was a great quarter for Aerospace, and we've talked before. The company's long-term targets are 19% operating profit, and we see Aerospace going there. I think what happened in Q1 is excellent continued execution around the Win Strategy. Good mix during Q1, it was what I would call stronger legacy OEM shipments and less entry-into-service shipments. That changes going forward a little bit, and that's what we forecast.","And then less R&D expense in Q1, we gave you a range of 6.25% I think to 6.75% last time. We came in at 5%, and that's just really timing, Andrew, in Q1. So that's factored a range of 6% to 6.5% for the balance of the year. So two things going on with the balance sheet why you see a midpoint guidance of 18.3% is increase in R&D expense on some things. It's come way down from where we were, but an increase in R&D expense, and we see the mix changing going forward.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","And, Andrew, it's Tom. On International, we were excited, you're right to point it out. This is a big deal to have International higher than North America. When we finish the year, we'll have North America higher than International. But when you pattern International, Q1 always ends up being the highest profitability quarter for us, so this is a normal seasonal change for us.","We will have as we go through the course of the year with Asia growing at a little less growth rate than it had before and Asia carrying a higher profit margin, that does impact us a little bit for the full year. But we're still going to see a full year with some nice improvement within International margins, 70 bps higher than the previous year, and we raised it 20 bps versus the prior guide. So we're very pleased with what International is doing.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just to follow up on International, maybe we're not doing the math right, but it comes out that for International in the second half, we're going to have flat to negative core growth, and I was just wondering how to think about that. And how does pricing figure in it because we're hearing you guys are getting fairly good pricing across your regions?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Andrew, it's Tom again. So our International growth for the second half is going to be 2.5%. And so what you're seeing when you look at that is really the effect of currency. We have a second half based on what we see for currency right now of a 5% drag. Obviously, it's subject to change based on translation, but that's what you're experiencing with International.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. Thank you.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Julian \u2013 I'm sorry, it's Andrew.","Operator","And your next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Maybe \u2013 hi. Just firstly, a little bit more color on your comments on APAC. I think you said China still growing, but the region moderated in the first quarter, and it sounds like you're saying that it will continue to moderate in your assumption over the rest of the year. So maybe talk about how much of that is China-specific versus other parts of the region and how broad of a slowdown in China are you seeing right now?","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","So, Julian, this is Lee. So China did moderate, there's no doubt about it, but we're still seeing growth across the region and in China. I think what everybody has to remember, we've just come off some incredible great growth comps in China. So we're still seeing growth, but at the low end of that range that we gave you. What's noticeable is still strength in what I would call natural resource end markets there and construction equipment markets. We do forecast some infrastructure spend going forward for the year. It's already starting to ramp up, so there's a little bit of stimulus happening from the Chinese government.","I think what's also positive is we're seeing excellent growth throughout the region in Australia, Japan, and India. Those are all noticeable growth areas for us. So you put all that together, and that's why we came up with the growth in that low single-digit rate.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. And then my second question just around the North America margins, you obviously had some issues affecting the margin last year. You came in squarely in the middle of your incremental margin guide for the first half in Q1. Maybe just update us how comfortable you feel with the incremental margins for the balance of the year and how the productivity effort is progressing and the duplicate cost-out?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, Julian, it's Tom. You're right, we had forecasted at 10% to 20% for the first half, came in at 16% MROS for Q1. I mentioned in my opening comments, a very important milestone is that we've closed all those plants that we want to close.","Remember, part of the issue we've had the last several quarters is we were running duplicate plants due to demand and productivity levels, and so that's a huge milestone. And all the lines that we wanted to move, they got moved as well. Now there's a number of them that got moved during Q1. And when you move a production line, you go through a requalification with the customer, and there's a production ramp-up curve that you go through, so that will be happening in Q2. But we feel very good about where we are for the second half.","So our first half MROS, we're now looking at a 15% to 20% MROS, and the second half still, as we had articulated last quarter, at a 40% to 50% MROS. The lines that have moved prior to Q1 moves are all moving in the right direction. Productivity levels are increasing. So we feel very good about that.","I think the fact that North American margins were basically the same as prior period, and you compare what we did in the prior periods as far as plant closures, which was very minimal compared to what would be going on now, the underlying efforts in North America are getting better. You can see it. There's no way you could have held North America margins flat with the amount of plant closure work and production line work that has been going on here without some good underlying productivity on everything else that's working.","And I think the other part is the International margins and Aerospace margins are indicative of all the Win Strategy initiatives that are going on. Those margins moved, but they moved demonstrably for several reasons that Lee had touched on with Aerospace, but because the Win Strategy is working. So I feel very good about the margin expansion. Of course, we forecasted that in the guide going forward. I know North America has been an important question for shareholders and analysts. And I would just tell you we've reached an important turning point, and we feel good about the future there.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you for the detail.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Julian.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And, Tom, congratulations on getting this plant closed. I know it's been a long time coming and a pretty arduous process.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thank you, Joe.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I guess my first question, look, it sounds like you guys feel really good about your end market backdrop and what you're hearing from an order entry perspective. How do I square that with the comments that CAT made this quarter regarding inventory levels being elevated? Just maybe any color that you can provide there would be helpful.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Joe, it's Tom. So I'll start, and if Lee wants to add anything on. I think we've seen some isolated, and I would call it not material, where customers have made a supply chain adjustments basically where the supply chain has caught up and they're rebalancing their demand signals that they're giving to their suppliers.","But I think the theme for us that has been a big positive, North America stayed strong. EMEA strengthened better than we thought, and EMEA is 60% of our International. Asia moderated, but it's been off a very high. So that mixture in International made us feel good about that.","Lee touched on what's driving the organic growth for us is distribution and the natural resource end markets having enough strength and power to overcome the geopolitical noise that we're hearing. And I would characterize automotive and automotive-related, like tires and machine tools, some of that is the automotive cycle, and some of it could be some of the tariff noise. It's hard for us to attribute what's to what.","The mills and foundries that Lee touched on clearly is probably trade-related. Power gen, semicon, and marine, that's been something that was soft, stayed soft, so that didn't really change. So it's really that composition, Europe getting a little better than what we had thought, and the distribution and natural resources having enough strength to overcome the geopolitical noise that we've heard so far. We will obviously keep our eyes and ears open to all that and we always give you our best look every quarter, but that's the view right now.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful, Tom. And maybe as my follow-up question, just was there anything that occurred below the line this quarter? That number seemed to be a little bit more elevated than usual to get to your EBIT bridge. So I'm just wondering if there were any one-time items in that number.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yes, Joe, I'll take this one. We have some investments that help support some deferred compensation plans. And those investments incurred losses this year compared to gains last year. So you see the swing year over year, and it's purely from the market moving on those investments. That's the biggest item.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And, Cathy, how should we be thinking about that number on a go-forward?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","We're anticipating that we'll continue to see losses compared to last year just based on what the market looks like today versus before. So we have added a little expense in the next few quarters in the other income line related to that.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thanks, everyone.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Raso of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Hi, thank you, just a quick question. The guidance appears to have the back half of the year, you talk about $0.15 a share out of the implied back half. And is that solely currency? But also, the tax rate at 24% through the rest of the year, is that an upward revision of how you thought the tax rate would be sequenced through the year? I'm just trying to figure out that $0.15 out of the back half.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yes, David, it's primarily the tax. And what is happening is we had some very favorable discretes in the first quarter that started the year out at a pretty low rate. But as we are finalizing our calculations related to tax reform, specifically the GILTI tax, which is very complex, and as we're pulling those together and finalizing that, we've built in a 24% rate for the rest of the year to compensate for right now what we're seeing in that. So a little bit higher rate in two, three, and four quarters that offset the very low rate we achieved in Q1.","Keep in mind, we do not forecast tax credits that we do get for stock option exercises. And so our number may be conservative, but we have no way to forecast that. We are forecasting 24% run rate for the next three quarters.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","And for moving forward, just use 24% for fiscal 2020 and onwards as that base case?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","I think as we look at the GILTI and what we can do and as we look at all of tax reform and how we can work with it, I would use 23% on an ongoing.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","23%, okay. And quick question on North America, the margins were maintained, but it seemed like your description of your end markets, resource markets, strength in distribution, it almost seemed like there could a little upward bias to North America on the margin, just given that mix. Is the mix as you thought, or is the mix a little better and maybe price\/cost is trimming that back? I'm just trying to understand the North America margins being maintained.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","David, it's Tom. North America being maintained versus our guide was related \u2013 it came in exactly how we expected. The sales forecast hit our expectations. The MROS, just for clarification, I articulated a 10% to 20% MROS range for North America, and we came in at 16%, so right in the middle. So it was right on what we were thinking, and we feel good about that. Like I mentioned, we've had a couple big turning points to get all those plants closed, all the lines moved now. We've got to get them qualified and up to production rate, but we made a big turn in North America.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","And lastly, your trailing net debt to EBITDA now is down to 1.6 \u2013 1.7 times. Can you give us a bit of an update how you're looking at the M&A markets?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yes, David. As I mentioned in my opening comments, which I'll repeat, we really look at four main levers when we think about capital deployment. Obviously, I'll get to your M&A piece. So we're going to look at dividends and we're going keep that increase record, and we are going to have dividends continue to grow with the operating net income of the company. And we expect to expand them as we go forward over the next several years. We're going to invest in CapEx for organic growth, but we're going to make some productivity investments as well. This is a unique time between additive and automation robotics to really look at productivity initiatives throughout the company, so we're doing that.","On the acquisitions, to get specific on your question, we are always out there working that. We've been building relationships for years and years with a lot of companies, and we'll continue to do that. Our pecking order there is one we want to continue to be the consolidator of choice. If it's in our space, the $130 billion motion control space, we'd like to be at that. We may not decide to swing, but we'd like to be aware of what's going on and have those relationships. All things being equal, we want to invest in aerospace, engineered materials, instrumentation, filtration. It has a little higher margins, a little more resilient over the cycle, so we'd like to add to the portfolio there.","And then lastly would be share repurchases. The 10b5-1, we'll obviously continue it, but we have enough capacity, to your point, to look at discretionary share repurchases as well. And we're going to look at all four of those levers on a simultaneous basis and what makes the most sense to optimize value creation for our shareholders, and we'll do that in concurrence with our board and try to do that to the best of our ability.","So the good thing, and you pointed it out, we have a lot of capacity. We're in a much different position on capital deployment than we were two years ago or 18 months ago, and that's a great thing for shareholders. We're going to put it to work. You've heard me talk about we want to be great generators of cash. We're going to keep doing that. And we want to be great deployers of cash. So I think you can look forward to us putting it to work.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","I was looking for with maybe some of the recent economic anxiety, whatever it may be, have the multiples being asked by sellers changed?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","I would say not yet. I think it's still fairly \u2013 a lot of it depends on what technology platform you're going after. Some areas are valued higher than others. And we're going to obviously try to pay at the right value that wins the deal but also wins the deal for our shareholders and creates the right kind of returns, and we will be selective. We will pick the right properties that make the most sense. But I would still characterize the M&A environment as fairly high still from a multiples standpoint.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","All right, I appreciate the time. Thank you.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'd like to go back to the Aerospace margin profile here. It's up nearly 500 basis points year over year. I think Lee explained maybe a couple hundred basis points lower R&D year over year. There's a comment you made, Tom, in your prepared comments that there are prior-year investments paying off here. I would think the numbers you gave \u2013 or that Lee gave on the mix, OE grew faster than aftermarket. So it wouldn't seem to be a mix tailwind here. So I'm wondering, why the margin profile for the rest of the year is not a little bit higher than what you're pointing to given those dynamics?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, Nathan, this is Tom. So the investments I was referring to was \u2013 remember, we were at 11%, 12% R&D. And that was if you go back the 10 years we've been working basically the Aerospace super-cycle, which is a unique part of the whole Aerospace business, a unique opportunity to win an extraordinary amount of business both on the airframe and engine side. And we took advantage of that, and so there was heavy R&D to do that.","I would say what is driving us \u2013 what Lee was referring to, we had just a mix. Aftermarket and OE stayed about the same as we were in Q4, but we saw a higher mix of legacy, which was a temporary delivery pattern. EIS does not go out at the same margins that legacy goes out, because with legacy you've had years, in some case decades of working on the cost and price relationship. And so it's pretty much a night-and-day comparison in margin, very similar to maybe the margin gap you would see in the OE to aftermarket for Aerospace. So that was the unusual part that spiked out the first quarter. We don't expect that to repeat. That was an unusual for the quarter.","But what will repeat, which is why you see Aerospace margins growing versus prior period, is the great job they're doing on the Win Strategy. They are working up the EIS learning curve and getting better at that. And the R&D is down from \u2013 we're going to be we're projecting in that 6% to 6.5% range. And for the quarter we're around 5%. So we had a little extra tailwind on R&D as a result of that \u2013 timing-wise we'll spend that money as we go forward in the next three quarters.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, got it. So there's some mix within the mix there. And then I've got a little bit more of a philosophical question for you. I think maybe this time next year or when we started fiscal 2018, Tom, you had said you thought we were going to be in a relatively good multiyear growth outlook for the industrial economy. A fair bit has gone under the bridge, shall we say, from a macro perspective over the last four or five quarters. Can you talk about what your expectation is over the next few years, maybe how it's changed over the last 12 to 18 months, if at all?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Some of you have heard me talk about this, where if you look at our company over the last 15 years, you see the global expansion, really the China pull from 2003 to 2008, the financial crisis. And then industrials, not just us, but industrials in general somewhat treaded water in that 2011 to 2015 range. Then we had the second largest contraction in our history, and everybody else felt it, the whole natural resource contraction in 2015 and 2016.","So part of what I was characterizing is this feels like a different part of the cycle. It's not treading water clearly. It's not the global expansion that we saw with China. It doesn't have that same kind of pull, but it feels more broad-based. Part of what \u2013 and for legitimate reasons, a lot of concerns and questions have been around the geopolitical issues around the world between trade and interest rates, Brexit, those types of things.","But what we were very happy with as we look at our end markets and our order patterns, they held up pretty well despite all that. So provided, which we can't control the geopolitical things, provided that none of those go tilt and create some really step change down, I think there's enough strength there that the industrial activity \u2013 we're only in our second year of an expansion. So everybody talks about being in the ninth year of expansion. We're in the second year of expansion. So that's why I felt this has got some room to go.","Remember when we did our first IR Day, at that time it was Lee, Jon [Marten], and myself, we were hoping for a 1% to 2% world. And our range that we gave you, taking out currency, at a 2.5% to 5% world, while it feels like a big range. Even if it's at the low end of the range, with everything we've got with the Win Strategy, we can perform extremely well at that type of growth target. And that's why I think you see the enthusiasm and how we feel about where we can go is that I think we're prepared for the low end of the range if it happens. And again, I hope none of the geopolitical things impact it enough. But we'll see what happens over the next couple years. Who knows?","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks for the insight.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Nathan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. Just two quick ones, one, the Filtration and Engineered Materials revenues were down year over year. I don't know if there was anything to read into that.","And then my follow-up question, it sounds like you guys didn't see this in mining but some suppliers to the mining OE companies have talked about weakness in order trends and sales in the third quarter. I'm just wondering if you saw that in any particular geography? Thanks.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Jamie, it's Tom. The technology platforms you saw, the difference would be most likely the Facet divestiture, which that was the piece of the Filtration business that we sold due to the Department of Justice settlement. So that would make the year-over-year comparison not as favorable for us this year because it was in the prior-period sales. Regarding mining, mining for us is holding up okay. It's still in that mid to upper single digits for us.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Jamie. We have time for one more question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Good morning.","Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Lee, did organic orders benefit in the quarter at all from distributors or customers maybe building inventory to get ahead of any of the price increases, or is the growth really just more indicative of underlying market demand?","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","No, I would say the growth is definitely just from underlying demand. I didn't see any \u2013 there was no big event on the price increases that people would be pulling forward.","Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just lastly, are you facing any notable supply chain constraints in any of the segments dealing with expedited freight, extra overtime, any other cost items that could be dragging on margins that could potentially improve from here?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Neil, it's Tom. No, we didn't really experience anything. We've been fortunate that our supply chain \u2013 we're in the region to serve the region, and the team has done a nice job of balancing out the supply chain challenges. We may have had an isolated issue or two here, but in general I would say the supply chain has done a really good job for us in the past, and we're in good shape on that.","Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, thank you. Congrats.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Neil.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","So maybe before I turn over to Cathy to finish I just want to make one comment to all the investors and analysts that are listening. The gentleman down at the end of the table here, Ryan Reed, who all of you know as the Director of our Investor Relations is leaving us, which we're not excited about. As you all know, he's done a great job for us. We are very happy for him, for the opportunity. He's leaving the company for bigger job in Investor Relations. And I think all of you know he's done a great job, and we will obviously work very hard to fill that job, but he's got big shoes and did a nice job.

My name is Mark and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Marten, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please proceed, sir.","Jon Marten","Thank you, Mark, good morning and welcome to Parker Hannifin's fourth-quarter 2015 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today is Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks. Today's presentation slides together with the audio webcast replay will be accessible on our company's Investor Information website at www.phstock.com for one year following today's call.","On slide number 2 you will find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations or any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and are posted on Parker's website at www.phstock.com.","Continuing on to slide number 3, I just want to point out the agenda for today's call. To begin our CEO, Tom Williams, will provide highlights for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015. And then following Tom's comments I will provide a review of the company's fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 performance together with the guidance for 2016. And Tom will provide a few summary comments and then we will open the call for a Q&A session. At this time I will turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slides number 4 and then 5.","Tom Williams","Thank you, Jon and welcome to everybody on the call. We appreciate your participation today. I'm going to take a few minutes to share our thoughts on the fourth quarter and our full-year results. I will also touch briefly on some of our end market conditions and provide an update on the upcoming rollout of the refreshed Win Strategy. This includes a focus on our new simplification initiatives, some of which you have already -- are already being implemented. I'd like to start with a few comments on our fourth quarter.","We're operating in a tough environment as we continue to feel the effects of the strengthening dollar and ongoing weak conditions in some key end markets. Throughout the quarter we continue with actions to adjust to these conditions, including the completion of a voluntary retirement program in the United States and a broad range of other actions to reduce costs globally such as reductions in force, reduced work schedules and tight control of discretionary spending.","Sales declined 11% in the fourth quarter as the effects of changes in currency rates negatively impacted us by 6% and organic sales declined 5%. Order rates were 9% lower than fourth quarter compared with the same quarter last year. This follows a 4% decline in the third quarter.","We're working hard to align costs with such a swift change in order rates. All things considered I am pleased we delivered total adjusted segment operating margins of 14.9%. This compares to 15.0% adjusted in last year's fourth quarter. Folding adjusted segment operating margins flat while sales declined 11% is a nice accomplishment.","Earnings per share were $1.27 or $1.43 adjusted for business realignment and the voluntary retirement program. Earnings were impacted by a higher effective tax rate through largely the changes in the geographic mix of pretax profits. This equated to a $0.30 negative impact to our Q4 2015 guide. Operating cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $511 million or 16.2% of sales. In regards to our performance for the full year, considering all the challenges we faced we performed well. Sales were $12.7 billion, a 4% decline compared with fiscal 2014. The entire decline in sales was driven by the effect of currency rate changes.","Organic growth was flat as growth from most of our markets and innovative new products was offset by significant weakness in our natural resource-related end markets. We delivered a 50 basis point improvement in adjusted operating segment margins despite this sales decline and reached 14.9% compared to 14.4% in fiscal 2014. Fiscal year 2015 earnings per share were $6.97 compared to $6.87 in the prior year. On an adjusted basis earnings per share were $7.25 compared to $6.94 in fiscal 2014. As a reminder, fiscal 2015 earnings included $0.38 per share in transaction currency gains that are not expected to repeat in fiscal 2016.","Cash flow was strong with full-year cash from operations of $1.3 billion or 10.2% of sales. This is the 14th consecutive year of cash sales greater than 10%, excluding discretionary pension contributions. This is strong, consistent performance despite several downturns over that timeframe. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. Our top priority is to maintain our dividend and increase record followed by investing in our organic growth through CapEx and innovation. We remain committed to executing our previously announced share repurchase program while concurrently evaluating strategic acquisitions to boost the company's growth and profitability. We have repurchased approximately $1.3 billion under our plan to purchase $2 billion to $3 billion worth of Parker shares over two years which began October 2014.","Our efforts to re-energize the pipeline of acquisition opportunities are proving effective as we're starting to see a pickup in activity. Moving on to a discussion on key market trends. We saw continued weak conditions in some key markets that are important to our business. Specifically natural resource markets like oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment showed continued weakness.","Our distribution channel was also affected, especially those distributors who are exposed to oil and gas. These difficult market conditions outweighed positive growth trends in other markets such as power generation, heavy-duty truck, automotive and commercial residential air-conditioning. For fiscal year 2016 we're in initiating guidance for earnings per share of $6.15 to $6.85 or $6.65 to $7.35 per share on an adjusted basis. This guidance includes an increase in adjusted segmented operating margins of 14.9% to 15.4% for FY '16.","Guidance for fiscal 2016 includes business realignment of approximately $0.50 per share of which $0.30 per share relates to our simplification initiatives. Simplification is one element of a broader effort to reduce complexity, increase speed, reduce costs and better serve our customers.","Many of our groups have announced plans to consolidate divisions and eliminate the associated redundant overhead costs. Organization and process design changes are being implemented to streamline operations and corporate functions. We're also removing bureaucracy that can get in the way of our team members taking action to meet the needs of our customers. Simplification initiatives like these, when combined with our traditional realignment actions to optimize our manufacturing footprint, will build a stronger more agile Parker capable of generating consistent long-term profit growth.","We do anticipate a bottom forming in fiscal year 2016 with the first half expected to continue with challenging conditions and the second half showing a slight uptick. Overall we forecast sales for the year to be down slightly. We will continue to aggressively manage costs in this environment while still investing in growth initiatives such as innovation. The cost reductions that were put in place in fiscal 2015 and the planned actions for fiscal 2016 will help us perform better in tough conditions and strongly position the company for the future.","While adjusting our businesses to meet our immediate challenges we continue to plan for the future. On September 22 during our Investor Day in New York, we will share more details about a comprehensive refresh of the Win Strategy. We have spent the past six months gathering input from our key stakeholders globally.","While many of the principles of the Win Strategy remain relevant, we're making changes that are intended to take the company's performance to the next level. Our target will be to achieve top quartile financial performance among our Diversified Industrial peers and we see many specific opportunities to drive growth and margin expansion at Parker. We're excited about these opportunities that will position Parker to be an even stronger leader as the number one motion control company in the world. And for now I will hand things back to Jon to give you some more details on the quarter.","Jon Marten","Thanks, Tom. And at this time transitioning to slide number 6, I will address the earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for Q4 was $1.43 versus $2.06 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to a decrease of $0.63. This excludes restructuring and voluntary retirement expenses of $0.16 and compares to -- which compares to $0.08 for the same quarter last year.","Please also note that in Q4 we made numerous tax adjustments that amounted to $0.30 per share due to the mix of pretax profits noted in the quarter and a few discrete items that were incurred. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 were $7.25 versus $6.94 for the full year of 2014. Total realignment expenses were $0.28 for the full year 2015 and that compares to adjustments for restructuring, asset write-downs and the joint venture that was formed which in total net to $0.07 of expense for the full year in 2014. Also included in FY '15 earnings is the 38% -- $0.38 per share in transactional currency gains that are not expected to repeat in FY '16, as Tom alluded to earlier.","On slide 7 we discussed the influences on adjusted earnings for Q4 versus Q4 of last year. And you will find the significant components of the walk from the adjusted earnings of $2.06 to $1.43 for Q4 of FY '15. The impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.10 per share.","Reductions to adjusted per share income include, one, lower adjusted segment operating income of $0.30 per share driven by the strengthened U.S. dollar and weakened end markets demand; the impact of the increased effective tax rate which was $0.30 per share as a result of the shift in the geographic mix of pretax profit as well as the discrete items; and an increase in corporate G&A expenses that totaled $0.13 per share due in part to the early retirement program in FY '15 and unusual one time credits booked in FY '14 in Q4.","Slide number 8 discusses the influence on adjusted earnings per share for 2015 versus 2014 for the full year. On slide number 8 you will find the significant components of the walk from adjusted EPS of $6.94 for the full 2014 to $7.25 for the full 2015. An increase of $0.59 was realized from net other income due to, one, the $0.38 of income related to the transactional currency gain primarily booked in Q3 of FY '15; and less stock comp expense booked in FY '15 of $0.07 as well is lower pension expense in FY '15 of $0.05 versus the FY '14."," There was also $0.30 from fewer shares outstanding as a result of the company's enhanced share buyback program announced and initiated in October of 2014. And decreases were driven by the $0.33 primarily due to the corporate G&A, $0.23 from a higher effective tax rate and a $0.02 reduction in adjusted segment operating income.","So now moving to slide number 9, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year. From a segment standpoint total company organic sales and Q4 decreased by 4.9% over the same quarter last year. There was minimal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percent of sales was slightly higher than planned equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $210 million or $0.06 in the quarter.","The total segment operating margin for Q4 adjusted for the realignment cost incurred in the quarter was 14.9% versus 15% for the same quarter a year ago. Restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were $27 million versus $18 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $467 million versus $530 million last year reflects the meaningful impact of a strengthened U.S. dollar against the foreign currencies.","For the full year organic sales in FY '15 adjusted for the GE joint venture as represented in the upper right portion of the page were slightly positive at 0.6%. The effect of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $546 million or a negative 4.1% of sales for the full year which represents the entirety of the sales decline in FY '15."," Total company segment operating margin for FY '15 adjusted for realignment costs incurred during the year was 14.9% versus 14.4% in FY '14, an increase of 50 basis points. Restructuring and voluntary retirement expenses incurred in FY '15 totaled $50 million.","Moving to slide number 10, here I will discuss the actual business segments within Diversified Industrial North America and for -- first of all, for Q4, North America organic sales decreased by 6% as compared to the same quarter last year and there was a 1.2% negative impact in the quarter due to currency. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 17.3% versus 17.7% in the prior year. Restructuring and voluntary retirement expenses totaled $15 million as compared to $1 million in the prior year. And adjusted operating income was $244 million as compared to $269 million from last year which is driven by the reduced volume as a result of the softening trends in key end markets.","For the full year organic sales for FY '15 increased by 1.2%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $50 million or a negative 0.9%. For the full year 2015 operating margin adjusted for [indiscernible] costs was 17% of sales versus 16.7% in the prior year. Restructuring and voluntary retirement expenses totaled $17 million as compared to $2 million in FY '14. And adjusted operating income for fiscal year 2015 was $972 million as compared to the $949 million from last year.","Now continue to slide 11 organic sales for the quarter for the Diversified Industrial international segment decreased by 4%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 13.6%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment cost was 10.9% of sales versus 11.2% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $6 million as compared to $18 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $124 million as compared to $156 million which reflects the translational impact of the strengthened U.S. dollar as well as, very importantly, weaker end markets.","For the full year organic sales for the fiscal year 2015 decreased by 1.2%. The impact of foreign currency resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $487 million or a negative 9.2% of sales for the full year. For the full FY '15 operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 12.9% of sales versus 12.7% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses totaled $27 million as compared to $99 million in FY '14. Adjusted operating income for FY '15 was $611 million as compared to $671 million last year, reflecting the translational impact of the strengthened U.S. dollar.","Now on slide 12, in Aerospace -- organic revenues decreased 4% for the fourth quarter. Currency posed a modest negative 0.6 of a percent while commercial OEM sales for the period were strong. The segment sales decline for the period was driven by lower military OEM and military aftermarket sales volume and favorable contract settlements reported as revenue in FY '14 Q4. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for the realignment cost was 16.9% of sales versus 17% in the prior year. Restructuring and voluntary retirement expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $5.8 million as compared to zero related expense in the prior corresponding quarter.","Adjusted operating income was $99 million as compared to $105 million in the prior year reflecting the impact of the reduced aftermarket sales volume in the quarter, albeit partially offset by reduced development costs as a percent of sales which was 7.5% for the quarter. For the full year organic sales for fiscal year 2015 adjusted for the impact of the joint venture that was formed increased by 3.7%. For the full year 2015 operating margin adjusted for the realignment cost was 13.5% of sales versus 12.5% in the prior year. Restructuring and voluntary retirement expenses totaled $6 million compared to $1 million in the prior year. And adjusted operating income for fiscal year 2015 was $305 million as compared to $272 million last year which is largely attributed to the reduction of the development cost as a percent of sales and our increased OEM commercial volume.","Moving to slide number 13 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, we report orders on a trailing average that are expressed as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year over year excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders shifted to a negative 9% for the quarter end reflecting the continued weakness in oil and gas, construction, mining and agriculture which represented four important industrial end markets. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased to a negative 9%; International orders decreased to a negative 5%; and Aerospace orders decreased to a negative 14% for the quarter against very high prior year comps.","Now on slide 14 we're going to discuss the cash from operations. For the fourth quarter cash from operating activities was $511 million or 16.2%. This aligns to the same 16.2% of sales for the same period last year. For the all year cash from operating activities for fiscal 2015 was $1.3 billion or 10.2% of sales as compared to 11.1% last year. In FY '14 cash from operating activities was adjusted for a pension contribution of $75 million. There was no pension contribution made during FY '15. The significant uses of cash during the year, $1.7 billion returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of $1.4 billion and dividends of $340 million. $216 million for CapEx equating to 1.7% of sales for the year.","And now turning to the guidance slide on number 15, guidance is provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY '16. Total sales are expected to be in the range of minus 3% to zero as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is basically flat. Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 1.7% which is nearly all attributed to the industrial international segment."," We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of June 30, 2015 and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming FY '16. For the total Parker adjustment segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. This compares to 14.9% for 2015 on an adjusted basis. The guidance for below the line items which includes corporate admin, interest and our other expense category, is $540 million for the year of the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected to be 29%.","The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in our full-year guidance was $140.8 million. On the topic of share repurchase as communicated during last quarter's earnings call, we remain committed to the $2 billion to $3 billion share repurchase announced in October of 2014. To date share repurchases -- share repurchase spend totals 67%, at the low end of the announced repurchase program and we anticipate that the balance on the commitment for repurchases will be made discretionarily over the remaining 14 months of the program.","For the full year guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is $6.65 to $7.35 or $7.00 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $100 million to be incurred in FY '16. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.50 for the full year, consisting of $0.20 for restructuring and $0.30 for the simplification initiatives that Tom outlined earlier. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $70 million.","Some additional key assumptions for the full year 2016 guidance are, sales are divided 48% in the first half, 52% in the second half; adjusted segment operating income is divided 45% for the first half, 55% for the second half; EPS for the first half is $2.96 and for the second half $4.04. And the Q1 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.47 per share at the midpoint and this excludes $0.21 of business realignment expenses including both the simplification program as well as our traditional restructuring.","On slide 16 we have the major reconciliation of the major components, FY '16 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.00 at the midpoint from prior FY '15 EPS of $7.25 per share. Increases include $0.21 from fewer shares outstanding, $0.19 from increased segment operating income, $0.09 from reduced corporate G&A and $0.02 from a reduced full-year effective tax rate.","Key components of the decrease include a $0.68 reduction from increased other expense as a result of prior year other income, the most significant portion having been attributed to the unpegging of the Swiss franc and the euro during the third quarter and for the full year $0.38. As you will recall, this resulted in a one-time intercompany settlement gain in Q3. There was also $0.19 impacting this category from increased forecasted pension expense due to updated mortality tables and, finally, $0.08 from increased interest expense. Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisitions or divestitures that closed or that will close during FY '16.","For consistency we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates. This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I will turn the call back to you for your summary comments.","Tom Williams","Thanks, Jon. We do have some challenges ahead, but the good news about FY '16 is that with every quarter we move closer to the bottom of the decline in the natural resource markets that we serve. As we've demonstrated, we performed well in tough times. The bright spot is that we enter our new fiscal year leaner than ever and we're taking additional concrete actions to further lower our cost structure. We're also encouraged by our new product and systems commercialization progress. As a result we expect to perform well as sales start to increase.","Importantly, Parker has a fantastic foundation and legacy to build upon. Our culture is strong, with tremendous support by our global team members who I know will do everything they can to achieve the goals we have set for them. I want to thank them for embracing the changes that we're implementing at Parker.","I'm confident we have a bright future ahead of us and I look forward to sharing with all of you our progress throughout the year. And with that I will turn it over to Mark to initiate the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Please proceed. ","Jamie Cook","I guess just a couple quick questions. One, on the restructuring and simplification initiatives I think you said that you expect a $70 million pay off. Can you -- I guess more broadly can you talk about which segments the restructuring and simplification is aimed at? As we think about the $70 million savings when do we begin to realize that I guess would be my first question? So just a little more color on that.","And then my second question relates to just the guidance. I think you said by the back half of 2016 you expect sales to increase. Just a little more color on that. And what gives you confidence that you start to see improvement in the back half of the year? Is it just easy comps? Is it assumption the markets get better? So any color on that. Thanks.","Tom Williams","Okay, Jamie, I will start. This is Tom. So there is two questions you've got. I'll start with the whole restructuring simplification piece. Jon will have a few more details on that, than I will follow up with your question about the guidance. Okay, so, we're introducing this new concept of simplification which really isn't entirely new to the company. But let me give a little color on this as far as what we're trying to do here. So the focus is to reduce complexity, increase speed, reduce our cost and improve service to our customers which ultimately is going to help enable growth.","So the key areas we're going to focus on is first, if you look at our revenue profile, particularly look at any typical division, you look at the last several percent of revenue, it typically carries a disproportionate amount of costs, part numbers, quote activity, so we're going to look at that revenue profile. We're also looking at organization and process simplification to optimize to that revenue profile, but also basic things like looking at number of layers, span of controls, other kinds of things around organizational structure.","We're taking a fresh look at our division structure. Now we're complete believers in the divisional structure, that P&L focus we love, we're going to continue to be a decentralized company. However, we have -- as a starting point we have 115 operating divisions around the world. When we look at those divisions we see about 20% of them that have overlaps in product charter or product technologies that would benefit from combining them and getting more scale and synergies on both growth and on cost. So we're going to look at that 20%, we will probably take about 10% of our total operating divisions and reduce that as a result of that overlap and the last area will be around bureaucracy. Just reports, activities, our planning process, you name it, we're going to look at trying to just simplify how we do things.","So I will let Jon make a few comments about how it is going to be spread through the year. So that is the simplification part. The traditional restructuring will be reduction in forces, plant consolidations, all market adjustments that we're making so they are really additive. The simplification thing is around all the things I said plus the traditional restructuring. So, Jon, you can comment on the -- how it times out.","Jon Marten","I think, Jamie, just in the big picture, 60% of the cost should be incurred in the first half. And we should get about 20% of the savings in the first half and then we will get to the remainder of the savings in the second half. And of course the 40% of the cost incurred in the second half. So that is the way we have kind of got it timed in our guidance. We have got very detailed plans and we're going to leave it at that for now.","Tom Williams","And, Jamie, so I will go back to your second question which was -- and which I am sure is probably a question everybody has, how did we come up with the guidance. So from a process standpoint we always -- this is a bottoms up process from our divisions. We also build economic models to try to model how the forecast might be. And they happen to converge on about the same number which is the guidance that we've given you. But the color behind it, for the first half of the year we're continuing to see challenges in that natural resource-related market.","So oil and gas, Ag, mining and construction, we expect distribution to continue destocking, particularly for those distributors that have exposure to oil and gas for the first six months. And when we look at the year and we see Ag and mining starting to bottom at the end of this calendar year, so at the end of our Q2. And in our forecast this is for oil and gas and construction equipment to bottom at the end of our fiscal year."," So we're not really expecting any help from construction and oil and gas. However, the fact that they are not going down as rapidly and they are seeking bottom towards the end of our year it provides less headwind for us."," So the natural resources markets are going to either be at bottom or close to bottom. And then the other positive markets that have been what we have seen positive growth throughout this year will continue into next year. And that will provide the growth in the second half."," We have easier comps, we will be at bottom or nearing bottom in those tougher markets and the positive markets will be power gen, heavy-duty truck, rail, SEMICON, life science, general industrial, automotive, telecom, air-conditioning and aero. And we see a small moderate growth for distribution. So that is kind of the makeup of the year and how we came up with a minus 1.5 for the total year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Timothy Thein from Citi Research. Please proceed.","Timothy Thein","Tom just following up on your last comment there, was -- just so I am clear. So you are expecting within industrial globally the OE versus distribution split. Some growth is forecasted for distribution is I guess part one? And then just second, can you provide more detail in terms of the quarter just completed? What you saw in terms of the -- within that order decline, how that mix played out, i.e. distribution versus OE?","Tom Williams","Yes, I will start and I'm going to let Lee cover the market for the last quarter. But yes, our assumption is that there will be a small moderate growth, low single digits, for distribution in our forecast period. But I will let Lee give you color on the current quarter, what we saw, what we're currently seeing.","Lee Banks","Timothy, this is Lee. I think what I will do if it is okay with you, I'm going to comment on the industrial markets and maybe just walk you through the different regions. And I will touch on distribution and OE and different markets throughout those regions.","And try not to be redundant here, I think there is just three big headwind themes. One is the translational effect currency is having. That is the biggest impact to the top line, no doubt. We have mentioned a couple of times natural resource driven markets. And then lastly, I think there is this -- the third drag would be the continued regional\/country weakness in Europe, China and Brazil. So with that as a backdrop, I will just touch on North America. I will start with distribution. If we look at FY '15, distribution did grow organically, but there was absolutely a noticeable slowdown in Q3 and a contraction in Q4 sequentially and year over year. The slowdown was largely attributed to those distributors with significant oil and gas exposure.","And as Tom mentioned earlier, we expect another six months of destocking in that channel before it has worked itself out. On the positive side, we continue to see real positive momentum with our distribution base that is exposed to automotive Tier 1s and machine builders. They all experienced growth and continued to throughout the quarter. Talking about oil and gas, continued contraction across all upstream sectors. Offshore activity sequentially got worse since our last call. Land-based activities sequentially worse, but only mildly so. It didn't -- not at the rate that it was in Q3.","On a positive note, we continue to gain market position by helping our customers decrease costs in that sector, really using our system applications. And we have introduced some new technology developments that has really positioned us well as we go forward.","Agriculture, I think we know that is soft. Power generation has been a positive for us, almost completely globally, definitely in North America. Through FY '15 and Q4, there has been a shift from coal to gas-fired plants and that has really played well for us in terms of opportunities. And then the whole renewable energy has been positive for us.","And I think we have shared with you in the past some of the things out of our Winovation pipeline. But we're really excited about our energy storage business, that continues to gain great momentum in that energy storage space. And you may have noticed a recent press release on some significant new contracts with Alevo.","Heavy truck, Class 8 build rigs continue at a high level. We continue to experience growth and positive market position with many of our standard products and subsystems. And we have introduced some new technologies there to aid in emissions controls which are positioning us even better as we go forward. In mobile continued softness in mining and CEs. We have talked about we're bullish on the recent ABI trends that will bode well going forward.","Switching now to Europe, a lot of news about -- a lot of questions around green shoots, PMI, etc. We have not really seen a significant uptick with our customers with some exceptions. The export activity out of Germany hasn't been what it was. I suspect that is largely due from the historic pull from China which I will get to in a minute. Oil and gas activity has been slow. Many major capital projects that we have been involved with have been pushed out. Distribution performance I would categorize as flat to moderately down throughout Europe. We have seen some positive in construction, although modestly.","Agriculture continues to be soft, a couple of big forces there. Food prices are low, one, but second there continues to be a lot of debate over food subsidies or farm subsidies throughout the European union. So that is suppressing investment. And then the continued conflict in Russia and the Ukraine have really reduced investments.","Truck was a strong quarter. In Europe there was a really strong residual impact of the Euro 5. Truck pre-purchased, we expect demand going forward to be closer to underlying need. And then in China we saw modest attraction in Q4 and year over year. We see continued weakness in construction of machinery. I mean that is down probably 10% year over year off of very depressed FY '14 levels. Distribution in Asia continues to grow positively. I think, one, it is better same-store sales to use that term. And that we continue to add locations. So that has been a positive.","Another positive has really been rail both in subsystems and components. China is really becoming a producer of choice in Asia and Africa and we're happy to be a participant in that. And then automotive implant continues to be positive. I talked about power generation earlier, that is positive mostly in renewable energy. And then lastly Latin America, I will touch on this quickly. The story really is around Brazil. I just returned from there a week ago. Significant GDP contraction and weakness really across almost all sectors with the exception of power generation. We have seen some significant wins in solar and wind power in that area and the investment plan there is strong.","Heavy-duty truck is extremely weak, the natural resource markets we talked about are week. The one benefit we have had, Petrobras has reduced their plan investments nearly 40% for the next five-year projection. But a strength and emphasis on maintenance of existing infrastructure and that has really played well for us. So that is a lot there, but that just gives you a quick color on where we saw the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please proceed. ","Nathan Jones","If I could just get back to the margin guidance for 2016, can you talk about your total Parker margin guidance is up about 50 basis points despite lower revenue. I am sure you get some benefit from the new simplification project that you are embarking on. Can you talk about where the underlying margin improvement is coming from, be it restructuring or new products, etc.?","Jon Marten","Nathan, it is really coming from a couple of different areas. First of all of course we have been restructuring this year, we did the early retirement program in Q4. We had a significant restructuring that we did in FY '14. We're glad that we did that, that is going to continue to drive important savings for us in FY '16. And the simplification program that we're initiating for FY '16 is going to help us drive margins. And so, we're very focused on driving our margins up and as we added it all up we were able to come on an adjusted basis with 50 basis points higher margins in FY '16 on as reported lower sales.","So it is going to be that reduction in our fixed cost infrastructure driving higher margins, as well as it is going to be our ability to just further drive our new businesses and new products into increased margins in ways that we have not seen before. And so, when you pull that altogether that gives us this advantage.","We're also seeing, as I know you know, 100 basis points higher margins in Aerospace which is also helping drive the total company's margins up too by -- for next year and is an important part of that. And a big part of that increased Aerospace margins is coming as a result of the reduction in some of our development expenses as well as the expansion that we're experiencing in the OEM, super cycle commercial shipments.","Nathan Jones","And then my follow-up question is on pricing. You have seen 4% order declines in the third quarter, 9% order declines in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what impact that is having on pricing in the market and how competitors are behaving, what the competitive environment is like at the moment?","Lee Banks","I mean certainly it is a tough pricing environment. I mean we're pleased but we track this very closely with our SPI index and we're still positive year to date, we were positive in the quarter. One of the things that we try to do is really address our customers' cost issue. And we do that through bundling technologies and helping them take cost out of their system. So we try to get away from price per se. But bottom line is still positive, it is a tough environment, though I don't want to describe it any other way.","Nathan Jones","Are you expecting price to be neutral to positive going forward?","Lee Banks","We're expecting it basically to be flat in our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Please proceed. ","Ann Duignan","Can you give us some more color on your Aerospace orders? I don't know if I missed it, but I know you said tough comps, but I think you also said that commercial aftermarket was down. You are not the first company to note that and I am just curious what is going on in commercial aftermarket or if I missed [indiscernible].","Jon Marten","Not sure. Well, I think that in our commercial aftermarket we're actually up slightly there in our orders. So it is not a big move up, but we're up slightly there. From an order standpoint the major driver for us is military. And so these orders, Ann, that are really driving our numbers, as you know, for the military and can be very lumpy and that was the comparable number that I was talking about. And that is what is really driving the numbers.","We're also seeing some move in our commercial OEM business down slightly. But again, that is from a very high ordering pattern this time last year and really throughout the beginning of the cycle which is now starting to level off to more numbers that are more representative of how we see ourselves going forward which is indicated in our guidance. Does that help, Ann?","Ann Duignan","Yes it does actually. Thank you, it helps a lot. I've got a lot of questions on that since you released. Can you talk about your confidence in your outlook for the start of a recovery and distribution in the back half. There isn't much visibility there, I mean where could you be wrong?","Tom Williams","Ann, this is Tom. I mean, as you know, any forecast is usually wrong the day after we send it out. But I think we have some fair assumptions. We have done this through visibility to customer demand, distribution inventory, our own economic modeling and then our bottoms up from our divisions was all basically coalesced along the same thing. So the key assumptions will be that we're assuming bottoming of some of those end markets that were giving us the most trouble. So mining in the second quarter and Ag in the second quarter and then oil and gas and construction in Q4. So if those were to slip at all that would be a potential risk.","But that is our best assumption right now. And of course every quarter we're going to give you a new look at that and what we think. So we think that is fair based on all the intelligence that we have been able to gather to date.","Ann Duignan","And then other than your oil and gas outlook, are you assuming an increase in rig count from here or just kind of stay at this level and we bump along?","Tom Williams","Yes, we're assuming flat and basically if oil and gas gets to flat that becomes a positive for us because it has been such a drag the last two quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Please proceed. ","Jeff Hammond","If we could just zero in on oil and gas, I think you have talked about that as being a $1 billion business. Can you just talk about how you think about that for the full year magnitude of decline and how that kind of plays into the margin mix?","Tom Williams","Well, Jeff, this is Lee. I mean it is -- we have talked about it being a big headwind in terms of margin mix, there is no doubt about that. I mean if you look at the oil and gas, I mean we have got OEM customers that are off 50%. So they are going -- 50% with us, they are going through a big destocking process with us.","So I think once we work our way through that, work through the inventory that is in the channel it will be a little more line pole in terms of demand, I think that will be a positive for us. But we're not forecasting other than line pole a big rebound in that market.","Jeff Hammond","Okay and then can you quantify what distribution was down in North America in the quarter and how much you think of that as just temporary destock versus the underlying short-term demand trend?","Lee Banks","Yes, in the quarter about 4% would be our best guess. And I think a lot of that has to do with, again, just destocking some of these end markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow. Please proceed. ","Eli Lustgarten","One of clarification. Your guidance has share count of 140.8, I guess you spent sort of on the $1.4 billion so far. Is the assumption that you are not going to buy back stock more than creep for the rest of the year? Or you just haven't put it in there and that is something we should take out [indiscernible] 600 million plus.","Tom Williams","Eli, it is Tom, yes, we did not put it into our forecast. But you can rest assured that we're still committed to the $2 billion to $3 billion of share repurchase over the timeframe that we communicated. And I would look for us to -- you will see us buy opportunistically and I would look for you to see us doing that going forward here.","Eli Lustgarten","So, will go down if you do execute?","Tom Williams","Right.","Eli Lustgarten","Now can we talk a little bit about your assumption for Rest of World profitability? You have got the margins going up anywhere from 50 to 100 basis points and what is likely to be relatively stagnant kind of volume or so.","Is that a beneficiary of this program that you have announced this year? And is that where -- one of the points we're trying to find out is the $70 million benefit you are getting, where would we see that? Most of it is going to be International or is it split between International and Rest of World and North America?","Jon Marten","Yes, Eli, Jon here. Overall the benefits of the program we're going to see worldwide. This is a business process simplification and it is going to have an impact on our margins worldwide. So I think we will see equal implications for North America as we will for our Industrial International businesses there.","Eli Lustgarten","And is that the source of the improved margins in Rest of World or is there something else happening?","Jon Marten","It is one of the key factors for our improved margins. But we're continuing to look as our market starts to stabilize to be able to generate a margin in Europe much higher than we have been experiencing here in FY '15 and so we've been, as you know, determined to do that for the last couple years. And we start to see improvement in our European margins as all of the simplification and all of the prior restructuring take hold in our cost structure there. And so, we will see it in Europe, we will also see improvements in our Asian businesses too.","But I don't want to give you that that is 100% of the driven increases in our margins. This also has a lot to do with our Win Strategy, our ability to do pricing right, to do buying right, to recover from some of the translational and transactional impacts of currency headwinds that we're feeling in some of the countries in Europe. And so, there is a whole host of activities that we're working on very [Technical Difficulty] here to help drive our margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. ","Andy Casey","A couple questions, the first one is kind of asking something that has been asked a couple times before at least a different way. Can you help us understand what sort of benefit from internal restructuring realignment and early retirement initiatives are included in the $0.19 operating profit increased shown on slide 16?","Jon Marten","Okay, let me just make sure that I am tracking there with you. Yes, well, listen, in that $0.19 it has got all of the impact of the simplification. Keep in mind that our revenues are going down. So we're showing increased operating earnings on lower as reported earnings.","And part of the driving force for us to be able to increase our earnings in a lower sales environment which I realize is at first glance completely counterintuitive, is our ability to do the simplification program the way that we have outlined it, as well as reap the benefits from the prior restructuring that we have done, the early retirement that we have done here in that fourth quarter of this year. And that is the source of the $0.19. And again, just to remind you, I know you know this very well Andy, but this is a compilation of all of the programs from a bottoms up perspective in the company. And this is not just one program, we're making it sound like it is one program and it is externally.","But inside this is many, many, many programs at the divisional in group level within the company and this is how it gets rolled up here in the company when we actually ended up doing our guidance. And that is a big basis for the $0.19 that we're showing on that slide.","So, I don't want to give you the impression that this is just a big tops down look at the forecast for FY '16. This is something that has come up from the divisions like we normally do. And this is the result of that process as we start to review it and make adjustments to our operating cadence around the world.","Andy Casey","If you ex out the initiatives that have yet to be done, some of the initiatives you announced today.","Jon Marten","Yes.","Andy Casey","What sort of benefit is just carryover from what has already been done?","Jon Marten","Well, we have got a $50 million carryover from the effort that we had put together here in FY '15. And that's really the benefit that we're going to see next year and that will be bleeding right into the cost structure in FY '16. So that is one number that we're very firm about, we feel we have a lot of confidence in and that is the number that is rolled up into the forecast that we're getting from the team.","Andy Casey","And then in the first half\/second half outlook I just want to make sure if there is any items on top of the revenue outlook by market that you kind of gave. Does the first half outlook include any inventory reduction actions, either on the corporate level or in your distribution channel, that when you look into the second half to expect that to normalize?","Tom Williams","As I mentioned earlier, for the first six months we're assuming some destocking in our distribution channel. So that is part of the headwind we will have in the first half of the year from a revenue standpoint.","Andy Casey","And then one last one if I could fit it in on the Aerospace back to I think it was Ann's question. Some other participants have described some distribution channel choppiness. Are you seeing any of that at this point? It doesn't sound like your order intake is suggesting that on the commercial side.","Jon Marten","No, we're really not, Andy. We have not a booming commercial aftermarket, but we have steady commercial aftermarket experience here in our FY '15 and that is what we're expecting here for FY '16. Now from quarter to quarter of course there can be some issues, but we didn't experience in Q4 and we're not planning on anything unusual other than the normal seasonal patterns that we will see in FY '16 as we saw in FY '15.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. ","John Inch","Jon, you mentioned the $50 million carry-forward from I guess your 2015 initiatives into 2016 and you also mentioned $70 million. Does the $70 million map to the $100 million of charges you are taking? So that would imply, based on what you said, $14 million or 20% savings in the first half and $56 million or the remainder 80% in the second half? So basically we're looking at an incremental $120 million with that split out? Is that the benefit for 2016, is that the way to think about it?","Jon Marten","I think you are right, Jon. I am going to have to take a look at my numbers here right now. We have got savings of $24 million that are related to the $100 million in the first half. And we have got a savings of $46 million in the second half related to the backend of a $70 million of the $100 million cost. So the total cost for the program in FY '16 is $100 million, the total savings in FY '16 is $70 million. So there is a total net cost of $30 million which equates to $0.15. That $0.15 is built into our guidance.","John Inch","But a total restructuring benefit excluding the cost of $120 million, right, because of $50 million that you said was--?","Jon Marten","That is correct.","John Inch","Okay. And then you were kind enough to give us your first half\/second half assumptions. What would be your organic growth assumptions, Jon, first half versus second half? Is there any way to provide a little color there? To get to Tom's point about flat for the year?","Jon Marten","Yes, I'm going to just give you a rough order of magnitude on the organic growth in the second half of FY '16 as part of our guidance is about 2.5% organic growth on, of course, much different comps that we're talking about right now at that time that we're projecting for our FY '16 Q3 and Q4.","John Inch","With a little bit of recovery excluding comps baked into that I am assuming based on all of the commentary you've made in this call. Is that fair?","Jon Marten","That is right. That dovetails into the comments that we were hearing from Tom and Lee and our slow but sequential pick up starting in the second half -- very slow, very modest.","John Inch","And can I just follow up on the $100 million? You guys had issues in Europe for many years, you weren't the only company, you kind of bit the bullet in 2014 and took some very substantial outsized restructuring. And here we're heading into 2016 and there is another $100 million which encompasses Europe. So really I guess my question is of the $100 million, how much of that would be structural versus variable? Right, so reduction in force in response to weak markets? And then what is it exactly that you are doing in Europe that you didn't already do through actions in 2014 and 2015? I'm just try to understand kind of what --.","Jon Marten","Sure.","John Inch","So what is really happening here to get it to the $100 million?","Tom Williams","So, John, this is Tom. There is a difference between what we did before. Before we focused on footprint optimization and classic plant consolidations and those type of things. The simplification initiatives which is, as you know, 60% of the total restructuring cost, is focused more on organization and process optimization looking at revenue complexity.","And that is global, it is not picking on Europe. This is 50-50, we're going to have half of these actions in North America and half internationally. And that half international will cover Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Europe because these processes are issues around the world.","And we're just taking a fresh look at it around revenue complexity organizational complexity, division consolidations and bureaucracy. And I can tell you right now this has got a lot of energy behind it, a lot of enthusiasm. It is not easy and it is tough decisions, but there is a lot of interest because when you do these things right you are going to be faster to serve customers and it is going to enable growth for the company.","John Inch","It really sounds, Tom, as if this was probably tied to your own succession as CEO and just kind of a refresh of Win for the most part versus just making sure that there was nothing in the quarter you said, uh oh, you know what, May is really tough, we're just going to have to get out and bite the bullet and take a lot more restructuring. I am assuming that most of this, call it -- you could call it almost strategic -- is that a fair statement? Or is there really just kind of almost balance based on obviously the short cycle economy which is pretty tough right now.","Tom Williams","Well, John, I think you nailed it. This is something that both Lee and I and Jon have talked about knowing when the succession was going to happen that this was something strategically that we did want to look at. And this is really two parts -- we're going to do the normal adjustments to the market that we have always done, the classic restructuring realignment and on top of it we're going to do these strategic things which is going to have a much more efficient cost structure and a much more -- much better service model for our customers.","And that is just one element of the refreshed Win Strategy. Everybody on the phone, you get a chance to hear a lot more detail. So we called this one out the simplification piece because it is a big part of this year's operating plan. But there is a lot of other things we want to talk to you about all around growing the company best as the market and expanding margins which we'll give you a lot more color at IR day here in September.","Jon Marten","Okay, well, thanks, John. And this concludes our Q&A and our earnings call for today. Thank you to everybody for joining us. Robin will be available throughout the day to take your calls should you have any further questions. Thank you and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect. And have a great day."],"16834":["Parker-Hannifin Corp.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Cathy Suever, Chief Financial Officer. Ma'am, you may begin.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom Williams; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks. Today's presentation slides, together with the audio web-cast replay, will be accessible on the company's investor information website at phstock.com for one year following today's call.","On slide number 2, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and are posted on Parker's website at phstock.com.","Today's call agenda appears on slide number 3. To begin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, will provide highlights for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's third quarter fiscal year 2017 performance, together with the guidance for full fiscal year 2017. Tom will provide a few summary comments, and then we'll open the call for a Q&A session.","At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slide number 4.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks Cathy, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning. I'd like to take a moment to congratulate Cathy on her new role as Chief Financial Officer, which we announced earlier this month. We will certainly miss Jon Marten, who announced his retirement; we thank Jon for his great leadership and service during his 30 years with the company.","We're very fortunate to have someone of Cathy's leadership and experience to step into this important role, Cathy has 30 years of experience in operational and financial roles at Parker, and has been acting CFO since November of last year. This seamless transition is an indicator of the effectiveness of our leadership succession planning at Parker.","Now, moving onto the results, I'd like to share highlights of our third quarter results, which were strong across many measures, give you an update on the CLARCOR integration, and comment on our changes to the fiscal year 2017 guidance.","Before I get into the financials, I'd like to first report on our safety performance since keeping our people safe is our highest priority and our most important measure. During the third quarter of 2017, we were able to reduce our recordable injuries by 28% compared to the prior year. Importantly, we reduced our lost time due to injuries by 39% compared with the prior year period. This builds on a significant year-over-year improvement in the last several years, and it's even more impressive considering the increase in volume we've experienced this quarter. This improvement is being driven by strong leadership, training, and engagement of our team members globally through high-performance teams that are focused on achieving the goal of zero accidents.","Now onto the financial highlights for our third quarter results: This was another strong quarter for Parker across many measures, third quarter sales were $3.12 billion, a 10% increase compared with the same quarter a year ago. Organic sales increased 6%, and acquisitions contributed 5%, while currency was a negative 1%. We are particularly pleased with the strong organic growth, driven by improving conditions across many of our end markets. This is noteworthy as it is the first quarter of organic growth since the December 2014 quarter.","As you know, we closed the CLARCOR acquisition in late February, and had one month results included in the quarter, which drove the 5% increase from acquisitions. Order rates, which do not include the impact of acquisitions, also continued to move in a positive direction for the third consecutive quarter. Total orders increased 8% compared with the same quarter last year. Industrial North America orders increased 9%, Industrial International orders were double-digits at 13%, and our Aerospace Systems Segment orders were flat.","Again, we see encouraging signs of recovery in demand levels. We'll provide more color on the markets in our Q&A portion of the call. Net income for the third quarter increased 28% to $238.8 million, as reported compared with the same period last year.","Earnings per share were $1.75 as reported or $2.11 on an adjusted basis, a 40% increase in adjusted earnings per share compared with adjusted earnings in the same quarter last year. Our overall segment operating margin performance this quarter was very strong at 14.8%, as reported, or 16.1% on an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins increased 140 basis points compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2016, an excellent year-over-year improvement. Year-to-date cash from operations excluding a discretionary pension contribution was 11.8% of sales, demonstrating our ability to be a strong generator of cash on a consistent basis.","Now just a few highlights, updates on capital allocation. As we announced at the end of February, we closed the transaction to acquire CLARCOR. Since the transaction closed, we've welcomed the global CLARCOR team to Parker and have begun the process of integrating our businesses. Filtration Group President Rob Malone has formed a leadership team for the newly combined business. We have also formed a dedicated integration team staffed with some of our most experienced and talented operational and functional leaders. I feel very good about the progress we've made with the integration and I'm confident we can generate the $140 million in cost synergies we initially expected from our combined filtration businesses.","We've incurred the expected amount of one-time acquisition related expenses, which Cathy will highlight in her slides and we will provide FY-2018 CLARCOR costs and EPS projections when we provide full year guidance in August.","Also during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Helac Corporation to add specialty rotary actuators and attachments to our hydraulics portfolio.","During the quarter, we announced a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend. We've now increased our annual dividends paid for 61 consecutive fiscal years. This is among the top five longest-running dividend increase records in the S&P 500.","We've also continued our 10b5-1 program and bought $50 million worth of shares in the third quarter. These actions reinforce our commitment to being a great deployer of cash in ways that generate increased long-term returns for our shareholders.","Just one other strategic update to comment on, this week, we launched our Voice of the Machine Internet of Things offering at the world's largest trade fair for industrial technologies in Hanover, Germany. The Voice of the Machine IoT platform is an open, interoperable and scalable system of connected products and services. We are excited about the launch of this new capability that offers benefits to our customers such as improved safety, reduced maintenance cost and downtime, while simultaneously uncovering opportunities to improve operational performance.","Moving to our revised FY 2017 guidance. We are increasing our full-year sales growth forecast from a negative 0.5% to an increase of positive 5.9% at the midpoint in our new guidance to reflect higher organic growth and the impact of acquisitions. For fiscal year 2017, we are updating guidance for as reported earnings in the range of $6.90 to $7.20 per share or $7.05 at the midpoint.","On an adjusted basis, we expect EPS in the range of $7.70 to $8.00 for a midpoint of $7.85. Earnings are adjusted for our anticipated business realignment expenses of approximately $0.25 forecasted for fiscal 2017 and for acquisition related expenses of $0.55. To be clear, our revised guidance does include the benefits and costs from the CLARCOR and Helac acquisitions.","For now I'm going to hand things back to Cathy to review more details on the quarter and the fiscal 2017 guidance.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Tom. Please refer to slide number 5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter were $2.11 versus $1.51 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of 40%. Third quarter earnings have been adjusted to exclude CLARCOR acquisition related expenses of $0.27 per share incurred during the quarter and business realignment expenses of $0.09 per share, which compares to business realignment expenses of $0.14 per share for the same quarter last year.","On slide number 6. You will find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.51 for the third quarter of fiscal year \u2013 fiscal 2016 to $2.11 for the third quarter of this year. Increases included higher adjusted segment operating income of $0.44 per share, of which Legacy Parker was $0.37 and CLARCOR contributed $0.07.","Lower income taxes as compared to the prior year equated to an increase of $0.18, due largely to the stock option expense tax credit, while lower other expense and the impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.03. Adjusted per share income was reduced by $0.05 due to higher interest expense and corporate G&A.","Moving to slide number 7, we review total Parker's sales and segment operating margin for the third quarter. Total company organic sales for the third quarter increased by 5.7%, compared to the same quarter, last year. There was a 5.6% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions, while currency negatively impacted the quarter by 1%.","Total segment operating margins adjusted for realignment costs as well as CLARCOR acquisition related expenses was 16.1%, versus 14.7% for the same quarter last year. Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $16 million, versus $25 million, last year. CLARCOR acquisition related costs included in segment operating income totaled $26 million in the quarter. The increased adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $503 million, versus $417 million, last year reflects the impact of organic growth, combined with the benefits yielded from our simplification initiatives.","Moving to slide number 8, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the third quarter, North American organic sales increased by 3.8%, compared to the same quarter, last year. Acquisitions contributed 9.7% impact to sales, while currency negatively impacted the quarter by 0.2%.","Operating margin for the third quarter adjusted for realignment and CLARCOR acquisition related costs was 18.2% of sales, versus 16.9% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $4 million, as compared to $9 million in the prior-year.","CLARCOR acquisition related costs included in operating income totaled $26 million during the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $258 million, as compared to $211 million driven by strong incremental margins on increased revenues and lower fixed cost.","I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial International segment on slide number 9. Organic sales for the third quarter in the Industrial International segment increased to 9.5%%. Acquisitions positively impacted sales by 3.7%%, while currency negatively impacted the quarter by 2.5%. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for business realignment costs, was 14.5% of sales versus 11.9% in the prior year.","Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $11 million, as compared to $16 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $164 million as compared to $121 million, which again reflects strong incremental margins on increased revenues and lower fixed costs.","I'll now move to slide number 10 to review the Aerospace Systems Segment. Organic revenues increased 2.9% for the third quarter, with flat growth in OEM sales, aftermarket demand helped drive growth in both commercial and military businesses during the quarter.","Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs was 14.2% of sales versus 15.1% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $2 million compared to $1 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $82 million as compared to $85 million, reflecting the impact of higher development costs during the current quarter.","Moving to slide number 11 with the detail of order rates by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three months rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders improved to positive 8% for the quarter end. Diversified Industrial North American orders increased to a year-over-year 9% change. Diversified Industrial International orders increased year-over-year to a positive 13% for the quarter. And Aerospace Systems orders were flat year-over-year.","In slide number 12, we report cash flow from operating activities. Year-to-date, cash flow from operating activities was $789 million or 9.2% of sales, this compares to 8.4% of sales for the same period last year. When adjusted for the $220 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was very strong at 11.8% of sales. This compares to 10.8% of sales for the same period last year, adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the prior year. In addition to the discretionary pension contribution, the significant uses of cash year-to-date have been $4.1 billion for acquisitions, $262 million for the company's repurchase of common shares, $257 million for the payment of shareholder dividend, and $145 million or 1.7% of sales for capital expenditures.","Full year earnings guide for fiscal year 2017 is outlined on slide number 13.","Guidance is being provided on both on as reported and an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million for the full year. Adjusted segment operating margins, below the line items, and earnings per share exclude expected CLARCOR acquisition related expenses of $103 million for total fiscal year 2017.","Total sales are expected to be in the range of positive 4.9% to positive 6.9% as compared to the prior year. Full year organic growth at the midpoint is up 1.9%, acquisitions in the guidance are expected to positively impact sales by 5.1%. Currency in the guidance is expected to have a negative 1% impact on sales. We've calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended March 31 and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the final quarter of fiscal year 2017.","For total Parker, as reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.7% and 14.9%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 15.6% and 15.8%. The full year guidance at the midpoint for below the line items which includes corporate G&A, interest and other expense is $470 million on an as reported basis and $425 million on an adjusted basis.","The full year tax rate is now projected at 27%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 136 million shares. For the full year, the guidance range on an as reported earnings per share basis is $6.90 to $7.20 or $7.05 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is $7.70 or $8.00 or $7.85 at the midpoint. This adjusted earnings per share guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million for the full fiscal year 2017. The effect of this restructuring on earnings per share is approximately $0.25. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million and are fully reflected in both the as reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges.","In addition adjusted guidance excludes $103 million of CLARCOR acquisition related expenses for fiscal 2017, equating to $0.55 earnings per share. Our revised guidance now includes the benefits and the costs from the CLARCOR and Helac acquisitions completed during the third quarter. We would ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison. Some additional key assumptions for full-year 2017 guidance at the midpoint are sales are divided 45% first half, 55% second half. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 43% first half, 57% second half, adjusted earnings per share first half, second half is divided 45%\/55%.","Fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $2.22 per share at the midpoint and this excludes $0.07 of projected business realignment expenses and $0.19 of projected CLARCOR acquisition-related expenses.","Slide number 14, you'll find a breakout of CLARCOR's impact on our fiscal 2017. CLARCOR sales contributed $136 million in the third quarter and are forecasted to be $369 million for Q4, resulting in a full 2017 sales impact of $505 million. CLARCOR acquisition-related expenses were $16 million in Q2, $51 million in Q3, and are expected to be $36 million during Q4. CLARCOR's earnings per share impact on an as-reported basis was a negative $0.09 in Q2, negative $0.24 in Q3, and is expected to be a negative $0.14 in Q4. The earnings per share impact of CLARCOR adjusted for acquisition-related expenses was an accretive $0.04 in Q3 and is expected to be $0.04 in Q4.","These earnings per share amounts include CLARCOR-related amortization, which is presently estimated to be $130 million per year, additional depreciation estimated to be $13 million per year, and incremental interest expense of $73 million per year. Please note that Q3 included only the month of March and this year March had a high number of shipping days, which helped with absorption of fixed costs. The estimates for Q4 represent a more normal level of quarterly sales and earnings per share accretion for making assumptions going forward.","On slide number 15, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of fiscal-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $7.85 per share at the midpoint, compared to the prior guidance of $7.30 per share. Increases include $0.52 from stronger segment operating income, of which CLARCOR is forecasted to contribute $0.21. Additionally, a lower tax rate, other expenses, and corporate G&A resulted in a $0.07 per share increase. The decreases include a $0.12 per share reduction from higher interest expense and $0.02 from a modestly higher share count. Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisitions or divestitures that might close during the remainder of fiscal 2017. This concludes my prepared comments.","Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Cathy. We've continued to make progress through fiscal 2017 and our third quarter continued this momentum. I'd like to thank our team members around the world for their dedicated efforts.","We are making meaningful progress with the new Win Strategy, which is designed to drive top quartile performance versus our proxy peers and generate long-term shareholder value. All signs point to a strong close to the fiscal year. More importantly we continue to see opportunities that will allow us to achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, which includes organic sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production, 17% segment operating margins and a compound annual growth rate and earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period.","This is a special year for us at Parker as we celebrate our 100 year anniversary. We are very proud of our history and confident of the bright future that we see in front of us.","So, with that, at this time, we're ready to take questions. So, Shannon, if you could go ahead and get it started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. You may begin.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","If you have the numbers handy, could talk about what the incremental margins were excluding the acquisitions?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. Why don't I talk about excluding CLARCOR, we've done it multiple ways here to analyze our core business results, but looking at just excluding CLARCOR, we're in the range of \u2013 the incremental margins in the third quarter were in the range of the high 40%s.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And I think you had fairly considerably higher incremental margins in the last quarter and probably even at the high 40%s, which is very good, was maybe a little lower than expected. Was there anything in there that dragged those down in the quarter or how should we be thinking about those incremental margins going forward?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","I think it's normal for us to be in the high 40%s as we're coming \u2013 we're growing and markets are improving. We've seen some also benefit from the simplification efforts we've been making, and I'm giving you a broad total Parker number. On the industrial side, it was higher, in the 50%s. So, it depends on which of the segment of the business you're looking at.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Nathan, this is Tom. Because aerospace was a little challenged with some extra development costs in the quarter that kind of deflated the marginal return on sales a little bit. If you back that out, just look at industrial and then also take all the acquisitions out, we're in the mid-50%s.","Now, I would not project a mid-50% MROS for us going forward. We tend to have the first quarter to up about that level, and then glide back down to a more steady state of plus 30%, but these margins are really, really stellar that we put up in this quarter.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Are those aerospace development costs projected to increase or to continue at that level?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Nathan, this was \u2013 in this quarter, we pulled in some development works to help some of our customers get to the end of their \u2013 to get their development cost programs finished. So, it was more cost that had been planned for fiscal 2018 that we pulled into this third quarter.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So, it should glide down then. And just a question on industrial, clearly Parker usually is a beneficiary early in the cycle of inventory restocking in the channels. Can you talk about what you think is maybe the growth that you're seeing there, that's due to inventory restocking?","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. Nathan, it's Lee. I mean, I think the exciting part for us, industrial in North America is we saw a lot of our distributor partners see a substantial increase in their backlog throughout the quarter. So that's had a knock-on effect of order entry and shipments. I'm sure there's some marginal inventory restocking, but I wouldn't call that a significant driver of what's happening, I would characterize it more as real demand.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks, I'll get back in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning. One question and then I guess a follow-up. Tom just to be clear on the last question with the incremental margins, I guess more broadly, we shouldn't assume that CLARCOR dampens incremental margins assuming things continue to recover, so we should think about sort of Parker \u2013 you know what I mean? We should think about Parker's historical incremental margins and assume that's how we think about things going forward. I just want to make sure there is no short-term issues with the integration of CLARCOR?","And then, second, obviously the orders inflected higher broadly, if we think about North America, although easier comps and on the international side, so Lee, perhaps you could provide some color on which markets inflected more positively versus last quarter or last year. Thanks.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Okay, Jamie, I'll start then I'll hand it over to Lee for the markets. On MROS, I think with CLARCOR all in (27:43) you should see us do what we've historically done. If \u2013 that plus a little bit more, because everything we've done as a company, with the new Win Strategy, the fixed costs that we've taken out, simplification. So I think you could model historical plus a little bit better. On the integration, it's going terrific. I'm very pleased with integration so far. The teamwork between both companies basically becoming one, they are the talent that the cultural fit, all the synergies, very interesting, the synergies we thought when we're kind of looking at it, more isolated now that we're looking at it jointly. There is a lot of harmony between both teams looking at and saying we've created, this is a dynamite list. So we're very encouraged and there is \u2013 as we go forward, we update you in August give you a better clarity as to the cost to achieve and the savings for that fiscal year, but we're off to a good start with that. And then on the markets, I would just tell you that's it's nice \u2013 it's really nice having sat in this room now for 10 quarters to have a quarter where we have an exciting organic growth story to tell you. I mean, it's across pretty much board, and I'll let Lee give you the color on that.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Sorry, Tom, just a follow-up on the incremental though, but in \u2013 obviously it's very encouraging that you think you can do a little better than where we were historically and you don't see sort of price cost is an issue as well like that's not to be short-term.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","No.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right, great. Sorry, Lee. Go ahead.","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","No, that's fine. So I think, I wanted to just to highlight here, which was kind of nice, this is the strongest orders growth we've had since Q1 of FY 2012. So it's been some time that it's been and we've had that kind of inflection. Just talking about the industrial markets. As we look through all our end-markets and we track these kind of on a giant heat map, it's hard to find any significant market that's natural positive year-over-year order entry growth during the quarter. And really, Jamie, to highlight some of the key markets, I think if you bucket all the natural resource end markets, those continue to grow during the quarter. We kind of saw some of it last quarter that I highlighted. But this would include agriculture, construction equipment, mining, oil and gas. The number in oil and gas rigs, North America, nearly doubled from a year ago, and we've just seen an appreciable pickup in quotes and order entry activity for a lot of rigs that have been stored where parts have the cannibalized. So, it's really not new rig activity, it's just a lot of MRO, which is great business for our guys.","We also saw a really nice rebound in activity from our distributor partners around the world. So, for the first time and we're up worldwide with all their distributor partners for some time. And I'd say other notable markets that grew during the quarter, microelectronics was strong, HVAC in our refrigeration, very strong telecom, Class 8 truck, were all really strong markets.","If I can, I'll just \u2013 as long as I'm going here Jamie, I'll just cover the regions real quick, I'm not going to walk through the markets, but just give you some color on the regions.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","So, in North America, as I just talked was very strong really encouraged by the increasing end market activity. And it was really nice just to see a significant increase in backlog with some of our distributor partners that really been hit hard by the oil and gas, natural resource end market collapse.","In EMEA, we saw strong order entry growth during the quarter, and it kind of built as the quarter went on, in fact this will be the first year we expect year-over-year organic growth in three years in EMEA. So, we're hoping that's going to continue as we go forward. And then Asia, Asia is really strong. I mean, China continues the lead with strong industrial and natural resource end markets, and the strength in China really has been led by a significant infrastructure investment and strong housing market.","And we also see emerging markets in Southeast Asia continuing to show great growth. So, we're really happy with what's happening. There is clearly a positive global sentiment to growth right now anywhere you go, but I think we'll be happier if we see a couple of more quarters of this can order entry growth going forward.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. That was very helpful. I'll get back in queue.","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thank you.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you and congratulations, Cathy and then Jon, if you're listening. You'll certainly be missed and we definitely wish you well. So, first question, maybe just staying with the discussion on organic growth. Did trends improve as we progressed through the quarter, how trends started out in April, any commentary you can have on that, that would be helpful?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. The trend \u2013 Joe this is Tom. The trends through the quarter, North America and Europe showed steady progress through the quarter and Asia Pacific and Latin America were pretty much consistent, stayed at a high level for the quarter, and April is consistent with what we saw and it's reflected in the guide. So, in general, I think Lee kind of hit it, we're encouraged, but couple of more quarters would just solidify that for us.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. Maybe when I kind of take a look at your organic growth guidance for the year, I recognize the commentary around March being a healthier quarter from a shipment perspective for CLARCOR. I'm just trying to break up your total organic growth guidance in the North America business. It seems like you were expecting at least high single-digit maybe even low double-digit organic growth in that business for 4Q. And I just want to make sure that I'm calculating things right for CLARCOR, so any other detail you can give on the components, it would be helpful?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Sure, Joe. Yeah, we're expecting for North America high single-digits organic growth in the fourth quarter. CLARCOR right now is running more mid-single digits, but total Parker North America high single-digits.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then maybe if I could ask one more on CLARCOR, the $103 million in costs this year, how much integration cost, I think you guys had highlighted about $90 million in integration costs that you expected to take on CLARCOR to get the synergy benefits. How much of any of those integration costs are going through this year, and maybe if there is some cadence for 2018 as well, that would be helpful?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. It's very small so far this year and expected in the fourth quarter as we're just getting started, we do have the full-time team on board, and so we're including the cost for that team. I would say, you can think of it in terms of a couple of million dollars for FY 2017. And then for FY 2018, we're expecting, I think initially, we told you the $90 million would be split about 75% of it would be in the first and second years, you can continue to think in those terms for FY 2018.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. I'll get back in queue. Thanks, guys.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Good morning, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. So Cathy, CLARCOR was what, mid-single digit organic growth in this quarter, I realize you only owned it for a month, but that \u2013 if you just look at their quarter, is that about the number?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Because it was only the month of March with the high sales compared to a normal quarterly month sales, it was higher than mid-single digits for just the month of March. It was actually double-digits.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So it was double \u2013 all right, that makes more sense. So you think it reverts to more of a mid-single because \u2013 why again, just because they had such a big March?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yes. So March had 23 shipping days and that's a bit unusual. When you look at shipping days per month on a quarterly average, it's closer to 21 days. And CLARCOR tends to have heavy burden of fixed costs, and if you think about amortization being layered in there, you get quite a bit of absorption improvement when you have higher volume. And they saw that in March, but that isn't a normal trend.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then \u2013 okay. So I wanted to ask about the tax rate. I mean, obviously, I am assuming the stock option expense issue is sort of driving this lower quarterly, is there not a better way to forecast this like what \u2013 your tax rate for the year, do you assume that no options get exercised as part of the derivation of this because it did add a significant amount to EPS versus the forecast last quarter, is this something we've just got to live with or what?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. John, we look at that and we do not forecast any because there is so many variables involved. We don't know how many people will be exercising their options, we don't know what options they're going to exercise at what grant value, and we'd have to also know what we've already incurred as expense because it's only the differential of where they exercise versus what we had already recognized as expense. So there are so many variables that we choose to not try to forecast that, so it's an upside.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, no, that's fine. I just want to make sure, I'm not missing something. There is a lot of interest expense running through for CLARCOR, maybe Tom or Lee or Cathy, can you remind us what's you plan to deleverage? And when do you start paying that debt back, so we get even higher accretion, because I guess accretion is running kind of $0.15 to $0.20, but could be up a lot more if you could pay this debt down?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","John, I'll start at a high level and I'll let Cathy fill in, add any more details, but our goal is, we're about 3.2 times debt-to-EBITDA. Over the next 24 months to 36 months, we want to drive it down to the 2.0 debt-to-EBITDA. So, we're going \u2013 the cash flow, we're very proud of at almost 12%, CFOA, we're going to be using that to help pay down the debt and we're encouraged by what we've seen so far as far as synergies and our ability to put these businesses together, so we think cash will continue to be a very strong component of it. But that's the focus is driving that down.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, people are already building out to 2018, I guess the question is how much \u2013 are you still going to make a big pension contribution next year or do you channel that into debt, like how much debt can we reduce in 2018 to kind of help us with the accretion?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yes, a little too early to tell, we're having only CLARCOR for one month, John, but we do \u2013 we are optimistic in performance we're seeing and what they will provide for us in cash, we did purposely keep some of the new debt short-term, so that we can be paying it down as we have the cash available, but too soon to tell how much it will happen in FY 2018.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just last, I think Lee you were in China recently, is China getting better, it seems Chine is a source of strength for a lot of industrials this quarter, versus last quarter, but you guys had strong Asia-PAC results before, because of I guess the build out of your distribution network and so forth, if you just try and pro forma for that, what's going on in China, did it strengthened for you or is it sort of status quo strong or anything you could say about it would be helpful? Thanks.","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Well. It's been strong the last couple of quarters and I talked about this infrastructure build. You've seen \u2013 if I look at all the Chinese national manufacturers' construction equipment. I mean their production has more than doubled than what it was a year ago. So, it's just really strong, but there has been strength over the last year in rail, there has been a lot of strength in life science industries that we serve. So, it's been positive across many different fronts.","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","In fact, when you look at all the end markets in China, it's hard to find anything that's red.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I don't know, your folks on the ground that will think it can be sustained, I guess is where I'm going or is it a little bit...","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Well...","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...stimulus and all that other stuff?","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","I think the consensus is going to be sustained, but I mean you know how that works. So...","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","...there is definitely a lot of things driving it right now.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Growth Chinese style. Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. Here we go.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A couple questions, you mentioned earlier that you really didn't see any meaningful restocking in the North America distribution channel. Did you notice any occurring in the North American based OEMs, I'm just wondering if they maybe staging for further production increases?","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Andy, I think order entry up is across many different markets. So, those customers are placing orders. To what extent they're trying to create a buffer of inventory is really hard for me to see, their say. But I would characterize most of the demand that we're seeing is real demand based on what I see on production rates with our customers is being passed through.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Lee. And then I'm wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the revised outlook for the Industrial North American margin, you shaved 20 basis points, not a lot, but 20 basis points of the top end. Was that all CLARCOR or was there anything else that you were considering in that guidance revision?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","North America, Andy, we've actually bumped it up, if you consider pulling CLARCOR out, so what you see as the little bit of deterioration is CLARCOR related.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. You may begin.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Hi, just one question. I was curious, I know you're speaking encouragingly about some of your end customers, end demand, not just stocking. But just so we can kind of baseline where do you feel we're launching into fiscal 2018 guide, if the order rates stayed where they are, the comps do get a little bit harder, but I'm just trying to understand, where are the orders exiting fiscal 2017 on a year-over-year basis if we just run it sequentially flat for the quarter?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","David, it's Tom. We can't predict it at this point. I mean I know everybody would like me to start talking about FY 2018 in April, but FY 2018 is hard enough to talk about in August. So we'll give you the color on that, we just started our process internally. So, I'm going to just ask you to wait until we get to August.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Well that's why I asked it the way I did, I wasn't asking for a prediction, I was asking current levels, run straight out flat sequentially, where would we exit the year?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Really, so I mean, have to go do that math, but part of it'll be (43:15) doing that math, but also, we'll be talking to our customers, looking at economic forecasts. So, it's not just trying to take current quarter and projecting it out and comparing it to prior periods. It's actually looking and understanding end demand and what's going on. So, we will do that, but that's not the only factor that will influence it.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Well \u2013 I mean, again just mathematically, the comp gets a little harder, right, negative 6 a year ago for this quarter, it's negative 1 comp next quarter, and you can double stack it, however you want to look at it. But I'm just trying to get a feel, we're up 8%, or especially the Industrial business is up 9% and 13%. If I can just maintain this level, comp actually gets a little easier in North America, a little harder internationally. I'm just trying to make sure we manage expectations, but also understand the launch for 2018 CLARCOR side, the core business, again it's hard \u2013 you have the exact numbers, but it would seem like Industrial, the orders would still be running up, call it, high single digit at a minimum on the two Industrial businesses, Aero obviously it's over 12 months, a little harder comp analysis there, but is that a fair assessment? And again, it is just the math, and if you want to talk offline, that's fine, I'm just trying to understand for modeling 2018, should at least, talking the Industrial businesses, the orders just being flat sequentially, should launch into 2018, up high-single digit?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","David, I think the best approach would be take it offline. You and Robin and Ryan can talk about in the follow-up call.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","All right. Appreciate that. Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. You may begin.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Hi, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can we go back to CLARCOR again, just talking about the synergies, I know you're just working through everything, but when we did our bottom-up analysis, the one assessment we made was that there probably wasn't that much opportunity on the purchasing or strategic sourcing side. Could you maybe describe to us where we could be wrong on that or where do you think the opportunities will be? I know you don't want to break into buckets some of the other synergy opportunities, but at least on the strategic sourcing side, just give us a little bit more color there? And at least whether you think there's some overlap that you can achieve savings?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Ann. This is Tom. We actually think the supply chain side has a tremendous amount of synergies because CLARCOR is a very decentralized company similar to us. However, they ran a very decentralized buying organization. So they didn't leverage any of their spend or very little of the spend across their various businesses. So, you've got leverage there, first, just by itself. But then combining it with our spend as well, you have that aggregation. So, we see big upside. And I think all of you know, we've been careful on breaking the buckets up, because obviously, some of those buckets are sensitive to how you \u2013 how we would disclose these things. But you can rest assured, we have a very finite detail by major cost bucket and supply chain being one of the largest actually, and it's the natural things you would think of. The Win Strategy initiatives, corporate SG&A, supply chain, leveraging the manufacturing capabilities for both of our companies. And the advantage here is not just looking at one isolated, it's the combination, so looking at both of our manufacturing capabilities and leveraging that. And just part of how we did \u2013 we did this with our own insight and what's really been great is now with the CLARCOR team's viewpoint, and we've been spot on as far as in agreement as what we think we need to do, which has been very encouraging.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And is there a point in time where you will at least break out the buckets, at least on the strategic sourcing side, I know you said it's a major part of the $140 million, will you break that out for us at any point?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","I think what we'll certainly do is every quarter, starting in August we'll give you the projection that we think we'll do for that fiscal year as far as cost to achieve, then the synergies that we're going to get and then we'll update how we're doing every quarter against that.","The supply chain savings, I am not worried about disclosing that, so if that's something in particular that you'd like to see, we can provide more detail. I also don't want to scatter the herd on my suppliers either, so we'll have to think about how much of that we actually do. But the team on the phone has to \u2013 you have to be very confident that we have this down to a very finite detail by major bucket. There is various sensitivities as you disclose that, that we'll just have to consider, but certainly we're going to give you the total and how we're tracking against it.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate that and I appreciate you not wanting to tip your hand to your suppliers, that's certainly understandable. Can you just talk \u2013 spend a little bit finally about the one month. You're one month in, you're probably talking to the CLARCOR team well before that. Has there been any upside surprise, anything that you've learned in the short time that you've owned CLARCOR that maybe you hadn't anticipated prior to the acquisition?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Ann, it's Tom again. I guess the encouraging thing is there's been no negative surprises, it's all been positive reinforcement and affirmation of the assumptions we made. And I am very pleased with the leadership talent and the strength of the organization. I am pleased with the cultural fit, I am pleased with the fact that both teams are working as one. When I look at these synergies and there's been a lot of buy-in as to what we have to do to make both of our filtration businesses, the best filtration business in the world. So \u2013 and I'm knocking on wood, I couldn't be happier with the start.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there, and get back in line. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. You may begin.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc","Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Just \u2013 I want to go back to this tax issue just to clarify something. Can you confirm that your adjusted tax rate in the quarter was just under 25%, first and foremost?","And then I guess related to this, I'm trying to figure out, why the step-up sequentially in the fourth quarter in the tax rate? And whether or not, we should be really thinking about this number to migrating actually quite a bit lower than 27% for the year as a whole going forward?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Sure, Mig. Yes, you're correct in that our effective rate for the third quarter was 24.7%. And we are forecasting a higher rate in Q4, and that's really driven by \u2013 we have a lot of \u2013 a fair amount of the acquisition related expenses that we're incurring are going to be \u2013 are not tax deductible. So we're expecting to have to finish the year at an overall effective rate higher than what you saw come through in Q3, reflecting those non-deductible expenses, and also a little bit of shift in mix between U.S. and foreign.","You're right in that there will be upside to the rate if we have a heavy amount of stock option exercises at the current stock price, it's likely going to be a nice credit for us, but we just have no way of forecasting how much that might be.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc","All right. That's helpful. Thank you. And maybe to ask a demand question, when I'm looking at your various technology platforms that you're reporting, I'm looking at motion systems expense, for instance. That platform is down, call it, 20% versus the peak from a couple of years ago. How do you think about demand progression over the next few years? Really what I'm trying to get at is in order to get the prior peaks, what do we need to see in terms of volumes from OEMs versus maybe some other things that are internal initiatives for you such as market share gains, new products, things of this sort?","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","So Mig, it's Lee. I think when you think about motion systems, some of the big drivers in there are really around those natural resource end markets. So, think about construction equipment, mining, even land-based oil and gas. And I think what's encouraging is, globally, we're seeing a significant rebound on those. So, it's been a big driver of what's happening in China. So, it is trending in the way of getting us back to where we've been.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from (52:22) with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question about the longer term segment margin target. You've expressed confidence about this in the past. Obviously, this is before CLARCOR. So, I guess are you willing to comment on potential areas for upside to this goal, or perhaps if you don't want to comment at this time, is this something we should be looking for, I don't know, in the coming months as we think about fiscal 2018 guidance?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. Millie (52:47), it's Tom. Well, first of all, when we set those targets, they were top quartile performance threshold for our peer group and that continues to be a good number. I am very happy to relook at that number once we've achieved it. I don't want to de-motivate the team by moving it before we've actually achieved it. So, we're going to achieve it first, we're going to obviously continue to drive continuous improvement and we'll also look at what top quartile is running at that time because we see our abilities to continue to get more profitable all the time, but we're not going to move the 17% target until we actually achieve it.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Understood. And then I guess just as a quick follow-up. More of a clarification, I think, you mentioned price cost a little bit earlier in the Q&A session. I just want to clarify, you said, you don't think that that's going to be a challenge as the year goes on?","Lee C. Banks - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Millie (53:40), it's Lee. I mean, price cost absolutely is a challenge but I don't think it's going to be a challenge for us in terms of affecting margin. So, we've seen escalation in some key commodities, but we've also been able to realize price in certain parts of our channel. So we track our cost input, that's our PPI index and we track our kind of our sales number which is our selling price index and we've got a positive GAAP between the two and we expect that to continue going forward.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. You may begin.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to get a sense of \u2013 as you look at the simplification outside of anything in CLARCOR, just \u2013 where do you think you are in that? How far along that spectrum have you progressed? And is 2018 like a bigger year potentially than 2017 in terms of the cost you can take out? Just how you're looking at that broader transition that you're doing?","Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Joe, it's Tom. Again, I'd characterize it as early days still. There's some things that we moved out more on division consolidations and those type of things. But we'll continue to look at that and we'll certainly update you on the plans we might have there in the future. But the bigger area that has, I think, the most upside is that whole revenue complexity that looking at the product line simplification, that last couple percent of revenue and the complexity associated with that want to service our customer to make it faster and better experience for them, but also to redesign our organization and our processes and SG&A cost that supports that.","So I am very encouraged because every time we look at that, I still see tremendous upside. That part that I just described, the product line complexity is hard work, I've described this as hand-to-hand combat, you got to go part number by part number to go through that. So that's why I characterize that it's still very early days because a company of our size with the number of part numbers, there's still a lot of work we're doing and we're very active on that, and I think you'll see that'd be a contributor for margin expansion for multiple years.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then on the \u2013 I think, you mentioned earlier today, $30 million you're planning on savings that are in guidance from the $48 million that you're spending this year. Is that like a realized $30 million for this year, like what's the exit rate and how much of that spilled over?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. That's a real number. We are benefiting $30 million this year and certainly that carries over and we will see some rollover full year impact from the initiatives we've done this year.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Of that $30 million, like how much have you done through three quarters and maybe that will kind of frame into next year?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. The majority of that is tail-end of the year, because some of the initiatives that we've done, it is \u2013 it takes time to see the benefit of it, so heavily weighted towards the second half of the year.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. You may begin.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, just a couple housekeeping items on CLARCOR as you get it closed. I think you said $163 million in amortization, is that still a good number? And as you kind of put together your debt, how did the debt costs come out relative to your initial assumption?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","So, that $163 million was our initial estimate, but actually we're seeing that much lower, it's $130 million a year as we have preliminary \u2013 preliminarily estimated the beginning balance sheet, and we're still fine-tuning that and it may tweak slightly as we finish the fourth quarter. But right now, we're estimating a $130 million a year.","The debt costs also came in lower. We were estimating additional interest expense of about $100 million, and that's now solidly in the books at $73 million incremental per year as we were able to get better rates on the bonds that we sold.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just within the 13% order growth in international, where do you get kind of place where Asia, Europe and LatAm were either exactly or directionally?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Sure, Jeff. We're seeing for Europe mid-single digits; Asia Pacific is mid-teens; and Latin America also in the mid-teen range.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. You may begin.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning, all. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick fill-ins. Cathy, is there any type of shorter term step-up amortization that we should be thinking about that rolls off kind of quickly versus the longer term step that will be with us for a while?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah, good question, Steve, I'm glad you asked. So, in the number of one-off acquisition related expenses is the gross up of the value of the inventory that we bought from CLARCOR, that's about $39 million, and that will roll through cost of sales over a three-month period. So, we incurred one-third of that in March and we'll incur the rest of it in April and May and then that rolls off.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So, just sort of thinking about that, if you're sort of in a $0.04 accretion for the fourth quarter, the number in 2018 would be higher than that because you wouldn't have the step-up accretion?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. But keep in mind that we have adjusted that out. So, the accretion that we're telling you has taken the impact of that out.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","So the $0.04 take that out already?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","The $0.04 is the run rate, correct.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then totally unrelated, but I'm just curious, I think you guys probably have a reasonable amount of visibility in Aerospace business and we sort of ticked down to zero and I know it's very chunky on a quarter-to-quarter basis with respect to orders, but does that business grow next year and as you see the programs come down the pike, how do we think about that in sort of in the next couple of years?","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Yeah. We still anticipate growth in Aerospace. What you see in the zero order rate for the 12-month rolling now in March \u2013 as of March 31, we had a pretty significant military OEM order come through in January of 2016, it was a multiyear order. That has now dropped from the numerator into the denominator causing tough comparables. So, it's a little bit of a misnomer. It's a little bit deceiving to see that flat. We do anticipate continued growth. We're seeing nice improvement these days in the MRO, especially the military MRO business. Commercial OEM is a little down year-over-year, but commercial MRO is strong. So, military good, commercial struggling a little bit in the OE side, but strong in the aftermarket side.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. I appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Cathy Suever for closing remarks.","Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.","Okay, thanks, Shannon. This concludes our Q&A and our earnings call. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Robert and Ryan will be available throughout the day to take your call should you have any further questions. Thank you everyone.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct and question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's Mr. Jon Marten, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Marten you may begin.","Jon Marten","Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's first quarter FY '17 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks. Today's presentation slides, together with the audio webcast replay, will be accessible on the company's Investor Information Web site at phstock.com for one year following today's call.","On Slide 2, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements, as well as our non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any references to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and are posted on Parker's Web site at phstock.com.","Turning to Slide 3, toady's agenda is outlined. To begin our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams will provide highlights for the first quarter of fiscal year '17. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's first quarter, FY '17 performance together with the guidance for FY '17. Tom will then provide a few summary comments, and then we'll open the call for a Question & Answer session.","At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to Slide 4.","Tom Williams","Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I'd like to share highlights of our first quarter results, comment on our fiscal year 2017 guidance. And finally share progress we are making with the new win strategy.","Before I get into the financial highlights of the quarter first I\u2019d like to talk about the safety. Keeping people safe is our first priority and as such we start our meetings at Parker with the discussion on safety. So I thought I\u2019d start our earnings call with safety as well.","During the first quarter of 2017 we are able to reduce our recordable injuries by 35% compared to the prior year. This builds upon a 33% year over year improvement we posted comparing 2016 versus 2015. And actually we have a long way to go, to reach our goal of zero accidents. But I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. Safety is important because, not only does it protect our people but also because great safety performance typically leads to great financial performance. ","Now to the financial highlights of our first quarter results. First quarter sales were 2.74 billion, a 4% declined compared with the same quarter year ago. This represents the third consecutive quarter we saw a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis. Nearly all the decline in sales this quarter was organic.","Total order rates in the first quarter increased 2% compared with the same last year on easier comparisons. This represented the first quarterly increase in order since December 2014. By segment, North America is still weak but slowly recovering and our aerospace systems segment and international business order rates were positive. These order rates reinforced our previously communicated view that we\u2019re progressing towards stabilization in many of our key markets.","However we will continue to monitor order trends closely to ensure that this outlook is holding up. Net income for the first quarter increased 8% to 2010 million on an as reported basis or $218 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share were $1.55 as reported or $1.61 on an adjusted basis. A 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share, compared with the same quarter last year. Despite soft market conditions, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 15.0% or 15.4% adjusted. ","This is another quarter of solid performance and represents a 10 base point improvement, year-over-year in the adjusted segment operating margins. Our decremented margin return on sales or MROS was 3.9% for the first quarter or 12.7% on an adjusted basis. This really is outstanding performance and marks the seventh consecutive quarter. That our adjusted decremented have been below 30%.","It was another strong quarter for cash flow, cash flow from operations, excluding a discretionary pension contribution, was 12% of sales, reflecting our ability to be a consistent generator of cash through economic cycles. During the quarter we've repurchased $115 million in Parker's stock, this completes the previous announced commitment to buyback a minimum of $2 billion in Parker\u2019s shares of October 2016. Going forward our plan is to be a great generator of cash and a great deplorer of cash, in a way that generates increased long term returns for our shareholders.","Now regarding FY17 guidance. We continue to forecasting a year of flat sales compared with 2016. For 2017 we are maintaining guidance or as-reported earnings in the range of $6.15 to $6.85 per share or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10, or middle point at $6.75. Business realignment expenses are still anticipated to be approximately $0.25 per share in fiscal 2017. ","So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We will continue to make meaningful progress across initiatives across four broad goals, engaging people, premier customer experience, profitable growth, and financial performance.","Our ongoing execution with new Win Strategy through its first full year implementation gives me even more confidence that we can achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of our 150 basis points. Higher then a rate of global industrial products. We\u2019re also targeting 17% segment operating margins and progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compounding of growth rate and earnings per share of 8% over this 5 year period. These performance targets will allow us to deliver sustainable, long term value of Parker team members, our customers and our shareholders.","I\u2019ll now hand things back Jon to review more details on the quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance.","Jon Marten","Thanks, Tom. And at this time please refer to Slide 5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.","Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.61 versus $1.52 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.09. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.06, which compares to $0.11 for the same quarter last year. On Slide 6 we review the influences on the adjusted earnings per share for Q1 versus Q1 of FY '16. We had earnings per share of $1.52 for the first quarter FY '16 and $1.61 for first quarter of this year, increase to adjusted earnings per share include a reduction of corporate G&A expense which totaled $0.11 per share.","A lower effective tax rate of 28.1% versus 29.2% in Q1 of FY '16, lower interest expense and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company share re-purchase activity which equated to an increase of $0.07 per share, a reduction of $0.08 per share and income was a result of the lower adjusted segment operating income driven by weakened end market topline demand as projected while higher other expense equated to a reduction of $0.01 per share.","Moving to Slide 7, with the review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the first quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 4.6% over the same quarter last year. There was nominal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions and minimal currency impact. Total company segment operating margins for the first quarter adjusted for realignment cost incurred in the quarter was 15.4% versus 15.3% for the same quarter last year.","Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $11 million versus $22 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $422 million versus $438 million last year reflects the impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from the company's simplification and restructuring actions.","Moving to Slide 8, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the first quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 9% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was no impact from acquisitions and nominal impact from currency in the quarter.","Operating margin for the first quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 17.5% of sales versus 17.2% in the prior year. Business realignment expense incurred totaled $4 million, as compared to $8 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $205 million, as compared to $221 million, driven by the reduced volume as a result of those same key industrial end markets.","I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial Segment on Slide 9. Organic sales for the first quarter in the industrial international segment decreased by 3.2%, acquisition positively impacted sales by 0.9%, while there was no impact from currency. Operating margins for the first quarter adjusted for business, realignment cost was 14.2% of sales versus 13.6% in the prior year.","Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled 7 million as compared to 12 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was 144 million as compared to 141 million which despite the weakened topline reflects the offsetting savings resulting from the realignment actions taken in the current and prior fiscal years.","I\u2019ll now move to Slide 10 to review the Aerospace System segment. Organic revenues increased 3.1% for the quarter, neither acquisitions nor currency impacted revenues, growth in military OEM, commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance as compared to the prior year.","Operating margin for the first quarter adjusted for realignment cost was 13.1% of sales versus 13.9% in the prior year. No business realignment expenses were incurred in the quarter, compared to 2 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was 73 million as compared to 76 million reflecting the timing impact of higher development cost during the quarter.","Moving to Slide 11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The diversified industrial segment report on a three month rolling average while aerospace systems are based on a 12 month rolling average. Total orders improved to positive 2% for the quarter end reflecting easing year ago comparisons and a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets.","Diversified industrial North America orders decrease year-over-year to negative four, diversified industrial international orders increased modestly year-over-year to a positive three and Aerospace Systems orders increased year-over-year to a positive 14%.","On Slide 12, we report cash flow from operations. For the first quarter cash flow from operating activities was 114 million or 4.2% of sales, this compares to 0.7% of sales with the same period last year. When adjusted with $220 million discretionary pension contribution we made in the quarter cash for operating activities was 12.2% of sales. This compares to 7.7% of sales for the same period last year, adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution in May last year.","The significant uses of cash during the quarter were the $220 million for the discretionary pension plan contribution, $150 million for the Company's repurchase of common shares, and 85 million for the payment of shareholder dividends. 33 million for CapEx, equating to 1.2% of sales for the quarter is also called out.","Turning to Slide 13, the full year earnings guidance for '17 is outlined. The guidance has been provided on both an as reported and an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of 48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY17. This is the only item for which we are adjusting. ","Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Organic growth at the midpoint is nearly flat and acquisitions and the guidance are expected to positively impact sales by 8.4% currency and guidance is expected to have a modestly positive 0.3% impact on sales. We have calculated the impact on currency to spot rates as of September 30, 2016, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming balance FY17.","For Total Parker as reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.8% and 15.2%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be 15.2 -- to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. The guided midpoint on each range compares favorably to FY16 margins, 13.9% on an as reported basis and 14.8% on an adjusted basis in FY16.","The guidance for below the line items, which includes corporate G&A interest in other expense is 478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at 28.5%, the average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 135.5 million. ","For the full year, the guidance range on an as reported earnings per share basis is $6.15 to $6.85 or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is $6.40 to $7.10 or $6.75 at the midpoint. This as reported EPS guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be incurred in FY17.","The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be 30 million and are fully reflected in both the as reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges. We would ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for proposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison.","Some additional key assumptions for fiscal year 2017 guidance are sales divided 48% first half, 52% second half. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 45% first half, 55% second half. EPS first half is $2.96 and $3.79 and the midpoint, that\u2019s first half versus second half. And Q2 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be a $1.36 per share at the midpoint and this excludes $0.10 of business realignment expenses expected to be incurred in our Q2.","On Slide 14, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY17 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY17 EPS of $6.75 per share, increases include $0.05 from lower corporate G&A and $0.05 from the lower tax rate.","The key component of the decrease includes a $0.10 per share reduction from higher other and interest expense, please remember that this forecast excludes any acquisitions and divestitures that might close during FY17.","This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you for our summary comments.","Tom Williams","Thanks, Jon. I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve started 2017 on such a positive note. I would like to thank the appropriate team members around the world for their efforts. Not only have we made meaningful progress with initiatives designed to improve margins, but we\u2019ve also taken great strides to strengthen and sustain our business and better serve our customers. We\u2019re positioned well for the rest of this year and beyond under the framework provided by the Win Strategy. I look forward to sharing more with you as always as the progresses.","And at this time, we are ready to take questions. So Andrew if you could help to get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open.","Nathan Jones","I think I would like to talk a little bit about cash generation and cash usage today, very, very strong cash flow quarter in what I don't think is normally an overly strong cash flow quarter. I think for as long as I have followed Parker your target has been 10% of sales converted into free cash flow. Is the new Win Strategy an execution of that structurally changing that target and should we think about cash generation being some number higher than 10 going forward?","Tom Williams","Nathan, this is Tom. 10% has been our historical target, it\u2019s still the target. But what we\u2019ve done as far as determining that target is what\u2019s top quartile against our peer group. And it happened to be when we set that goal years ago 10% was top quartile and as we benchmark it today 10% is still top quartile. Now obviously as we continue to raise margins, which is our goal, we should continue to be even better performing, but the goal is to be top quartile, we happen to be a pretty consistent performer in being top quartile on cash and I think you look forward for us continue to do that.","Nathan Jones","Okay, fair enough. And then the $2 billion share repurchase is complete. The commitment that Don made a couple of years ago there is complete. The balance sheet is still pretty robust, you've still got plenty of capacity there. How should we think about your approach to M&A versus share repurchase going forward from here?","Tom Williams","Hey, Nathan, it\u2019s Tom again. So we obviously look at both of those all the time on a dynamic basis with the goal of making the best long term value creation decision for our shareholders. So I would characterize the pipeline right now as far as acquisitions you know being fairly active, as always acquisitions are lumpy and hard to product as far as the [technical difficulty].","And I think what is normally -- what historically in the last couple of years has slowed us down as far as converting more acquisitions has been the price valuation gap and what we are seeing now and I hope would hope over the next couple of years we\u2019ll continue to see this even more is, I think sellers expectations coming closer to reality and I think that price gap that we experienced will become closer and I think properties will become more actionable.","So we will continue to look at share repurchase and acquisitions and make the best decision every quarter on behalf of our shareholders. On the share repurchase, just as opposed to pre-announcing we\u2019ll continue to be active and as I\u2019ve said before on these calls what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll communicate after the fact. We think that\u2019s the best value creating for our shareholders. We won\u2019t be buying into our own wind and you\u2019ll see us be active.","Like I mentioned in my opening comments, our goal is to be great generator of cash and we will continue to be even better at that, but we want to be great deployers of cash and put into work. Now the $2 billion that you mentioned Nathan that\u2019s sitting there, just to would remind I think most people realize this, is that 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. And so there is certain constrains or factors that you have the weigh when you think about how to deploy that and trying to deployed it in a most tax efficient manner on the benefit of our shareholders.","So we will look at that, we obviously want to put it to work but there is factors you have to consider on that cash that is sitting overseas.","Nathan Jones","Okay, thanks very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Andrew Obin","Just a question, we are seeing improvement in energy prices and I was just wondering if you could give us some more color if you guys are seeing any impact on backlog or discussions with your customers?","Lee Banks","Andrew this is Lee Banks here. I would characterize the oil and gas pretty much as we characterized it last call. So year-over-year it's still down. There is certainly is an increase in rig counts taking place, but I would characterized it as almost basically at the bottom with a lot of choppiness taken place in the market. So there is no real catalyst for a significant change at this point in time.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up on M&A, I have literally had discussions where people are using negative interest rates for a cost of funding for deals. What is the equation between the prices and cost of capital is working in this environment? Are people getting more reasonable given where macro is and how does it balance the fact that you can borrow at almost nothing?","Tom Williams","Andrew, its Tom. I think the gap I was refereeing to on valuation has been more of sellers continue to use whatever crop pre 2008 mentality as far as forecasting sales based on, we buy properties that we know and understand, we buy things within our space and we have divisions that are in the same space. So we see what the market and our growth rates are and typically there has been disconnect in that.","I see that disconnect getting closer which allows things to be more actionable, now your point as far as how we decide to look at the financing side of things, we\u2019re disciplined, we do a disconnect cash flow, we have a certain discount rate that we look at. We have returned criteria's that we considered. And this is all to the benefit of creating value for our shareholders and how we look at that analysis. I think we are very contemporary, we try to look at that in the current environment, so it will be reflective of what's going on in the real world. So I think we will continue to do that robust review.","Andrew Obin","Thank you, very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Nice quarter. Two questions. One, Tom or Jon, I'm just trying to one, get a better understanding of the margin guidance in International given the performance that you put up in the first quarter given that you actually had a sales decline and your sales for the year are assuming positive growth. So I would assume you would get more leverage there. So if you could just give a little color there.","And then my second question is just on the order front, I guess I was pleasantly surprised that North American declines are lessening and we saw another positive order number out of international on a tougher comp. So can you give a sense of your comfort level that the OE channel is clear or when North American orders should start to inflict positively? Is that in the second half of the year? And then whether you expect the strength in international to continue or when that starts to inflect even better? Thanks.","Jon Marten","Yes, Jamie. A quick answer from me, this is Jon on the margin guidance here for international. We did it up 10 basis points, we are showing as we made in commentary, a little bit of a better overview in the Q1 and guidance going forward there. We see great progress as a result of our restructuring actions and our simplification ability here in the company wide internationally also. And so we found it was prudent to just move that up 10 basis points and we are really pleased with how we are performing there.","Jamie Cook","But, Jon, your margins in the remaining nine months of the year implied margins are lower than the first quarter, but we\u2019ll get sales growth?","Jon Marten","Well, what we are going to do there is that as we look at the mix as the year goes on Jamie, we have a very slight change in the mix going forward here. So we are trying to make sure that we get the best guidance out there. Please keep in mind that there are some seasonal impacts here for going forward here that we are going to see in our Q2, that\u2019s kind of indicated in our guidance too. And that one have an impact on the international margins in our Q2 and as typical in that beginning up our Q3 also.","Jamie Cook","I'm sorry. What is the mix issue? Is it just more OE or can you just give color on that?","Jon Marten","Well, it would be more of an ability as we look at some of the in rows that we are making and some of our businesses in Asia as well as in Europe making new wins getting more business and we are seeing good increases in our sales there for as -- much better than we had projected and that is really helping us to get more business and -- but that OE versus the aftermarket mix here is having a very, very slight impact.","Jamie Cook","Okay sorry, then just a question on the order inflections for North American International?","Lee Banks","Yes Jamie, it's Lee. I am going to answer your question and pivot on that too, and just give some color on the markets around the world. I think it's important too, for just everybody on the call to just go back a quarter and how we characterize the micro environment as we gave guidance in FY17. And what we talked about was basically we figured this to be a year where most of our market declines that we saw when we decelerate and eventually make it back or close to the flat.","And we forecasted growth to be soft in Q1 as you remember, essentially flat in Q2. And then we\u2019d see some small organic growth in year-over-year basis in the second half of the year. And we gave guidance last quarter, we put the markets in three buckets positive which would be positive year-over-year growth for our FY17, neutral and then -- which would be neutral and then negative.","So it really hasn\u2019t been much change from any of that. When I think about positive, we\u2019re still bullish on aerospace, we talked about refrigeration, air conditioning, semicon, and telecom. We continue to see strong activity in all those areas.","On a neutral front, we talked about automotive, we talked about power generation in rail. And I think the one thing that we talked about, which it really was a positive in our mind that we saw distribution moving to neutral, and what we see, we\u2019re on track to do that. And I\u2019ll comment on North America too for you when. And then negative year over year, which is consistent, it is decelerating for sure.","But whole natural resource and markets construction, farm and ag, forestry, marine, mining, and oil and gas. All have -- still have headwinds to them and then heavy duty truck, which we talked about. So having said that the organic growth for the quarter really largely moved in the direction as we expected from the last call.","Just touching on North America and distribution. We saw it\u2019s down low single digits, it\u2019s really in line with the expectations that saw. It\u2019s definitely reaching all those people impacted by natural resource end markets are still suffering and there are still some tough comps, if you remember back Q1 last year, this time for some of these people. What I was encouraged about, is roughly every 4 years we hold a channel meeting in North America with our filed power channel. ","And I just came back from a meeting with 400 principals representing this channel across North America. And I have to tell you, I spent two days just going from top to bottom networking, with everybody there and I left mildly encouraged, certainly not depressed about prospects moving forward. As you would expect areas like the great lakes regions are having positive year-on-year growth. People in the oil patch were still suffering, but it\u2019s not that accelerating rate of decline there is more talk about some positive trends possibly happening here in FY17, so that was good.","If I talked about industrial markets in North America, you have to talk about oil and gas. And I would say major OEMs continue to indicate no significant investment, but do get a sense of there if there is a little bit a light at the end of tunnel and there are some talks about some projects happening going forward.","Energy markets is another one that we like, overall the large frame turbines was flat year over year but, I\u2019ve talked about this in the past, that we\u2019ve had some good specifications wins there, our content is up, so we\u2019ve seen some strong numbers from that sector for us.","And then in the mobile markets in North America, we continue to see year over year declines in off-highway construction, equipment off-highway farming and ag, industrial trucks, material handling and railroad equipment. ","I\u2019d say one market that was a little worse then we forecasted was heavy trucks and trailers. That was a little bit of a headwind for us. And then I would say the automotive market is a little worse and really I\u2019m talking about light truck there. And I think a lot of it has to do with there was some extended summer shutdowns in some of those sectors that impacted us. But when we look at it going forward, we still feel very positive about it for the year.","I\u2019m going to get to international orders, Jamie. I haven't forgotten you\u2019re here. So when I talk about EMEA distribution, I would say again it\u2019s a same story. If you talk about oil and gas regions, if they have a large negative year over year impact. We continue to see great growth in some of the emerging regions, but I\u2019ll say a little bit of headwinds in some of the political unrest in Turkey, which cost us in the quarter, we see that coming back. And then oil and gas still tough year-over-year comps, but we are seeing some positive activity on some project business outside of Western Europe.","General Industrial, Middle East has been strong for us. There is a lot of projects going on, result of their economic diversification efforts. So we\u2019ve had some great project wins there and then in the mobile sector, we are seeing some positive news in Europe and with off-highway construction equipment and heavy trucks and just getting some positive year-over-year input from our customers. So Europe largely for international order standpoint largely moved in the direction that we thought it would for the quarter.","For Asia-Pacific we were encouraged by another strong quarter of year-over-year entry. So it accelerated from last quarter moved in the direction that we thought. Distribution was strong, we\u2019ve got a big footprint expansion going on as part of our new win strategy and we like what\u2019s happening there. And we\u2019ve really seen very strong growth in India and Southeast Asia.","Industrially we are up in almost all end markets. So if I highlight machinery product power generation semiconductor, telecom all grew positive in Asia-Pacific. And then in mobile, I\u2019ve highlighted this before in the past, but high-speed rail continues to be a bright spot for us. Through some specification wins. We are doing very well there. And really increases in most segments in mobile off-highway construction again very low levels obviously, heavy duty truck farm and ag.","And then Latin America, another international component, again another second quarter of strong order entry year-over-year from an extremely depressed level, but we\u2019re encouraged by what\u2019s happening there it\u2019s been the first positive movement sometime. So when we think about countries like Brazil, coming back that\u2019s a positive for us.","So international order entry accelerated stayed relatively in line, but if we thought in Europe accelerated in Asia, accelerated Latin America.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you. That was very helpful. I will get back in queue.","Lee Banks","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Can we just take a step back for a moment. I missed what you said about Turkey. Did you say Turkey was improving or Turkey was a bit of a headwind? You were talking about political activity.","Lee Banks","I was a little bit of disruptive there when all the political unrest was taking place, but it appears to us to be getting back in line and it was really some distribution business that went soft on us for a period of time.","Ann Duignan","Okay, that is helpful. And then Lat-Am orders accelerating. Can you just talk about where exactly you are seeing the demand? Is it distribution? Is it truck? Just a little bit of color in terms of specifically by market or by region?","Tom Williams","Yeah, I mean these are all very low level. So I don\u2019t want to mischaracterize what\u2019s happening there, but truck has been positive, construction equipment and really farm and ag has been the positive.","Ann Duignan","Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on your guidance. The dollar has strengthened against the euro by 4% since the end of the quarter. And I know you said you expect your outlook based on September 30 exchange rates. If you were to do your exchange rates as of today, would you have changed your revenue guidance?","Jon Marten","Ann this is Jon. I think yes I mean given that track and we have a pattern of a going through and using September 30. We will see how that kind of plays itself out for the balance of the year, but with the strengthening the dollar today I think that it would have an impact on the guidance very slightly.","Ann Duignan","Okay, I appreciate it. I will get back in line. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","First, I guess my first question, there has been a lot of concern especially as we have been exiting September that things in Industrial have started to get a little bit worse. And so I'm just curious whether you can provide any color on how things trended in the quarter and specifically that back half of September which has been a hot topic of conversation with folks?","Tom Williams","Joe its Tom. So through the quarter what we saw was that North America orders get less negative, which is a good thing and seeing it progress sequentially that way to the quarter. Internationally and aerospace we are relatively consistent through the quarter. In October we haven\u2019t seen I think that\u2019s unusual and October is consistent with what we\u2019ve put in the guidance.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Helpful, Tom. And then maybe just given that the earnings number came in a little bit better than expected, Tom, you kind of kept the guidance range wide for the year. I think historically you guys have kind of narrowed in the first quarter. Just curious what your thoughts were around that especially just given the fact that order trends have gotten a little bit better?","Tom Williams","Yes, two things. One and maybe I will talk about the width of guidance, maybe people didn't pick up. We start -- we did this year in August different than what we have done historically. If you go back and look at our August guidance typically had a much wider range, so we started off the year with a more narrower than traditional range in August and we just kept that the same for the third quarter.","So that part of it is really the starting point. And as far as keeping it consistent, when you look at what happened to the quarter, so we met the guide at the operating income level and the good thing about what happened in the quarters is we had slightly less sales, but we had better operating margins so we ended up delivering the operating income to our guide which was a testament really to the team around the world doing a fantastic job on that. We got some help below the line with some discrete one off things that are not going to repeat.","So we felt that with the mix holding it flat made sense and holding it flat especially in today's environment with the macro environment being I would still say fairly uncertain, but we are encouraged with the fact that our orders turned positive. I would like to see a little bit more data before we get too far ahead of ourselves.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That makes sense. Maybe one last follow-up and this is specifically on the below the line items in the guide. I know you guys made a voluntary pension contribution. I assume that was going to be a little bit of a tailwind to your earnings number for this year, but it looks like your corporate number has gone up. And so what is the natural offset there?","Jon Marten","Yes I think the -- first of all it\u2019s not a big tailwind, but it is a slight few cent tailwind there with that additional contribution that we made. Going on below the line, what would be going the other way as Tom has talked about and many of our different venues over the last several quarters. Our investments in R&D, our investments in ecommerce, our investments in IOT, and the kinds of things that we needed to in order to improve on our well customer experience is really driving the additional expenses here that are helping to offset that $0.05 or so impact that were getting from the additional pension contribution that we made. So I hope that helps you Jon.","Joe Ritchie","It's helpful Jon. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","On the quarter could you give a little bit more color on the benefit to operating profit from restructuring and simplification?","Tom Williams","Andy, this is Tom. Maybe I will start strategically and I will let Jon add with the details in the quarter. But with simplification, the strategy here is really there is four elements of it and we\u2019ve have a focus I would say initially, if you would envision simplification as kind of being an iceberg, the tip of iceberg was division consolidations that was kind of the natural thing out of the gate that we have did. But the bigger part of simplification was underneath that, it's going to product line complex, revenue complexity, organization design work, process changes that we\u2019ll do related to that revenue complexity and there is good old-fashioned bureaucracy.","So we are very encouraged because if you remember simplification is geared more at the strategic SG&A type of restructuring. So we made a lot of progress, but I think this is very early days and that\u2019s a part of why you have seen from an operating margin standpoint why we perform so efficiently in the last several quarters, and why our decrementals have held up so well. But specifically within the quarter Jon has something more to add on that.","Jon Marten","Well the only thing that I would say on specifically in the quarter here is, we had $0.06 in restructuring that we actually book. We are going to see about -- we are maintaining our right guidance for the year and we are maintaining our saving that we have projected when we put our guidance together which is about 20% of the savings that we are going to get in the first half for the year.","So it kind of came right in along with our expectations, our actual restructuring that we booked in the quarter was a little bit lighter, few cents lighter than what we have projected in the guidance, it's actually $0.03 lighter than what we have projected in that guidance. But we are very pleased with our progress and we are maintaining that projection through the balance of the year.","Andy Casey","Okay, thanks, Jon and Tom. If I step back a little bit from the quarter and look at the 2020 goals, you have mentioned confidence in achieving those. If I just isolate the 17% operating margin goal, can you comment on whether you can get there if the market stabilization happens but the markets kind of stay flat after that? Or do you need some end market growth in addition to the 150 basis point outgrowth that you are targeting?","Tom Williams","It's Tom again. So what we project including the 150 bips greater than the market is a 1.5% CAGR. Now remember the CAGR starts in \u201915, so it went down from \u201915 to \u201816 which is why that doesn\u2019t sound like a really big number. So we go down because \u201915 all the natural resource that dollar but then \u201915 to \u201916 flatting from \u201916 to \u201917 and starting grow by -- this time we get to FY20. Our expectation is to grow 150 basis point faster in the market based on FY20 as an exit rate.","When you do the CAGR through that period of time it's 1.5%. So as a background, as long as the CAGR from \u201915 to \u201920 is a 100% CAGR we think we can get there 17% operating margin. Obviously if it\u2019s lower than that, that\u2019s does going to put challenges on it.","But I think that\u2019s a reasonable expectation given the macro environment, and our goal to gain share and all the other strategies we got around, the Win Strategy to grow fast in a market. So I think that\u2019s fairly reasonable and we feel very comfortable that we can pull that off.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joe Giordano","We have kind of touched on this but with the orders in North American Industrial getting slightly better on a comp basis, but the revenue was touched a little bit lower like 40 bps, did the order patterns even though it improved come in a little bit lighter than you might have thought?","Tom Williams","Joe, this is Tom so the sale gap that we have, which is very slight impacted, our guide around $40 million was pretty much equally dispersed between the three reporting segments, aerospace North America and international. So for Aerospace, it was little bit of biz jets softness helicopters, for North America a little softer, and heavy duty truck, automotive and little bit in the general industrial. Then international is mainly a little bit lighter in the Europe, then we had thought. But when you put it all together and based on their order trends that we\u2019ve see and in fact that order trends are moving in the path we had thought they were going to go, we are encouraged, which is why we left the sales guidance flat for the full year.","Joe Giordano","I guess I was just referring to just on the sales guidance for North America, was touched down a little bit from prior. And orders seem to be getting a little bit better so I didn't know if that specifically -- if the cadence there was a little bit different than you might have thought? ","Tom Williams","Now these are only slight differences, Joe. We are only down a total of -- for the time period of 19 million for the year going forward were not down, all that much. And so this is us going through each one of our end markets, each one of our business pulling them all together and then coming up with some guidance that makes sense. But I would not read anything into that. Our orders are trending, just the way that we thought that they would. And so therefore we are making just very slight change in the sales as we\u2019re projecting here in the guidance.","Joe Giordano","Fair enough. If I could just switch quickly to Aerospace for a bit, you mentioned the margins suffered a little bit from development costs. Can you maybe go into a little detail there? And then just two quarters in a row there 14% order growth and how much would you attribute that to comps getting progressively easier or are you seeing some real strength there?","Tom Williams","Well first on the development cost, I think from time to time, it\u2019s very hard to project these quarter by quarter here and so these are more timing issues than they are anything else. Now on the 14% for two quarters in a row. I want to again -- as you know and everybody on the call knows, we are reporting these numbers because it\u2019s long cycle business at a rolling 12 months average.","Now the long term growth rate that we can expect is what we\u2019ve seen almost in the Q1 from aerospace there sales up 3.1%, and our long term growth rate with them is going forward is going to be in the 4% range. And that is something that overall a next 3 or 4 or 5 year timeframe, we feel very confident in saying. So I want to just caution you that to not expect a 14% increase going forward. This has to do with the lumpiness of the orders and how they come in from our military and commercial customers. And the long term prospects are fantastic, but they are not at translating to sales at a 14% per year annum rate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephen Volkmann","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. I think, Lee, when you sort of went around the horn on all the end markets, I didn't hear you mention anything regarding distributor inventory levels and maybe stocking is kind of waning or something, but I don't want to put words in your mouth. Anything to comment on there?","Lee Banks","Steve, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big issue, I mean I\u2019m sure there are some pockets out there, that aren\u2019t apparent to me. But by and large that\u2019s not something when I talk to the channel people that we\u2019re worried about. I think a lot of that has worked its way out.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay, great. Maybe for Jon, it feels like we are sort of tweaking down the guidance I guess for fiscal second-quarter a little bit. Correct me if you disagree, but is there anything to call out for modeling purposes, any kind of below the line item stuff that maybe bounces back or how do we think about that?","Jon Marten","No, you\u2019re right. I mean I think if there are some onetime events that Tom was talking about that happened in Q1, that was kind of good news for us, that are not going to repeat in Q2. You\u2019re right, your observation is correct, it\u2019s been tweak down just slightly. And there are no other new in different types of activities that are occurring here that would want to call out in a call like this. I think it\u2019s a normal cost structure. Our cost structure is getting better, our volume is following a long our orders. Our orders are coming in the way that we had projected and so we are just a slight adjustments here for the slight bits of a good news here that we got in Q1, especially below the line.","Stephen Volkmann","Great. That is all I have got. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Hammond","Just back on simplification and the division consolidation, I mean you guys have done a great job early on. But Tom, you mentioned a lot of runway ahead. Can you maybe just speak to what are the really big opportunities as you go forward? And maybe along those lines just, Lee, you touched on international distribution maybe just expand on what you are doing there?","Tom Williams","So Jeff, its Tom. I\u2019ll start with the simplification and Lee can talk about international distribution. For us I think the biggest pull in the tent on simplification is the whole revenue of complexity and when you look at our divisions and you do a histogram of their sales and you look at that last couple of percent of revenue it has a significant, and I would underlying significant amount of part numbers, quote activity and SG&A that\u2019s tied up in a relatively small percent of revenue.","Now, we don\u2019t want to walk away from that, we want to do it significantly more efficiently. So that\u2019s a big element and because of the size of the company and then just the sheer magnitude of part numbers, that is something that will take time, but it\u2019s going to be probably the biggest contributor to savings in the future on simplification. And we just now started scratching the surface of that.","Related to that is organization design and process. So as we go through their product line complexity and simplify it, its old 80:20 type of concept. We are going to change organization design and processes associated and there will be speed, efficiencies, cost, et cetera. And in general an improvement in the ability to serve customers and ease of doing business with us, that\u2019s the other big part of the simplification is, is to make it easier to business with Parker.","We\u2019ll look at traditional things in organization design like span of controls, number of layers, all those type of things then we will look at good old fashioned bureaucracy which Lee and I talked about it in the past, if you were to do our -- what used to be called internally in the Company, the Black Book of process which is our annual planning process. It was a process that would take 5 months, 20 financial schedules and literally thousands and thousands of people hours tied up in that process and we drove that down to eight weeks, eight schedules and significantly freed up time for people.","So those are just an examples and color on that. We\u2019re early days in this, but I think I would say it's got great momentum in the Company. So I\u2019ll let Lee take over on what we\u2019re doing on distribution internationally?","Lee Banks","We have talked I mean many times that our distribution network is our greatest off-balance sheet asset that the company has and we have talked about North America being the gold standard in terms of how we compete and how we get to market. And when we\u2019re putting the new Win Strategy together, although we had done a lot, we were cognizant that we still had not built this network out at the rate that we wanted to throughout the rest of the world. So as we rolled up the new Win Strategy we put a team of senior executives that know how to get this done, focusing on emerging regions in Europe and focusing on Asia Pacific. And we are really encouraged by the progress we are making 12 moths to 15 months into it right now. So very positive.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just a couple of questions of clarification first. I just wanted to make sure I had straight what Jon said about restructuring. You made a comment about 20%. I don't know Jon if you were saying 20% of a restructuring benefits are in the first half. If you could clarify that and then just a couple of follow-ups.","Jon Marten","No you got that right, 20% of the savings that we get from the restructuring that we\u2019re incurring for this year we will get in the first half, so yes.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then on Aerospace, obviously with these wins and orders you do have this development cost bubble. I\u2019m wonder if you could just give us some sense of how elevated your R&D or E&D is today versus where you expect to see it say in that 2020 horizon?","Jon Marten","We are at the round numbers at about the 8% level today. We have as you know moved it down from 11% a few years ago. So the 7% to 8% range is the range that historically is a number that we are the most comfortable with. But overall our level of development cost are aligned with what our expectations are of our customers. If there is new and different types of requirements where we are the technical experts then we will be in many cases the designer of choice and that so will fluctuate, but for right now given today's environment 7% to 8% seems to be a right level for us and we are at about 8 right now.","So if in could just have one more question and we will wrap it up for today. I hope that answers your question, Jeff.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. Your line is open.","Alex Blanton","Just a question on the CapEx. The first quarter you had $32.5 million which is about 1.2% sales. That is about half of what you normally do which in turn is half as a percent of sales of what it was 10 years ago. What do you expect CapEx to be for the year? What percentage of sales?","Jon Marten","It will be in the range of 1.6 to 2.0 for the year. So 1.6 to 2.0 CapEx as a percent of sales.","Alex Blanton","Okay, so that is going to be a pretty low figure compared with what you were 10 years ago.","Jon Marten","We are not nowhere near as required capital that we did 10 years ago Alex, and that 1.6 to 2.0 includes a lot of reinvestments into the company, but no you are right we are nowhere near where we five years ago, let alone 10.","Alex Blanton","And that is mainly due to the lean efforts, correct?","Jon Marten","Yes, it's hard to articulate on the phone call like this, how much lean has transformed our company. And when you add on to that all these affords that we are going through from a business simplification standpoint and how that\u2019s impacting our CapEx plans, we are just seeing a lot of great momentum from that. And so yes, that\u2019s correct.","Alex Blanton","So is it just a matter of raising your margins, [indiscernible] profits, the higher profits [indiscernible], when it comes to allocating it to CapEx and [indiscernible] acquisitions?","Jon Marten","Yes, we are from a CapEx standpoint we feel very good about our positioning there and of course we are discipline, we are using in a IRR approach on that just as we do on the DCS from an acquisition standpoint. And we remain disciplined on all of our right capital allocation plans. And that\u2019s our goal, as Tom said we want to be great deployers of the cash going forward. So I hope that helps you out, Alex.","Alex Blanton","I just have one suggestion on the slide that you list your cash flow -- I guess it is slide number -- cash flow from operating activities, Slide 12. I would give a simplified cash flow statement actually there. You are not presenting the individual components, the major components of cash flow and I realize that is in the cash flow statement in the operating statements, but it would be very helpful to have it right here on this slide so people could see it and wouldn't have to refer back to the cash flow statement. Just a simplified one showing the CapEx, showing changes in inventory and the working capital and so on.","Jon Marten","Okay, well that\u2019s a [multiple speakers] yes, no good suggestion Alex, we will definitely take that one on and take a real hard look at that for you and all of our investors. So I think with that. ","Alex Blanton","You gave the number when you were talking but they are not on the slide.","Jon Marten","Okay, all right. We\u2019ll try to be a little bit clearer next time. Thanks Alex and with that I think this concludes our Q&A earnings call. I want to thank everybody for joining us today; I want to just to be assure everybody that Robin and Ryan and will be available throughout the day, to take your calls, should you have any further questions. And thank you and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program, and you may all disconnect.

My name is Shaquana, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Pamela Huggins, Vice President and Treasurer. Please proceed, ma'am.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thanks, Shaquana. Good morning, everyone. Pam Huggins here, just as Shaquana mentioned. I'd like to welcome you to Parker Hannifin's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Release Teleconference. Joining me today is Chairman, CEO and President, Don Washkewicz; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Marten.","For those of you who wish to do so, you may follow today's presentation with the PowerPoint slides that have been presented on Parker's website at www.phstock.com. For those of you not online, those slides will remain posted on the company's Investor information website 1 year after today's call.","So at this time, please reference Slide #2 in the slide deck, which is the Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements. Please take note of the statement in its entirety, if you haven't already done so.","Now moving to Slide #3. This slide is required and indicates that in cases where non-GAAP numbers have been used, they've been reconciled to the appropriate GAAP numbers, and they're posted on Parker's website as well.","Slide #4. The agenda for today consists of 4 parts as usual. Don Washkewicz, Chairman and CEO and President, will provide highlights for the quarter and year. Second, I'll provide a review, including key performance measures for the fourth quarter and year, concluding with the 2014 guidance. The third part of the call will consist of the standard Q&A session. And for the fourth part of the call, Don will close with some final comments.","So at this time, I'm going to turn over it to Don and ask that you refer to Slide #5, titled Highlights Fiscal Year 2013.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Thanks, Pam, and welcome to everyone on the call. We certainly appreciate your participation today. I'll make a few brief comments, and then Pam is going to return for a more detailed review of the results.","First of all, I'd like to start by talking a little bit about the year, the full year. Our performance for fiscal 2013 largely reflected soft global economic conditions, particularly outside the United States. Sales were $13 billion, and they were positively impacted by a 3% contribution from acquisitions but largely offset by a 3% decline organically, which includes the divestiture of our automotive business, which was minus 1%. So we had a plus 3 contribution from acquisitions, offset by 2 organically and then 1 divestiture, or 3 total, which kind of offset the 3% increase from acquisitions. And then we had a negative 1% currency on top of that. So for that, the net for the whole year then was down 1%. I hope that's clear as to how we get to that number. So what was happening basically is lower margin acquisitions were replacing higher-margin organic growth throughout the year.","Earnings for the year were within our guidance and were impacted primarily by lower volume and acquisition and integration-related expenses. Segment operating margins were 13.8%, which was a strong performance despite soft economic conditions.","Operating cash flow before a discretionary contribution to our pension plan was $1.4 billion, or 10.9% of sales. And I'll just make the comment that this is the 12th year now in a row that we've generated greater than 10% operating cash flow for the company, so we're pretty excited about that.","In fiscal 2013, we acquired 8 companies, totaling approximately $0.5 billion in annualized sales. And we completed divestitures within the CIC group, totaling about $155 million. As previously announced, we have reached agreement to form a 50-50 joint venture with GE Aviation to produce fuel nozzles for current and future GE Aviation commercial engine platforms. We anticipate completion of this transaction in the second quarter of fiscal 2014.","In this fiscal year, we also increased our dividend payout twice for a total of 10%. Parker has now increased dividends for 57 consecutive years. We also repurchased $257 million of our own shares. We purchased $200 million under the 10b5-1 program and $57 million were additional discretionary purchases of our shares, so that's $257 million total for the year. And by the way, the average price there was about $86 a share.","Just switching now for a few comments about the quarter. Our sales for the fourth quarter were a record for the company. We're finally coming off the bottom with respect to order trends. You've seen those order trends. July, and I'll just repeat July, not June, the June orders are what you've been looking at there, but July orders are in-line with our expectation and support of our current guidance. So they're coming in okay. Acquisitions contributed 3% to revenue growth in the quarter, offset by a 2% decline in organic sales.","Net income for the quarter was $271 million, or $1.78 in fully diluted earnings per share. A number of factors impacted our fourth quarter earnings, including lower-than-projected volume. We had a record quarter, but we had expected higher numbers than even what we came in with. Higher acquisition and integration expenses also impacted us and then inventory reductions as well.","Total segment operating margins in the fourth quarter were the highest of any quarter in fiscal 2013 at 14.5%, so we're pretty happy about that. And then operating margins in our CIC segment were an all-time record at 13.8%, and that group was basically benefiting from all of the restructuring that we've done over the last couple of years. So a nice record for the CIC group.","Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter at $472 million, or 13.8% of sales, a very, very strong number for us.","Looking out to next fiscal year, we are anticipating a modest growth year as a result of the global macroeconomic conditions and have provided guidance of $7.35 to $8.15 in diluted earnings per share. These estimates for fiscal 2014 compared with 2013 include an expected gain of approximately $1.50 from the joint venture with GE Aviation and higher operating expenses of approximately $100 million due to possible restructuring activities.","And I'll just stop for a moment there and just explain what we're doing there so that it's clear to everybody. Our goal, as we stated over the last 12 or 13 years now as we launched the WIN strategy back at the early 2000s, was to get the performance of the company up to 15% operating margin levels. And we did that, and we wanted to do that over the cycle. We just didn't want to hit it one time and then fall off. We wanted to average 15% over the cycle. And in order to do that or by doing that, we would achieve top quartile performance against our peers. So that's been our objective and our goal ever since. We've been marching toward that.","We hit 15.2% last year. We hit 13.8% this year because of all the factors that we talked about earlier. So we decided this was appropriate time to make a major restructuring. This will be a bigger restructuring than we've done in the history and any 1 year in the company's history. We've done $50 million before. We've done $40 million. We've never done a year where we did $100 million in restructuring in the company.","So we're doing this to ensure that we hit 15% by '15. That's our tagline internally here as we want 15% by fiscal '15. That's a year from now. So all this restructuring that we're taking on right now, the $100 million, is going to happen this year. We hope to get through all of it this year, fiscal '14. That's the reason why it's impacting our numbers with the payoff being about a year from now starting in fiscal '15 when we're targeting 15%.","So I hope everybody can appreciate what that's going to entail. It's going to be a lot of work and hard work and effort on everyone's part here. But that is the rationale for it, and I think the timing is right because we're looking at soft markets anyway. This is a good time to get it done and get our business rightsized for the business that we have facing us going forward. So just wanted to make that comment. We can talk more about that in the Q&A, if you'd like.","Also to provide greater visibility to the underlying businesses in our diversified Industrial segment, we are also going to start providing some supplemental sales information in September for 3 new global technology platforms. One platform is going to be called motion systems, another platform will be flow and process control and then the third platform will be filtration and engineered materials. I think that will give us a lot more transparency for the company, for people that aren't that familiar with us looking from the outside in. And we can discuss that a little bit further in the Q&A as well.","So right now, I'm going to turn it back over to Pam, and she's going to give you a little bit more detail for the quarter.","Pamela J. Huggins","Thanks, Don. I'll ask that you reference Slide #7, and I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Fully diluted earnings per share came in at $1.78 for the fourth quarter. And again, this is the highest quarter of the fiscal year and an increase of 6% sequentially versus the third quarter. Of course, the $1.78 is less than last year, $0.18. We did $1.96 last year. So for the full year, fully diluted earnings per share came in at $6.26. And again, $1.19, or 16% lower than last year's fully diluted earnings per share of $7.45.","So moving to Slide #8 and just laying out the significant components of the $0.18 decrease in earnings per share for the fourth quarter, quarter-over-quarter. The majority of the $0.18, as you can see on here, or the $0.14, is the result of decreased segment operating income. And this is mainly due to decreased volume in North America. And I notice that most of you did pick that up in your reports this morning. It's also due to acquisition-related expenses and then, of course, inventory reductions that Don talked about, both in North America and in International.","Other expense was higher by $0.06 as a result of higher pension expense, and we took the liberty to net some of these numbers here. EPS was favorably impacted by $0.02 as a result of reduced shares outstanding, obviously, in connection with the share repurchases. And then we netted below the line items corporate G&A, interest and taxes as they offset one another.","So moving to Slide #9. Sales, again, $6.26 versus the $7.45. We've laid out the components of the decrease here for you of $1.19. And again, as you can see, $1.19 really related to segment operating income. This was mostly due to a decrease in base volume in Industrial International and North America, again, acquisition integration and related expenses. And in this segment, there was an International. There was also some currency impact. And then, of course, the inventory reductions as well.","Other expense increased $0.30 due to increased pension expense. And again, we took the liberty to net a little bit here. So if you hear a little bit of a different number by $0.01 or $0.02, don't be concerned. And then the decreases were partially offset by a favorable impact from share repurchases of $0.12. Again, we netted the below the line items.","Moving to Slide #10. And looking at the top line, reported revenues for the quarter, they increased 1% to $3.43 billion, and that's slightly ahead of last year as a result of acquisitions. That added 3% to revenue growth, partially offset by an organic decline of 2%. And then for the full year, reported revenues of $13 billion, they were down 1%. And this was really due to currency, if you net the acquisition growth of 3% and the organic decline of 3%.","Segment operating margins for the quarter decreased 100 basis points versus last year. And on a sequential basis, margins increased 50 basis points from the third quarter. And again, as we already said, the margins were the highest of any quarter this year. For the full year, segment operating margins were down 140 basis points. And the reason for this is all the things that I mentioned earlier. And just to give you a little idea as far as restructuring charges, $0.02 were incurred in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, $0.06.","So now moving to Slide #11 and focusing on segments, and I'll commence with Industrial North America. North American organic revenues decreased 6%. Acquisitions added 3% to revenues, while currency was relatively minor. So as such, reported revenues decreased 3%, ending the year at $1.3 billion, fairly consistent with the prior year at $1.34 billion.","Operating income decreased 10%, $225 million versus $249 million. And again, this was due to decreased volume acquisition-related charges and inventory reductions. For the full year, reported revenue was flat. Acquisition growth of 4% offset the organic revenue decline of 4%. And then operating income decreased to $845 million from $895 million, and again, due to the same reasons that I just mentioned: decreased volume, acquisition integration and related charges and inventory. So the result in operating margin for the year decreased 110 basis points to 16.7% from 17.8%.","So continuing with the Industrial segment, moving to International, Slide #12. For the quarter acquisitions added 5% to revenues, but this was partially offset by a negative currency impact of 1% and a decline in base revenues of 1%, resulting in a 3% increase in reported revenues. So good to see International turning around here.","Operating margin decreased to $156 million from $164 million, and again, due to the same mentioned. You'll see a theme throughout these comments due to the same reasons that I mentioned earlier. And then for the year, reported revenues declined 3% due to currency. Acquisitions added 5%, but this was offset by a decline in base revenues of the same magnitude. So operating margin declined to $584 million from $733 million for the year. And again, I won't mention the same reasons that I've mentioned earlier. As I said, there is a theme running through these comments.","So moving to Slide #13, the Aerospace segment. Aerospace fourth quarter 2013 reported inorganic revenues increase 9.5%. Of course, there were no acquisitions or currency impact on that segment. Operating margin increased to $86 million from $85 million versus the same quarter, and this is with an additional $10 million in development expenses in the year. Development expenses were 9.8% of sales for the quarter so below the target of 10% that we've been talking about.","So moving to the CIC segment. It's kind of sad the last time I will be talking about this segment. But prior to commencing with the numbers, I'm sure that you saw the press release last week announcing the consolidation of CIC into the Industrial segment. Attached to the press release, a table was provided that restated historical numbers for Industrial North America and Industrial International for 2 full years, fiscal year 2012, fiscal year 2011, and 3 quarters of fiscal year 2013. We've revised the table to include the fourth quarter just ended, and it's in the Appendix of this slide deck, obviously, for your convenience.","So now back to the results for CIC. Slide #14 indicates that for the quarter, core and reported revenues were down 16%. But just as a reminder, there was a divestiture of the automotive air conditioning business, which took place in this segment. The prior year number hasn't been restated for this divestiture. And had the restatement occurred, revenues would have decreased 3%. So with less revenues, segment operating margin as a percent of sales increased to 13.8% from 11.7% a year ago. Way to go out, CIC. So for the year, revenues were down 14%, again, for the same reason. And margins increased to 9.9% from 8.7% last year. Excluding the divestiture, revenues would have been down 4%.","So now let's move to orders on Slide #15. And I'm sure you've seen these numbers. But just as a reminder, too, these numbers represent a trailing 3-month average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year. And these exclude acquisitions and currency, except for Aerospace. Aerospace is reported using a 12-month rolling average.","So if you can see from this slide, orders were flat for the June quarter just ended, reflecting improvement sequentially across the segment. North American orders for the quarter just ended decreased 5%. International increased 3%. Europe became positive in the quarter, while Asia is still negative year-over-year. Aerospace orders increased 3% for the quarter using the 12-month rolling. And in CIC, orders were flat. So orders coming off the bottom with slight improvement over the last quarter. But as we know, one month doesn't make a trend.","So moving to the balance sheet. The balance sheet remains strong. In the quarter, $472 million in cash was generated from operating activities. This has allowed us to reduce the total debt by $194 million due to a paydown of commercial paper. And cash on hand increased $104 million in the quarter. DSI, or days sales and inventory, came in at 62 days for the quarter versus 67 last quarter. So this is the nice improvement in inventory that we've been talking about throughout these comments. And the decrease in the quarter represents a reduction of almost $90 million, and inventory levels for the year at 10.6% of sales are a record for the company.","Accounts receivable in terms of the DSO closed at 49, in-line with last quarter, and we continue to make improvement on the weighted average days payable outstanding. June came in at 56 versus March at 54.","So the cash flow statement, the $472 million in cash that we generated, 13.8% of sales. After increasing the cash on hand by $108 million, cash was used for the following: $194 million, again, to retire commercial paper that I just talked about; $118 million returned to the shareholders via share repurchase and dividend payments; and then, of course, $52 million, or 2% of sales, utilized in connection with capital expenditures.","So now Slide 18 through 21. Those 3 slides -- I guess, 4 slides represent the guidance, and on Slide 18, the guidance for revenues and operating margins by segment that's been provided. I'm not going read through this information on the call, but the detail has been provided there for your convenience. Just as a reminder, these numbers include the JV that Don talked about and the restructuring that Don mentioned as well.","So Slide #19. This slide lays out the guidance assumptions as follows: the full year guidance assumes increased revenue year-over-year of 2%, comprised of 2% organic growth. There is also 1% growth as a result of acquisition carryover from last year, but this is offset by a 1% reduction in sales in connection with the joint venture in CIC.","Segment operating margins, 13.4% to 14%. And then guidance has been provided in total for the items below segment operating income, what we refer to as below the line items. And that's forecasted to be $120 million at the midpoint. So what you need to remember is that this $120 million includes a gain of $360 million in the second quarter as a result of the joint venture with GE Aviation. That was announced in a press release in November. So excluding this gain, the total for the below the line items is $480 million at the midpoint. And the tax rate for the year is projected to be 30.8% due to the JV gain, which is taxed at 37%. And the JV gain is included in the second quarter. So the tax rate -- I know it's a little confusing. The tax rate excluding the gain is 29%.","So we'll answer any questions that you have with respect to that, if there's anything that's confusing you after having gone through these slides. The number of outstanding shares used in the guidance, 151.6 million.","So moving to Slide #20. This slide summarizes the guidance on a diluted earnings per share basis and using the assumptions that I just explained and is documented at the bottom of Slide 19. The guidance is $7.35 to $8.15. That's $7.75 at the midpoint. This slide also details the walk with the major components from actual fiscal year 2013 to the guidance of $7.75 at the midpoint. As you know, I saw it on all your reports, so I know you picked up on it, the full year guidance includes $1.50 earnings per share in the second quarter related to the GE Aviation joint venture. $0.44 as a result of additional segment operating income. It's offset by a net restructuring of $0.32. So $98 million to $100 million in restructuring, net of $30 million savings. And then, of course, we have $0.12 from higher tax rate. The press release called out $0.30 for restructuring. Obviously, we just used a rounded number. We used $0.32 in the guidance.","But just a couple of salient points with respect to the guidance. First half to second half is $48.52. Segment operating income first half to second half is 45% in the first half, 55% in the second half. And then EPS first half to second half is 53%, 47%. The midpoint of the guidance for the first quarter is $1.40. Please remember that the forecast excludes any further acquisition divestitures that may be made in fiscal year 2014.","So there's a lot there, so we're anxious to get to Q&A. So at this time, please open it up to Q&A, Shaquana.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann, representing Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I'm wondering if we can touch a little bit, the cash flow continues to be very strong and the balance sheet also very strong. And Don, you talked in the past couple of 3 quarters about stepping up the share repurchase. But obviously, we haven't really seen that, and I don't think there's any share repurchase in your guidance. So I guess, I'm wondering if you can just address, is there enough in the pipeline acquisition lines that you feel like you want to hold off on this? Is the price not attractive? Or is there some potential for some share repurchase to sort of be additive to all this guidance for '14?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Good question, Steve. I think our priority as far as the capital allocations, first of all, would be the dividends. Okay. And you've seen what we've able to do with the dividends this past year, and we'll continue to work on that. We want to get to about a 30% payout on the dividends, moving up from 25%. So that will continue to be a focus for us. As far as the acquisitions and the share repurchase, our interest right now is in acquisitions. And basically, the interest is strong enough for acquisitions because of the soft global economy that we're faced with. So I think the organic growth for the near term here as you can see is going to be subdued. So what we would like to do is to spend that money on acquisitions as opposed to share repurchase. However, if we're going to continue to do at least $200 million in share repurchases to the 10b5-1, that's kind of a steady-state number for us going forward. However, if acquisitions don't materialize for the extended period of time, I mean, we will definitely consider doing more share repurchase, no question about it. I don't want to leave a lot of money on the balance sheet, not putting it to good use. So we will do one or the other or both for sure. But we also want to hit the dividends. We'll continue to work on the dividends. And then I think we're in pretty good shape on the pensions right now after having what we did last year for the pensions so I don't think we're going to have to allocate much more to the pensions at this point in time. Does that help you, Steve?","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","It does. But I'm wondering if I can just push you a little bit. I mean, you did about $500 million, I think, in acquisition revenue in '13. Is '14 going to be up meaningfully from that?","Donald E. Washkewicz","We would like to have at least that much. We're targeting like 4% to 5% for acquisitions, and so we'd like to have at least that much. We can handle more if we find the right properties and at the right prices. One of the challenges that you have in any time when you go into an environment like this, especially with acquisitions, from a practical standpoint is as sales -- the global world outlook as far as growth is subdued, of course, that has a major impact on your discounting cash flow valuations. And so there is always this -- the realization have to be a coming -- a meeting of the minds, if you will, between the buyer and the seller as to what reality is going forward. And so there's that challenge that you always have with acquisitions. We will put in what we think is a prudent growth rate. They'll figure that. Of course, the growth rate is going to be much higher, then you have to kind of come to terms with that. So that's one of the challenges you have in an environment like this, especially when there's very little growth, and that depends on where the growth is at as well. For instance, in some of the regions around the world, I'm not sure that you can put much of a growth rate in at all into a model based on what we know right now. So that's where the challenge comes in with acquisitions. I hope you follow what I'm saying there. That's not to say we can't do them, and we're going to continue to look. We're looking at some right now. We'll continue to focus on it, and I'm hopeful that we can meet our target at least 4% to 5% and more. We've got plenty of capacity to do more if we find the right properties.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And just quickly clarifying your 15% target for '15, I think what you're saying is you think you can do that kind of that even in this very slow growth environment that we're all \"enjoying.\" And I just want to make sure that, that's on a segment basis. Is that how you're thinking about that?","Donald E. Washkewicz","That's correct. That's on a segment basis. And you're right, we are not anticipating or projecting anything special happening to get us to the 15% other than the restructuring. Now if we go into a major recession, I mean, all bets are off. But at least if we maintain this kind of activity level, we feel comfortable we can get to 15% in '15 for the entire company. And that's our goal, and that will put us nicely into the top quartile of our peers, and that's where we want to be. That's where we were last year. This year, we fell down a little bit, but we'll be back. We'd be back and next year -- we're taking some pretty definitive action here to get back to where we were.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond, representing KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So just a few questions on restructuring. One, can you walk through the cadence of the spend? And maybe just clarify, it looks like most of it is coming in the International segment. And then finally, what is the savings versus the $100 million spend, kind of annualized savings all-in when it's all said and done?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Let me start off, and I'll let Jon and Pam finish. When you look at the actual restructuring, it happens -- the majority of it is going to happen internationally. There is some happening in North America, but the majority will happen outside of North America throughout the year. So that's basically where it's going to happen. And I think if you look at the segment data that we've provided you as far as the operating margin data, I think you'll be able to tell pretty quickly as to where it might happen in the International markets and other segments of our business. And I'll turn it over to Jon and Pam.","Jon P. Marten","Yes, Jeff, just to give you some additional context there. In the press release, we talked about the $100 million in restructuring, and that's the gross number. And we are expecting to get off of that $30 million in savings. And if you take that $100 million in gross expenses for restructuring, take out the $30 million in the savings, add that back, that's how we get to the $0.32 that is on Pam's reconciliation. And that breaks down first half, $0.21, and the last half, $0.11. And that's the net impact here of the restructuring here that we've got built into the guidance for FY '14, and as Don said, the majority outside North America. But this includes all segments, all regions all together here. So as we report back to you through FY '14, we'll be able to detail that for you in more detail at that point.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just a consideration, as you go forward and report, maybe if you can spike out into this JV noise, as well as the restructuring noise, I think it'd be a big help in the presentation and reported results.","Jon P. Marten","We'll do. I appreciate that, Jeff.","Pamela J. Huggins","We will do that, Jeff.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre, representing Robert W. Baird.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess, first question for me, maybe a little more color on what you're seeing in various end markets and how orders have sort of progressed through the quarter? I remember on the last call, you sort of mentioned that April progressed quite well. So I guess, I'm kind of wondering what changed.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Well, I can tell you what the different markets are looking like for us to kind of give you an idea as to what is looking good and what's not looking quite as good right now might help you with what our order trends are seeing. First of all, the worst 2 segments for us as far as market segments are construction and process markets. Okay? Constructing pretty much globally is down. And I think that is probably the major decline that we've seen in the last quarter or quarters, if you will. Some of the more positive segments are commercial aerospace, both on the OEM side and the aftermarket side. Our distribution is still positive, not as strong as it was but still positive. Farm and ag is a really strong segmentm for us. Cars and light trucks shouldn't be a surprise. That's been doing pretty well. Semiconductor is turning around. It's actually improving now a little bit. Forestry, industrial trucks and industrial refrigeration are all positive. So that would be some of the markets that we're tracking positive. On the downside, in addition to the process and the construction market that I mentioned, oil and gas is softening. And then military markets, both on the defense side, defense OEM and defense aftermarket, are both negative as far as order trends for us. And then the rest of them would be flat. So the rest of them would include things like machine tools, general industrial, power gen and commercial air conditioning and commercial refrigeration. The other thing I might just point out is just what's happening on the PMI because we kind of track along with that to some extent in these various markets. So if you look at the PMI and globally, there's been a slight increase. It's just north of 50% now, so there's been a slight improvement in the PMI or ISM index, if you will. The U.S. took a big turn up in July. It was tracking pretty flat through June and it went from like 50%, a little over 50%, almost 51% to 55%. So that made a big turn up in July. The Eurozone broke through 50%. However, a lot of that came from the -- well, outside of the Eurozone would be the U.K. U.K. was very strong. They had a very strong PMI index. And Germany just crossed over in the 50%, crossed over 50%. They were actually below 50%. So you can see there's some positive movement here in some of the PMIs in the different areas. The 1 or 2 areas that really have impacted us in a negative way and is tracking pretty well at the PMI as well is China. China is down to 47% now on the PMI, and that's tracking down from 51% and then 48%, now 47%, starting back in March. So that's not a good direction to be heading. And then likewise, Brazil is down under 50% as well. They're down to 48%, so they started at almost 52%, and they're moving backwards down to 48%. So when you look at the PMI, there's a couple of kind of weak sisters in there as well. So I think North America, slight positive. Europe, positive trend at least in this early going, which would be -- that's good because they've been down in recession for quite some time there. We'd like to see that come back around. And Asia being not so good right now, and Latin America kind of flat. So that's a little color on some of the markets and some of the regions as we see it here.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Sure, that was helpful. And if I may, the follow-up here is on Aerospace. Maybe you can give us a little update for how you're expecting R&D expenses as a percent of sales to progress, given the noise surrounding this JV. If I remember correctly, you expected to exit at about 8% of total sales by the end of fiscal '14. Is that still the case?","Jon P. Marten","Yes, right now, Mig, our guidance is just right around 9%. We were hoping to get it down to 8%. We're going to be striving for is very, very hard to get there. But our guidance indicates 9%, and that's after the impact of the JV, which will reduce sales as recorded once this JV is closed in FY '14 by about $100 million.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Andy Casey, representing Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question, I guess, on the quarter, the Industrial International margin performance. Could you give us the puts and takes in there? I would imagine a lot of the restructuring, the $0.02 that you called out, is included. I'm just wondering if acquisitions were added, if at all, or if they were just neutral.","Jon P. Marten","I think, Andy, for the Industrial International for Q4, acquisitions are a slight add. They're not, of course, nearly as much of a additional incremental earnings there that we would get from our classic organic business that we have been experiencing there in the Industrial International area. If you look at the results, although we were down quarter-over-quarter by 100 basis points, it was our best quarter of the year in Industrial International. And we do see, as Pam indicated and Don indicated, the Eurozone starting to stabilize and maybe bounce up from the bottom that has been formed and an inflection point being incurred there. Asia, as Pam indicated, which is the other major significant portion of that segment, is still down and the order trends are still down. And we're projecting that to move back up later in the year. That did not move up as quickly as we hoped during Q4 and as we indicated here in some of our earlier commentary here at the end of January and the end of April.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then on the guidance midpoint that you've provided, Pam, for the first quarter, it seems like that's a normal kind of sequential decline with seasonality. Is the restructuring that you called out, I believe it was $0.21 for the first half, is that primarily weighted to the second quarter?","Pamela J. Huggins","Yes, yes. There's about $0.07 in the first quarter. And so $0.21 minus the $0.07 is what's in the second quarter. But don't forget, in the first quarter, we also have much, much higher stock compensation expense that falls in that other category. So yes, I think besides those things, then it's the volume.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton, representing Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Can I ask about the fourth quarter guidance? I think you said $1.40, first quarter, December quarter. You said $1.40 towards the end of your remarks, and that will be versus $1.57 last year. Could you bridge that gap briefly? I don't think you've done that.","Pamela J. Huggins","No. I think Alex, not to just reiterate what I said. But if you look at '13 versus the first quarter, we always have a lower quarter from the fourth to the first, but I know you're looking at first quarter a year ago.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Year-on-year?","Pamela J. Huggins","Yes, yes. So we do have lower volume, a little bit of lower volume. We have higher stock compensation expense, and then we have restructuring expenses that are flowing through there. And those are the bulk of the differences.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Okay. What is the restructuring part? Do you know?","Pamela J. Huggins","Restructuring is about $0.07 in the first quarter.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","$0.07, okay. Secondly, the inventory reduction you mentioned, is that company inventory?","Pamela J. Huggins","Yes, that is company inventory.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Okay. So you're down to what as a percent of sales and inventory?","Pamela J. Huggins","Yes, we're at 10.6% of sales, which is a record for us.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Record low, right?","Pamela J. Huggins","Right.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","So that contributes to the high cash flow. What did that cost you in terms of absorption? Do you know?","Pamela J. Huggins","What did that cost us?","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Yes, in terms of underabsorption of [indiscernible] when you reduce inventory?","Jon P. Marten","Alex, Jon here. We have calculations that unabsorbed overhead that's related to the inventory reduction is about $0.08 in the quarter in Q4.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","$0.08 in the fourth quarter?","Jon P. Marten","Yes, that's it. That's almost a $90 million reduction in our inventory in the quarter.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Quarter-over-quarter, right?","Jon P. Marten","Yes, that was in the -- from the end of Q3 to the end of Q4, yes.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Okay. So that was $0.08 of the shortfall, right?","Jon P. Marten","Yes.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","And finally, when you look ahead at next year to this first half to this -- the second half of this fiscal year and all of calendar 2014, really, to what extent are you expecting Europe to recover? Because you've mentioned the beginnings of what could be a substantial improvement that would help you, but I believe that we see that in your guidance, I mean, your guidance at the midrange, if you substract the gain, it's flat, overall flat. And there's no pension cost coming out of it. So really, if you subtract that, it's down.","Jon P. Marten","Well, let me just recap for you what our guidance shows here as we look at the regions around the world. We're looking at all-in a 2% increase built into our guidance in the top line for FY '14. That 2%, Alex, includes about a 2% projection for us for Europe and about a 3% projection for us in Asia. And the balance of it is Aerospace is going to come in flat because of the impact of the joint venture, and the balance of that is in North America, which is about almost 3%. And that's how our guidance breaks down here by region for FY '14 top line, including the impact of that reduction of the Aerospace sales due to the joint venture.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","All right. Well, it just make me a little -- I wanted to get to the details because, overall, it doesn't seem like much of a recovery.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones, representing Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","If I could just go back to the restructuring actions, you said that you intend to save $30 million in fiscal 2014. Correct?","Jon P. Marten","Yes.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","At the full run rate, what's that annualized savings? What will that annualized savings be in 2015?","Jon P. Marten","$80 million is our best estimate.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","$80 million. Okay. So obviously, it looks like a lot of that is intended to be in Industrial International. And we have been looking at negative auto comps in Industrial International other than this most recent quarter for a year. Can you talk about why this decision to restructure those businesses was not taken earlier?","Jon P. Marten","Well, Nathan, I think the conclusion that we came to is, just like Don alluded to earlier, we're in the point of the cycle as we understand it right now that we knew that, given the growth prospects in some of the regions, that we are going to be doing the restructuring. And let me just emphasize that there will be in all regions in all segments that we'll be doing restructuring in FY '14, that we have always had the policy that pursuant to the WIN strategy that we put in place 12 years ago, that Don talked about earlier, that we would want to have a cost structure that would allow us to get to 15%. And given the organizational structure that we have right now, given as we look at our cost structure here in FY '14, as we were doing the deep, deep planning for FY '14 and really realizing the results that were going to give us the 13.8% ROS in FY '13 versus the 15.2% in FY '12, as we started pulling all that together here during our planning cycle, we knew that there were certain regions and certain buildings and certain facilities and certain businesses that needed to be restructured. We always restructure. We've always restructured throughout the history of the company, but this was such a big number. As we were pulling the planning, we knew that we had to call it out in the press release. Of course, when we look back and we take a look at the mix of the volume, you always are able to take a look at the cost structure and really take a look at our results vis-\u00e0-vis our peers. We do that. We do that consistently. We were able to get to 15.2% in FY '12 coming off of a big low. But during the entire business cycle, we knew, for us to maintain 15% going forward, that we could and we should restructure and we should do it in FY '14. And so that was our thinking.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. If I could just get one in on the Industrial North America. Don, you were talking about the PMI numbers earlier. And historically, where the PMI has been for the last 12 months would have had you with order growth in the 0% to 5% range, and you've been down in the high negative single digits. Can you talk about the impact of OEM customer destocking and now that, that's over, why your guidance isn't higher for revenue growth in Industrial North America?","Donald E. Washkewicz","I think that when you look at Industrial North America, I read off those segments to you that we're tracking positive. I think that there was -- we know that there was some destocking going on because we've been paying attention to the press releases from some of our customers as well. But also what we do is we track the 3\/12 and 12\/12 cyclicals on these various market segments based on our order trends. And I would say we're just now getting to probably the bottom of the destocking cycle. If I can look at, for instance, in the construction end of the business, our 3\/12 cyclical is flattening out but well below 100%. It's been flattening out now for several months. But the 12\/12 continues to trend down, but it looks like it's probably going to be coming in for a landing here shortly. So I think that we haven't totally seen the end of the destocking, but it's going to be in the near term here. And I think that probably the biggest impact is going to be in the construction part of the construction market segment for us. GDP is looking like about 1.7%. I mean, that's nothing to write home about. I think they started higher than that. The production index is about 0.1%. GDP for the quarter, I think, was started well over 2%, but they keep adjusting it down. So I'm not sure, frankly, what is the real growth out there other than what I can tell from my own cyclical trends and order trends that I'm looking at here. And so we're just being cautious at this point. We're just saying, hey, we're not going to assume anything. I'm not going to budget, set up these budgets for this company based on some blue sky forecast and then have a real fiasco to explain down the road. We're going to set tight budgets and plan accordingly. And if something happens better than that, then we're all going to be happy about what we did. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a little color on it.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook, representing Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","As you went through sort of this restructuring effort and you thought about what you could do in a flat environment, are there any businesses that you look at that you're just sort of saying, okay, even with this restructuring, they just don't generate optimal returns? And in that regard, are there any businesses -- incremental businesses that you think could be up for divestiture in 2014? The second question is with regards to the acquisitions that you talked about, Don, I think you said you hope to contribute about 4% to 5%. Can you just talk about the size of those? Are they bigger ones or compiled of a bunch of small ones? And then my last question, can you just talk about what you're assuming this year for pension and then material costs?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Wow, that was a long list, Jamie. But that was okay. That covered about all the rest of the topics. Nonetheless, well, let me just...","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But they're quick answers.","Donald E. Washkewicz","No, those are all good questions. On the size of the acquisition, it really doesn't matter to us. We typically have been more successful in the up to $200 million kind of range acquisition or $0.25 billion, whatever. We've had some bigger than that, and we've had a lot smaller than that, of course. We are looking at some larger potential ones. We don't have anything that's imminent. We're going to be able to say, we're going to bring this home this year, but we're always in touch with some little bit larger ones. But by and large, the preponderance of the acquisitions are in that smaller, relatively smaller scale, like a $0.25 billion and less in size. And I would expect that to be the case going forward. If we happen to land one of the bigger ones, that would be great, too. That would be on top of what we're doing. We could handle more as well. We could certainly handle a bigger one if we wanted to do.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then on the divestiture side, as you just went through this restructuring exercise?","Jon P. Marten","Jamie, Jon here. Just on the divestitures, for every 10 acquisitions that we do, we do 1 divestiture. We don't do them, as you know, very well very often. There may be a business or 2, nothing really material in FY '14 that we would divest. But that's not nearly the amount of energy that we're spending on the acquisition front, as Don would talk about. So that's our thinking on the divestitures. In terms of the pension, we're showing about $0.17 tailwind built into our numbers for FY '14. And that's largely being offset by certain compensation and benefit offsets to that year, so that's not going to be a real big tailwind for us and certainly nowhere near the magnitude of the headwind that we took coming in from FY '12 into FY '13. And in terms of the material costs, I think we are really not seeing a tremendous amount of change in the input versus the pricing structure here for us. But Don, perhaps if you want to please go ahead and make a few additional comments about that.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Yes, the raw materials, Jamie, actually compared to where we were last time, actually have come down a little bit. Some of them have, some are flat, some of the inputs. I'll give you some for instances here. Castings and steel and zinc die-cast parts and, frankly, oil, those would be some of the categories that have been flat. Natural gas is down. Nickel is down. Nickel would be -- and then some of our stainless and higher alloy products is down. Aluminum is down, and copper is down. So some of the input raw materials are down. Steel is relatively flat. That would be a big input for us. So it's going to be a little bit of a mixed bag, but the general trend, I think, is softening. And I think copper being down is probably directly related to the fact that China has stopped growing and has stopped -- the construction has kind of flatlined over there at least for the time being. And because they were consuming most of the copper on the planet, I think, going back from a year ago. So that's kind of what we see there. We're recouping any kind of increases we're seeing. We're having success there because we track that across the company with our producer price -- our purchase price index, rather, and that is tracking positive for us as far as being less than one, the pricing we're paying now relative to what we were paying. And then the sell price index is tracking good for us as well. So everything there is holding up fine as far as recouping any cost that we're incurring, input cost and recouping the cost plus the margin.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of David Raso, representing ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","For the fiscal '15 commentary on the margins, just thinking through how you think about base revenue growth in acquisitions, it appears the fiscal '15 EPS number would be roughly $8. I just wanted to see if maybe you would bless that as the framework you're thinking about. And secondarily, the new global technology platforms, if you could just help us size of them to at least put a framework around sizing those 3 platforms within diversified.","Jon P. Marten","David here, Jon. First on the FY '15 $8 per share number, I have to tell you that we have been spending so much time worrying about FY '14 that we have not really focused on the FY '15 EPS number very much. I don't think that you're going to be too far off, but there are so many different variables that are going to be involved in getting that. We feel very confident that we're going to have our cost structure in-line by then, and it's going to be a matter of what happens with the growth rates. If growth rate accelerate past what our guidance indicates, then certainly we've got the capability as a company to do $2 per share per quarter. So it doesn't sound outrageous, but I have to tell you, I don't want to endorse that number here on this call at this point. I hope you understand.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","No, I can understand. I guess the idea is more organic growth gets better incremental margins, so my $8 was just doing more of a $2, $3 kind of organic the next 2 years. Obviously, you get more on the incrementals from at least typically from organic than acquisitions.","Jon P. Marten","Very much so. And very much so, our upside leverage, given where we are right now and given the restructuring that we do, is going to be just as good as it's ever been for the company, I think, going forward. We feel very confident in that.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And the new global technology platforms?","Donald E. Washkewicz","Do you want to answer that?","Pamela J. Huggins","Yes, let me just say, first of all, David, in September, we are going to be coming out with a fact book. Communications has spent a lot of time the last couple of months putting this together, so it's going to give you a lot of information relative to those global platforms that you don't have today. The other thing that we will be doing at the same time is we're going to release historical information for you on a quarterly basis just as we have done for CIC. So you will have all that information at your disposal in September.","Donald E. Washkewicz","And David, just to maybe to give you -- I can give you a little logic for what we're doing, okay, maybe if that will help you a little bit. The motion systems piece basically is going to include the tri-technologies that we have in the company that produce motion and those are the automation technology or electrohydraulics or electric actuation, if you will; hydraulic actuation; and then as well as pneumatics. So it's going to include all those tri-technologies. So it would be a combination of what you would consider in the past being our hydraulic group and our automation groups. Okay? Those would be combined in the motion systems. So that's the way you create movement or motion is through utilizing those technologies. The flow and the process control piece is a combination now of our instrumentation, what was prior instrumentation group or is our instrumentation group, our fluid connectors group. And then also now embedded in there is going to be our refrigeration and air conditioning process control, and that's going to be part of the instrumentation group. So those are the pieces that will be in flow and process control. And the rationale there is they're all similar type products but address different or differing markets, if you will. But keep in mind that all of these products really work together as a system. When we go out and present them to a customer, we're breaking them down in these spaces because they make some logical sense from a technology platform standpoint. In front of the customer, we piece parts and pieces together from all of these platforms to generate the system activity that we have at the customer level. The filtration and the engineered materials segment is basically going to include the filtration group, as we've known it in the past, and the seal group. And the seal group has really morphed into something way beyond what you would consider just seal technology. All of these, both in the filtration and the engineered materials, the filtration group and the seal group, they all have to do with material technology, either their media, material media for filter, applications or steels. And certainly, there's other material technology involved in our seal group like EMI shielding and things like that. The technologies are very similar. They all have to do with material technology and sophisticated materials, and that's the reason why they fell in the filtration and engineered materials group. And then, of course, the last one you already know, and that's Aerospace systems. And those would be the kind of the 4 technology platforms that we would have, 3 Industrial and 1 Aerospace.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Lastly, are there any changes operationally how you're running the company related to these changes? Or is it simply the presentation of your results?","Jon P. Marten","Well, David, in the press release that we did on the CIC consolidation very clearly, there is a set of management that is not going to be managing that CIC group. That management has gone on to other assignments within the company within those 3 technology platforms. So that is operationally a very big change. We had traditionally 8 groups. Now we have 7, and the management of those technology platforms has been put together here in ways that we will really be able to use synergies in working closer together in ways that we haven't been before. But we will still have our 7 traditional group presidents managing those platforms. But they -- because of the reasons Don just articulated here, they go together very well, I think, looking at the outside in at the company. And that's what we're trying to do is just provide more transparency.","Donald E. Washkewicz","And David, what is going to happen when you get that fact book, you're going to get sales breakdown in these areas, okay, these new platforms. And then we're trying to give you just kind of a rule of thumb. And it may not come out exactly this, but I think it's probably going to be pretty close to this. Because I know the next thing everybody is going to want to know is what's the margin by all these segments and then more and more and more information on those lines. But I think what we'll be able to tell you is that, from an operating margin standpoint, that every segment that we have in that Industrial breakup, those 3 Industrial segments, will be within 100 basis points as far as operating margin from the corporate average. So that might help you kind of get a feel that these are all pretty high-performing pieces of the company, and they're fairly close with respect to their ability to generate operating margin.","Pamela J. Huggins","So at this time, we'll close the conference call with just a few final comments from Don. Thank you for your participation, and we truly appreciate it.","Donald E. Washkewicz","Okay, great. I just want to once again thank everyone on the call for joining us this morning. As always, I want to take the opportunity to thank our employees for their continued commitment and for the success that we've had as a business. Our global team continues to do a great job executing the WIN strategy and delivering positive results for the company. The tone for our new fiscal year is to be, and as I mentioned earlier, is to be cautiously optimistic. If our orders continue their current trend, we could have a record year in fiscal '14. In any event, our restructuring will put us on a path to consistently deliver 15% starting in fiscal '15.","If you have any additional questions, Pam will be around the rest of the day.

I\u2019m pleased we\u2019re up to such a solid start to the year, as we executed well, delivered strong results and reinforced our view that this will be another record year for the company.","The first quarter highlights, we had a record first quarter sales at $3.3 billion up slightly from last year\u2019s first quarter. Organic growth adjusted for the GE Aviation joint venture increased almost 4%.

Total segment operating margins reached 15.9% and we\u2019re certainly very pleased with those numbers, and that\u2019s a 150 basis point increase from last year\u2019s first quarter and on an adjusted basis reached 16.1%.","This is a result of the success for restructuring completed last fiscal year. Our performance is led by an all-time record for segment operating margins in our Industrial North American businesses at 18%. Both Aerospace Systems and Industrial International had meaningful increases in margin this quarter compared with a year ago. Notably, the Industrial International margins reached 15%. And that\u2019s a great number considering Europe and Latin America are still pretty weak for us. So, hitting 15% was a great accomplishment.","Operating cash flows was again strong at $261 million and we anticipate that fiscal year 2015 will be our 14th consecutive year of cash flows greater than 10% and we\u2019ve generated greater than 10% ever since we launched the win strategy back in 2001.","Now, I\u2019ll make a few comments on our capital allocation strategy as a follow on to our announcement last week. We are very pleased to announce that the Board increased a quarterly dividend 31% from $0.48 to $0.63 and authorized a repurchase of up to 35 million shares.","Our capital allocation priorities remained pretty much the same as they have in the past, as we have consistently communicated our first priority is to maintain our dividend increase record. The significant increase last week brings us into alignment what our goal of a 30% payout ratio calculated as a percentage of net income. And we have been saying pretty much for the last year or so that we wanted to hit that 30% payout by within three years by 2016 and we\u2019re pretty much on target for that.","Second, we are committed to reinvesting in our business through capital spending that drives organic growth. We\u2019ve been running less than 2% CapEx and we think that we can manage this business by executing lean, continuing to execute lean and keep the CapEx around 2% give or take a little bit.","Third, we have a target to grow through acquisitions and we\u2019ll continue to pursue acquisitions at fit with the company strategically. And then lastly, we are committed to providing returns to \u2013 to our shareholders. The new authorization of 35 million shares approved by the Board last week, allows us more flexibility for share repurchases, this authorization more than doubles the number of shares available to purchase compared to our previous authorization.","Our goal is to repurchase 2 billion to 3 billion in the next 24 months for planning purposes and for spreadsheets; you can assume a straight line repurchase over the next two years, of course it appear to be a little lumpy, but I think that will be pretty much the best advice we can give you kind of assume straight line and you will be pretty close.","Guidance has been increased based on our strong first quarter results, partially offset by a significant currency headwinds. Adjusted guidance has been increased to a range of $7.45 to $8.05 and diluted earnings per share and that excludes rather $0.25 of restructuring expenses. The savings from the timing of the execution of our restructuring activities give us confidence that will deliver another record year in fiscal 2015.","So, now I\u2019m going to turn the call back over to Pam for getting a little bit more detailed review of the quarter.","Pam Huggins","Thanks Don. At this time, I ask that you reference Slide #5 and I\u2019ll begin by addressing earnings per share. If you go to the far right of this slide, you can see that the first quarter came in at $1.89 versus $1.67 for the same quarter a year ago, an increase of $0.22 or a 13%. Restructuring were originally planned at $0.07 with $0.04 in the quarter and this compares to $0.06 for the same quarter a year ago.","So, moving to Slide #6. This chart lays out the significant components of the lock from adjusted earnings per share of $1.67 for the first quarter of last year to the $1.89 for the first quarter of this year. And as you can see by looking at the slide, the significant contributors to the increase was segment operating income of $0.24. And this was due to better performance across all segments with a little offset due to the higher below the line expenses $0.02. And this is a result of less stock compensation expense offset by higher tax rate due to the elimination of the R&D credit and favorable discrete items last year. And I think that\u2019s not new to you.","So, moving to the next Slide #7. On the far right in the blue box commencing, if you go to the fourth line down, you can see that adjusted organic sales in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter increased almost 4%. So, we\u2019re real happy with that 4% increase. And this takes into account just as a reminder the joint venture that commenced October 1st of last year. There was minimal impact to sales in the quarter from acquisitions, and currency or FX originally planned to be positive reduced reported sales by $23 million or 7\/10 of a percent in the quarter. If you look to the bottom of the slide, you can see segment operating margins adjusted for restructuring cost in the quarter, the margins were 16.1% and this compares to 15% for the same quarter last year.","Restructuring cost in the quarter affecting segment operating margin it was $6 million this quarter versus $11 million last year. And please note that total restructuring cost were really $8 million in the quarter and $12 million for the same period last year. This difference of $2 million and $1 million is really included in below the line items in other.","So the higher adjusted segment operating income this quarter $525 million versus $476 million last year, which is a 10% improvement is due to the higher volume in North America and Aerospace, less support cost in Aerospace and leverage as of order restructuring in Europe.","So, moving to Slide #8. Focusing on the business segments commencing with North America. You can see that reported and organic revenues increased 6% to $1.47 billion from $1.3 billion last year. And there was little impact from currency and acquisitions in the quarter. Going down to the bottom looking at the adjusted operating income for the first quarter, you can see that it increased to $264 million from $236 million a year ago, again mainly the result of higher volume in the quarter.","Moving to the next slide, Diversified Industrial International. Here you can see that organic revenues for the quarter in this segment increased almost 1%, currency however, was a deduction to sales with an impact of minus 1%. Acquisitions again minimal impact, so reported revenues were down just a little less than 1%.","So adjusting for realignment cost, operating margin for the first quarter increased to 110 basis points to 15.5% from 14.4% and this obviously is a result of less restructuring cost, and savings associated with the restructuring activities completed last year. Restructuring cost in this segment $6 million in the quarter and this compares to $9 million in the same quarter a year ago.","So moving to Slide #10. Aerospace reported and organic revenues adjusted for the previously announced joint venture increased slightly more than 3% for the quarter. Again the impact of acquisitions in currency on this segment was negligible. The increase in revenue it was mainly due to higher commercial OEM business. Operating margins for the quarter increased to 100 basis points from 11.2% to 12.2% and this is due to higher margin OEM business on less support cost.","So, now moving to order rate, just as a reminder these numbers represent trailing average and are reported as a percentage of increase of absolute dollars, year-over-year excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency.","Diversified Industrial uses the three month average while Aerospace Systems uses a 12 month average. And as you can see from slide, the orders were positive 5% for the September quarter just ended. North American orders were up 6%, Industrial International orders up 2% for the quarter and Aerospace Systems increased to 12%.","So now if we can move to Slide #12, the balance sheet. Parker\u2019s balance sheet remain strong, cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet at quarter end were #2 billion, partially offset by outstanding Commercial Paper of a little more than $700 million. DSI or day sales and inventory came in at 69 days flat with a year ago; inventory levels at 10.9% of sales are an improvement versus first quarter last year, were inventory as a percent of sales was 11.2%.","Accounts receivable in terms of DSO closed at 49, a 1-day improvement from the first quarter of last year and weighted average days payable outstanding at the end of September was 60, a 2-day improvement sequentially from the June quarter end.","Moving to Slide #13, to talk about cash flow, it was $261 million or 8% of sales and the major uses of cash in the quarter, $122 million return to shareholders by share repurchases and dividends, $113 million utilized in the reduction of Commercial Paper outstanding and $55 million utilized in connection with capital expenditures. As a result of this and more to cash on hand declined by close to a $100 million in the quarter.","Moving to Slide #14 addressing the guidance. Please remember that, as requested we\u2019re providing adjusted guidance in line with last quarter, sales growth is adjusted for the GE joint venture that commence the first of October last year and segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude restructuring charges.","On this slide, we have detailed guidance for adjusted sales growth adjusted segment operating margins below the line items, the tax rate, the shares outstanding and then we provided the range for reported and adjusted earnings per share at the bottom.","Beginning at the top, looking at the fourth line down and addressing sales, total adjusted sales are expected to increase from 0 to 3% for the year. This is lower than the previous guidance provided at the end of last quarter, due to negative headwinds from currency, mainly the strengthening of the dollar versus the euro to last quarter.","Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is 3.3% and there is minimal impact from acquisition carryover. Currency in the guidance is now a deduction to sales of 1.9%, almost all related to the Industrial International. For total Parker adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 15.7% and 16.1% and this compares to 14.4% for fiscal year of 2014. And that\u2019s on an adjusted basis.","The guidance for below the line items, okay we conclude corporate admin interest and other, it\u2019s forecasted to be $470 million and again this is lower than the previous guidance given and this is due to the first quarter favorable results.","The full year tax rate is projected at 29% and the number of shares used in the guidance is $151.1 million. Please note that shares outstanding have not been reduced for the share repurchases that will take place in connection with the new authorization of 35 million shares and the plan to purchase $2 billion to $3 billion in shares over the next 24 months.","Also please note that the restriction on annual share repurchases has been lifted. This restriction was equally to the greater of 7.5 million shares of 5% of the shares outstanding as of the end of the prior fiscal year and is no longer in effect.","For the full year revised guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is $7.45 to $8.05 and $7.75 at the midpoint just as Don said. And this guidance excludes restructuring expenses approximately 50 million to be incurred in fiscal year 2015. And this is consistent with the previous guidance.","The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25 and the $0.25 will be incurred about 50% in the first half, 50% in the second half. So, just a couple of selling or a point with respect to guidance, sales are divided 48% or $6.43 billion first half 52% or $6.93 billion in the second half. This is obviously at the midpoint. Segment operating income first half, second half is divided 45% in the first half and 55% in the second half.","Earnings per share, first half, second half is 43%, 57% or $2.98 in the first half and $3.95 in the second half and again at the midpoint. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.47 at the midpoint and this number has been adjusted for $0.08 of the restructuring cost expected to be incurred in the second quarter.","So in summary, the major difference between the full guidance this quarter versus last is higher than previously guided first quarter results partially offset by the negative impact of currency as a result of the strengthening of the dollar throughout the first quarter. Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisitions or divestitures that may be made in fiscal year 2015 for published estimates as requested please exclude restructuring expenses.","So, at this time we will now commence with the standard Q&A session. As a reminder the call will be limited to one hour. So, please honor the request of one question at a time and a follow up only when clarification is needed. Right here into this courtesy everyone will have a chance to participate. Thank you so much.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Good morning.","Pam Huggins","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Pam congrats on the retirement and best of luck.","Pam Huggins","Thank you so much, it\u2019s been a pleasure Jeff.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, so just on the \u2013 just to be clear on the buyback are you guys doing a 10b5 or you will be in it every day or will you be more opportunistic and have your normal blackouts? And maybe just to follow on, what kind of gets you to the higher low end to that $2 billion to $3 billion?","Jon Marten","Okay, Jeff Jon here, I\u2019ll start out, I think we are going to continue with our 10b5 just as we have right now as Don said for planning purposes, best to use a straight line method for yourself. The actual results are likely to be lumpy. So, we\u2019re going to be reviewing matters as the in sewing quarters go on. And it\u2019s going to be something that we\u2019re going to be focused on every day.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, and what takes you to the higher low end?","Jon Marten","I think that, we\u2019re going to just take it one quarter, our best advice right now Jeff, is that we\u2019re just going to take it one quarter at a time, we\u2019re going to update it every quarter as to what the results are. We would be able to tell you more about the high or the low end as we get into the program and time goes on. I don\u2019t want to say anything to lead you to believe it is going to be closer to the low end or at the high end on this call.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay great. And just a quick follow-up, can you just talk about what trends you\u2019re seeing in Europe just on an underlying basis, what you saw kind of coming out of the summer shutdowns in the September, October and we\u2019re hearing certainly mix things and just want to get your sense of Europe?","Jon Marten","I think you know to just start out on that Jeff in Europe things came in exactly as we had put our guidance together. We had a good July not a great August, again accounting for the normal shutdowns that we see in August. And then we had exactly what we expected in the month of September, things are not ramping up, things are not ramping down things are relatively flat in Europe when we take a look at the orders. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right now, of course the major change on our guidance going forward is just the impact of the strong dollar vis-\u00e0-vis euro. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re seeing and that\u2019s how Europe is looking to us right now today.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre from RW. Baird. Please proceed.","Joe Grabowski \u2013 RW. Baird","Hi good morning everyone, this is Joe Grabowski for Mig. Really nice recovery in the International operating margins, just wanted to maybe find out if some the restructuring disruptions you had last quarter, it seems like perhaps those were worked out this quarter?","Jon Marten","Yeah that\u2019s a fair assumption, we were really quite worried that in Q4. We talked about it a lot in our Q4 conference call. Those kind of disruptions, the restructuring related costs that we were experiencing in the Q4 of last year have all that been eliminated here, our plans are being executed very well by our team mates and we are very pleased with the results internationally here at this past quarter.","Joe Grabowski \u2013 RW. Baird","Great, okay thanks. And then maybe just a quick follow-up, you kind of gave sort of the cadence of business in Europe, could you maybe talk about how the quarter progressed for North American industrial and maybe what you\u2019re seeing so far in October?","Jon Marten","Well right now in terms of the orders in North America, first your last question first for October, it\u2019s right into where our guidance is coming out. So nothing remarkable there to report out on two you that was along with our orders, that was along with our guidance. In North America, in the quarter, the results as we saw them in July, August and September again sequentially August is always lower than July, which is what we saw and September was sequentially better than August and September was slightly better than the month of July.","Joe Grabowski \u2013 RW. Baird","Okay great, thanks for taking my questions.","Jon Marten","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel","Good morning Don, Jon and Pam.","Pam Huggins","Hey Nathan.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel","If we could just go back to the beat in the quarter, it seem to me when you gave the guidance for this quarter that you had some vigor in built in there for possible cost over runs from the restructuring in Europe, how much of that improvement in Europe or you know the beat relative to your guidance was not incurring those costs, good execution on the restructuring versus fundamental improvement in the business?","Jon Marten","I think Nathan, there is certainly was some hesitation on our part in the month as we were putting the guidance together in terms of whether happen in Q4 for Europe. But a significant part of the beat that you are looking at above the segment line is coming from a tremendous performance in North America, our North America Industrial business. With an all-time record 18% return on sales as we\u2019re reporting externally. And that was even bigger and the slight beat that we saw in Europe and the more that we have since of what it transpired in Q4 last year.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel","And on those margins in North America, which were obviously extremely strong, was there anything that positively impacted that lot makes our price et cetera. This is normally your second lowest revenue quarter. Are they sustainable kind of margin levels do you think?","Jon Marten","Well first of all to answer your first question it was across the Board, excellent performance every product grouping across the company in North America. So there is no mix issue that kind of crops out here, are these margin sustainable. Well, we have for the year higher guidance and Diversified Industrial North America at very good margins for us. We\u2019re not showing that it can be sustained in Q2 or Q3, Q2 is always sequentially a little bit lower in terms of the top-line and Q3 we start to catch-up and around Q4 we will be very close to that same number in terms of our return on sales. And so for the whole year, we will be slightly below the 18 that\u2019s what\u2019s indicated in our guidance, but we will be in our guidance showing and we are showing all time high North America Industrial margins.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel","And once a little up just on the balance sheet, Don you can\u2019t get read it out with me one on the balance sheet, I know you guys would have like to be able to get deals done over the past 12 months or so before getting to those point, can you talk about, what got in your way from getting those deals, Don whether it was discipline on price or what led you to not be able to get those done?","Don Washkewicz","Nathan Don, just so that everybody on the call recalls what we had said in the past, it\u2019s been about three or four quarters that of course everybody was asking what, how we\u2019re going to deploy capital and so forth, that\u2019s we\u2019re building up cash balances on the balance sheet. And just sort of I can let you know now, what was going on, we had been in very serious discussions with a couple of major opportunities, acquisition opportunities in which case I would have needed all of the capital, all the cash that we had on the balance sheet and then some. They were very significant, we were in confidentiality agreements with them, I really couldn\u2019t disclose or say anything at all at the time.","So, we kept putting you up and I know that that was frustrating for all of our shareholders out there, that we \u2013 weren\u2019t taken any positive action, I think they were thinking that we\u2019re dragging our feet for one reason or other. But we were very, very seriously involved in a couple of major ones. We just couldn\u2019t bridge the gap at the end of the day, the \u2013 we\u2019re pretty disciplined, we have and these being strategic acquisitions. We felt that we had an advantage over other potential parties that would be interested from a standpoint that we would have more synergies.","And so, even using a synergistic model with building and all the synergies, we still came up significantly short from what the expectation of the sellers were so. We agreed to part ways and at some point in the future maybe we\u2019ll come back together, I think we kept everything friendly and I think there was just a difference in expectation or evaluation expectation that was the main reason why we parted. So, like I said we\u2019re disciplined on this, we know the businesses very well, we know what the capability is, all of these companies that we\u2019re looking at, because we\u2019re in similar businesses.","So, I don\u2019t think we missed anything from an evaluation or fair evaluation standpoint, it was just that we were not going to come together at this point in time on either one of these. So, plan B Nathan was always share repurchase and we had been talking about the dividend increase. We moved that up a quarter, because once we broke the confidentiality agreement with these, we were then free to go ahead and go ahead and do some take some actions with regard to the dividend increase which we did and of course we announced the share repurchase as well.","So, that was always plan B and I think, obviously the investment community saw that as a real positive that I have to say that going forward, we do have some smaller ones now more typical of what we\u2019ve done in the past that are in the funnel we probably will have a couple coming out hopefully, we don\u2019t project anything. But I would just say that, I my guess is right now will have a couple of smaller ones coming through the pipeline in the next few months.","So, you will still see us active in this area, but very disciplined and hopefully that answers your question, I think obviously at some point in the future we could revisit any of these and\/or all of these. But right now that\u2019s off the table we\u2019re pursing the actions that we presented to you this past week.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel","That\u2019s a great explanation. Thanks Don and good luck Pam.","Pam Huggins","Thank you, Nathan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Please proceed.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Good morning everyone and me too wish you the best Pam.","Pam Huggins","Thank you, Eli, the pleasure is been mine.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Can we talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace in demand across the Board, you\u2019ve gone to plus or the minus in this segment. And the order \u2013 your order in North America were quite actually, quite respectable for the quarter, and can you give us some idea, well we\u2019re seeing of course business at this point if we go into the end of the year?","Don Washkewicz","Yeah, I think I can do what I have done in the past, is seems like people would like to hear a little bit about, first I would give you a little color on the PMI and then I\u2019ll give you a little overview on the regions and then maybe going to some specific market segments kind of wrap it up. But just starting off on the PMI and this would be comparing PMI of June to PMI of September basically, and I\u2019m going to run you through the regions globally of just a little bit about 4\/10 still tracking north of 50 at 52.2. So, globally we\u2019re still on positive territory there.","The U.S. was the \u2013 a very nice pick up since June, June was 55.3 we\u2019re at 56.6, so it was a pickup of 1.3, which was good. The Euro zone was just the opposite, it went down to 50.3 from 51.8 was up 1.5. Germany was a big negative within the Euro zone of course Germany makes up a big part of that Euro zone. And Germany came in just above 50 was running more around 52 in June and now tracking around 50. So just off about 2 points.","China off about a half tracking at about 50.2 right now in September and Brazil was under 50 at 49.3. So just some general comments about the PMI, all the PMIs are 50 or greater which bodes well with one exception and that is Brazil and they are very closer at 49.3.But I think when you look at just the PMI keep in mind my understanding of the way it works is that when you are at down as low as 44 you can still be growing, but had a much lower rate.","So, all of these being around 50 or north of 50 is still pretty good news overall. The largest increase in the PMI from June was with the North America with the United States up 1.3. The largest reduction from June was Euro zone down 1.5 and that was let again by Germany. And then the largest absolute PMI was the United States, which is 56.6 which is definitely the strongest region of all of them.","Now I\u2019ll just kind of comment a little bit more detail on the regions more so than what you got from our order trends that we announced publicly. North America, as you saw, I may give you that 3\/12 and 12\/12s North America you saw 3\/12 running about a 107 and the 12\/12 running around 107. So those are both very strong numbers. Europe was pretty flat, 3\/12 and 12\/12 running at about 100.","So, the last three months orders over the prior year the same three and the last 12 or the prior year to same 12, running at about a 100%. So pretty flat in Europe, a strong trend in Asia overall 3\/12 running about a 107, 12\/12 running at about a 108. So Asia and North America are strongest, two strongest regions. Latin America again very similar to Europe being flat 3\/12 and 12\/12 running pretty flat at a 100.","So these order trends pretty much, match up well with the PMI industries that I just reviewed for you. Talking about some market segments and our market trends and what I\u2019ll try to do is give you a little comparison, this would be comparing the fourth quarter, which tends to be a stronger quarter for us to the first quarter which is weaker. So, we would expect some more sequential lower numbers or lower activity numbers in some of these markets. And I\u2019ll give you a little color as to how the year-over-year looks and these segments as well, because it will make the difference, because the two quarters are different with respect to strength, fourth quarter being stronger than the first quarter.","Some positive market segments for us is Aerospace on commercial side, the OEM and aftermarket those are strong segments. Something that turned strong for us that was running kind of negative was Aerospace, Defense, MRO, okay and with all the activity going on that didn\u2019t surprise us too much.","The other strong segments for the quarter were distribution, I mentioned here in a little bit just how strong that was one of our strongest segments, cars and light trucks, telecom and heavy-duty trucks both distribution and heavy-duty trucks were very strong. Now on a negative standpoint, which segments are trending negative sequentially would be Aerospace, Defense, OEM doesn\u2019t surprise us it\u2019s been there, for quite a while now.","Farm and Ag, machine tools, general industrial, life science, oil and gas, mining, marine, forestry, power gen, commercial refrigeration and commercial air conditioning. So that\u2019s a pretty long list and then kind of flat positive, slightly positive to flat would be construction, process and semiconductors.","Now coming back to all the negatives, because there was a long list of negatives, I want to just read off now the ones that are tracking positive year-over-year keep in mind that what I said earlier the fourth quarter it tends to be stronger than the first. So maybe this is a better indicator where these segments really are headed.","So, the ones that are tracking positive year-over-year are machine tools, general industrial, oil and gas, marine, forestry, power gen and commercial refrigeration and commercial air conditionings. We can see on a year-over-year basis, we still see positive trends in all of those segments as well.","Just coming back for a second on the 3\/12 and the 12\/12, I mentioned distribution being strong and heavy-duty truck being strong. Those are the two strongest segments for us on the positive side that the \u2013 the distribution on a 3\/12 basis is running at 108, and on an order trend basis and on a 12\/12 is running at a 108. So, continues to run extremely strong for us and keep in mind distribution is half of our industrial business. So that bodes very well.","Strong likewise as heavy-duty truck running that question, last year this was running pretty, quite opposite, quite negative. But now it\u2019s running positive 3\/12 at a 110, 12\/12 at a 109. So those are very strong. I mentioned, Ag is weakening the 3\/12 on Ag is 73 that shouldn\u2019t surprise anybody and the 12\/12 is at 90. So that continues to weaken.","Construction and Semicon are pretty flat, process slight increase 3\/12 is running at a 100, 12\/12 is at 97 due to the slight increase in process industries. And Aerospace is very strong 3\/12 bounces between a 100 and 120 and the 12\/12 at 110. So, those would be hopefully that wasn\u2019t overly confusing, or probably have to go back and re-read some of those, but that\u2019s how we see it here. And I think it\u2019s important to kind of compare the year-over-year numbers, because of the difference in the quarters, fourth quarter being strong than the first.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","One quick follow up, can we talk about pricing, is there any movement in pricing at all in the industry?","Don Washkewicz","Pricing and raw materials first of all, let me just touch on raw materials, because it\u2019s tied in with pricing. We\u2019re seeing quite a few of the inputs there as far as raw materials going up, steel and aluminum both are going up a little more to actually up to 20%. This is comparing trends from October last year to October this year. And copper is down just slightly, steel is up. So, what we\u2019re doing is as we have done in the past, our time for reviewing pricing on the distribution channel is January and July. So, we\u2019ll approach, we\u2019re going to be approaching that here in the next month or two.","So, I anticipate we will maybe making some adjustments depending on the raw material involved in the product involved. Keep in mind that our goal here is for the, we have like what we call PI index that purchasing price index, the goal is to keep that less than 1, we\u2019ve been running less than 1. So, we\u2019ve been recouping any increases in our input cost effectively. And the other thing we track very closely worldwide is our sell price index and that\u2019s been tracking greater than 1. So, it has been running greater than 1 for considerable period of time.","So, we\u2019re recovering basically what that tells is recovering our cost plus the margin. So there will be some adjustments in January and if these increases continue, we\u2019ll have to adjust them again mid-year. And then the other thing we do is for the OEMs, we look at the pricing at the anniversary of the contracts that we have with the OEMs and make the appropriate adjustments and negotiate those adjustments at that time.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi good morning, can year hear me.","Pam Huggins","Hi Jamie, yes we can hear you.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","And Pam congratulations.","Pam Huggins","Thank you, Jamie.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","So, just a couple of questions and I apologize, because this is like four different calls going on at the same time. But, can you just give us an update, on the Aerospace side your confidence level with the margin projections that you guys have given where we are in the first quarter and the headwinds that we\u2019ve experienced over the past couple of years? And then my follow up question is just back sorry again on the share repurchase again, can you just talk, you talk to your assumptions of the timeline, but can you just talk to how you plan to finance, would you take on that should be expected to be, you will just use your free cash flow, will you repatriate cash from oversees, if you can just walk through that? Thanks.","Jon Marten","Okay Jamie, Jon here. First on the Aerospace margins, we\u2019re expecting to be coming right around guidance. We had a slight beat here in Q1. We are concerned as always about the trends that we see and the development expenses. That might be a little bit higher than what we were talking about for the year, maybe $5 million to $10 million. But, still we\u2019re expecting R&D as a percent of sales around 9% for the year and we\u2019re expecting our guidance at \u2013 we\u2019re expecting the results to come in right at the 13.5 range.","Now in terms of the share buyback, we\u2019re going just use cash that we have on hand in the U.S. as well as our, Commercial Paper line that we have that we use that you\u2019ll see that and it\u2019s payable portion of our balance sheet and so it\u2019s just the cash that we generate, the cash that we have here in the U.S. and our Commercial Paper line that\u2019s how we plan to fund the share repurchases. Money that is oversees, we\u2019re \u2013 it has been permanently reinvested oversees.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","All right, thank you.","Jon Marten","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Raso with ISI Group. Please proceed.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Hi, just quick question on the sales guidance for International, I was curious you lowered it solely on currency. Can you take us through the moving parts geographically, did you raise your outlook on Asia to offset a weaker outlook on Europe or is everything generally been maintained?","Don Washkewicz","Well David just big picture, you are correct, we Asia is trending better than we expected and so, the trends in Asia are offsetting the weakness that we\u2019re seeing in Europe without regard to the currency as it turns out the currency offsets the impact overall internationally, but when you break it down a little bit further we are seeing some pretty good growth and better than we expected in Asia and in some of our key end markets.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Can you flush that out a little bit where is Asia providing you the upside?","Don Washkewicz","Well, it\u2019s \u2013 this would go along with some of our rail businesses, our marine businesses, our oil and gas businesses. This would be centered around some of our engineering materials group, some of our filtration group, some of our life sciences businesses that are cut across all of our groups. So it\u2019s no one end market David, but it\u2019s \u2013 but it\u2019s the mobile construction which of course is been a problem is flattening out there and again we\u2019re seeing another end market, other key end markets in Asia some of the signs of mid-single digit to a little bit higher growth there in some those of markets that I just mentioned.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","So the net ex-currency is international is still expected to be up a little bit, can you help us a little bit with how much is Europe down in that total International up slightly ex-currency?","Don Washkewicz","Yeah, I don\u2019t want to give you an impression that Europe is down very big, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s just down slightly, it\u2019s relatively flat, it\u2019s just the currency that we seeing that we\u2019re calling out here on the call. And Asia is up slightly, but I don\u2019t want to give you the impression that in our guidance Europe is coming in extremely weak it is not, it\u2019s coming in right as we have kind of put our guidance together just slightly, slightly down but not significant at all.","Jon Marten","And David, just kind of regrouping back at the order trends, that\u2019s evidenced by the order trends of 3\/12 being running at about a 112, 12\/12 at 100. So it\u2019s pretty flat.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO. Please proceed.","Joel Tiss \u2013 BMO","Hey guys, how is it going?","Pam Huggins","Good, how are you?","Joel Tiss \u2013 BMO","That\u2019s good, all right. This other expense line, I don\u2019t know if you talked about that or not, it\u2019s down $26 million in the quarter, I just wondered what was in there?","Jon Marten","Well in the \u2013 on the other expense it is really a reduction in our stock option expenses just less stock option expense. We do that once a year in the company and it came in significantly lower for that line that we in plan drill. So that\u2019s what we called out in our opening comments.","Joel Tiss \u2013 BMO","And is there any reason why well to sort of going to blue two weird questions together, is there any reason why you\u2019re not updating your long-term operating margin targets. You always talked about 15% seems like your pretty there now, I just wondered if there is another level. And any reason why you\u2019re not including share repurchase in your forward guidance?","Jon Marten","Well in terms of the share repurchase in the forward guidance, because it is likely to be lumpy as time goes on. We\u2019ve thought the best thing to do for everybody understanding the models that we\u2019re working with is to just give the advice that it would be, just straight lined over the next 24 months. And in terms of the \u2013 in terms of updating our long-term operating margins, of course we would, we don\u2019t see a limit to the up increasing margins that we are seeing right now. We feel like that 15% is always been the number that has been over the cycle that is something that we\u2019ve been really keyed on in areas of the world like we are right now and North America we\u2019re able to 18. And so, it is something that we are very proud of here, but we don\u2019t want to set a new level of expectations at this point. Don, but you want to add on to that?","Don Washkewicz","I would just say that, if you look at what we were heading, we\u2019re at 15% here; we\u2019re going to close the year at 15%. And what I would consider kind of medio per year, with two of our regions doing recently well North America and then Asia. And two pretty much flat under back being Europe and Latin America. So, I think you can see that any tailwind that we get, going forward is just going to be accretive to our margins. I think it\u2019s going to obviously be accretive to the MROS that will be generating.","I think when you look at Aerospace, Aerospace is still well below where we think it will ultimately be and I think as we bleed off some of the R&D, the NRE expense, that R&D that we\u2019ve been experiencing because of the new programs. I think you\u2019re going to see margin improvement certainly across that platform. I think the other thing is, you\u2019ve heard now about our self-help program, everybody was very positive on that this last year. And we appreciate that the fact that you\u2019d hung in with us through that process. And but we\u2019re not done, there is some more restructuring going on right now, some of that\u2019s baked in to the obviously, into the numbers that you see. But as we fully appreciate the full impact of all of these restructuring that\u2019s going to help margins as well.","The other thing going on in the company that we don\u2019t talk about a whole lot certainly on these cost is the innovation and as we drive more and more innovation new product, new to the world, new to the industry type products out there, our margins are going to increase. And then lastly, I would say and we already talked a little bit about this was our distribution channel, we continue to add distributions somewhere in the world everyday we\u2019re adding distribution whether it would be a ParkerStore, HOSE DOCTOR a distributor at principal location or something somewhere in the world, something is going on every day, we want to continue building on that.","So, I think when you talk margins in the company, we don\u2019t know how high this can grow. I mean frankly we\u2019re taking one year of time, and of course everything is fluid. So, things change every year and we\u2019re just going to take a one year of time and I think though the trend, you can see when we are at 13%, we were getting questions Don, I think you are peaked out at 13% and then I said no, we\u2019re going for 15%, when we got the 14% I was getting the same questions, you think that\u2019s about it, I said no, I think we can go higher and 15%. And so, I think we\u2019re going to see, I think the good news is we have a lot of great things happening in the company and we\u2019re going to be moving this \u2013 the need as far as we possibly can and better days are ahead let me just leave it at that.","Joel Tiss \u2013 BMO","All right, thank you very much.","Pam Huggins","Thanks Joel.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please proceed.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Thank you.","Pam Huggins","Good morning Alex.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Good morning and congratulations Pam.","Pam Huggins","Thank you.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","A quick question on the \u2013 the payout ratio that you indicated. If you take the new quarterly dividend rate $2.52 a year and divide that by the midpoint of your guidance, is a 32.5% payout. To be a 30% payout you would have to earn $8.40 here. So, could you just clarify that?","Jon Marten","Well Alex, Jon here. My math comes up a little bit differently, here we\u2019ve got, I\u2019m showing at around 31, but of course you\u2019re not far off. So, we are of course going to always grow. We\u2019re at, we have not talked about our FY\u201916 and what we expected FY\u201916 in terms of the top-line growth as well as EPS. But our goal that we have set a few years ago it was to get to a 30% payout ratio. And I don\u2019t think that there is anything wrong with the calculation that you just did. And but, I\u2019m not sure you might want to just check your calculations on the share buybacks and what the straight line of the share buybacks would give you in terms of the 31, I think it might move from 31 to maybe around 28 or 29.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","And so you\u2019re at 30, so you are 31% takes into account reduction number of shares?","Jon Marten","31% is that exist right now today uses the current shares.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Oh current shares?","Jon Marten","Yeah, but I think that if you \u2013 if you just assumed in your calculation the advice that we gave at the outset, I think it will go below 30.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","You know I just did a simple calculation.","Jon Marten","Right.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Dividend were 8 per share divided by earnings per share.","Jon Marten","Right.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay I see were just high. All right the second question sort of relates to Joel\u2019s previous question, you had an incremental margin overall 111% in the quarter with profit up 49 million on 44 million increase of sales. And that was composed of 33% incremental margin in North America and then in rest of world and Aerospace you had higher profit on lower sales. So that was the result of your restructuring program which I assume continue to show some results this year. But going forward after that and relating to the possibility of even higher operating margins, what do you think you can generate normally as the incremental operating margin without any further restructuring?","Jon Marten","Normally?","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Normally going forward after the restructuring is all in, why would you continue to expect leverage?","Jon Marten","Our cost structure right now normally will give us about a 30% margin return on sales as the business unfolds overtime. That\u2019s what our cost structure gives us across the Board for all of the segments.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","30% well, of course if you carry that out for ever you would raise your operating margin 30% ultimately.","Jon Marten","Right, right.","Pam Huggins","Thanks Alex, we try to make people understand that. So, thank you, you just have that.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","My point is that there is upper limit, but is pretty it can be well above where you are now.","Jon Marten","Right, yes sir.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay thank you.","Pam Huggins","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham. Please proceed.","Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham","Hi good morning guys.","Pam Huggins","Good morning Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham","So, just a couple of clarifications, first on the pacing of the buyback. I guess, first why not try to frontload that to the extent that, that the free cash flow enables it? And then I guess secondly, just looking out into the coming years, especially with the CEO transition coming up. How should we think about, any discretion on the low end of that range to the extent deals come up? I would imagine that whoever takes the reigns from down here, wouldn\u2019t want to feel handcuffed by a program, should we think of that $2 billion is being aligned in the sand and if something comes along they are still able to do that, how does, how should that transpire?","Don Washkewicz","We, this is Don. We think that, first of all there is no big acquisition that we\u2019re looking at right now, as I talked about earlier. So the smaller ones that we anticipate coming through will be able to handle those in the normal course, okay. We\u2019re not using every last bit of capacity that we have. So there will be enough capacity to handle a number of smaller ones tuck-in type acquisitions like we\u2019ve \u2013 you\u2019ve seen us do on the past pretty effectively. So, I don\u2019t think we will be tying anyone\u2019s hands going forward, as far as the ability to continue down that path and we do want to continue down that path, because we do want to grow the acquisitions as well as internal growth. What was the other question that?","Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham","You got it item both together, so that was helpful and I guess just as a follow-up Don you mentioned, a couple of whale sized properties that you were looking and the space, and you think from an end market perspective that you could share, color on where you guys were focused?","Don Washkewicz","No I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t think we want to do that, because of the sensitivity of course of the companies that we\u2019re looking at and the people there. We did have a confidentiality agreement; we are going to honor that even going forward. So, we won\u2019t be disclosing any specifics. Suffice it to say though, these properties has everything we do, makes perfect sense and I would assure you that you would agree with us, would make perfect sense for the company. It\u2019s focused on motion and control, it\u2019s accretive, they are synergistic. Everything that we would do is not going to often and let feel somewhere. So, and it would be good for their company, as we were able to do that.","So, I\u2019m still optimistic that down the road that we\u2019ll have another shot at a couple of these potentially. So, but we won\u2019t go on the specifics as far as segment or name or anything for obvious reasons.","Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham","Understood, thank you very much.","Pam Huggins","Thank you, Josh.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks, good morning everyone.","Pam Huggins","Good morning John, welcome.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning Pam, thank you and congratulations.","Pam Huggins","Thank you.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So, I just want to ask about the financing again of the share repurchase, I think based on the previous quarter or Q almost all of your cash, Jon was oversees. So, if you, if your sort of stepping this out your dividend is up, and all your cashes oversees did that imply that the repurchase if it\u2019s going to be linear mostly has to be financed with Commercial Paper. And I just, I\u2019m trying to understand the mechanics of how you afford this, it\u2019s in fact it didn\u2019t really have any cash, in the U.S. begin with and you\u2019ve just jacked up your dividend commendably in the U.S. which has to be paid with U.S. dollars?","Jon Marten","Right, well, all of your facts are absolutely correct, all of the cash on our balance sheet that you were looking at June 30th was oversees and we use the cash that we generate here in the U.S. I think the in order to pay down CP or to take care of ongoing U.S. need. And so, we would do that same for our share repurchase program, we would use the U.S. cash that we generate which is a significant portion of our free cash flow of course. And we would use our credit line that we have established as it is right now on CP in order to work on the program going forward. And so as we model the straight line guidance that we gave to you, because of the cash generating ability of the company we feel that we can fund the share repurchase quite nicely.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Maybe another way ask this was, if you prior to the dividend increase in share repurchase authorization, you were generating healthy profit in the U.S. and you wouldn\u2019t have the cash on balance sheet. So, where was the cash going that now allows you to use that cash to in turn fund these actions, that\u2019s maybe the better question?","Jon Marten","I don\u2019t have the exact numbers in front of me John, but in the round numbers, I think we took our notes payable line if you look on our balance sheet down approximately in the last 12 months as we were going through this review of this very big opportunities as Don was talking to you about by a total just for those, just for a total of about $900 million in the last 12 months. That could be wrong from that stat, but that\u2019s if you look at the notes payable line in the reduction and that\u2019s where you will see that.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And that\u2019s probably the filler. And then just big picture I mean be commendably by $0.25, you know it seems like maybe half of that was below or I\u2019m sorry $0.05 that was below the line $0.19 now from currency, we just sort we had the moving parts and it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re really given that you raise the guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint giving yourself much credit for the opportunity based on improving orders. I mean are you, well I mean how much of the $0.10 if you will comes from an expectation that, these improved orders in North America and oversees actually roll through to the rest of the quarters?","Jon Marten","Well I think all of the $0.10 is, is really tied into the increased, confidence that we have in our guidance that we set up for the year that we are maintaining in terms of the top-line, but for the translational impact of that you have a strong dollar. So, as we look at that and our guidance. We wanted to take the guidance up by $0.10 and as we kind of added up all the numbers from all around the hurdle that\u2019s the way that, that our calculations came together. And so, I think that our order rates support that, our order rates support our guidance and mind the strongest order rates are in North America and our guidance is over 5% increasing volume in North America.","So, I think it ties together quite nicely, looking at the trends in the orders and we feel very confident in our guidance going forward. Hopefully that helps you John.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","That is, thank you.","Pam Huggins","Thank you, John. We are now five minutes past the hour.

Good morning and welcome to Parker Hannifin's second quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks. Today's presentation slides, together with the audio webcast replay, will be accessible on the company's investor information website at phstock.com for one year following today's call.","On slide number two, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement, addressing forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's materials and are also posted on Parker's website at phstock.com.","Today's agenda appears on slide number three. We'll begin with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, providing highlights from the second quarter. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's second quarter performance, together with the revised guidance for the full year fiscal 2020. Tom will then provide a few summary comments and we'll open the call for a question-and-answer session.","Please refer now to slide number four and Tom will get us started. ","Tom Williams","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to the call and thanks for your interest in Parker. Let me start with some strategic highlights. First of all, we are very pleased to report that despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, our margins and our cash flow are all-time highs, relative to previous downturns. I think the best way to compare this -- the best way to do it apples-to-apples is look at the base business without lowering side and compare to prior downturns.","When you look at our second quarter FY 2020 adjusted operating margin without acquisitions, that came in at 16.1%. This compares to our previous best recession performance, which was in FY 2016, and that Q2 adjusted operating margins were 13.5%. Both of these recessions had about similar organic sales declines and this represents a 260 basis point improvement comparing that to our best previous recession performance. Really, a remarkable performance and really my thanks to everybody around the world for doing such a great job.","In addition to the margin improvement, cash flow from operating activities was an all-time year-to-date Q2 record. This performance demonstrates that we are building a more resilient business that is poised for accelerated earnings growth as the market turns.","Strong FY 2020 margin performance and cash flow generation so far are really a reflection of the improvements driven by The Win Strategy and the strengthening of our portfolio by buying companies that are accretive to growth into margins. So we are excited about where we are and we're excited about where we're going to go in the future.","Shifting to safety. We had a 25% reduction in recordable incidents in Q2. Really making great progress here and my thanks again to everybody for their effort on this and their dedication to safety. Our recordable incident rate and what that is to people that aren't familiar with that, that is the number of safety incidents we have per 102 members that is now top quartile versus our project peers. And there's a very strong linkage.","You've heard me talk about is between safety and business performance. If you were to apply our safety metrics and our financial metrics you'll see them moving in tandem in a positive direction.","So some summary comments on Q2, sales were our second quarter record as acquisition revenue offset soft organic sales. Organic sales declined as we expected with improvement in international organic sales versus our guide. The 737 Max issues impacted our aerospace business as Q2 airframe and engineers were slowed in advance of the production pause.","Strong adjusted EBITDA margins were significantly higher than they were during the last recession. We came in at Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.5% again really strong performance. Earnings in the quarter were excellent and adjusted EPS exceeded expectations.","Order rates in the quarter continued to be negative impacting organic growth. And the portfolio additions that we have made are certainly going to help our organic growth over time.","We've acquired businesses that are more resilient with higher organic growth rates than legacy Parker. We're well positioned for excellent performance in the second half of FY 2020 and beyond that.","I want to move now to year-to-date cash flow. You've heard me talk about how this is such a strategic priority for us. We want to be great generation deployers of cash to drive excellent returns for our shareholders. We've achieved the best-ever cash flow from operations of any first half in our history. And given current market conditions that's really commendable.","Free cash flow to sales is about 10% and we're expecting to achieve our 19th consecutive year of cash from operating activities as a percent of sales in excess of 10% for FY 2020. The year-to-date free cash flow conversion was excellent at 130%.","Moving now to the outlook, we're increasing EPS guidance for FY 2020 on roughly flat sales to the prior year. This reflects strong Q2 performance which is being offset by the 737 Max and slightly weaker organic sales in the second half versus our prior guide.","Our guidance assumes no additional 737 Max sales for the balance of FY 2020. We are very excited about the future. We feel we're well positioned for growth with excellent margins and cash flow as the macro conditions improve.","Some of the factors that are driving this feeling of confidence will be first launching, The Win Strategy 3.0 which is going to drive a further step-change in the performance of the company really building on the momentum from the previous updates that we've made to The Win Strategy.","Second would be the portfolio strengthening that we've done through the strategic acquisitions that have come on board. We're very happy with how LORD and Exotic integrations are progressing and we can comment more about that in the Q&A.","And we recently had the leadership teams for both businesses here at headquarters talked about the -- incorporating The Win Strategy 3.0 their integration plans. It was a great session; a lot of good teamwork there.","And then third would be the launch of the purpose statement which is enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. This statement is a real source of pride for our organization. And we recognize that it takes being a top-quartile performing company to live up to the higher purpose.","Parker is transforming as evidenced by the higher level of performance that we're doing in a very difficult part of the business cycle with lots of opportunities to drive earnings growth beyond FY 2020.","Switching to the next slide, you'll see a reminder of our winning formula what we have characterized as our competitive differentiators. And I've talked about these before, so I'm not going to say highlight each one specific. I would just tell you this is -- this listing in aggregate is what makes us special. This is why customers come to us and this is why shareholders should think about investing in Parker.","If I had to reference one in particular these competitive differentiators, I would point out Win Strategy 3.0 and what we're -- the momentum and the performance enhancements that's going to create over time. And a lot more discussions will happen on that as we forward.","So my thanks to all the global team members for their continued and dedicated effort in creating a top-quartile company. And with that I'll hand it back to Cathy for more details on the quarter and the guidance.","Cathy Suever","Okay. Thanks Tom. I'd like you to now refer to slide number 6. This slide presents as reported and adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $2.54, compared to $2.51 for the same quarter a year ago. Adjustments from the fiscal year 2020 as reported results totaled $0.97 including before-tax amounts of business realignment charges of $0.08, acquisition costs to achieve of $0.05 and acquisition transaction expenses of $1.14. These were offset by the tax effect of these adjustments of $0.30. Prior year second quarter earnings per share had been adjusted by $0.15, the details of which are included in the reconciliation tables for non-GAAP financial measures.","On slide number 7, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $2.51 to the second quarter of fiscal -- for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to $2.54 for the second quarter of this year. Starting with the net decrease of $0.13 in segment operating income. For Legacy Parker, a $260 million decline in sales contributed to a $0.34 reduction in operating income. The Legacy Parker teams did a good job of controlling costs on this lower volume by sustaining a decremental margin of 23% for the quarter. The acquisitions contributed $0.21 partially offsetting this reduction.","Lower corporate G&A contributed $0.16 due to gains this year, compared to losses last year on market-adjusted investments tied to deferred compensation. Incremental interest expense on the debt borrowed for the acquisitions resulted in a $0.20 year-over-year decline in the current earnings per share.","Lower other expense of $0.07 benefited from interest income earned on the bond proceeds prior to the closing of the LORD acquisition. We gained $0.10 from a lower tax rate, primarily due to favorable discrete tax benefits and a lower share count benefited the current quarter $0.03.","Slide number 8 shows total Parker sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter. Organic sales decreased year-over-year by 7.1% and currency had a negative impact of 0.4%. These declines were more than offset by the positive impact of 8.2% from the acquisitions.","Total adjusted segment operating margins were 15.8% compared to 16.6% last year. This 80 basis point decline before the incremental amortization expense from the acquisitions. With the help of the Win Strategy tools, the Legacy Parker businesses managed to achieve good decremental margins of 23% on their lower sales volume.","On slide 9, we're showing the impact LORD and Exotic had on the second quarter fiscal year 2020. These results reflect a partial quarter of contribution from LORD since the acquisition closed on October 28; and a full quarter of Exotic, which closed on September 16. Sales from the acquisitions during the quarter were $286 million and operating income on an adjusted basis was $36 million during this stub period.","Moving to slide number 10. I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America.","For the second quarter North American organic sales were down 8.5%, while acquisitions contributed 7.3% to the segment. Operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis was 15.4% of sales versus 16% in the prior year. Incremental amortization of 75 basis points in the quarter more than accounted for the change in margins.","North America's legacy businesses generated a good decremental margin of 24%, reflecting the hard work of diligent cost containment and productivity improvements together with the impact of our Win Strategy initiatives.","Moving to the Diversified Industrial International segment on slide number 11, organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 9.4%.","Acquisitions contributed 4.5% to the segment and currency had a negative impact of 1.4%. Operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis was 14.6% of sales versus 15.7% in the prior year. Incremental amortization was 30 basis points in the quarter. The legacy businesses generated a very good decremental margin of 23% which was partially offset by contributions from the acquisitions.","I'll now move to slide number 12 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Aerospace Systems sales increased $111 million or 18% from acquisitions and 1.3% from organic sales. Growth in military OEM and commercial aftermarket sales were largely offset by lower commercial OEM sales and military aftermarket sales.","Operating margin for the second quarter was 18.5% of sales versus 19.7% last year. Incremental amortization expense of 160 basis points more than accounted for the change in margins. Good margin performance from Exotic and hard work by the teams on productivity improvements, helped contribute to the strong performance in the quarter.","On slide number 13 we report cash flow from operating activities. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $826 million or 12.1% of sales. This compares to 10.7% of sales for the same period last year after last year's number is adjusted for a $200 million discretionary pension contribution. That's a year-over-year increase of 11%. Free cash flow for the current quarter was 10.4% of sales and the conversion rate to net income was 130%.","Moving to slide number 14, we show the details of order rates by segment. As a reminder these orders results exclude acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average.","Continued declines in the industrial markets resulted in total orders dropping 3%. This year-over-year decline is made up of a 7% decline from Diversified Industrial North American orders and a 6% decline from Diversified Industrial International orders offset by a positive 12% increase from Aerospace Systems orders.","Moving to slide number 15. The full year earnings guidance for fiscal year 2020 is outlined. This guidance has been revised to align to current macro conditions and includes the impact of the LORD and Exotic acquisitions. Guidance is being provided on both an as reported and an adjusted basis.","Total sales for the year with the help from acquisitions are now expected to be flat compared to prior year. Anticipated full year organic change at the midpoint is a decline of 6.4%. Currency is expected to have a negative 0.5% impact on sales. And acquisitions will add 6.9% to the current year.","We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended December 31, 2019 and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2020. Considering the uncertainty of the regulatory clearance of the 737 MAX, we have now excluded all 737 MAX sales for the balance of the fiscal year 2020.","For total Parker, as reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 15.1% and 15.5%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 16.0% and 16.4%. We have not adjusted the incremental amortization expense of approximately $100 million, we will incur in fiscal year 2020 as a result of the two acquisitions.","The full year effective tax rate is projected to be 22.5%. The second quarter tax rate was favorably impacted by discrete items which we don't forecast for the balance of the year. We continue to anticipate a tax rate from continuing operations of 23.3% for the remainder of the year.","For the full year, the guidance range for earnings per share on an as reported basis is now $8.78 to $9.38 or $9.08 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is now $10.25 to $10.85 or $10.55 at the midpoint. The adjustments to the as reported forecast made in this guidance include business realignment expenses of approximately $40 million for the full year fiscal 2020 with the associated savings projected to be $15 million this year.","Synergy savings from CLARCOR are still estimated to achieve a run rate of $160 million by the end of fiscal year 2020, which represents an incremental $35 million of year-end savings. In addition, guidance on an adjusted basis excludes $27 million of integration costs to achieve for LORD and Exotic and $185 million of one-time acquisition-related expenses.","LORD and Exotic are expected to achieve synergy savings of $18 million this fiscal year. A reconciliation and further details of these adjustments can be found in the appendix to this morning's slides.","Savings from all business realignment and acquisition costs to achieve are fully reflected in both the as reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges. We ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison.","Some additional key assumptions for full year 2020 guidance at midpoint are sales are divided 48%, second half 52% -- sorry 48% first half, 52% second half. Adjusted segment operating income is split 49% first half, 51% second half. Adjusted EPS second half is -- first half second half is divided 50%, 50%.","Third quarter fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $2.36 per share at the midpoint and this excludes $18 million of projected business realignment expenses, $7 million of integration costs to achieve and $19 million of one-time acquisition related expenses.","On slide 16, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of revised fiscal year 2020 adjusted EPS guidance of $10.55 per share at the midpoint, compared to the prior guidance of $10.50 per share.","During the second quarter, stronger than guided sales together with meaningfully higher segment operating margins from the industrial segment generated a net $0.17 operating income beat. Strong gains in market adjusted investments tied to deferred compensation and lower than guided interest expense contributed a benefit of $0.08 and favorable discrete tax benefits during the quarter helped to contribute $0.07, totaling to a $0.32 EPS beat in the quarter.","Updates to the second half guide result in a $0.04 increase in operating income offset by a $0.30 negative impact to operating income from the elimination of 737 MAX shipments in the second half. Updates to the below the line items resulted in a net $0.01 decline. This results in a net $0.05 increase to the fiscal 2020 full year guided earnings per share at the midpoint.","On slide 17, we show the impact the acquisitions will have on both an as reported and adjusted basis for the full year. On an adjusted basis the acquisitions lower operating margin to 16.2% for total Parker from 16.6% for Legacy Parker impacted by the $100 million or 70 basis points of full year FY 2020 incremental amortization expense. For the adjusted EBITDA margins, the acquisitions provide 50 basis points of improvement, moving from 18.1% for Legacy Parker to 18.6% for total Parker.","If you'll now go to slide 18, I'll turn it back to Tom for summary comments.","Tom Williams","Thanks Cathy. We're pleased with the continued progress. We are performing well for this downturn as demonstrated by our cash flow performance and our ability to raise the floor on margins. We're well on our way to delivering top-quartile financial performance as a company.","I just want to remind people where we're trying to drive to as far as we're laser focused on our FY 2023 targets and those are sales growth at 150 basis points greater than global industrial production growth, segment operating margins at 19%, EBITDA margins at 20%, free cash flow conversion greater than 100%. And those would all culminate in driving an EPS CAGR of 10% plus. So thanks again to the global team everybody around the world for all your hard work.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Liz to start the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is now open.","Mig Dobre","Yes. Good morning, everyone.","Lee Banks","Yes. Good morning, Mig.","Mig Dobre","Maybe just very quickly some clarification on what's embedded is segment level for organic growth, especially in your industrial business?","Tom Williams","Mig, it's Tom. So what we assumed for \u2013 I'm just going to give you for the second half with the new guide was North America at minus seven, international at minus 12, aerospace at minus 0.5 gets to the second half at a minus 7.5. And that compares to the prior guide was minus six. Big difference there being a little bit of weakness in North America but the big difference was a shift in the mix.","Mig Dobre","Understood. Then if I may on international, I think you said negative 12 for the second half?","Tom Williams","Yes. Yes.","Mig Dobre","So if I'm comparing that with what you've done in \u2013 in the first half there is some deceleration there? And obviously your orders are looking a little bit different in that regard being less bad if you would. So can you help us understand kind of how you're seeing it and what's going on there?","Tom Williams","Yes. So our thinking on \u2013 again Mig. it's Tom. Our thinking on the orders and the sales for international, first of all, you're right. So orders came in at minus six. They did improve in Q2 but that was driven mainly by Asia. And from what we can tell, a lot of that was influenced by some pull-ins in advance of Chinese New Year. So we feel these order rates may be a little bit overstated or maybe not entirely reflective of underlying market conditions.","And then given the uncertainties of the Coronavirus and the fact the Chinese government has extended Chinese, New Year by one week, we actually had our Asia team just within the last 48 hours redo the second half forecast on what they thought. And their latest thinking which is obviously very fluid given what's going on there is now reflected in this new guide.","And ironically it came in about the same as what we had before. We were minus 11.5 before, we were minus 12 million. But that was our thinking is that combination of the orders are a little bit over-enhanced from the pull-ins and our current intelligence-based on what's going on is reflected in this guide.","Mig Dobre","I appreciate that. Not to put too fine a point but as we're sort of thinking about the Q3, specifically in Asia, in China, how do we think about that in terms of the negative 12 for the back half of the year? Thank you.","Tom Williams","Yes. So I'm not going to split it out necessarily by region but we have international for Q3 at about minus 16. So the worst of it hitting in Q3, you got the Chinese, New Year, the extension of that. There's some obvious reasons why Q3 might be impacted worse.","Mig Dobre","Great. Thank you, Tom.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Mig.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Cathy Suever","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones","Maybe I'll just start with a question on pricing. I mean you were kind of getting to the peak of the negative comps in this part of the down cycle. Are you guys seeing any pressure coming from customers? Any kind of aggressive or irrational behavior from competitors in the market out there? I know you guys are always targeting being price\/cost neutral? Are you still able to maintain that at the moment? And do you think you can maintain it for the rest of the year?","Lee Banks","Yes. Nathan, it's Lee. To answer your question is yes. As you know, our goal always is to be price\/cost-neutral, margin-neutral. And I think why we're so resilient in doing that are the processes that we have? We follow the input costs through our purchase price index and we have our selling price index that we track at all the different locations. But in our forecast and what we're expecting is to be price\/cost-neutral, margin-neutral.","Nathan Jones","Okay. You guys have also -- I mean, you've taken the margin expectation in aerospace down, which I think is fairly straightforward, right? You've got less volume from the MAX, so you're not going to say the leverage on that. You did take the margin expectations in both North America and international up. Can you talk about what's going on there, whether it's internal productivity? Or what else has led to an expectation of better margins for the full year than you had previously baked into guidance?","Tom Williams","Nathan, its Tom. I think what we're experiencing, what we said, and you saw a lot of that in the first half; I'd take North America as an example. We had some benefits from lower synergies pulling in from what we had originally expected, The Win Strategy and everything we're doing there. We've seen a lot of help from Kaizen activities at all of our plants.","On international, we had a very strong Q2, driven somewhat with higher volume burst of our guide. But the same thing for international, Kaizen activities, The Win Strategy, we had the benefit of prior restructuring that is playing through for us there. And I think it just gave us confidence that when we looked at our second half that we could continue that in the second half. The organic growth is slightly different, slightly worse than the prior guide. But we didn't think it was enough to -- we felt we had enough other positives to offset that and to improve the margins.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I'll pass it on.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Nathan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Cathy Suever","Good morning, Joe.","Nathan Jones","Tom, I just want to clarify the MAX comment that you made. I think you said that it impacted 2Q. And so, if it did, like, what kind of impact did it have on 2Q? And then secondly, as you think about the zero for the second half of the year, is it just fair to assume that airframers have inventory on hand and that's why the MAX is going to zero in 2H?","Tom Williams","Yes. So let me just -- Joe, this is Tom. Glad you asked, because I wanted to give a little bit of color as to why we did what we did on the MAX. First, given Boeing's public comments about the ungrounding occurring sometime in the middle of the year, we felt that, hey, there's a lot of uncertainty there. Even Boeing doesn't fully know exactly what's going to happen with that, once suppliers will turn back on. And that we really wanted to derisk the guidance for the rest of the fiscal year by taking the MAX out.","I also felt that it wasn't fair to our shareholders to have it in and then be guessing on what it's going to be and what kind of ramps it could be. I thought it was a disservice to our shareholders and that it would be much better perceived stronger by taking it completely out and showing that we could demonstrate the guidance that we're going to -- that we have here, even without the MAX.","So what we did is -- so the production pause officially started January 15. However, when you look at what hit us in Q2, there was some minor slowing of orders, both on the airframe and the engine side. It was approximately $5 million in Q2. The total amount for us for the full year, including Q2 and the second half, is $150 million impact for the MAX and $50 million of earnings. Obviously, lower volume and the lack of absorption associated with that.","But obviously Boeing and as well as all of our customers are really important to us. We're going to be there to support them whenever the production returns. If it happens to return sooner what we have in this guidance we'll be there for them. And in the meantime, we're reallocating our team members to other programs as much as possible to help with backlog and potentially accelerating schedules of our customers permit that. So that's really the strategy and the thinking behind the MAX.","Joe Ritchie","That's super helpful Tom. And then maybe if you can just, kind of, talk about the North America weakness in a little bit more detail, just parsing out like what you're seeing from a distributor perspective versus what you're seeing on the heavy industry side and how you expect that to play out in your fiscal second half?","Tom Williams","Okay. So Joe what I'll do is I'll go through North America, but I'll just maybe run through the whole company on markets, because it's typically a question people want. But our thinking on North America, we're guiding 100 bps lower than what the prior guide. So it was minus six. Now it's minus seven. I'm just talking about the second half because, obviously, that's what's left.","Orders were down from -- 100 basis points from Q1 to Q2. So that's probably the most direct linkage there. We had distribution weaker. We have the December ISM at 47.2. And all those factors plus, obviously, every time we do this we do a bottoms-up. We really look at what our thinking was there.","I went through international, but I wanted to make a comment about distribution when I think about North America. So distribution and the whole for the whole company was down mid-single digits about 400 basis points worse than Q1. And this declined pretty much sequentially through the quarter and really was broad-based from an end-market standpoint.","International distribution was worse in North America, but about all the regions went down equally approximately going Q1 to Q2. In North America in particular, we think the holiday timing hurt. There's two Wednesdays involved there for Christmas and New Year's Day. And really what we saw with end customers is that drove extended plant shutdowns. And our distributors as a result of this broad market based decline and the extended shutdowns took the opportunity to resize their inventory.","So if you think about down mid-single digits on distribution, our best intelligence and again this is an estimate it was about half of that was destocking. Half of it was tied in markets. Maybe if I go back to just total end markets, I'm just going to list all of the positives and the negatives and I'll give maybe a little more color on the specific end markets. But on the positive side for the quarter Q2 total Parker, aerospace, mining, semiconductor, lawn and turf and marine. And then minus was distribution, which was -- I was just talking about. It's not a market but an important channel to us.","Mills and foundries, refrigeration, machine tools, tire and rubber, power generation, telecom, life sciences, oil and gas, automotive, heavy-duty truck, construction, ag, forestry and rail this is too long a list on the negative side.","So -- but let me give you some color if I was to, kind of, lift it up to the major segments. So I talked about distribution. So now I'd just characterize industrial end markets. For those maybe not familiar, all of our industrial markets are basically things without wheels things that don't move equipment that doesn't move. That was -- that improved. So, industrial markets went from minus nine to minus 6.5, again total company.","The positive side of there was low single-digit improvements in mining and semiconductor. Semiconductor is starting to come back. On the negative side, low single digits. I'm just going to give you buckets. Low single digits was mills, oil and gas. Mid-single digits was refrigeration, power gen and general industrial. And things greater than 10% declines were machine tools, rubber and tire, telecom and life science.","Then on the mobile side, again equipment with wheels saw us go from minus 6.5 in Q1 to minus 14. So that was the big shift. A lot of that was driven in North America. And the positives there was mid-single-digit improvements in lawn and turf.","And then on the negatives, kind of, two buckets here, high single-digit decline in forestry. But then almost all the end markets with mobile were kind of in that 10% to 20% decline range: automotive construction, heavy truck, ag, rail and material handling. And then Cathy alluded to in her comments about aerospace. I'm rounding to the nearest half. Up plus 1.5. We had commercial OE minus 3; military OE plus 2; commercial MRO plus 15; and military MRO down 5. Netted out to 1.5. So that's kind of the spend through the end markets, Joe, I hope you have a follow-up to that.","Joe Ritchie","No. I think I'm all good. Thanks. Thanks, Tom.","Cathy Suever","Thank you, Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Cathy Suever","Good morning, Nicole.","Nicole DeBlase","So, I guess, maybe focusing on the North America orders, we already talked a little bit about what happened in international. But what's your view on whether or not order activity has bottomed and maybe thinking about how January has trended as a way to characterize that?","Tom Williams","Nicole, its Tom. So if I was to kind of do what I did, I won't go into that same kind of detail for North America. But if you look at North America industrial, it went Q1 to Q2 basically about to say minus 5.5, minus 6. So basically the same quarter-over-quarter. The mobile is what declined the most. It went from minus 5 to minus 16. And all the same end markets that I just described for the total company, is what we saw there.","And then on distribution, that went from minus 2 to about -- I mean, it was flat in North America to about minus 4 or so -- in Q2. So that was 400 bps in North America alone that we went down. So that was kind of how we look at North America. I think, in general, when we think about organic growth for the year, we're really -- in our guidance, we're reflecting really Q3 is kind of our bottom from what we see at this point.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, Tom. And then just a quick one on the deals. I think you guys said that you're expecting $18 million of synergies, up a little bit from your prior guidance. Can you just say what you've realized in synergies in the second quarter? And what's remaining for the second half?","Cathy Suever","Yes. We saw a little bit of the synergies for LORD pull into the second quarter. The timing moves ahead for us, so we got them sooner than we anticipated. And so, we're then factoring that through the rest of the year as well. So, a small amount in Q2 with $18 million for the full year effect.","Nicole DeBlase","Got it. Thanks. I'll hop it on.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Nicole.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ann Duignan","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Cathy Suever","Good morning.","Ann Duignan","Good morning. Tom, would you just comment on the notion on that, while you've taken the downturn in aerospace because of the 737 MAX? Couldn't that also spill over into your industrial business more broadly, just from the supply chain and the supply base as they have to shut down production?","Tom Williams","Yes. Ann, its Tom. We did factor that in. Because people who don't realize that we'd have a fair amount of work that goes that's aerospace-related and engineered materials and filtration that goes into that. So the $150 million includes the industrial piece in that. And just in round numbers about 10% of that is industrial; and the other 90% as you might imagine, the bulk of it is in the Aerospace segment. But we did factor in the amount of onboard type of work we did. And then the -- I think what data part you're referring to is the things that might be in the factories of our suppliers. That's factored into the guide we have for the rest of the business.","Ann Duignan","Okay. That's -- I appreciate that. And then just circling back on the same topic, can you give us a breakdown, the $150 million? How much of that is Legacy Parker? And how much is Exotic Metals?","Tom Williams","So Exotic is $16 million of the $50 million.","Cathy Suever","$150 million.","Tom Williams","Of the $150 million, sorry. Yeah, $60 million of the $150 million.","Ann Duignan","$60 million of the $150 million?","Tom Williams","Yes.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And that includes both direct shipments content on the aircraft as well as shipments to the engine?","Tom Williams","Yes.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I appreciate that. I just wanted to get back color, and I think you\u2019d given us most of everything I\u2019m assuming. So, I appreciate it.","Tom Williams","Okay. Thank you.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. A nice quarter. I guess two questions Tom. Just in terms of as we exit 2020, potentially comps get better when we start to see organic growth reignite again. Based on what you've done with the acquisitions and when is there -- should we be thinking about incrementals any differently? And I'm wondering if there's a difference on how to think about things Industrial versus Aerospace I guess?","And then just my second question just relates to your portfolio given some of the announcements recently. One, do you see any change in the competitive landscape? Or could that be a positive for you with Eaton selling their hydraulics business? And just your view of -- is there any change in your view I guess of your portfolio in terms of potential divestitures? Thank you.","Tom Williams","Okay. Jamie, it's Tom. So I'm going to work backwards on the questions. I'll start with -- I think what you're referring to is the Danfoss Eaton announcement. I would first say we weren't surprised, given I think the portfolio that Eaton has. And I think some of our inclination as to what they might do with it.","We have a lot of respect for both Danfoss and Eaton. And in our view, strong competitors make you a better business. So we welcome the challenge. We like our chances. We believe that the breadth of our technologies, the growth that we have with the motion and control technology and the Win Strategy is going to allow us to compete effectively with any company in our space. And we're confident going forward.","Obviously when you have these, kind of, transitions, having done a lot of these type of acquisitions ourselves, we recognize that there's stress in the system when that happens. And there's maybe a potential opportunity to look at share gain. And so we will, obviously, be doing everything we can to optimize that and take advantage of that and good competitive tension in the system.","So if I move back to maybe your other two comments from incremental MROSs, kind of, looking forward. I still think plus 30 in general is a good number if you're doing it over multiple years. But clearly coming out of a downturn as we have talked about in the past, you would expect to see that be north of a plus 30, because you're going to get some help as that volume comes up. And you're going to be only adding incremental variable cost and doing it very efficiently as you do that. So I think the first couple of quarters coming out, tends to be stronger than what I would say you'd see over a whole cycle.","And then the whole goal of these acquisitions and they will but maybe I could just comment in general about them. I'm extremely pleased with the progress. We've acquired great products and technology but the best thing that we've done is the talent that's come into the organization from these two businesses.","It was on full display when we had the leadership meaning we have about 80 people from both businesses and together. And if I look at LORD, LORD is ahead of what we had hoped for, low single-digit growth and that compares to a minus 6.5% for total Parker. So it's doing what we wanted. It's more resilient.","And what we're seeing from the aerospace thermal management. The structural adhesives part of LORD is really doing quite nicely. We were very confident on the $125 million of cost synergies and we pulled in the synergies into this year.","Now with Exotic, the team is doing a great job. The 737 MAX is out of everybody's hands. That's something we can't control. But that team there is effectively redeployed everybody that was on the MAX and we've redeployed them to the F135. And we got to do some minor CapEx to help facilitate that. But we have them on F135.","We also have the repair depot starting up on the F135. And then we've got one of the big synergies which we didn't really disclose on our revenue side is the fact that we have this well-established aftermarket organization customer support operation as part of legacy Parker aerospace that can help with the commercial efforts of Exotic to go capture those legacy engines and to look for spares and repairs for all the type of products that Exotic does. And we're going to do that and we're going to try to pull them in.","And everything I just described in that is not going to really help so much Exotic in FY 2020 but it's really positioned for FY 2021. And the MAX will come back. And so I think we have the benefit there. There's potentially a one-two punch with Exotic MAX goes back. And then we've also got additional people trained.","Now some of the F135 will depend on our customer allowing us to accelerate the schedule. I think they have signaled that they would. But obviously, if some other supply becomes a constraint for them they might slow us down. But that's an opportunity to accelerate the F135. So that's kind of a long-winded answer on acquisitions.","But if you think about them in aggregate they're coming in they're going to grow faster than the legacy Parker. And that was the whole reason why we acquired them. You see the incremental EBITDA, what it's doing for us in one of the slides that Cathy had. So we're still very positive. The MAX is a short-term blip on the path to a pretty strong future for them.","Jamie Cook","Thank you. I appreciate the color.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jeff Sprague","Yes. Thank you. Good day, everyone. Just a couple of things for me. First just back to LORD, Tom. Can you address how it's performing kind of in the automotive markets? And you had pointed to kind of the ability to outgrow through thick and thin. We've heard a lot of the kind of negative automotive comments out of the 3Ms and DuPonts here this earnings season. Just wondering how things are really progressing for that slice of the business?","Tom Williams","Yes. So \u2013 and without getting into specific numbers, if I just take the three major buckets. Aerospace is a pretty strong growth for us. And then the industrial piece would be slightly negative and automotive would be neutral to slightly positive. And what's really happening there is the technologies we have there that are more electrification type of technologies which would be thermal management.","And structural adhesives are offsetting the weaknesses that we have. And the traditional adhesives and coatings they might be more supplied into the internal combustion engine. So I'm really happy with what they're doing, coming in at low single digits. And that's even factoring in some weakness in Asia tied to the Coronavirus. So those -- that's, obviously, a new element and that's an unknown still as -- and yet to be determined. But I'm really happy with what they're doing out of the gate.","Jeff Sprague","And I was curious back to the MAX situation. You provided a little detail on the redirect to the F135 et cetera. But have you actually shut down MAX related production? Or are you continuing at some low rate to keep the line warm? How do you manage that operationally to make sure you are ready to go if you get the signal?","Tom Williams","Well, obviously, that's a balancing act. So we redeployed the people. So we haven't lost that skill set for the most part. There's some we could not retain unfortunately, but we've retained most of them. So we have the skill set people wise. Obviously we'll make sure we maintain any of the equipment that needs to be maintained. So we're ready to go.","And with our supply chain, we're making sure that they're ready and able to supply to us when we need to. So if we need to carry a little extra inventory to be ready we'll do that. And our suppliers will be ready too. But I thought it was prudent for us and for our shareholders to not be trying to chase and guessing when the MAX is going to start back up. So we didn't build it in the guidance. But, obviously, internally we're going to make sure we built a supply chain that can respond. And, obviously, Boeing needs to give us some lead time and they recognize that they will. But we will be there to respond when Boeing gives us a signal.","Jeff Sprague","Right. Thank you.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joel Tiss","Hey guys, how it\u2019s going?","Cathy Suever","Good morning, Joel.","Joel Tiss","We've gotten a lot of good information here. So just a couple of like whatever clarification I guess. Are you guys giving any updates on your debt-to-EBITDA? Like where do you expect to be by when? Or is that more for the Analyst Day?","Cathy Suever","I can talk about that for you Joel. As we finished the quarter considering that we don't have a full 12 months of EBITDA from the acquisitions in there, we're currently at a gross debt-to-EBITDA as is four times. And our net debt is 3.6 times. We expect by the end of the year we'll have the gross debt down to 3.7 and the net debt down to 3.3. Again that's not -- that only has a sub period of EBITDA for the acquisitions in there. So it's actually -- next year will look -- quickly look a little better once we get 12 months of EBITDA.","Joel Tiss","And is there a target before you'd look at acquisitions again? Do you need to be closer to two, or is it more 2.5?","Tom Williams","Joel, it's Tom. I think as \u2013 2.0 is what we'd like to get to. But, obviously, as we start to glide closer to that we're -- obviously our interest is going to get more keen.","The key thing on what we've learned and it's not a new lesson over the years is you have to continually work that business development pipeline. We are working it now today as we speak, building those relationships, understanding the strategic fits to our company. And so we'll continue to do that. Even though we're not ready to action a thing, we'll continue to work that pipeline. But yes we need to get closer to two before we get back in the game.","Joel Tiss","Okay. And just one last quick one. You -- Jamie asked about PLS and you didn't really -- you missed that part of the question. I just wondered are there any, kind of, bigger chunks that you guys are seeing that could accelerate the restructuring. Or everything is pretty much as you expected and we just keep the incremental improvement?","Tom Williams","Joel help me with PLS?","Joel Tiss","Product line simplification, so looking at individual product lines and having them off or finding a better owner for them?","Tom Williams","Okay. Good. So yes, that's going to be a big but we will talk a lot about that at IR day. But the cliff notes is that still a really big part of our strategy going forward. And we've added to it was Simple by Design. So it's still looking at what I'll call organization or structural change, a number of divisions and cruise. But that has played through for the most part but we continue to look at that.","But the other part of that that we'll look at is just within the divisions do we have the right staffing elements, what we call competitive staffing analysis looking at debt versus best-in-class examples. So that's item one. Item three is I think what you were using \u2013 what we would call 80-20. And that's still early days. We have lots of opportunities and that's a big part of how we're trying to simplify things, revenue complexity and the processes and structure that services that.","And the third element is Simple by Design, which gets at that approximately 70% of the product cost is tied up in how we design things in the first place. So you can have the most fantastic lean system in Kaizen and doing all these other simplification things I just talked about, but a lot of your cost and your speed within your factories and your speed of service customers is stuck in concrete based on how you design the product.","So we'll go through that in a lot more detail at IR Day. And we think we're one of the first people thinking differently on how we want to do that and it'll be a combination of process and software things that we'll elaborate in more detail. And that's \u2013 obviously, that's a little bit longer term because you've got to do that as you design new things. There are some things we can do going backwards with existing designs. But that will set us up nicely for margin expansion and really I think speed in the future.","Joel Tiss","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Joel","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. I think Tom you had said that destocking was about a 2.5 point drag on sales in the fiscal second quarter. So I just wondered what your guidance implies for that destock aspect in the second half please?","Tom Williams","That one is really hard to predict exactly how destocking goes and doesn't go. To be honest I would not have expected given what we were trending before the quarter does to have it stepped down about 200 bps. We're in round numbers we're about minus 100 destocking in Q1. It's now around minus 300 in Q2.","That has to eventually find equilibrium. And I would \u2013 based on probably the Q3 being our bottom, our hope is that the destocking when to hit bottom in Q3. And then everything else from our distribution channel would be end market-related as we go into Q4.","Julian Mitchell","That's helpful. Thank you. And then my second question just on the international industrial segment. You gave a lot of good color on the top line pieces moving around there. I just wanted to ask on the margins because it looks as if \u2013 in terms of the margin rate your full year guide for margins in international implies a step-down sequentially in the second half in the first half or second half versus Q2, even though the revenues just in dollar terms should be going up. So I just wondered if there's something around mix or something with the Asian production impact that you were talking about earlier that dragged down the margin sequentially even with that higher revenue?","Tom Williams","Yes. You hit the nail on the head. So percentage-wise organic goes down 11.5 to minus 12 for international. But I think in particular, what you're seeing there, is we've got a little -- our assumption is a little weaker decremental, go from a decremental in the low 20s in the first half to kind of the low 30s in the second half for Asia, really influenced by how we looked at what the risks associated and the uncertainties around, in particular, Asia, the Coronavirus and just the unknowns there. Recognizing that as you extend Chinese New Year shutdown, nothing's happening there. And then when you start back up, it's going to be much more inefficient. Our belief on the start-up than in previous times coming off of the Chinese New Year. So that's really the difference, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Cathy Suever","Thanks, Julian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andy Casey","Thanks a lot. First question on Europe. It doesn't seem like that's trending any different than you expected, but are you seeing -- we're seeing some improving macro stuff. Are you seeing anything on the ground that would follow that?","Tom Williams","Hey, Andy, it's Tom. We saw some slight improvement in Europe. If I look at EMEA as a total region, industrial went from minus 13 to minus 11 in Q2. So still soft, but got a little bit better. There was no particular end market that kind of lifted up sand. That was what drove it, just was kind of really a whole breadth of it getting a little bit better. Mobile was basically the same, minus 13, slight improvement minus 12.5. I'm rounding to the nearest half. So I would say, fairly consistent with some minor improvement.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then, I think, last quarter you called out phase three, phase one -- sorry, phase three, phase four being 28% and 48% respectively. It sounds like North American distribution had a little bit of a lag down. Could you kind of help us with how phase three and phase four trended in Q2 and how that may change if you exclude the North American distribution piece?","Tom Williams","Yes. Andy, so that distribution -- as distribution goes, it really influences these four phases. I think what we've seen now and looking at these phases, things can move kind of jock you back and forth between phase three and phase four, depending on what's going on. And that's what we saw in this last quarter.","Distribution went from phase four in the prior quarter to phase three. And distribution, being like 37 points of our -- excluding aerospace, it influences it quite a bit. So, if I just contrast for you phase one that's accelerating growth was plus 3. I'm talking about the current quarter. Decelerating growth, phase two, was plus 17% -- or 17% of our sales.","Accelerating decline in phase three was 72% and that main reason why that moved higher, was because distribution moved into there and automotive moved in there. Automotive was in phase four. The balance being 8% of our sales was in phase four decel and decline. So the big shift predominantly was distribution and automotive moving from four to three.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you. And then, one last one and this isn't an attempt, because irrespective of what, just, I'll be at the Investor Day. But should we expect any significant changes in the longer-term goals that you previously outlined outside of potentially EBITDA margins, which are -- look on track to maybe exceed it? Given a big slug of amortization that you're carrying now, the EBIT margin seems like it might be more of a challenge. But anyway should -- your lineup looks great. It looks like you're going to be providing a lot of detail. But at the end of it, should we expect significant changes in the longer term trajectory?","Tom Williams","This is Tom. You're very perceptive. Obviously the amortization headwinds Cathy gave numbers by segment. If you look at that on a steady state round numbers, it's about 100 bps of headwind that we now have with amortization before -- that we didn't have before we set those goals. But I would -- the short answer to your question is, no, you should not see any big changes. But, obviously, EBITDA needs to be looked at given what's happened. And we will look at that. And we're looking forward to seeing everybody, because I think you're going to see an excited team with an exciting lineup with I think more information than we've ever shared with you. And we're going to get a chance to talk about the Win Strategy 3.0 and a lot of things that I think are going to be very compelling to people want to be excited about our current shareholders and then hopefully future shareholders to want to own Parker-Hannifin.","Andy Casey","Great. Thank you very much.","Cathy Suever","Thanks Andy. Liz, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Stephen Volkmann","Well, just slid it in. Thank you.","Cathy Suever","Good morning.","Stephen Volkmann","Can I just ask Tom to go back to something you were talking about earlier when I think Joel was asking you about product line simplification. And you talked about 80\/20. From a lot of other companies who have instituted this, a big part of the process was having off a fairly chunky size of revenues that might be underperforming or might just not have the potential to perform over time that you might have thought. You've made lots and lots of acquisitions.","So I guess I was just trying to get a little more clarity there. Can you picture Parker going through a process of divesting a significant chunk of revenue to, kind of, prepare the ship for higher returns and higher growth going forward? Or is the portfolio where you want it and there might be some tweaking but nothing major?","Tom Williams","Yes. Steve, it's Tom. So that's a good question. And actually that's probably what Joel was getting at and I didn't completely answer him. I think the short answer is, no, you're not going to see any major chunks come off. You might see some minor tweaks. The big difference between say how we're deploying 80\/20.","We're deploying it the same way that people that you've seen to it before like ITW et cetera. The difference is in our portfolio. Our portfolio is built with a lot of complementary interconnectivity there. And with 60% of our revenue coming from customers that buy from four or more of our technologies, our revenue in the tail is very much linked to other revenue throughout the company.","So it requires a little more thoughtful approach. We can't just lop off those tails saying hey that's the end of it because the tail for one division might be an A item for a different division. So we're doing that for a very thoughtful standpoint. We will still get the same kind of speed and margin improvements. We're just -- you're not going to see really any, kind of, revenue changes on that. We don't see it as a headwind to revenue. It will be neutral on the revenue side. You might see some minor things that we do on that, but most of it is going to be just helping customers through different ways to deliver it. Different pricing things are different things we can do on alternative part numbers to satisfy their demand. We want to still take care of our customers and create a great experience for them. We're just going to find more efficient ways to do it.","Stephen Volkmann","Great. Good color. I appreciate it. Thanks.","Cathy Suever","Okay. Thanks, Stephen. Okay. This concludes our question-and-answer session and the earnings call. Thank you everyone for joining us today. Robin and Jeff will be available throughout the day to take your calls should you have further questions. Thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

My name is Jasmine and I\u2019ll be your coordinator for today.  At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of today\u2019s conference.  If at any time during the call you require assistance, please press star followed by zero and a coordinator will be happy to assist you.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Pamela Huggins, Vice President and Treasurer.  You may proceed.","Pamela Huggins","Thank you very much, Jasmine.  Good morning, everyone.  This is Pam Huggins speaking.  I\u2019d like to welcome you to Parker Hannifin\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2012 earnings release teleconference.  Joining me today is Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Don Washkewicz, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Marten.  ","For those of you who wish to do so, you can follow today\u2019s presentation with the PowerPoint slides that have been presented on Parker\u2019s website at www.phstock.com.  And for those of you not online, the slides will remain posted on the Company\u2019s investor information website at the same location one year after today\u2019s call.  ","At this time, reference Slide No. 2 in the slide deck, which is the Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements; and again, if you haven\u2019t already done so, please take note of this statement in its entirety.","Slide No. 3, as you know, this is required and indicates that in cases where non-GAAP numbers have been used, they have been reconciled to the appropriate GAAP numbers and again are posted on Parker\u2019s website.","To cover the agenda for today on Slide No. 4, the call will be in four parts. First Don, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President will provide highlights for the quarter.  Second, I\u2019ll provide a review, including key performance measures of the second quarter and conclude with the fiscal 2012 guidance.  The third part of the call will consist of our standard Q&A session and the fourth part of the call today, Don will close with some final comments.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don and ask that you refer to Slide No. 5, titled Second Quarter Fiscal Year \u201912 Highlights.","Donald Washkewicz","","Thanks, Pam, and welcome to everyone on the call.  To start the call, I\u2019d just like to take a moment to point out some of the highlights for the quarter.  First of all, just to make the overall comment that we had just an outstanding quarter for the Company, not only an outstanding quarter but an outstanding first half for the Company, so we\u2019re pretty excited about that.  We did some demand moderating this quarter, which is what we anticipated.  We had a December meeting with the investors in New York and we talked about that a little bit, especially as it pertains to our international business; so what\u2019s materializing is pretty much what we had seen building over the last several months.  ","However, we\u2019re certainly pleased to announce a number of second quarter records for the Company, and I\u2019ll just kind of highlight a few of those for you here.  We had record sales, net income, and diluted earnings per share, and those were all second quarter records for the Company.  Total segment operating margins were also second quarter record at 14.2%.  Keep in mind that the second quarter in our fiscal year \u2013 not just this fiscal year but in any fiscal year \u2013 is typically our worst quarter, and we\u2019ve continued to remind everybody of that.  This year was no different, but to come in with 14.2%, we\u2019re pretty excited about those kind of numbers, being able to post those in one of the toughest quarters that we have in our fiscal year.  ","Again, those\u2014that margin, the 14.2, was really driven by an outstanding performance in our industrial North American operations, and they came in with 16.5% operating margin so well above our 15% target.  The other thing I would note is that virtually all our sales growth in the quarter was organic, very little in there for acquisitions, so it was virtually all organic growth.  Orders increased, as you had seen in the press release, about 3% and have moderated.  Again, at the beginning of this fiscal year, we pretty much predicted this, that the first half was going to be strong and the second half was going to be kind of single digit growth numbers, and that\u2019s pretty much what\u2019s materializing.  Now, albeit the mix is a little different; we didn\u2019t expect North America to be quite as strong.  We didn\u2019t expect international to be as weak as it is, but we had some offset there but all in all, we\u2019re pretty much doing what we anticipated to be doing for this fiscal year.","The backlog for the quarter\u2014ending backlog was up 4% compared with the same quarter a year ago, so we do have a build in backlog which is a positive note.  Operating cash flow remains strong at 9% of sales, and we certainly like that number.  I know there will be discussions about acquisitions, and we can talk about that more.  We\u2019re at pretty much various stages with regard to acquisitions on a number of acquisitions.  We don\u2019t forecast acquisitions; we don\u2019t predict acquisitions because we never know when we\u2019re going to get them to finish line.  But as it is right now, there is a number that we are in negotiations with and hopefully some of these will close before the end of the year.  So that would be a positive going forward.","We have acquired about 20 million in incremental sales this fiscal year so far, in addition to the buyout of a joint venture that we had in China.  Yesterday, we announced an offer to buy out the remaining shares of Taiyo Limited of Japan, and we\u2019ve been a majority shareholder there since about 2006.  ","Now I\u2019ll just talk a little bit about the international segment.  You know, you obviously heard a lot about the international.  If you\u2019ve been reading in the papers and paying attention to the news, there\u2019s a lot of well-publicized and ongoing information about how unstable the conditions are in the international segment, especially in Europe across a number of our key end markets.  We\u2019ve adjusted our full-year diluted earnings per share guidance back to where we were at the beginning of the year.  If you recall, when we started this fiscal year, we had kind of a nominal 7.10 for the year guidance, and we increased that guidance after the first quarter because we actually beat the first quarter by about $0.30, I believe the number was; so we added that back to the guidance and that\u2019s where we ended up with the higher number.  And we\u2019re now bringing the number back down to where we were at the beginning of the fiscal based on what we\u2019re seeing right now.  So the mix hasn\u2019t been the same, like I said earlier, but the end result is going to bring us right back into that nominal 7.10 plus-or-minus kind of territory.","We expect current North American conditions to continue through the balance of the year, and the strength is not just coming from one market segment, it\u2019s coming from a broad range of market segments.  We can talk later about PMIs and different specific segments and what we\u2019re seeing.  I can give you a little color on that later.  But right now, we don\u2019t anticipate anything bad happening in North America, any negatives coming out of what\u2019s happening elsewhere in the world, at least at this point in time.","So right now, we expect that for fiscal 2012, earnings from continuing operations, like I said, would range somewhere 6.90 and 7.30, and that nominal is somewhere around 7.10; and that represents about a 6% adjustment from where we were previous and still anticipates an all-time record year for the Company.  But we\u2019ll talk more about that after Pam gives you some more detailed review of the quarter.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks, Don.  So at this time, I\u2019ll ask that you reference Slide No. 6 and I\u2019ll begin by addressing the earnings per share for the quarter.  Fully diluted earnings per share for the second quarter came in at $1.56, in line with what you saw in the press release this morning.  This is an increase of $0.17 or 12% versus the $1.39 from the same quarter a year ago, and while the $1.56 is down sequentially from the first quarter, this is normal for Parker due to the natural cycle of the business and in line with historical performance.  ","But to get back to the $0.17 increase in earnings per share for the second quarter, let me just outline for you the puts and takes of that $0.17.  Segment operating income added $0.19; higher expenses below segment operating income impacted EPS by $0.04; higher tax rate impacted EPS by $0.09, and a lower share count had a favorable EPS impact of $0.11.  Sales were higher in all segments of the business with the exception of climate industrial controls group, and all segments generated increased operating income year-over-year with the exception of international.  International was slightly less than last year in spite of the sovereign debt issues and slowing economy in Europe and Asia.","The less than expected performance in international was due to less sales than anticipated on a higher expense base, continued investment in Asia, and the impact of currency \u2013 mainly the euro \u2013 as it continued to weaken throughout the quarter against the dollar; and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk about these issues a little further as we go through the call.","Expenses below segment operating income were impacted by higher corporate G&A, and that was due to higher research and development costs and performance incentives.  The higher tax rate was due to a higher mix of domestic sales versus foreign, and of course we always have this multi-period R&D tax credit \u2013 it was booked in the second quarter last year.  The lower share count is the result of share repurchases.","So moving to Slide No. 8, looking at the top line, revenues for the year increased 8.4% to 3.1 billion, and that\u2019s over 2.9 billion last year.  Sales increased across all segments of the business, again except CIC.  But you should note that CIC generated slightly more income on less sales.","There was a minimal impact from acquisitions and currency in the quarter, and as a result the organic growth was the same as the top line \u2013 8%.  Segment operating margins for the quarter increased 20 basis points from 14% to 14.2%, again as Don said, an all-time second quarter record for the Company.  ","So now moving to Slide No. 9, focusing on the segments for just a moment, commencing with North America.  North American revenues came in at 13.2% for the quarter.  Acquisitions and currency had little impact; as such, the organic core revenue increased 13% as well.  Operating income increased from 159 million to 196 million, and this is a 23% increase for the quarter year-over-year.  Operating margins for the quarter increased to 16.5% from 15.2%.  ","So moving to Slide No. 10 and continuing with the industrial segment but moving to international, organic revenues increased 5.3% in the year.  Again, currency had minimal impact on revenues.  Acquisitions added 1% to revenues in the quarter, and so total revenues for the quarter increased 6.2%.  Segment operating income decreased to 166 million from 168 million, and operating margins decreased to 13.6% from 14.6%, again due to the reasons that I cited earlier.  ","Moving to Slide No. 11 and focusing on the aerospace segment, aerospace reported revenues increased to 8%.  Again, acquisitions and currency had no impact to revenues.  Margins increased 40 basis points for the quarter to 14.2% from 13.8% last year, and this of course is due in large part to the higher sales volume.","So moving to Slide No. 12 and addressing the climate and industrial controls segment, revenues decreased 3% for the year; however, margins were up in spite of the decreased sales.  Segment operating margins as a percent of sales were 4.7% for the quarter versus 4.4% last year, and this is obviously due to the continued restructuring efforts that we\u2019ve talked about over the last several calls.  And again, restructuring is going on over time in that group and so you\u2019re seeing some of that in that bottom line number.","Moving to Slide No. 13 addressing orders for a moment, just to remind everybody, these numbers represent a trailing three-month average and they\u2019re reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions and currency, except for aerospace; and aerospace is reported using a 12-month rolling average.  As you can see from this slide, orders are up 3% for the December quarter just ended.  North American orders increased to 8%.  Industrial international orders increased 1%.  Aerospace orders were flat, and climate and industrial control orders decreased 5% due to the continued weakness in their markets.","So I\u2019d like to move to the balance sheet just for a moment here.  Parker\u2019s balance sheet, of course, remains solid.  Cash on the balance sheet at year-end was over $488 million.  Days sales and inventory increased to 63 days from 62 last quarter, and that\u2019s pretty much typical for Parker.  We tend to build a little inventory in the first half and then we tend to reduce it even more than what we build in the first half, in the second half.  Accounts receivable in terms of DSO closed at 48 days, consistent with the first quarter; and weighted average days payable outstanding increase to 54 days versus 51 last year.  ","So moving to Slide 15 and addressing cash flow, cash flow from operations for the quarter came in at 254 million, 8.2% of sales; and on a year-to-date basis, 563 million or 8.9% of sales.  The major components of the uses of quarterly cash flow of 250 million in the quarter is as follows:  76 million returned to the shareholders via share repurchase of 20 million and dividend payments of 56 million; 53 million or 1.7% of revenues utilized for capital expenditure purposes, however please note that capital expenditure purposes on a year-to-date basis is only 1.5%.  So 1.7 for the quarter, 1.5% on a year-to-date basis.","In addition to these uses of cash, cash did decrease another 50 million in the quarter and that was mainly due to the effect of exchange rate changes on the cash.  In total, cash increased 64 million in the quarter.","Moving to Slide 16, you can see that the debt to total cap ratio is 25.2%, and on a net basis 19.5%; so obviously, the Company has a lot of capacity to grow the business moving forward.","What you\u2019ve all been waiting for, on Slide 17 and 18, the revised guidance.  On Slide 17, the guidance ranges are reported for revenue and operating margin by segment, and on Slide 18 the guidance has been provided at the midpoint and in total for the items below segment operating margins.  On Slide 19, the guidance is summarized on a diluted earnings per share basis.  As you can see from this slide, the revised guidance for the fiscal year is projected to be $6.90 to $7.30.  This revised guidance range incorporates the low end of the previous guidance provide last quarter.","So please remember that the revised guidance excludes any acquisitions that may be made in the second half of this year; and just to summarize some of the assumptions in the guidance for you, revenues increase almost 6% at the midpoint.  Operating margins are projected to be in the range of 14.8% to 15.2%, a pretty narrow range.  Expenses below segment operating income, including the corporate administration, interest and other, at the midpoint are projected at 412 million with a very small band of plus-or-minus 0.5%.  ","The projected full-year tax rate at 29%, and just a couple of points with respect to guidance.  Sales first half, second half are divided 49%, 51%.  EPS first half, second half are divided 49%, 51%.  Realignment costs for the year projected at $0.10, and $0.03 has already been incurred and the remaining projected expenses will hit in the second half.  Fourth quarter will be stronger than third quarter.  Approximately 46% of the total EPS for the second half will be in the third quarter.  The fourth quarter will have higher sales and there are some expenses occurring in the third quarter that won\u2019t repeat in the fourth quarter, such as restructuring, legal fees, inventory expenses, as well as expenses associated with inventory reductions.  ","So at this time, I\u2019d just like to open the session to our standard Q&A; and as a reminder, please be courteous.  Limit your questions to one at a time.  If you need clarification, that\u2019s fine, have a follow-on; but we\u2019d like to give everybody a chance to participate.","So at this time, please open the call.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your touchtone telephone.  If your question has been answered or you wish to withdraw your question, press star followed by two.  Please press star, one to begin.","And your first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.  Please proceed.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, good morning.  ","Pamela Huggins","Good morning, Jamie","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","I guess, Pam or Don, just a couple of quick questions.  When we look at your order trends, you were nice enough to give us the October and November order trends when we were at your analyst day.  It just implies sort of December fell off a cliff, and I guess what surprises me is aero took a big hit and North America took a big hit, whereas the rest of the world where everyone was surprised it didn\u2019t seem like \u2013 you know what I mean? \u2013 it saw as material a decline.  So I\u2019m just wondering if you can sort of explain that.  Was there anything in the quarter\u2014is it seasonality in December, was there less business days?  If you could sort of just speak to that, and then my second question \u2013 could you just comment about inventory levels at Parker and the level that you\u2019ll need to reduce that, and inventory levels at the distribution level?","Jon Marten","Jamie, this is Jon.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi Jon.","Jon Marten","","How are you?","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good.","Jon Marten","I\u2019m going to try to first handle the orders questions here, and let me just start out with aerospace.  The aerospace orders are really as a result of very, very tough comps.  We are at all-time record highs in terms of the backlog there, so I wouldn\u2019t\u2014and again, aerospace being on a 12-month rolling number here, there is a lot of changes as we look at what would have been dropping off the period 12 months ago.  So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that.","Now as you mentioned, in the investor day discussion that we had in December, the beginning of December, we had just gotten our November numbers; and you\u2019re right \u2013 as things rolled through in the month of December and for the quarter, we got progressively weaker in terms of our inventories in North America as well as in Europe.  However, the point\u2014I think the key point for North America, our projections for North America, in terms of our revenue that are built into our guidance, is quite healthy and we are really relying on those projections where we\u2019re going to see a rebound in North America as the quarter goes on and into Q4.  So we feel very good about our projections in North America in terms of revenues. ","Internationally, we\u2019ve baked in the decrease that we saw in December into our revenue forecast, and we\u2019re going to see really two effects:  one, the ability for us to make sure that we are watching every single month the order rates that we\u2019re seeing in Europe and making sure that we are able to keep our cost structure in line; and then internationally in terms of areas other than Europe, primarily Asia of course for us, we expect to see an increase over time throughout the third quarter, beginning into February, beginning of March time frame in Asia, and then that increase building in Asia throughout the year.","So you\u2019re right \u2013 by deduction, our December was not as strong as we would have liked, but there is often when you\u2019re looking at just one period of time, some seasonality issues there; and of course, the uncertainty related to the situation in Europe, we\u2019re sure affected some orders at some point here in the month of December.  But as we look forward and we look at the demand patterns that we\u2019re expecting from our customers, we feel like we have it really solidly built into our forecast going forward.  And as we looked at the data for the year, for the second half, we will still end up with\u2014have mid-single digit organic growth for the Company.  We\u2019ll be at about 6% for the Company overall for the year, and so we\u2019ll still be meeting all of our organic goals that we commit to \u2013 everybody here, every year \u2013 which has been part of our strategy.  And of course, as you know, it doesn\u2019t include anything that we\u2019ll be planning on doing in terms of acquisitions.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then just the second follow-up question on the inventory levels at Parker and at the distributor basis?","Jon Marten","Yeah, I think\u2014you know, we don\u2019t have any information that would lead us to believe that the inventory levels at the distributors are any different than they have been, so normally at this time of the year.  Although our inventory is up as a company, as Pam mentioned in her comments, the inventory goes up seasonally for us in Q2 and then we always drive it down.  I think we\u2019re at 63 days of sales\u2014of 63 days of inventory on hand at 12\/31, and we were really at 55 days of inventory on hand at June 30, and we intend to be well below that 55 days by the time we get to June.  That\u2019s built into our planning here for the second half.  But in terms of the actual inventory on hand at our distributors, we think that we are pretty much in the same band that we are normally in, given this time of year.","Donald Washkewicz","Jamie, this is Don.  Did you want to know something more about the distribution?","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Well, no.  I guess my follow-up question really isn\u2019t on distribution.  It\u2019s more\u2014I mean, again on the order trends, Jon, you cited a little bit of seasonality.  I mean, that shouldn\u2019t impact us year-over-year.","Jon Marten","Mm-hmm.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","So I guess I don\u2019t get that.  I mean, was there something specific to this year?  I think GE this morning said there were less business days or something.  Did any of that impact you, or--?  I\u2019m just trying to get\u2014it just doesn\u2019t make sense.","Jon Marten","Well, the thing that\u2014for us, in the month of December, again we shared the October and the November data with you in the meeting at the beginning of December.  In the month of December, we saw a worsening of the order rates year-over-year.  And when I mentioned seasonality, all I was doing was trying to compare what\u2019s happening in Q2 versus Q1 and just try to\u2014","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay.","Jon Marten","--our normal rates are going down.  I understand year-over-year that we\u2019re in the same impact; however, I do think it\u2019s fair to say in terms of Europe and what\u2019s happening in Europe, that there is some uncertainty, and in some pockets of our organization in Europe we saw some order rates that we wouldn\u2019t normally see in the month of December in Europe.  But our look at Europe going forward is baked into our guidance, and we feel very good about being able to make our organic growth rates as projected in our revenue forecast that Pam just described earlier.","Donald Washkewicz","Jamie, this is Don.  Just to add a couple points to that \u2013 first of all, the strongest segment for Parker right now is our distributor business.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay.","Donald Washkewicz","It\u2019s absolutely the strongest of all of our segments, the OEM or otherwise; so I don\u2019t anticipate our distribution cutting inventory or adjusting down inventory.  If anything, they might even be adding some inventory to deal with their business conditions, because that\u2019s really the driver right now in the company \u2013 it\u2019s the aftermarket in particular.  It\u2019s the strongest segment for us.","The other thing to keep in mind is December is always a lousy month.  I mean, I like December \u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong, because I like the holidays and all that.  But from a business standpoint, it\u2019s a lousy month with the holidays and all that, and every December is\u2014you know, we don\u2019t have a good December typically, ever.  I mean, really, when you look back through the years, it\u2019s a light month.  You can\u2019t read a whole lot into it.  I think more importantly is to stay focused on our backlog, and in the second quarter compared to last year, the second quarter, our backlog increased 4%.  That\u2019s kind of an indicator going forward as to what\u2019s to come, okay?  So we\u2019re building some backlog from year to year, quarter to quarter, and I think that\u2019s probably more important than trying to read too much into one month of December.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, I appreciate.  I\u2019ll let someone\u2014I\u2019ll get back in queue.  Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.  Please proceed.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc","Hi, good morning.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc","Just on the\u2014so if we take the guidance revision of $0.45, is there a way to bucket that between European weakness, FX translation, anything else?  And maybe within the international business, if you can just kind of correlate the organic growth with the margin decline \u2013 is that price cost, is that mix, is that inventory absorption?","Jon Marten","Yeah, I think\u2014Jeff, Jon here again.  In terms of the guidance, the whole story is really when you look at the numbers going forward as we\u2019ve broken it down by segment, is in our international business, and it is both in terms of revenue as well as in terms of margins.  We\u2019ve also got a little bit in there for\u2014we\u2019ve raised the tax rate up to 29 from 28, and that\u2019s the way that we\u2019re really looking at the guidance for us and the change in the guidance.","So that is the whole picture.  If you really looked at our prior guidance versus our current guidance, we\u2019re at a $0.37 impact there, so that just about covers that entire $0.45 that you\u2019re talking about.  And that gets to the point that Jamie was making earlier that we try to talk about in terms of our view of the international growth rates.  And as we tried to talk about in December, we were worried and we said that we were worried in December about the trends that were developing internationally for us, especially in Europe; but we were also very mindful of the strength that we were seeing in North America and we really wanted to be able to tell you exactly what was going to happen at the end of this quarter.  We didn\u2019t know, of course; we were only through two months and we had just gotten the fresh November data.  But once we finished the quarter and we go back and we look at it, we almost covered on North America.  North America is increasing in our guidance, as the year goes on, and it\u2019s just not able to give us the confidence that we\u2019re going to be able to cover what we\u2019re seeing internationally, both in Asia but of course primarily in Europe.  ","That\u2019s probably the picture in a nutshell for you, but it\u2019s all international.  It\u2019s not anything else other than that, and we\u2019re going to be keeping a really strong focus on that.  ","As Pam mentioned, she talked in detail about the difference between the expenses that we have got baked into the guidance for Q3 versus Q4; and in fact, we\u2019ve got about $20 million in additional expenses, mostly restructuring related to what\u2019s happening in Europe into Q3, but also has some legal and other types of costs that we\u2019ve got baked into Q3 guidance too, here.  ","So we see the issues.  We see the influences on us.  It\u2019s consistent, as Don said, with the macro-economic picture, and we\u2019re taking action.  We\u2019re taking action based on what we\u2019re seeing and how those markets are trending, in order to be sure that we come in with the guidance that we\u2019ve provided you here today.  We feel very good about our visibility into Q3 and we\u2019re very confident in the guidance that we\u2019ve just given you.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay.  Is there a way to quantify the FX translation impact, either on the EPS guidance change or on this 5-point swing in international revenue growth at the midpoint?","Jon Marten","Well, I think that in terms of the top line, about half of the top line delta between our old guidance and our current guidance is FX-related, and that will have a material impact on the bottom line for us.  We can get into a lot more details with you as the day wears on here, if you would like.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay, thanks.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with Buckingham Research.  Please proceed.","Joel Tiss \u2013 Buckingham Research","Wow, I made it before the end!  How\u2019s it going?","Pamela Huggins","Good morning, Joel.","Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research","","I just wanted to follow up on the direction that Jamie was going into, and I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t know if you guys want to answer this but I think it would be very helpful for everyone on the call if you could give us a little bit of a sense\u2014if you were a calendar year, what 2012, sort of the order growth rates and pricing trends, and some more color on different regional trends, what you\u2019re seeing.  Because there are\u2014you know, there\u2019s a lot of different parts of Europe.  You haven\u2019t talked about Latin America at all, and I just wondered if you could give us more of a snapshot of how you\u2019re seeing calendar 2012 and what the January order rates\u2014like, what the order rates look like and what you\u2019re hearing from your customers, more on that kind of a view.","Donald Washkewicz","Well Joel, I\u2019m not sure where we want to start on that.  I can maybe start with a little bit of what you may already know\u2014maybe not everybody on the call knows about the PMIs and what they\u2019re looking like globally.  But right now, what we\u2019re looking at is on a global basis, PMI is around 50, which is kind of neutral territory for the overall market globally, but not a bad number.  North America, I think bodes well being as pretty much in line with what we\u2019ve been saying here, is that the PMI increased to almost 54 from about 50\u2014just under 53 in November, so actually the activity in North America\u2014that was for North America, I don\u2019t know if I mentioned that.  So for North America, we kind of see that going into the new year as a real good sign.  ","The euro zone \u2013 you know, it actually went up just a little bit from low 46 to higher 46, but nothing really to write home about.  All of the western countries in Europe, for the most part, are below 50, so that just kind of confirms the weakness that we\u2019re seeing here.  China is around 49%, just a little bit less than that.  It was closer to 50% in September, so down a little bit. ","We anticipated, by the way, with our guidance at the beginning of the year that our first half was going to be strong and our second half was going to be weak, so none of this really surprises us.  It\u2019s just, you know, maybe some of the pieces moved a little bit here or there.  But I think what we\u2019re seeing develop is pretty much exactly the picture that we saw going in, and we said that our growth would be kind of single digit in the second half and that\u2019s kind of the way it\u2019s materializing.","You mentioned Brazil \u2013 actually, their PMI, they\u2019ve been kind of flat line for quite a while but they\u2019ve actually increased a little bit on the PMI now to around 49 from 45 the previous quarter, so that\u2019s kind of moving up.  You saw our order trends were up about 3%, and I think most importantly again is the backlog, that we\u2019re running about up 4% quarter-over-quarter.  I think that\u2019s kind of an indicator of what\u2019s to come going forward.","I could go into the order trends by region but I think I\u2019m just going to be repeating myself.  I\u2019ve got 3\/12s and 12\/12s.  I don\u2019t\u2014I would say the strongest trend for us anywhere in the world is our North American distribution, okay?  It\u2019s the strongest trend both on a 3\/12 and a 12\/12 that I see anywhere in all of the regions and segments that we deal in.  ","What else?  I think that\u2019s probably\u2014I mean, I can go into some specifics, some specific segments and so forth \u2013 you know, like semiconductor is flattening.  Refrigeration, of course, we talked about that with CIC and air conditioning is weak.  Housing builds, of course, are dictating that.  Construction is on a 12\/12 basis is pretty strong.  The 3\/12\u2019s coming down a little bit, but that\u2019s to be expected.","So those would be just some inputs.  I hope I answered a little bit of what you were looking for.","Joel Tiss \u2013 Buckingham Research","Yeah, and just on aerospace, can you give us a sense of why the growth\u2014it looks like if you\u2014I know you don\u2019t report it this way, but if you just took the fourth calendar quarter of 2011, it looks like the growth really fell off a lot.  You said it was tough comps.  Is there anything in commercial aftermarket that would have amplified that?","Joe Marten","Yeah, I would think that the commercial aftermarket, Joel, is still very strong and very good.  The impact that we\u2019re seeing that are the headwinds in the aerospace orders going forward is of course the defense business, and this would be defense OEM as well as the defense aftermarket.  The commercial side of the business is still very good, and we\u2019re expecting the guidance that we gave there to continue strong.  We are still, as we talked about in the investor day presentations that we made, referencing an 8% compounded annual growth rate for the next several years in aerospace, based upon all of the wins that we\u2019ve been able to make over the last year.  So you might see some changes in the backlog, but those were all anticipated and that\u2019s really more related to the defense that the commercial side of the business.","Joel Tiss \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay, thank you very much.","Donald Washkewicz","Joel, I\u2019ll just add one other thing I wanted to just cover, some specific market segments that I can just give you a little color on.  North America, a strong segment, it\u2019s doing better.  Mining, oil and gas, power gen \u2013 I mentioned distribution being extremely good for us, so that would be some other segments that are looking good.  Worse would be semiconductor and heavy truck, although heavy truck\u2019s running at a fairly high level, so don\u2019t read too much into that.  ","Internationally, this would be primarily Europe now that I\u2019d be talking about, the mobile markets are soft, cars, light trucks soft.  Construction, heavy duty truck, those are all soft, and farm and ag.  So you can see pretty much across the board, those segments in Europe are soft.  On the positive side, power gen, semiconductors is more positive now than it has been, but it\u2019s a small change.  Marine is strong, oil and gas is strong; so you can see the power and energy markets are doing pretty well, even in that environment internationally.  And that specifically was speaking to Europe.","China would follow that pretty much exactly along the same lines as I just mentioned for Europe, with the exception that cars and light trucks are still good in China; so the rest of the segment is pretty much parallel with what I just said.  Hopefully, that adds a little color to it.","Joel Tiss \u2013 Buckingham Research","Yeah, thank you.  Sorry for taking so much time.","Donald Washkewicz","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Raso with ISI Group.  Please proceed.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","","Hi, good morning.","Pamela Huggins","Good morning, David.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","First a clarification \u2013 at the analyst meeting, you were providing rolling three-month orders, right?  So it wasn\u2019t that North America was up 18% in October and 13 in November standalone, and then you backed into a down December.  Those were rolling three-month numbers you were providing for October and November, correct?","Jon Marten","That is correct, David, yes.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, thank you.  My question relates to\u2014I think it was Jon that made the comment that organic growth for the company in the back half could be\u2014I think you said 6%?","Jon Marten","What I meant there, David, is 6% for the year for the Company.  We\u2019re going to be in the 1 to 3% range.  Three percent is the implied guidance for organic growth for the second half of the year.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Okay.  I\u2019m trying to back into the currency impact you\u2019re baking into international and what\u2019s that implying for organic international for the back half, because the full end number is back half.  You\u2019re saying international revenue is down 4.7, but margin\u2019s only down 10 BPs year-over-year in the back half.  So how much is currency in the second half for international \u2013 is it 5, is it\u2014I\u2019m just trying to think, are we implying organic growth internationally is flattish in the back half?  ","Pamela Huggins","You\u2019re about there, David. ","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, and not to\u2014I apologize, I\u2019ll repeat my question from last quarter, but unfortunately it kind of happened again with the international margins.  If we were down 60 BPs in international margins in the first quarter, now 100, and you would think that maybe the outlook\u2019s weakening here a little bit, at least the next coming quarter, to have margins only down 10 BPs year-over-year in the second half is\u2014again, just a question from last quarter, why would the margins be only down 10 if we\u2019re not growing the business at all and costs have gone up in Asia, and who knows, maybe even the currency is a bit of a drag on the profitability?  I think that\u2019s a debatable point, but can you explain why the margin\u2019s only down 10 BPs in the second half internationally?","Pamela Huggins","I have a little more than that, so I don\u2019t know where we have a disconnect in our numbers; but there\u2019s a little bit of disconnect on the numbers, David.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Yeah, back half \u201911 is 15% international margins; second half, implied 14.9.  Maybe you\u2019re off by 10 BPs or so from my number, but\u2014","Pamela Huggins","Yeah.  Okay.  Okay, I see where you\u2019re coming from.  Yeah.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","I\u2019m saying, the inherent to a business like this, flat organic growth at best doesn\u2019t usually imply margins flat or down slightly.  Usually you\u2019ll take a bit of a hit.  Is there something with\u2014well actually, the currency going away, your currency is less of a drag on profitability because you don\u2019t get the same margin on a currency dollar?","Jon Marten","Right.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","I\u2019m just trying to\u2014you would think it would be a little more\u2014","Pamela Huggins","Well, part of it is because of the European margins.  You have to remember that our European margins are lower than the margins in the rest of our business.  So the currency does have a much smaller impact to the profitability than maybe what you might see on the sales line.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","And that\u2019s my last question \u2013 the international\u2014I mean, obviously we\u2019re thinking about Europe.  I\u2019m a little more concerned about the margins in the emerging markets.  Would that be more of an unpleasant surprise to folks\u2014they at least feel they can somewhat calibrate Europe potentially.  The emerging market margins, how are those trending right now?  I mean, all in with the investments as well, but even just with investments, without the investments \u2013 international margins, how are they trending right now?","Pamela Huggins","That\u2019s a good question, David.","Jon Marten","I think that\u2014and David, this gets to the point that you were asking about earlier, as our international business changes over time, of course we\u2019re growing bigger in our emerging markets than we are in Europe, and so as the margins are changing at a different rate in Europe vis-\u00e0-vis what\u2019s happening in Asia as an example.  However, as we\u2019ve talked about before, our margins in Asia are very, very good, but they are slightly down from where they were.  That is having an impact on us.  They are slightly down because we are putting in, as we\u2019ve talked about before, an infrastructure there in some of our CAPEX program, and we\u2019re creating opportunities for us to really invest in growth of the future.  And so it just so happens that as these facilities are coming online in Asia, they are having a very minor but noticeable impact to us in terms of the margins internationally.","Again, we\u2019re very proud of our emerging market margins, but your point is well-taken and your analysis of the situation is accurate.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","And that triggered a question for me \u2013 you made the comment about EMs maybe getting better \u2013 I think you said Asia, to be specific.  Is there anything in the order book to suggest a pick-up, because again, I\u2019m just not hearing that post-Chinese New Year pop that we usually get, so the cap-goods post-Chinese New Year\u2019s seems at the moment it\u2019s going to be a little disappointing.  Are you hearing something differently, or are you looking even kind of beyond that March-April time frame and there\u2019s something in your order book suggesting that pick-up in April-May?","Donald Washkewicz","Well, I think in China, I think\u2014you know, it\u2019s been down for quite a while now.  I think that just from what we\u2019ve been hearing as far as the banks and the access to capital and so forth as being softened or released a little bit, lessened, more available \u2013 however you want to put it, I think that\u2019s going to bode well.  The only question we have is what month or months is that going to really happen?  Our people in Asia say that it\u2019s going to happen this second half.  We can\u2019t pinpoint\u2014we were hoping that it would start in January.  It looks like it may be pushed out a little bit, but I\u2019m hopeful that still we start seeing a little bit of a pickup in the third quarter sometime.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","So it\u2019s a macro thought, not a micro in the order book thought?","Donald Washkewicz","Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Okay.  I appreciate the color.  Thank you very much.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Robert W. Baird.  Please proceed.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Good morning everybody.","Donald Washkewicz","Good morning.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Before I ask a question, Jon, could I just ask you to clarify something you said before?  The $20 million of excess expenses in the third quarter is a combination of restructuring and other things, or was it 20 million for restructuring alone?","Jon Marten","It is primarily restructuring, but we also have some incremental legal expenses that we\u2019ll be incurring in Q3 related to some of the projects that we\u2019re working on.  So three-quarters of it, certainly, is restructuring.","Pamela Huggins","And I just want to clarify, Rob, because I don\u2019t want you to think that\u2014it\u2019s a combination of things.  The third quarter, what\u2019s happening is we\u2019re having some expenses that won\u2019t repeat, and then in the fourth quarter we have some pickups of some inventory adjustments and things like that.  So it\u2019s not like we have\u2014you know, everything is in the third quarter and it\u2019s going to reverse in the fourth quarter.  It\u2019s a combination of things that are happening in the third quarter versus fourth quarter, and that\u2019s the change.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, thanks.","Pamela Huggins","So it\u2019s 21 million in total, though.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Twenty-one, okay.  So my first question was just\u2014I would like to try to distill down all that we\u2019ve heard about the international outlook into an order expectation.  So I think I hear you saying that you believe that recovering order rates in Asia, perhaps Latin America, will enable overall international orders in the second quarter to be up\u2014in other words, fully offset what you think is going to happen in Europe and allow orders to be up.  Am I getting the message correctly?","Jon Marten","Yes.  The second half, we are expecting orders in our emerging markets to increase sequentially as the third quarter rolls out and into the fourth quarter.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Yeah, I apologize, Jon.  I meant to say fourth quarter, of course.","Jon Marten","Okay.  So that\u2019s how we are looking at our guidance, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting.  And that, again, is as a result of our analysis of our forecasts that we\u2019re getting from each one of our business units in the geographies and the territories that they are looking at, and very close to their customers.  So this is not just a macro look at the world and trying to apply it to our numbers; this is a combination of that plus the rollup of all the data for all the divisions around the world.  That is exactly what we\u2019re expecting.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, got it.  And then my follow-up has to do with your expectations for aerospace profitability.  Obviously we understand some of the puts and takes.  I am surprised to see you forecasting that second half margins would decline from the first half despite an increase in the second half in terms of revenue. So\u2014and my impression has been that we have some easing of the engineering expense issue, so are we looking at the impact of an adverse mix shift created by more commercial, less military?","Jon Marten","Yes.  You\u2019ve got it very well put.  We still have the engineering expenses continuing in the second half, slightly less rate then the first half but still in the 9 to 10% range of revenues for the year.  And you are absolutely correct \u2013 it is the mix between the commercial and military, but it\u2019s also the mix in terms of the OEM build cycle.  As the OEM build cycle continues to gain momentum, of course that\u2019s causing a mix issue for us, and we are putting our guidance together with that in mind.  Our commercial aftermarket is at a very, very nice level right now for us, but we expect that to be flattening out as the year goes on, not giving us the momentum that we\u2019ve had over time; and as the OEM commercial business comes online, that will create that mix issue, which will\u2014maybe 100 basis point difference in the returns at the operating margin there.","Robert McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, thank you, Jon.  It\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.  You may proceed.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Good morning.  Can you hear me?","Pamela Huggins","Yeah, we can hear you.  Hi, Alex.  How are you doing?","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Hi.  My question, Pam, relates to something you said during the opening remarks.  With regard to the second half, you were talking about 49% of EPS in the first half and 51% in the second, so that would give you about $3.63 in the second half.  And then you said 40% of that second half would be in the third quarter, and 60% in the fourth quarter.  Is that correct?","Pamela Huggins","Yeah, I think my exact numbers were 46% in the third.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","","Oh, well, you said 40.  Because if you use 40%, that would give you a $1.45, and that looked a little bit light for the third quarter.","Pamela Huggins","Yeah, no.  It\u2019s 46% in the third.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Forty-six and 54--?","Pamela Huggins","Yeah.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay, thank you for clarifying that, because I was getting a little concerned.  That would give you $1.67 in the third quarter, which then you said would be burdened by about $0.12, including restructuring and legal costs.  Correct?","Pamela Huggins","Mm-hmm.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay.  Now, the other question is the decline in the margins in the quarter in international \u2013 I apologize if this has been covered before \u2013 but it was on higher sales.  Why is that?  I mean, there was no incremental margin.","Donald Washkewicz","Well, I think what\u2019s happened is that our anticipation for the business was higher than what exactly happened; and when you have a fixed infrastructure, Alex, it\u2019s hard to adjust real time to the moment to any change in activity.  So you\u2019re going to see some aberrations there early on in a situation like this.  You know, we\u2019ll be making adjustments and those will happen real time, but there is a little delay factor to get adjusted to what the current levels are.  We anticipated a higher level of activity than what actually happened for the amount of infrastructure we had in place, and the staffing and all that, so.  Those adjustments will happen; it\u2019ll just be a little delayed.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay.  So your sales were lower than expected, so your expenses were too high a percent?","Donald Washkewicz","Some of the fixed expenses were just that \u2013 they were fixed, you know?","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Yeah.  Well, are you going to reduce them in the second half?","Donald Washkewicz","Sure.  We are reducing everything real time as we speak.  As you know, certain regions of the world are easier to do that; other regions are a little bit more difficult because you have to\u2014you get the Vatican to approve it and whatever, you know, as far as cutbacks.  I\u2019m just pulling your leg there a little bit, but you have to get the work councils and the governments to approve things and so forth, but\u2014","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Yeah, that\u2019s a little hard over there.","Donald Washkewicz","Yeah.  But we\u2019re doing that, you know, we\u2019re making the adjustments as needed.  I will say this \u2013 that in Europe in particular, we have about\u2014right now about 1,000 associate employees, and we prepared for this.  At the last recession, we were preparing for the next recession because one of the parts of our game plan is to make sure that we do have associate employees that we can act on a little bit quicker than we would otherwise be able to do with full-time tenured employees.  So we have about 1,000.  W have a couple thousand in the company total.  We have about 1,000 of those in Europe, and that was down to zero in the recession.  So you can see the flex that we have there \u2013 it\u2019s about a 5% of our workforce flex that we have with temporaries and associates to be able to manage through these kind of downturns.  ","So you\u2019re not going to get much of a delay.  You\u2019ll have a little bit of delay.  There is some restructuring \u2013 I think Pam mentioned that \u2013 going on over there.  That\u2019s an ongoing thing.  It\u2019s not a huge number, but it is happening and it will continue to happen until we right-size everything to the level of activity.  ","Just along the same lines, then, CAPEX may be a question in your mind, what is happening with CAPEX.  Well, keep in mind that in a lean environment, lean drives discipline in CAPEX, okay?  I don\u2019t have to take any drastic measures on CAPEX when the economy goes up or down; it happens automatically.  When you really have a lean environment, you\u2019re monitoring that almost daily.  So we\u2019re running right now at about a percent and a half of CAPEX.  That\u2019s at a pretty low level already and it\u2019s pretty reflective of where I would expect to be with this kind of an economic environment that we\u2019re facing.  ","So those are some of the things that we\u2019re doing to address what\u2019s happening, especially over in Europe and international.  I can give you a few more, but I think that kind of hits the highlights.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Yeah, thanks Don.","Donald Washkewicz","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.  You may proceed.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks.  A couple more clarifications here.  Jon, I think at the analyst meeting, you did give the indication that November orders, industrial, international, single-month November was just very slightly positive.  Can you help us with December?  I think the implication was you went just slightly negative in December; and if that\u2019s correct, is it Europe got a little worse and Asia was still about as negative as it was in November?  Can you help us with any of that?","Jon Marten","Your logic is correct.  It did get worse in December.  It did go negative a little bit, and it\u2019s about equal by region.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Equally negative, or equally deteriorated versus November?","Jon Marten","Equally deteriorated vis-\u00e0-vis November in both Europe as well as in Asia.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, helpful.  And then in terms of the question on second half international margins kind of essentially the same for the second half despite the lower revenue, I wonder if you see an expanding price raw material gap?  Maybe you can talk about where that is now and where you see that heading, moving forward?","Donald Washkewicz","","This is Don, Terry.  We\u2019ve had raw materials right now\u2014maybe I\u2019ll just kind of highlight some of the movements there.  You know, we\u2019ve had some changes.  I think everybody\u2019s seen that on crude oil and so forth.  Copper has been moving a little bit up and steel likewise.  We also had some go in the opposite direction- aluminum and nickel.  The key for us is, and this is pretty consistent with the way we\u2019ve been managing this over the last five or six years now since we\u2019ve really launched the PPI \u2013 Purchase Price Index \u2013 philosophy here and the sale price index, is that what our goal is is neutrality, okay?  We want to achieve at least neutrality.  So when we absorb\u2014have to take raw material increases, we\u2019re not trying to make a profit on those increases other than the normal gross margin on those increases, okay? So what we\u2019re trying to do is achieve neutrality.  We\u2019re trying to keep the purchase price index less than 1 and the sale price index greater than 1, and we\u2019re pretty much doing that.  We\u2019ve done that in very, very difficult times.  We\u2019re doing that today, which is not as difficult an environment as what we\u2019ve seen in the past.  We\u2019ve had to manage through some very, very tough times when raw materials were going almost vertical.  ","So right now, I feel very comfortable being able to manage raw material inputs and recovering those.  We have\u2014I think we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we\u2019ve had price increases across the board on all of our products at least once or twice a year, either in January or July, and that holds true for this year as well.  So any adjustments that will be made will be made pretty much at those times, or at the contract anniversaries for OEM accounts.  So I feel pretty good we\u2019ve got things under control, and that\u2019s a global statement pretty much around the world, because we have visibility of these indices pretty much everywhere that we operate around the world.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So flat for the year, but is the spread changing in the second half relative to the first half?","Donald Washkewicz","The spread of what\u2014","","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Price versus cost?","Donald Washkewicz","No, I would say that it\u2019s pretty much constant.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.  And then lastly on capital allocation, Don, you mentioned at the analyst meeting that you\u2019d stopped buyback because you were anticipating acquisitions.  Obviously very encouraged to see the one you announced the other day.  I\u2019m wondering if you could true us up \u2013 is that all that is in the near-term pipeline?  Do you move back to buyback near term, or are you still optimistic about the deal pipeline and that\u2019s where the focus is?","Donald Washkewicz","Well, I think what we want to do is we do have a number of properties that we\u2019re looking at right now, candidates that we\u2019re looking at.  We\u2019re at various stages of discussions with them, and I think right now our focus is going to be to try to bring some of those in.  Some of these have been ongoing for some time now; and like I said, it\u2019s hard to predict when we can finally sign off on these.  ","So I think right now, yes, we\u2019d like to do some more deals.  We have some in the pipeline.  We think we will get some more to the finish line here in the near term.  ","On the capital allocation or the cash allocation, aside from that, when you\u2019re talking about share repurchases and so forth, let me just touch on the dividends first.  We want to maintain a yield on the dividend at least where we\u2019ve been tracking here, if not better, over time; and gradually, we want to bring the yield up to the median of our peers.  Now, our peer group is a different peer group than many on the call use for peers, so be careful with that.  I want to bring it up to the median of our peer group, and we\u2019ll do that over time.  So we want to keep that track record that we have going now for about 55 years of increasing dividends every year.","In order to do that, though, we need to increase our dividend at least at the same rate as we\u2019re increasing earnings per share\u2014I mean, net income, or greater to actually gain on that yield.  So I hope that\u2019s clear to you.  So we\u2019re going to do that.  I think the Board is pretty much in agreement with that.  We\u2019ll do it over time, but we\u2019ll gradually increase that yield up to the median of our peer group over time, and we\u2019ll have an annual increase in the dividend every year as long as I\u2019m around, so I can guarantee you that.","The CAPEX, we already touched on.  The pensions, we\u2019re in good shape.  We trued that up last year; we\u2019re in very good shape.  We don\u2019t have to do anything on the pension this year.  I like share repurchase, especially when our shares have been depressed like they have been.  We looked at our value of this company.  I look at\u2014I\u2019m doing acquisitions.  I can tell you that my best acquisition has been Parker stock at the prices we\u2019ve been buying this stock at.  So I would like to do more.  We will evaluate that in line with the activities that we get to the finish line with respect to acquisitions.  If we have additional capital and we\u2019re able to execute on what I said on the dividends, I\u2019ll definitely do more share repurchase.  I like\u2014especially at these kind of levels.  We\u2019re doing about 80 million anyway a year in share repurchase, just to cover stock option exercises and that.  But I\u2019d love to do more.  That will depend on what we get to the finish line here on the deals, and we\u2019ll keep you posted on that.  Hopefully that maybe sheds a little light on our game plan.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That covers it.  Thanks much.","Pamela Huggins","Thanks, Terry.  We\u2019re running out of time here, so we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.  Please proceed.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi, guys.  How are you?","Pamela Huggins","Good.  How are you, Ann?","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay.  You know, maybe Don, you would just touch on what you\u2019re seeing in North America from an OEM order perspective?  You\u2019ve got a pretty broad group of OEM customers, and I\u2019m just interested if you\u2019re hearing anything about slow down in orders on the back of the expiration of accelerated depreciation in any of your key end markets.","Donald Washkewicz","You know, I\u2019m really not hearing that in any of the markets that we serve.  I think the\u2014again, the energy markets have been extremely strong for us here, if you look at really what\u2019s doing very well in North America, and I think that\u2019s going to continue on.  The mining, oil and gas, power gen, and you name it right on down the line there, those have been extremely strong.  This whole distribution part of our business, of course, is the aftermarket, as I mentioned earlier, has been extremely strong.  ","So no, I haven\u2019t heard anything.  There was a little bit of softening we noticed in the heavy truck; but again, you know that that\u2019s been running at such high levels, I\u2019m not really all that concerned about that long-term either.  I think that\u2019s going to remain a very strong market segment for us.  So I\u2019m not really getting any feedback from anywhere that there is any dark clouds on the horizon.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, I\u2019ll leave it at that.  I think most of the other questions have been answered.  I\u2019ll take it offline.  Thanks.","Pamela Huggins ","","Thank you, Ann.  Okay, at this time I\u2019ll turn it over to Don for just a few closing comments, and before that I\u2019d just like to thank all of you for your participation and look forward to talking to you this afternoon.","Donald Washkewicz","Thanks, Pam.  I just want to then once again thank everyone that\u2019s on the call for joining us this morning.  I think we had a real good call, meaningful.  Hopefully we shared a lot of information that was meaningful to you.  ","I\u2019d like to also take the opportunity to thank all of our employees.  I know we have quite a few employees tuning in around the world, and I want to thank them for their commitment to serve our customers, ongoing service of the customers, which they\u2019re doing a great job of; and also, for their continuing delivery of this strong financial performance that we\u2019re witnessing here with these record quarters \u2013 a string of record quarters that we\u2019ve had and anticipate will continue to have going forward.  So just really congratulations to our global team for all their hard work and effort.","Just one last thing for those on the call \u2013 keep in mind that even with some of the headwinds we\u2019re facing, we\u2019ve got some tailwinds as well and we still are on track to achieve record performance in fiscal 2012 and should finish up as one of our better years for the Company.","So once again, I want to thank everybody for their participation and their continued interest in Parker, and I will say that Pam will be available the balance of the day to take any calls or answer any additional questions that you may have.   Thanks and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.  This concludes the presentation.  You may now disconnect.  Have a wonderful day."]}}
