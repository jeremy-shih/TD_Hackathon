My name is Ashley and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Navient Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Mr. Joe Fisher, you may begin your conference.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Ashley. Good morning and welcome to Navient\u2019s 2018 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO and Chris Lown, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the second quarter 2018 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted on the Investors page at navient.com. Thank you.","And now, I will turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I provide my comments on this quarter\u2019s positive results, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the regulatory political issues. We are approaching the fifth anniversary since the CFPB served its first civil investigated demand on the company.","This process has been backwards from the start. It began with the conclusion that the problems student loan borrowers were experiencing were caused by improper servicing then they looked for examples. However, the ongoing search for evidence to support this claim continues to come up empty handed. The bureau is now requesting yet another extension to continue its search. Five years and no evidence, it\u2019s time for this case to be dismissed.","These regulatory cases do not address the real issues facing federal student loan borrowers. High-cost, lack of financial planning, resources, program complexity and low graduation rates are the issues that need to be addressed. We have long advocated for changes to address these issues. And today, we published a letter that lays out the issues and advances five recommendations that would improve outcomes for borrowers. This letter is available at news.navient.com.","Let\u2019s turn to something positive, our financial results. Our results this quarter were particularly strong across the board. On a consolidated basis, we generated adjusted core earnings of $0.52. Earnings were driven by stable margins, strong refi originations, continued improvement in private credit portfolio performance and lower operating expense.","In our federal loan segment, we continue to deliver stable student loan spreads, even in a rising rate environment. We also delivered greater efficiency in our funding and operating expense. This quarter\u2019s results did include a higher provision for risk-sharing as a result of several factors, including the numerous natural disasters last year. As a result, this is a one-time increase in the provision. Results also include the release of a prior reserve on deferred revenue. This benefit is also a one-time issue.","In Consumer Lending, we continue to see growing demand for our refi loans with total volume this quarter of $629 million, a 26% increase from the first quarter. Our forecast for the second half of the year is equally strong and we expect to continue to see double-digit quarter-over-quarter origination growth. Importantly, our refi products help borrowers save thousands in interest expense over the life of the loans.","Year-to-date, credit performance in this segment has been exceptionally positive. While we don\u2019t expect similar outperformance in the balance of the year, we still expect performance to match our overall forecast for second half defaults. The strong employment environment, our effective repayment programs and the transfer of last year\u2019s portfolio purchases onto our servicing platform are the key contributors to our outperformance year-to-date.","In Business Processing, total revenue increased 23% with particularly strong growth in the services we provide to hospitals. I remain excited about the growth prospects in this business and our ability to deliver superior performance for our customers. We continue to leverage the operating skills and data strategies we\u2019ve developed in our loan origination, our loan servicing operations to deliver double-digit operating margins. For example, we\u2019ve deployed several automation tools this year that improve the speed and quality of processing for our clients. Importantly, we see further opportunities for continued organic growth and improving margins.","We\u2019re also focused on improving our net interest margin by lowering our effective borrowing costs. We completed several financing transactions year-to-date at cost better than planned. And we\u2019ve also completed several refinancing transactions that have lowered our cost of funds.","On the unsecured debt side, we\u2019ve eliminated our remaining 2018 maturities and have reduced the overall amount of outstanding unsecured debt. Combined with our retained earnings, our TNA ratio is within our target range. As a result, we repurchased 4.3 million shares on July 2, and we expect to complete our remaining share repurchase authorization this year. Our robust capital and liquidity position will allow us to take advantage of the share price.","We also completed the previously announced strategic agreement to sell our student loan servicing platform to First Data. I have long believed that servicers and loan owners would be better off sharing a robust common platform. This transaction helps create an environment for this to occur by allowing what I believe to be the most effective and most efficient platform to become a neutral technology platform that other servicers and loan owners can benefit from. In addition, this agreement contributes to our improving operating efficiency and converts our platform servicing expense from a fixed to variable structure.","Our results this quarter and year-to-date reflect the value our franchise can deliver. That includes maximizing cash flows from our legacy portfolios, offering lending products that deliver strong value to consumers, leveraging our skills in new businesses and allocating capital to its highest return. I\u2019m confident that our efforts will continue to deliver real value for our customers, teammates and investors.","Chris will now provide a deeper summary of our financial results. Chris?","Chris Lown","Thank you, Jack, and thank you to everyone on today\u2019s call for your interest in Navient. During my prepared remarks, I will review the second quarter results for 2018. I will be referencing the earnings call presentation, which can be found on the company\u2019s website in the Investors section.","Starting on Slide 3, adjusted core EPS was $0.52 in the second quarter versus $0.44 from a year ago. This brings our year-to-date adjusted core EPS to $0.95. As a result of our solid performance during the first half of the year, we are updating our full year EPS guidance to $1.90 to $1.95, excluding restructuring and regulatory related expenses. A few key highlights from the quarter include better than expected private education performance, continued focus on cost rationalization, robust loan origination growth and business processing fee revenue growth of 23%.","Let\u2019s now move into the segment reporting, beginning with Federal Education Loans on Slide 4. Core earnings were $148 million for the second quarter versus $138 million in the second quarter of 2017. Primarily as a result of the elevated use of disaster forbearance at the end of 2017, we expect to see temporarily higher charge-offs in the next several quarters. The provision for FFELP loans in this quarter therefore increased to $40 million from $10 million in the prior and year ago quarter. This increased provision captures the expected increase in charge-offs, and we expect that FFELP provision for the second half of the year to be back in the $10 million range per quarter.","In addition, on the expense side, we saw the reversal of reserve, which reduced expenses by $40 million in the quarter. The net interest margin for the second quarter was 82 basis points compared to 81 basis points in the year ago quarter. We expect the full year FFELP\u2019s student loan NIM to be in the high 70s to low 80s.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 and our Consumer Lending segment. Core earnings in this segment increased to $66 million from $40 million in the second quarter of 2017. In the second quarter, the Consumer Lending net interest margin was 321 basis points and in line with our expectations. We continue to expect full year NIM to be around 325 basis points. This guidance includes the expectation of two additional rate hikes to occur in September and December.","We\u2019re very pleased with the continued growth in our refinance originations and improvement in our credit quality. During the quarter, we originated $629 million of Education Refinance Loans and through the first six months have originated $1.1 billion. As a result of this growth, we are on pace for at least $2 billion of education refinance loan originations for the full year.","Private Education Loan losses and delinquencies continued to decline year-over-year with total charge-offs declining by $47 million or 39% from the prior year. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate provision expense of around $75 million per quarter.","Let\u2019s continue to Slide 6 to review our Business Services segment. Fee revenues in this segment grew 23% from the prior year. The growth from the prior year was primarily driven by new client wins in healthcare and the acquisition of Duncan Solutions in July 2017. As discussed on the first quarter call, we continue to target EBITDA margins in the high-teens and are on pace to achieve our previously disclosed guidance of at least 30% revenue growth in 2018.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 to provide additional color on our operating efficiency initiatives. This month, we closed on a previously announced strategic agreement with First Data. This agreement has numerous benefits, including variabilizing key components of our student loan technology expenses over the long-term. In addition to this announcement, we continued to focus on reducing operating expenses associated with our legacy businesses and optimizing our expense structure across all business lines.","Some additional examples of our ongoing initiatives include the consolidation of least-known facilities, increased deployment of our shared services model, business process automization and optimizing our financing capacity to reduce costs. These actions build on our strong track record of improving operating efficiency and managing an expense structure that compares very favorably to our peers.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 8, which highlights our financing activity. During the quarter, we extended the terms of the FFELP ABCP facility and a private education ABCP facility, while managing our maximum financing amount to reduce costs associated with excess capacity. Fees relating to these facilities were also reduced by over 10%. We continue to explore opportunities to more effectively manage financing expenses in both our private and FFELP ABCP facilities.","In the quarter, we issued a $997 million FFELP ABS transaction and a $521 million Private Education Loan ABS transaction. Year-to-date, we have issued $1.7 billion of Private Educational Loan ABS compared to $662 million and $488 million for all of 2017 and 2016, respectively.","During the quarter, we issued $500 million of unsecured notes due June 26 at an all-in cost of one month LIBOR plus 3.95%. We retired or repurchased $1.3 billion of unsecured notes in the quarter, which resulted in a $7 million loss and do not have any remaining maturities in 2018. On July 2, the company repurchased 4.3 million shares for $60 million through a derivative contract. As of today, the company has $100 million of remaining authority under its current share repurchase program. We expect to exhaust the remaining authority in 2018, while ending the year with a TNA ratio between 1.23x and 1.25x.","Let\u2019s turn to GAAP results on Slide 9. We recorded second quarter GAAP net income of $83 million or $0.31 per share compared with net income of $112 million or $0.39 per share in the second quarter of 2017. The primary difference between the core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions. In summary, our financial results this quarter were particularly strong across the board and we feel confident in achieving our goals that we outlined for the remainder of 2018.","I\u2019ll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Michael Tarkan with Compass Point.","Michael Tarkan","Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate the commentary on the storm as it relates to FFELP versus private. But as we think about the private side, can you just talk a little bit about the trajectory there sort of delinquencies and ultimately how we should think about reserves over the next 12 to 18 months as you mix more towards Earnest? Thanks.","Jack Remondi","It\u2019s a good question. On the private side, I think, we feel very comfortable and confident that provisions that we have to-date, and so from that perspective, there is no change from our previous guidance and how we thought about that business. Obviously, the Earnest portfolio is performing incredibly well. You can see some of those statistics in our earnings presentation, and so, again, don\u2019t see a meaningful shift from what you\u2019ve seen historically on the private side.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. And then, I know it\u2019s early, but in terms of CECL and new accounting rules coming on, I\u2019m just kind of curious if you have an update there on that front?","Jack Remondi","So we\u2019re still doing work on the impact of CECL and we will provide additional information, but we are still early days on the analysis and the work and implementation of that standard.","Chris Lown","I\u2019ll just point out that we do have a much longer loss forecast window than most consumer lenders at two years. And our conservative designation of accounts and a TDR status, which is a life of loan reserve mechanism is a relative high percentage of our total portfolio.","Michael Tarkan","Yes, makes sense. And last one from me, on the collection side, relating to the Department of Education. And I know the situation is fairly fluid, but how should we think about potential revenues associated with that big step up in inventory that you just got and maybe as it relates to the potential for more volume given some recent court cases? Thank you.","Jack Remondi","So this has been \u2013 fluid is a good word for this. I would say, it\u2019s been highly volatile ping-pong match, I would say, with things going back and forth through the court process. Right now as it stands, the department, we understand, has been calling back placements from other agencies, but no new placements have been made. Our revenue stream on the collections-related activity is really driven by successfully enrolling customers and a loan rehabilitation process. And we get paid at the end of that process, which is typically 10 to 12 months after a payment pattern is initiated. So there\u2019s \u2013 any new placements that would occur in 2018 will have minimal impact in 2018\u2019s results.","Michael Tarkan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Terry Ma with Barclays.","Terry Ma","Hey, good morning. So you guys are on pace for over $2 billion in refi loans for the year. Can you just talk about what\u2019s driving upside to your initial guidance? Is it more from the expansion of the total refi market annually or you\u2019re just taking more share?","Jack Remondi","So, we don\u2019t have a pure insight into total volume that\u2019s occurring nationally, but we believe our strategies of how we are targeting and marketing the product, primarily through digital, the digital means and our ability to decision and fund loans relatively quickly is what\u2019s allowing us to grow our volume faster than what we think the market is growing at. So we would say we\u2019re taking market share.","Our insights here are really a huge advantage for us in addition to the digital strategies that we deploy, is our insights into loan performance. And as Chris mentioned, the credit performance of the refi business has been exceptionally strong and much better than kind of the way we would model it live to date. So we\u2019re very happy with what we are seeing so far.","Terry Ma","Got it. So credit has been tracking better for refi. Are your acquisition costs also tracking in line with expectations? Can you talk a little bit more about that?","Jack Remondi","Yes. Our CTAs, cost to acquire has been also slightly better than planned. And as I said, our competition competes in the space in multiple ways. Many players are large, direct mail operations. We rely, principally on digital strategies to drive volume and that has a much lower cost associated with it. And we believe it\u2019s much more effective.","Terry Ma","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks.","Jack Remondi","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. My first question is the confidence level that disaster forbearance impact is behind us. Maybe you could explain the timing of why it happened this specific quarter? And how we should think about the impact going forward? Thanks.","Jack Remondi","Yes. So there were a number of disaster forbearances and these are disaster zones declared by the federal government in 2017. And by design of the federal loan program, any borrower who is delinquent in that status, we place into a mandatory forbearance. So these are not voluntary positions. If you become delinquent, the department requests us to put them into a mandatory forbearance.","As those customers exit those forbearance statuses, we then begin to see the entry rates of accounts into delinquent statuses and then resolution rates. And so your ability to predict what will likely be higher loss rates or default rates on that portfolio really don\u2019t show up until the customers exit those statuses.","As we begin to see them, I think, we\u2019ve taken a very conservative position as to what we expect will happen here based on entry rates and resolution rates. It all happens at once. So you see it all at the same kind of timeframe here for the most part in our two-year loss window says to us that this one-time $30 million increase in the provision is enough to cover all expected losses as a result of the disaster forb.","Interestingly, we\u2019re not saying the same kind of performance in the private loan side equation. It shouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise. The customers are different in those segments; one\u2019s a credit underwritten loans, the other is not. And the private loan performance continues to be year-to-date is significantly better than we projected.","Chris Lown","And I think that Jack\u2019s point is important to just remember back that third quarter, fourth quarter and first quarter, we had rolling natural disasters, whether it was Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico and then California, with the mudslides and the wildfires. I mean, it just was a rolling natural disaster that we were monitoring very closely and we were watching come through.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And then my second question on the capital management planning process going forward and I guess I\u2019m more thinking about next year, one weighing items like the growth in the consolidation loans in school potentially and CECL. Could you just talk about how we should think about capital management into next year? I know you talked about the share repurchase authorization for the remainder of the year, but maybe we could think a little bit ahead. Thanks.","Chris Lown","So I think that thinking into 2019, the guidance we have given, we still haven\u2019t clearly formulated it but I would \u2013 it would be highly likely that you\u2019re talking about a range still on the 1.23x to 1.25x. That range in our views taking into consideration a number of factors, which includes potential impact of CECL originations, buyback capital management. And so I think, thinking in your capital analysis of that 1.23x to 1.25x for next year is important but still a little uncertain how the regulators and also the rating agencies are going to manage the impact of CECL. And so we\u2019re in dialogue and following that closely, but there is still \u2013 it is still not clear exactly how they\u2019re going to treat that.","Sanjay Sakhrani","So should we see a pickup in the pace of share repurchases then?","Chris Lown","Versus what?","Sanjay Sakhrani","Versus this year?","Chris Lown","I think clearly, if you look at \u2013 if you do a capital analysis of what\u2019s freed up, what our capital uses are, there clearly should be room to have a pickup. Again, we haven\u2019t made up a determination yet, but the capital allocation analysis would suggest that.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. Kind of following up on that question, you\u2019ve been able to reduce the debt footprint this quarter. Is that something that can go on over the next few quarters to 2019 and 2020? Because I think that\u2019s going to be a significant factor in terms of maintaining that TNA ratio.","Chris Lown","So that\u2019s a great question. We are consistently looking in the open market to repurchase debt. Obviously, we do the analysis of what\u2019s buying that debt in the open market is versus a make-whole call versus waiting to maturity. But where there are opportunities to acquire debt in the open market in the 2019s and the 2020s, we do so and \u2013 when it\u2019s an advantage versus a make-whole call. So there are opportunities, but I\u2019ll tell you, the closer you get to the maturity date, the more robust in sellers are at that better value. But we do continue to monitor that and we have a very active dialogue with investment banks around what maybe in the market.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. And kind of on a slightly different vein, you mentioned in the opening remarks the idea of switching to a more variable cost call for servicing. I was hoping maybe you could flesh that out a little more, what are other opportunities that could give you both from the standpoint of potentially doing other things and in terms of reducing costs?","Jack Remondi","So our focus has, I think, if you look at the history of our company, we\u2019ve always been very focused on the expense side of the equation and running a very efficient, effective organization. When we look at our cost ratios compared to our peers, it was \u2013 we clearly outperformed. One of the \u2013 you are pointing to one particular structure, which is that, when we had, we build our platform, our platform benefited tremendously from growth in the number of assets or accounts that we serviced.","And so, as we look at our business today, in where we sit with our FFELP business declining where we sit with the Department of Education recompete bid and kind of what they\u2019re trying to achieve. We really saw two things that we were trying to \u2013 two main things we were trying to pursue with this deal. One is, it was clearly a call and a demand for a neutral platform that could be shared by multiple parties and not be viewed as something that would impact a competitor in that side of the equation.","They were looking for something that was very robust and efficient and scalable, clearly what our platform is capable of. And by putting it into that neutral position, we think we have positioned that platform to be more attractive for long-term solutions. The second thing we were trying to achieve is what Chris and I mentioned in our comments is converting our cost from fixed to variable. And so, our fee structure is now on a like a Software-as-a-Service type of structure, we are paying on a per unit measure. And so as our volume goes up and down, our costs are now much more variable than it would be if we were maintaining a large mainframe servicing platform for our own use.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Mark Hammond with Bank of America.","Mark Hammond","Thank you. Hi, Jack, Chris and Joe. I had a question on funding. So I\u2019m looking at what\u2019s coming due on the unsecured and there is 1.2 of unsecured bonds coming due in Jan 2019. And so I was thinking with that in mind, can you give the approximate capacity that\u2019s left that you could do for that private education loan repurchase facilities for the overcollateralization? Is there any capacity left there?","Chris Lown","In the Turbo facilities today where there isn\u2019t capacity obviously, everyday that goes by that a capacity starts to increase, but we have for the moment, maximized that opportunity. But we obviously have numerous liquidity sources, cash on hand. We obviously have a huge unencumbered balance of both FFELP and private loans. We have other financing arrangements as well as the unsecured market, which, as I mentioned before, we tapped last month. So I think, we really feel confident about 2019 and 2020 and it\u2019s more about optimizing the cost of that refinancing effort versus raising the liquidity.","Mark Hammond","All right.","Jack Remondi","Mark, you\u2019re pointing out here to that I mean, this is the single largest expense within the company. And we are very focused on the different tools that we have, access points that we have available to us and not just provide liquidity, but to drive down our overall interest expense. And we\u2019ve been successful at this year and we expect to continue to put our full focus on that for the balance of 2018 and beyond.","Mark Hammond","Understood. Thanks. And then on the reserve release this quarter and more of a bookkeeping thing, what revenue stream was that tied to for the release there?","Jack Remondi","This was a deferred revenue component that we had reserved for on a contingency basis to service \u2013 for services we no longer provide. And as a result of that, we were able to release the reserve.","Mark Hammond","Got it. And is there anything similar to this on the horizon that I should be looking for? Or is this more of just a one time and move on?","Jack Remondi","It was a one time and it just came through this quarter.","Mark Hammond","All right. Thanks for taking my questions.","Jack Remondi","Sure. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Henry Coffey with Wedbush.","Henry Coffey","Good morning, everyone. And thanks for all the detail on this. When we look at the First Data contract, should we assume \u2013 just really two questions. One, should we assume essentially they\u2019re your sub-servicer, but you still have \u2013 like as would be the case in the mortgage business, you still have sort of the financial implications of holding onto that servicing? And secondly, looking at the Department of Ed, I know we should be hearing something soon, assuming that \u201cyou won everything and your servicing balances doubled or you lost everything and it went away,\u201d what would be the financial implications for you of either of those outcomes, given that you have this new sort of variable cost model?","Chris Lown","So on the First structure, we are basically using, First Data provides a technology service to us of the account record and effectively the accounting system for our loan servicing. All of the servicing work including back-office processing, customer service activity, customer outreach, default prevention are things that we continue to perform. So we\u2019re effectively, as I said it\u2019s like a Software-as-a-Service agreement. We\u2019re licensing that platform to use on behalf of the accounts that we service. The Department of Education RP has been \u2013 the decisions there have been delayed due to a big protest, which we expect to be resolved sometime in September.","What the timing is for a decision after that is a TBD. We don\u2019t quite know. What the department\u2019s RP design provides for here is they are looking to segment the different components of loan servicing. So they\u2019re looking for a technology platform, they\u2019re looking to have a single brand that all customer accounts would be effectively serviced by the department \u2013or be known as the Department of Education. And then have multiple parties that would provide back-office customer service related issues. We think that brings \u2013 bring about significant cost efficiencies.","We think it can address uniformity in terms of servicing and eliminate some customer confusion. We get, for example, a fair number of customers think we own the loan and therefore set the interest rate and all the policies associated with that. We even have some regulators who think that \u2013 our job is we manage the loans on behalf of the terms and conditions that Congress and the Department of Education set. So we like what we see in that RP and hopefully, we will get decisions quickly here.","Henry Coffey","So with a single brand, if I\u2019m mad at my servicer, I\u2019ll be throwing darts at the Department of ED, not at Navient?","Jack Remondi","It would be \u2013 so that would be correct. Your account would be owned by the department and you would know your account would be owned by the Department of ED.","Henry Coffey","And I would blame them for all my woes?","Jack Remondi","Well, service and responsibility, doing a good job for a customer would still be held to the servicer and no one would ever be relieved of that obligation. And we\u2019re not looking to be relieved of that obligation. But when you owe money to a party, you owe it to the lender. You don\u2019t owe it to the servicer. When the interest rate is set on the loan, the interest rate is set by the lender, not by the servicer. If you are worried about loan forgiveness opportunities or get discharged, those are terms that are set by the lender, not by the servicer. Those are the things that would be properly belong at the lender level.","Henry Coffey","So the situation with the CFPB, everything rings true to us in terms of what the mortgage industry went through and it\u2019s the same deal that Fannie Mae is the one who determine the outcomes, but everybody would demonize the banks. But it was an identical situation. So one of the things that came out of the CFPB is when you had the stand-in Director, who\u2019s from South Carolina.","One of the first things he did was he immediately kind of backed off and all their punitive action against the small loan and payday loan industry, all of which are heavily concentrated in South Carolina. Is it some natural evolution of your case with the CFPB where it finally gets to the very top level of the organization and then the director finally rules or because there is a court case, is there something that just kind of drags on until the court sort of either rule or everybody decides to let it go?","Jack Remondi","I can\u2019t speak to how the CFPB will manage the caseload and the issues that are in front of them. I can speak to our particular case as it relates to the court process. As I said, this has been somewhat of a backwards process. They issued their conclusion before they began their research. And since that conclusion five years ago, they\u2019ve been in search of evidence to support what they believe to be true. They have found nothing. And there is no evidence to-date to support their case.","I mean, these are in the court filings. They have not presented any customer accounts that are consistent with their claims. The big frustration for us is that in a civil legal matter like this, we do not have a right to a speedy trial. So here we are two years into the legal process and we probably won\u2019t see the inside of a courtroom if this thing goes to trial for another two years. And so our arguments here are, you had five years to look your evidence, you found none. It\u2019s time to move on.","Henry Coffey","Well stated. It does not seem that any of this, except with the fact that it is a very time-consuming and expensive, it hasn\u2019t impacted your \u2013 with the Department of ED?","Jack Remondi","No. We have a very good relationship with the Department of Ed. I think the things that stand out for us is that we deliver on the service levels for them. Our customer performance leads the industry. We have the highest levels of enrollment and income-driven repayment plans. We have the lowest levels of severe delinquency and our customers, if you\u2019re serviced by Navient, are 37% less likely to default. If every other servicer met our standard, 300,000 fewer defaults would have occurred last year.","Henry Coffey","Great. Thank you very much for your comments.","Jack Remondi","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Del Grosso with Jefferies.","Mike Del Grosso","Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I guess, higher level one though on the private student loan refi market, can you briefly comment about some of the characteristics of those originations, any noteworthy descriptors or borrower characteristics? Or would you say it\u2019s generally a fairly broad-based cross-section of the student loan market?","Jack Remondi","No, it is not broad-based, the federal student loan marketplace and these products, the refi product is designed for customers who have completed their education, had joined \u2013 had successfully entered the workplace and had demonstrated a successful career record over a number of years. So these are borrowers who have been in repayment for a number of years and have been successful at making payments.","It\u2019s designed for customers who can manage that have substantial cash flow, to be able to manage their monthly payments, don\u2019t need some of the flexible repayment programs that are available on the federal loan side of the equation and are looking to pay off their loans faster and save thousands, in many cases, tens of thousands of dollars of interest over the remaining life of their loans. So it is a segment of the total of $1.4 trillion of outstanding debt that would qualify for this product.","Chris Lown","And you can get a pretty good handle on the market too. If you look at the myriad of securitization documents, will give you breakdowns of customer type, graduate, undergraduate, FICO bands, et cetera. So you actually pretty quickly determine what this universe is.","Mike Del Grosso","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi.","Arren Cyganovich","Thanks. Just on the consumer lending net interest margin, I think, guidance was for 325 for the full year. It has been declining through the first half of the year. I think you said that there was couple of rate hikes that will be helping that. I haven\u2019t really noticed that being particularly sensitive to rate hikes. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving the expected increase there?","Chris Lown","There are some financing costs benefits, which we expect to see come through in the second half of the year. And so again, we feel pretty comfortable with our 325 guidance. Obviously, in the first, second quarter, you did see it lower than that guidance but our expectation is to have in that area for the full year.","Arren Cyganovich","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ashish Nair with Citi.","Ashish Nair","Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. I just had one quick one. In the past, you viewed yourself as a BB company. I don\u2019t know how much you can say but I\u2019m curious, is that the view shared by your new investors? And have you had discussions with them on how you get there in near-term in terms of debt pay down versus investment in your \u2013 on the private side, growth in the private side and the servicing business?","Chris Lown","Well, I\u2019d say we are a BB company today. I mean the reality is two of three rating agencies have us in that zip code and one doesn\u2019t. Our expectation is the issues around our ratings are not related to capital liquidity that really related to the exogenous events that are currently around the company, including the CFPB lawsuit and the debt maturities in 2019 and 2020.","We obviously feel very comfortable with being able to manage these maturities in 2019 and 2020. We remain hopeful that we can resolve our issues with the CFPB. And so, again, if those pressures were to ease, we clearly would be back from a rating agency perspective in the BB area because those are the primary concerns that they\u2019ve highlighted to us.","Ashish Nair","Got it. And I know I read that you hedged \u2013 your portfolio is hedged for the next five years. How much of your portfolio is hedged? Could you remind us?","Chris Lown","I\u2019m sorry, say that again?","Ashish Nair","In your press release, it said that your portfolio is hedged to the next five years on the rate side.","Chris Lown","Are you talking about our floor income or ones-threes exposure?","Ashish Nair","No, floor income.","Chris Lown","Yes. Our floor income is hedged for the next four years 90%-plus. There is obviously still some additional value we can derive from it, but it was clearly prudent to hedge a lot of that exposure given the rising rate environment. And we do provide some disclosure of yearly floor income, but again that 90% number is what we\u2019ve done for the next four years.","Ashish Nair","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now turn the call back over to Joe Fisher for closing remarks.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Ashley. I would like to thank everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. If you have any other follow-up questions, feel free to contact me directly. This concludes today\u2019s call.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"15651":["Navient Corp. (NASDAQ:NAVI) Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call April 22, 2015  8:00 AM ET","Executives","","Joe Fisher - VP of IR","Jack Remondi - CEO","Somsak Chivavibul - CFO","Analysts","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","David Hochstim - Buckingham Research","Michael Tarkan - Compass Point","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Eric Beardsley - Goldman Sachs","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery","Mark DeVries - Barclays","Operator","Good morning. My name is Keith and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Navient First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call.","[Operator Instructions]","Joe Fisher, you may begin your conference.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Keith. Good morning and welcome to Navient's 2015 First Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO, and Somsak Chivavibal, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations, and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the Company's Form 10 and other filings with the SEC.","During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures we call our core earnings. The description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures, and our GAAP results can be found in the first quarter 2015 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted, along with the earnings press release, on the investors page at navient.com.","Thank you and now I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter's earnings call. Thank you for listening. I appreciate your interest and your support.","Later this month, on April 30, we will mark our one-year anniversary of Navient. We've accomplished much in this 12-month period, and we're well-positioned to continue our ongoing success in the future.","In the past 12 months, we've acquired $13 billion in student loans, assisted over 12 million student loan servicing customers in their path to successfully managing their loans, added $2.6 billion in projected cash flows to our student loan portfolio, and received $4.2 billion from cash collections and financings. We returned over $948 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.","We began executing on our growth strategy, most notably with this quarter's acquisition of Gila, and we launched the Navient brand to our customers. This quarter's results, which Somsak will cover in more detail in a few minutes, continued these trends with core earnings of $0.48 a share, $830 million in student loan acquisitions, continued improvement in student loan performance, and $363 million returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","While this quarter's results are good, we can and will do better. We need to move faster to grow and diversify our business revenues.","We need to decrease our need for high-cost, unsecured debt and we must continue to do more to make our business efficient. In asset management, in addition to the $830 million in student loans we acquired this quarter, we sold $189 million in third-party serviced FFELP loans, generating a gain of $5 million.","The market for loan assets today, including student loans, is a seller's market. While we continue to expect the volume of loans available for sale to be sizeable, we often see very high prices being paid. We will remain disciplined in our pricing and not chase volume for volume's sake.","Given our significant cost advantage in servicing and our ability to deliver superior performance and customer success, our sweet spot remains whole loans where we can convert the portfolio to our servicing platform. Here, we believe we will continue to remain competitive; however, depending on market conditions, we may offer additional portfolios of third-party serviced loans for sale.","During the quarter, we realized $800 million in cash flow from our student loan portfolio and added an additional $1.1 billion to our future cash flows through acquisitions, from lower interest rates, and improved credit expectations. In Business Services, we now service over $300 billion in student loans for more than 12.5 million customers.","On the credit front, we continue to see delinquency rates and our outlook for future expected charge-offs on our private portfolio improve. For example, the 90-day delinquency rate on our private loan portfolio fell to 3.6% at March 31 from 3.9% a year ago.","On the FFELP side, contrary to reports of much higher national rates, our 90-day delinquency rate was 8.4% at month end. Yes, our rate is calculated using only loans in repayment in the denominator.","More importantly, for the federal loans we service, we continue to see significant improvement in recent graduates' ability to successfully manage their loans. For example, the class of 2014, which recently entered repayment, is showing the best performance of any recent graduating class.","In fact, measured at the same time in repayment, their 30-plus delinquency rate is one-half the rate of borrowers who graduated in the great recession and 6% lower than the class of 2013. These results illustrate the continued material improvement in student loan performance we have seen since the peak of the great recession.","When used wisely, education loans help millions of students achieve their education dreams and earn a higher standard of living. Our data shows that, on average, these borrowers have manageable balances and are successful in managing their loans.","The federal loan program, however, offers limited resources to help students and families make more informed and better decisions before they borrow. As a result, although overall trends are good and are improving, not all borrowers are experiencing the potential benefits of higher education.","As a servicer, our relationship with borrowers only begins after the loan is made. As a result, our efforts and outreach are designed to help all borrowers understand the repayment options available to them and to help them navigate a path to successfully manage their loans.","In our asset recovery business, I'm very pleased to welcome Gila to our team. Gila, which was acquired in February, adds a talented, innovative management team, proven capabilities, and over 600 clients to our business platform.","This acquisition is a very strong fit with our growth objectives in this space and in just a few months, they're already exceeding plan. We'll continue to look for ways to grow in this space, both organically and through future acquisitions.","Also during the quarter, the Department of Education decided to not extend our 2009 education loan collections contract. This was disappointing and surprising news as we had consistently achieved top performance rankings and received satisfactory reviews from the Department, including the most recent review conducted after their announcement of non-renewal. While the long-term opportunities for the Department of Education loan collections contract remain unresolved, we'll continue to focus our efforts on delivering superior results and the strong compliance focus our asset recovery customers have long experienced from us and count on us for.","Total operating expenses for the quarter include several seasonal factors that did not repeat during the rest of the year. In addition, we are incurring expense associated with the acquisition of the Wells portfolio, which includes both third-party rates that run significantly higher than our own costs and one-time costs associated with the planning and execution of the transfer of the majority of these loans on to our platform.","The conversion process remains on track to be completed before the end of the third quarter and we will produce material benefits in both operating expense and loan performance. During the quarter, we continued to receive a number of requests for information from multiple regulatory bodies. The information required to be produced is voluminous and is both time-intensive and costly to produce, adding to our total expenses.","We continue to be responsive and collaborative while providing additional insight into the efforts we made to help our customers successfully manage their loans. For example, in addition to helping our customers avoid the negative consequences of default, with default rates 40% better than the industry average, we recently launched a series of webinars to help our customers on a variety of financial topics, including navigating the significant and growing complexity of the federal student loan program, such as differences between income-sensitive or income-based repayment options. Working with policymakers to reduce program complexity has been a significant focus for us.","Finally, we're also keeping our commitment to maintain a strong financial profile and create value for our shareholders. Our capital levels remain both strong and conservative given our risk profile and our reserves for loan losses cover more than 2 times annualized charge-offs. While maintaining this strong financial profile, we've repurchased $300 million in shares, mainly in February and March, and paid out $63 million in dividends during the quarter.","I continue to remain confident in our ability to generate core earnings per share of $2.20 for the year and our ability to lead the industry in helping customers successfully manage their loans and to execute on our growth initiatives. Combined with the $35 billion in cash flows we expect to generate from our loan portfolio, we will continue to deliver value for our customers, employees, and shareholders. Somsak will now provide more details of our financial results for the quarter.","Somsak Chivavibul","Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.","In the first quarter, we reported core earnings of $0.48 per share compared to $0.49 per share from a year ago after adjusting for expenses related to regulatory matters. Our first quarter operating expenses totaled $230 million and that's compared to adjusted operating expenses of $207 million from the year-ago quarter.","The increase in operating expenses is related to incremental costs resulting from the recent Gila acquisition, incremental third-party servicing costs related to the $8.5 billion of loans acquired from Wells in the prior quarter, and costs related to operating as a new separate company post-spin. As a result, we do expect our core EPS to be $2.20 in 2015 and operating expenses to come in less than $900 million in 2015.","Let's move to slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $85 million for the first quarter compared with $64 million in the first quarter of 2014. In the quarter, FFELP student loan spread was 96 basis points and the associated NIM was 88 basis points.","The full-year spread will be impacted by potential future loan acquisitions, as well as future LIBOR rates, which will impact the amount of unhedged floor income in our portfolio. Going forward, we expect our FFELP student loan spread to be in the low to mid-90s and the net interest margin to be roughly 8 basis points lower than the spread.","Let's turn to slide 6 to review our Private Education Loan segment results. Core earnings in this segment increased $3 million from the year-ago quarter to $77 million.","Our first quarter student loan spread came in at 3.87% and the associated NIM was 3.74%. Compared to the prior year, the spread was impacted by an increase in cost of funds and several one-time items; the largest of which was a $4.2 million acceleration of deferred financing fees.","For the rest of 2015, we expect the Private Student Loan spread to be approximately 4% and the associated net interest margin to be approximately 10 basis points lower than the spread. Our first quarter charge-offs were 2.9% or $28 million lower than the first quarter of last year and we continue to see year-over-year improvements in our forbearance, total delinquency, and 90-plus day delinquency rates. The improvement in our outlook of future charge-offs led to a decrease in our provision for losses, which came in at $120 million for the quarter, and that's a decrease of $16 million from a year-ago quarter.","Slide 7 shows our asset quality trends over the last five years. Our private credit portfolio is a well-seasoned portfolio with 93% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments.","Our highest risk segment, what we call nontraditional loans, that portfolio is now down to only 8% of our portfolio. We expect charge-offs to continue their year-over-year improvement and our annual charge-offs for 2015 is expected to end between 2.2% and 2.4%.","Let's now turn to slide 8 to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $86 million in the quarter, that's compared with $116 million in the first quarter of 2014.","We saw an increase in our asset recovery revenues of $9 million versus the fourth quarter and this increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Gila, which expands our fingerprint in the asset recovery and business process outsourcing space. The decline from the year-ago quarter was driven by a new reduced fee structure from guarantee agencies which became effective on July 1, 2014. We do expect our asset recovery revenues to be approximately $90 million per quarter for the remainder of 2015.","Today, the Company services loans for 12.5 million borrowers with 6.2 million borrowers under the Department of Education servicing contract. Our third-party servicing revenue increased to $44 million in the quarter with $31 million coming from the Department of Education servicing contract.","Let's now turn to slide 9 for highlights of our loan acquisition and financing activity for the year. We acquired $830 million of student loans in the first quarter. As Jack mentioned, our best opportunity for loan purchases remain whole loan portfolios that we can convert to our servicing platform and in addition, we may be seller of additional portfolios of third-party serviced loans.","Our ABS transactions continue to track strong investor demand. In the quarter, we issued $1.7 billion in asset-backed securitizations and just last week, we repriced a $997 million FFELP ABS transaction which came in at tighter spreads than our previous ABS issuance. In the quarter, we issued $0.5 billion of six-year unsecured notes, the better match on maturity profile to the predictable cash flows that come from our student loan portfolio.","In the past year, we have reduced our unsecured debt outstanding by roughly $600 million while increasing our projected cash flows by $2.6 billion, which came through loan acquisitions, higher floor income, and improving credit performance. In the quarter, we repurchased 14.7 million shares for $300 million and that activity mainly occurred in February and March.","We have remaining authority of $700 million under our current share repurchase plan and all of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position. As of March 31, 2015, our tangible net asset to unsecured debt ratio was at 1.25 times.","Finally, turning to GAAP results on slide 10, we recorded first quarter GAAP net income of $292 million or $0.72 per share and that's compared with net income of $219 million or $0.49 per share in the first quarter of 2014. And just as a reminder, the primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization that came as a result of the spin transaction, and any income society with SLM Bank Co.","With that, I will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Could you talk a little bit about the acquisition that you made in terms of the revenues that it has, what you paid for it, and how that might be applied to future acquisitions and maybe a little bit about what's out there as well?","Jack Remondi","Thanks for your question, Moshe. This is one of the areas that we identified as an opportunity for growth is in the asset recovery space, and particularly, in the state and municipal areas. Gila, which, as I mentioned, has over 600 contracts with clients in 39 states across the country, really has done a great job at building a franchise that does both asset recovery in combination with business process outsourcing.","It's this kind of combination of activities that marry both our operations capabilities with our collections performance that is attractive to us and an area that we would expect to grow both organically and through acquisitions. The organic side of the equation is obviously an area where we're most focused on and expect to be able to leverage the skills of both companies to grow faster than we would have otherwise. Somsak, you want to cover the revenues? ","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes. The annual revenues that we expect to generate or that Gila expects to generate is about a little under $70 million for the year.","Moshe Orenbuch","Just kind of pulling up, Jack, you made a comment, it sounded a little wistful that you don't really get involved with a borrower before the borrower makes that decision to make the loan. Is there any discussion anywhere about having other parties get involved in order to help that borrower make a more informed decision? Any opportunities that you would see for the Company in that?","Jack Remondi","Yes. So, I think this is one of the challenges in the space in which we operate is that student loan servicers are deemed responsible for how well or not well borrowers do in managing their loans, yet we're handed the account only after the money has been lent and spent, as we say. And one of the things that we've been advocating for, both on a policy side as well as with the Department of Education, is specifically that; is use some of the skills and data that we've built over the years to help customers make better or more informed decisions before they borrow the funds.","If you think about all of the efforts that go on in the federal loan programs today, all the borrower initiatives are driven towards helping borrowers who have already or find themselves in a position of having borrowed too much money or more money than they can afford, and we think a portion of that should really go to prevention. It's not as if you're saying, no, you can't go to school, it's just helping borrowers pick the school that better fits their profile or understand what the true cost or the full cost of getting a degree will be and making sure that they have the resources to be able to do that.","We have all of that data and skills today. We can use that with a high degree of accuracy to predict performance and allow for very direct and almost customized outreach to borrowers before the loans are made. Of course, someone has to be willing to pay for that level of education and service.","Moshe Orenbuch","Right. Okay, thank you very much.","Jack Remondi","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Hochstim from Buckingham Research.","David Hochstim","Thanks. I was wondering, is there anything more you can say about the Department of Ed collections contract loss and kind of relating what they did to what you got in your reviews, a better explanation?","Jack Remondi","Yes. So as we've said, they did not provide us \u2013 they simply decided not to extend our contract, they did not terminate it. As a result of that, the view has been that they have not needed to provide us with the detailed information behind some of their statements. We continue to press for that. I think the filing in federal courts delayed a little bit or impacts the ability to share that information.","There was a court decision to dismiss the case on jurisdiction grounds. We're still waiting for the actual write-up of the opinion here before we make decisions on the next steps, but we are obviously disappointed in the process. We would expect that if someone is making a claim of non-compliance that we would have the opportunity to review those instances and be able to respond.","We know that when we look at our own work here and when we look at the reviews that the Department of Ed conducted over the past year and a half, we don't see similar kinds of issues or findings.","David Hochstim","Thanks. Did they say that you were able to bid for future contracts or that's no longer possible?","Jack Remondi","They continue to say that we remain \u2013 our position as one of the finalists in the new collections contract remains.","David Hochstim","Okay.","Jack Remondi","No decision has been made on that contract at this point in time.","David Hochstim","Okay. Could you just tell us how much do you have in FFELP loan service by third parties at this point, roughly?","Somsak Chivavibul","It's a very small percentage of the overall $100 billion FFELP portfolio that we've got.","David Hochstim","Do you have a plan for how much long-term debt you might prepay this year?","Jack Remondi","Our plan is to continue \u2013 we have $17 billion in unsecured debt outstanding. Our plan is to continue to reduce that as the portfolio amortizes. One of the challenges in the market place today is that the unsecured debt is clearly our most expensive source of financing for our portfolio. We're really looking at different ways to reduce the demand or the need for that as a source of funding and that includes both ABS funding as well as the prepayment of the debt or repayment of the debt through cash flow and collections.","David Hochstim","Okay. Given that condition, you might securitize more of the unencumbered loans and pay down some more?","Jack Remondi","Right. But regardless of that, the balance of unsecured debt will decline as the portfolio amortizes.","David Hochstim","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Tarkan from Compass Point.","Michael Tarkan","Thanks for taking my questions. Jack, I know you mentioned that you'd look to sell maybe FFELP loans that are serviced by a third party, but if pricing really is that high, why not consider selling residuals on the loans that you specifically service yourselves?","Jack Remondi","It's a good question and it's something that we consider when we're looking at buying or selling the portfolio. We own a financial asset here with a series of cash flows and if we can sell it at better prices or higher prices than what we would pay for it or what we think it's worth, that's certainly something we have to consider.","Michael Tarkan","Is it fair to say, then, that today you're looking at third-party serviced loans, but that may change if pricing continues to accelerate?","Jack Remondi","It's certainly the first place you would go because of the economics of those transactions relative to ones that are serviced on our platform.","Michael Tarkan","Okay, thank you. On the asset recovery side, you mentioned a quarterly run rate of around $90 million. Can you tell us what percentage of that you expect to receive from the remainder of the Ed collections contract that you've already put in for the rehabilitation funnel and whether or not we should expect that to go away in 2016 at this point?","Somsak Chivavibul","Sure, Mike. We expect before the Department of Ed decision to receive about $48 million of revenues under the Ed servicing contract. We are still working our existing inventory and do expect to still recognize the vast majority of those revenues in 2015 and that is included in the $90 million per quarter estimate.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. Lastly, just big picture, we've seen a lot of growth or a lot of headlines in the student loan refinance industry, either from these new peer-to-peer lenders or banks that have gotten into the space a little more meaningfully. I know we've seen consolidations to third parties pick up a little bit in your FFELP portfolio. Can you talk about your thoughts there and whether you would contemplate some sort of refi product at this point to capture some of those consolidations or how you're thinking about that space?","Jack Remondi","The marketplace is definitely, as interest rates remain extremely low, is definitely more attractive right now. It is targeted principally to borrowers coming out of graduate schools, so high balance debt, a good income, good credit profile, very, very high credit profiles of the customers. So it hasn't had a huge impact on our holdings of loans, it's been a bigger issue on the servicing side of the equation. So it's a marketplace that we think has some positive attributes to it and we continue to look at it.","Michael Tarkan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. Maybe to drill down on a question before, I mean, Sallie Mae basically sold a bunch of loans at 10.5% premiums. When we think about those levels of premiums, do you think that's something that's attractive for you guys to go out and sell at in terms of a level?","Second, how do you think about that in terms of you being able to purchase loans from Sallie Mae going forward?","Jack Remondi","Obviously, the premiums paid on any portfolio are highly dependent upon the cash flows of the individual transactions. So this was a relatively new portfolio, so long average lives, high-yielding, and high credit quality. There's no question about if it has an impact on our ability to purchase those portfolios. The transaction that you mentioned was sold in both an ABS and then a residual sale.","Buyers \u2013 I would look at it as being people who are looking at alternatives to just traditional corporate debt. That makes it difficult for us to compete in that particular space. Whether or not we're a buyer or seller of our own portfolios really is a function of the individual cash flows associated with those deals and not so much the price that's being paid.","But it is the reflection of what we would expect the cash flows to be, what the appropriate discount rate is, and then what a potential buyer would apply in those set of circumstances. To the extent they match up against what we would expect or be different, that would drive most of those decisions.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Is it fair to say to say that you guys would be actively assessing that on a quarterly basis or a regular basis?","Jack Remondi","No question. We look at our portfolio of student loans as we own a series of cash flows. Those cash flows happen to be very predictable, sizeable, $35 billion is the expected life of loan cash flows on that. If someone else puts a higher value on those cash flows than we do, it's a financial asset that we own here and we should be looking at it as such.","Sanjay Sakhran","Perfect. My second question is, Jack, you mentioned that banks are sellers of these assets, but pricing is definitely aggressive or competitive. Could you just talk about what your thoughts are in terms of an acquisition this year and based on the landscape that's shaping up? I think US Bank moved some of its loans to held for sale, Bank of America has done the same. Maybe you could just talk about that a little bit? Thank you.","Jack Remondi","We did buy $830 million of loans this quarter. We look for portfolios where we can add value. Where we add value is where we can apply our significantly lower cost of servicing to a portfolio and drive better cash flow performance. Our customers default at a lower rate, 40% lower than the national average, and so when you combine those two things, that's where we both deliver and can capture value from acquisitions.","Portfolios that are sold with life of loan servicing on third-party platforms, we can't bring any of those benefits to the borrowers or to the portfolio and so our pricing is, by definition, less competitive and those portfolios are less attractive to us. Some of the transactions that we have not acquired this year, the majority of them, are, in fact, those types of transactions, life of loan servicing on a third-party platform.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Beardsley from Goldman Sachs.","Eric Beardsley","Hi, thank you. Just to follow up on the acquisitions, as you're looking at these collections platform, where do you see the most opportunity? Is it the state and municipal area? Are there other opportunities in student loans?","Jack Remondi","What we look for in the asset recovery space is asset classes and programs where, through both a combination of our efforts and the rationale for the consumer to resolve the outstanding debt match up well. We don't do work in things like credit card asset recovery.","It's more of a commodity service area that's not particularly attractive. When we do things in the municipal area, it may be fines or taxes that need to be paid in order to renew your license or free up a lien on property, so there's an added incentive to do that.","We like the space a lot. It's an area where we have a relatively small market share today, even with the Gila acquisition. We think this space in particular offers an opportunity to combine both asset recovery and business processing services to the entities, which help make the business more leverageable from a margin perspective and that's really where the focus has been in terms of our growth.","We do an outstanding job in the education space. We lead the industry in terms of helping customers rehabilitate their loans, a huge benefit to the customer in terms of the value that they receive for resolving a debt obligation owed to the federal government which does not go away. But it is an area on the guarantor side of the equation where the portfolio available to collect is declining as loans are moving to direct lending and the contract moves to the Department of Ed side of the equation.","We are very interested in winning a role in the new contract in that space, but it obviously has to be at the economics in terms of both margin and regulatory aspects that combine to make it attractive for us.","Eric Beardsley","Got it. Secondly, as you look out of your earnings over the next year, any expected loan runoff? With the dividend and the buyback, how much excess capital do you expect to generate after repurchases and dividends?","Jack Remondi","I would look at our balance sheet in kind of two ways here: both the \u2013 all of our interest paying liabilities are supporting interest-earning assets, which are basically our student loans. So from that perspective, as cash flows come in and amortize, we would expect the debt capital to decline. Our equity capital is similarly really supporting \u2013 the majority of it is supporting our student loan assets as well and principally on the private credit side of the equation.","The FFELP assets don't require a whole lot of capital, as you know. So certainly as the portfolio amortizes and the cash flow is generated, we see opportunities of returns to shareholders coming from two sources: the excess spread generated or as you call it, the capital generated that we produce each year, as well as the capital release coming from the amortization of the portfolios.","Eric Beardsley","More specifically, taking into account your planned buybacks with the authorization and the dividend you have in place, will you generate any excess capital above and beyond those levels? In other words, how much dry powder do you have for acquisitions this year?","Jack Remondi","Again, it depends on the acquisitions, but our plans here for our capital return and what we have received in terms of approval from the Board take into consideration our plans for acquisitions on both portfolio, as well as entity acquisitions in the business services space. We don't break out the math on that equation.","Eric Beardsley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from comes from Sameer Gokhale from Janney Montgomery.","Sameer Gokhale","Thank you. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. The first one was if you can just revisit your commentary around the NIM for private student loans? Sounds like you talked about the year-over-year decline in the NIM and I think you called out $4.2 million \u2013 ","Jack Remondi","Yes.","Sameer Gokhale"," \u2013 in accelerated deferred financing fees. Can you just flesh that out, again, what that specifically related to? If one were to look at the sequential decline in the NIM for private student loans, if I'm doing my math correctly, it looks like the dollar impact is closer to $10 million or $11 million. What else might have been flowing through that line item that may have affected the NIM this quarter? If you can just talk about that, that would be helpful.","Somsak Chivavibul","Sure. The $4.2 million item was really related to a specific piece of financing that was redeemed early. Once it was redeemed early, we have deferred financing fees that we previously capitalized and that gets amortized over the expected remaining life of the debt. Since it was called early, we had to charge off that fee and that amount ran through NIM.","As far as the remaining, you're right, I'll call it the other items, as far as the sequential reduction to NIM, probably accounted for about $10 million or so. It's just a variety of other smaller one-time items that ran through this quarter that we don't expect to recur for the rest of the year.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. That's helpful. Just changing gears a little bit, Jack, you talked about your interest in acquiring additional debt recovery companies, collections companies. Now, would you wait until you get additional clarification from the CFPB as far as new rules? Because if proposed rules for, say, the payday lending industry, that's created a significant amount of turmoil for that industry.","So my sense is you probably prefer to wait for additional clarity from the CFPB as far as new rules for the debt recovery industry. But I just want to get a sense for whether you feel additional acquisitions are maybe more than 12 months out once we get more clarity or are you willing to, at the right price, pull the trigger sooner than that?","Jack Remondi","I think it all depends on the type of asset class that the entity is operating within. In the state and municipal side of the equation, to set a combination \u2013 these activities can be a combination of both asset recovery and processing. So it may be the billing activities associated with an unpaid receivable, notifications about options to repay on that, and then actually processing the collection work. That's an area where we think the rules are pretty clear.","We have a very strong internal compliance program to monitor our activities in this particular space and have built systems and controls that help us do a great job for our clients, while maintaining a strong compliance profile. We, obviously, would continue to work and have a close working relationship with the CFPB to make sure we understand those rules, talk about where there are areas for potential borrower confusion or impact, and make sure we're adjusting our activities accordingly so that it's a network in compliance and doing a better job for our clients.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. In terms of the litigation against the DOE, you provided some commentary earlier, but I just wanted to clarify, it sounds like the judge there has not opined on the merits of the case. As you mentioned, the decision to dismiss the lawsuit was more based on jurisdictional grounds, but where do you stand now in terms of that litigation?","Are you going to have a chance to discuss the merits of the case and try to get additional information from the DOE as far as specifically what things you violated or are you going to need a file a separate lawsuit? Can you just tell us where that stands in terms of the legal process?","Jack Remondi","The case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. The opinion has not been issued yet. Next steps would really take place once we've had a chance to read the opinion and understand better what the judge's ruling was based on and then explore what our other options are. But you're correct in that he did not rule on the merits of the case, just the jurisdiction.","Sameer Gokhale","Is there a sense for why so much of \u2013 at least what we've heard is that a lot of what the judge's decision was based on, that data has been redacted. Any specific reason for why that may have been redacted?","Jack Remondi","That's just the way that process works, but we need to wait and see what the opinion says here, I think is the next steps. Anything else we would just be speculating or inferring from what has been released so far.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Jack Remondi","You're welcome.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Mark DeVries from Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Thanks. First, I wanted to clarify the comments around loan portfolio acquisitions. Jack, I think you indicated it is a bit of a sellers' market here, pricing is aggressive. My question is, are you seeing that same level of competition around portfolios that really are in your sweet spot where there's no financing attached and no life of loan servicing, where presumably there just aren't competitors out there who can bring to bear the same advantages that you can?","Jack Remondi","The competition is equal, I think, in both whether their loans are servicing released or tied to third-party servicing. The difference is that in a loan portfolio with servicing release, we can actually bring significant advantages, cost advantages, to the equation that others who don't have a servicing platform, which is one of the places where the high prices are coming from, cannot. So that's a big differentiator.","The other piece of this is clearly size. The bigger the portfolio, the better, the more competitive we can be, simply because it limits how many people have the availability to come up with that kind of cash to purchase a whole loan portfolio. When selling residuals, even though the notional amount of the loans could be relatively high, the actual check that is required to be written can be relatively small.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Got it. Just a followup question on capital returns. I think in the past, when you were part of Sallie Mae had a policy of setting a repurchase authorization for the year through the Board and then kind of blowing through it relatively early and then going back and getting permission for more. I think, Jack, you've indicated that your preference going forward is to kind of set the amount at the beginning of the year and having that be what you buy back.","You did buy back a little bit more than the annualized pace of $1 billion. Should we still expect that's kind of the number for 2015 or might you go back late in the year and ask for authorization to buy back more stock?","Jack Remondi","No. We're trying to provide a more visible, predictable pace of activity here, so the $1 billion is what we expect to repurchase this year.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Joe Fisher","Thanks, Keith. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. If you have any other followup questions, please give me a call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Stephanie and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Navient Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Joe Fisher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning and welcome to Navient's 2015 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO, and Somsak Chivavibal, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations, and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the Company's Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, full reconciliation to GAAP measures, and our GAAP results can be found in the second quarter 2015 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted, along with the earnings press release, on the investors page at navient.com. Thank you.","And now I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter's earnings call. Thanks for listening and I appreciate your interest and support.","Even though the financial performance on many of our segments of our business was strong, a few areas were not. This quarter\u2019s results and our revised guidance for 2015 are clearly a disappointment in direction and impact.","Our results in the changing guidance were really driven by three main items. First, our original forecast assumed we\u2019d be able to purchase private education loans this year. Aggressive bidding from others and delayed timing by some sellers reduced the prospects here.","While we still expect to have the opportunity to bid on private loan portfolios later this year, if successful, they will likely occur too late to contribute to this year\u2019s earnings. Also included in our forecast was the ability to refinance some of our higher cost asset-backed securities issued during the recession. The opportunities to do so have not materialized thus far, though we will continue to pursue them.","Finally, we\u2019re seeing higher default rates than we projected in a narrow segment of our private loan portfolio. This segment of borrowers returned to school during the great recession and exited from their in-school deferment in 2014. The size of exits also increased to $2.5 billion in 2014, up from $1.8 billion in 2013. We expect deferment exits to decline to $1.7 billion in 2015.","These 2014 exits, which do not include borrowers who are entering repayment for the first time, are experiencing significantly higher levels of delinquency and default than prior cohorts. As a result, we increased our loss forecast for 2015 by approximately $100 million. We believe we have this issue well reserved for.","While the impact on our financial results for 2015 from these items is not insignificant, they\u2019re not reflective of the larger story here. First, our expected cash flows from our student loan portfolio remain a sizeable $33.2 billion. Year-to-date our student loan portfolio generated $1.6 billion in loan related cash flow and we added $500 million in expected future cash flows from a combination of student loan acquisitions net of financings, and increased forecast of lower-income.","This quarter also saw positive trends in several other areas. For example, we purchased $1 billion in student loans. We achieved a second place finish in the Department of Education loans servicing scorecard driven by our industry-leading default prevention success. We saw another year-over-year improvement in new college graduate credit trends and generated strong growth in fee income from our asset recovery businesses, and we returned over $360 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Earlier this quarter, we announced an organizational redesign and a corresponding restructuring. This effort is designed to align our business units to further improve organizational effectiveness and efficiency. We created two main business teams, an asset management and servicing group and an asset recovery and business services group. We also streamlined layers to improve speed of execution, efficiency, and enhance the lines of responsibility in these business areas.","While the primary objectives of these change -- changes which contributed to a restructuring charge of $29 million this quarter which will improve the effectiveness and align our team into the related business groups. These changes will also improve our operating efficiency going forward. For example, we expect to see a total run rate benefit in operating expense of approximately $25 million in 2016.","Growing our fee related business lines and improving our operating margins continues to be a major area of focus for us. For example, we\u2019ve been successfully growing our asset recovery revenue with a focus in areas beyond student loans. Earlier this year we acquired Gila, $70 million in revenue asset recovery and business service company to add to this effort.","The integration process has proceeded very smoothly and Gila\u2019s management team has quickly demonstrated their capabilities with the successful implementation of a large and very complicated services contract and overall performance better than expectations. We continue to look for opportunities to expand our asset recovery and business services skills into new areas.","In our loan servicing operations, we also continue to deliver superior results. We excel at helping our federal student loan customer successfully manage their student loans with overall default rates that are 48% lower than all other servicers combined.","Our efforts to help our customers understand the very complex array of repayment options available to them and select the option that helps them successfully manage their loans. While our efforts continue to produce lower delinquency in default rates, the economy is also helping borrowers as they leave school. Combined, these factors are driving significantly better loan performance.","Each spring we track the performance of recent graduates as they enter repayment for the first time. Looking at the performance of recent graduates six months into repayment, we see that the incidence of severe delinquency has fallen each and every year from a recession high of 22% for the class of 2010 to a low of 8% for the class of 2014, the most recent graduating class to enter repayment.","Our better than average delinquency default performance is the results of our data driven outreach efforts that help us reach borrowers and offer affordable solutions. This is why we advocate so strongly per customer contact. It works.","With the reauthorization of the federal student loan programs gearing up, we\u2019ve been strong advocates for program simplicity and for tools that help students and families make better decisions about paying for collage before they borrow.","Today in the federal loan programs there are 15 repayment options, eight loan forgiveness programs and some 35 forbearance and deferment options for federal borrowers to navigate. Not surprisingly our customers seek our help to understand the options they are eligible for and how to choose the plan that works best for them.","These federal efforts, however, are focused on helping borrowers manage payments only after the loan is made. Simplifying this complexity and helping borrowers make more inform decisions before they borrow should be top priorities.","Moody's and Fitch's ABS teams recently wrote about the impact of extended repayment options on federal student loan asset-backed securities. In their view this may impact whether or not a bond is paid in full by the bond before [ph] final maturity date. We actively monitor the performance of our student loan securitization trusts, including adherence to the final -- the legal final maturity date.","Since 2013, we have amended 17 trusts and exercised loan purchase rights of $428 million to address potential issues here. In order to amend the legal final maturity date, we encourage noteholders to reach out to us, so we can work with the agencies to modify the terms and successfully resolve this potential issue.","As the largest issuer of student loan backed securities, we take our leadership role seriously and we\u2019re working with the rating agencies, trustees, and investors to develop alternatives to minimize any impact to our ABS investors.","These efforts are consistent with our commitment to maintain a strong financial profile for our investors. Our capital and liquidity remain both strong and conservative, given our risk profile and our results for loan losses cover more than two times annualized charge-offs. Our capital return approach is fully consistent with these commitments.","At Navient, we\u2019ve made a significant and ongoing investments and customer success and compliance. We believe that our success is aligned with our customer success. Since the recession, we\u2019ve been engaged with several regulatory agencies and have responded to numerous data requests. While these inquiries are time and data intensive and therefore are costly, our focus is to remain responsive and collaborative.","We also make the effort to provide additional insight into the trends we see and the efforts we make to drive customer success. We are extremely proud of our track record in producing the highest success rates in the industry. We believe our experience and ability to use our deep data to continue to drive customer success are the foundation of our continued ability to add value.","Finally, while I'm deeply disappointed with the impact a few areas had on our financial goals, I'm confident in our ability to execute on our business plan and I'm committed and our team is committed to creating value for our customers, employees, bond investors, and shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Somsak for a more detailed view of the financial results.","Somsak Chivavibul","Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.","In the second quarter, we reported $0.40 per share and that's compared to $0.56 per share from a year-ago quarter. Our second quarter operating expenses totaled $225 million compared to operating expenses $195 million from a year-ago quarter. The increase in operating expenses is related to incremental costs resulting from the recent acquisition of Gila, incremental third-party servicing costs related to the $8.5 billion of loans acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014, higher servicing and asset recovery volumes and increased regulatory compliance costs.","We expect core EPS to be approximately $1.85 in 2015 and operating expenses of less than $900 million for 2015.","Now let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $93 million for the second quarter compared to $72 million in the second quarter of 2014. In the quarter, the FFELP student loan spread was 91 basis points and the associated NIM was 81 basis points.","The FFELP NIM maybe impacted by future loan acquisitions and future LIBOR rates, which will impact the amount of unhedged floor income in our portfolio. We do expect the FFELP net interest margin to range between 81 and 85 basis points for the second half of 2015.","Let's now turn to Slide 6 and our Private Education Loan segment. Core earnings in the segment decreased by $64 million from year-ago quarter to $22 million.","Our second quarter student loan spread came in at 3.66% and the associated NIM was 3.55%. Compared to the prior year, the net interest margin was primarily impacted by the interest rate reserve adjustments associated with the increase to our provision for the quarter and higher cost of funds. The increase in our provision for loan losses which came in at a $191 million for the quarter came as a result of the segment of borrowers that Jack mentioned previously. These borrowers exited deferment in 2014 and are experiencing unfavorable credit trends compared to those who exited in -- deferment in previous years.","For the second half of 2015, we do expect the private student loan net interest margin to range between 3.83% and 3.85%. And we expect the provision for private education loan losses to be between $575 million and $600 million for 2015.","As a result of the recent performance in our long-term recovery rate on defaulted loans, the Company changed its recovery rate assumption on charge-off loans to 21%. In recent years, we\u2019ve been charging off periodic shortfalls and expected recoveries against our allowance for private education loan losses and the related receivable for partially charged off loan. The $330 million adjustment eliminates the allowance for estimated recovery shortfalls and reflects the Company's confidence in its long-term recovery rate assumptions. ","Our second quarter charge-offs came in at 2.3 -- 2.7%, excuse me, or $30 million higher than the second quarter of last year. Total delinquency was at 6.8% and that's compared to 7.1% from a year-ago. And the forbearance rate was 3.7% compared to 4.2% from a year-ago.","Slide 7 shows our asset quality trends over the last five years. Our portfolio is well-seasoned with 93% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. And our highest risk portfolio, what we call nontraditional loans was down to only 8% of our portfolio. We expect annualized charge-off rates for the second half of 2015 to be between 2.2% and 2.4%.","Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $90 million in the quarter, compared with $130 million in the second quarter of 2014.","We saw an increase in our asset recovery revenue of $10 million versus the first quarter. This increase was primarily related to the full integration of Gila, which expands our footprint in the asset recovery and business process outsourcing space.","The decline from the year-ago was driven by the new reduced fee structure for guarantee agencies which became effective on July 1, 2014. We expect asset recovery revenues to be between $360 million and $370 million for the year.","The company services loans for more than 12 million borrowers with 6.1 million borrowers under the Department of Education servicing contract. Third-party loan servicing revenue increased to $47 million in the quarter with $35 million coming from the Department of Education servicing contract.","Let's turn to Slide 9 for highlights of our loan acquisition and financing activity. We acquired $1 billion of student loans in the second quarter. And while we removed future private loan acquisitions from our guidance, our best opportunity for loan purchases remain with whole loans that we can convert on to our servicing platform and take advantage -- in order to take advantage of our significant cost advantage in servicing and our ability to deliver superior performance in customer success.","In the quarter, we issued $1.8 billion of asset-backed securitizations. And as Jack mentioned, we are proactively working with rating agencies and investors to develop alternatives to minimize any impact to our ABS investors.","In the quarter, we repurchased $522 million of unsecured notes. In 2015, we\u2019ve reduced our unsecured debt outstanding by roughly $1.2 billion through repurchases and maturities. In the quarter, we repurchased 15.2 million shares with $300 million. We do have remaining authority of $400 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and as of the June 30, 2015 our tangible net asset to unsecured debt ratio was at 1.25 times.","Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10, we recorded second quarter GAAP net income of $182 million or $0.47 per share and that's compared to net income of $377 million or $0.71 per share in the second quarter of 2014.","And just as a reminder, the primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative position, expenses related to restructuring and reorganization, and the income associated with SLM BankCo.","With that, I\u2019ll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","David Hochstim","Hi. Good morning. I wonder could you just talk about any thoughts regarding potential sale of some loans -- private loans. If prices are too high to buy, would that suggest that it would make sense to sell some loans? And I had another question.","Jack Remondi","Sure. So we do look at this both -- as both the purchaser and a seller of loans. I think if we look at the market place overall, we would say that the prices that people are willing to pay for portfolios is aggressive, but it is not what I would call particularly deep. And so we\u2019ve looked at opportunities in that area, we\u2019ve sold some FFELP transactions as there is FFELP portfolios principally ones that were not serviced by us to reflect that and would continue to look at opportunities in both the federal and private space going forward.","David Hochstim","And the FFELP loans that you bought those -- how many different sellers were there?","Jack Remondi","It was a variety of portfolios from both guarantee agencies and banks.","David Hochstim","Okay. And then could you or Somsak just talk about the chart on Slide 7, that you update every quarter with the last performance of low risk, moderate risk, elevated risk loans and just talk about how the slug of the $2.5 billion kind of relates to these different segments?","Jack Remondi","So on the deferred exits, they really do cross all of the different components that are shown here, and so they\u2019re not unique to any of these risk segments that we broke out on this chart. This is what I think makes us a little bit unusual. What we saw in this portfolio compared to other years is obviously a worse default performance as the loans came out of the in-school deferment. When we look a little bit deeper at these loans, we saw that this year it's cohort had a higher percentage of borrowers who are having difficulty making payments before they had returned to school than prior portfolios, and in particular this portfolio had multiple occurrences within school deferments, meaning that these customers exited school, entered repayment, returned to school, exited school and get repayment and then went back again. And that's what a little bit unusual. It's normally our in-school deferments of students from the undergraduate side going back to get a graduate degree and here I think we\u2019re seeing a little bit more students who are working hard to get their undergraduate degree. And what the recession impact we just -- they did not perform. When we look at our overall delinquencies, particularly, our high-level delinquencies is over 90 days, we are at June 30, $1 low for the last year and a low that is a rate that\u2019s a $150 million less than what we were at year-end. So I think this issue is somewhat behind us. Our reserve policy which looks at a two-year window certainly covers future expectations at similar rates from exits going forward, but both that in the lower dollar amount. We think we\u2019ve got this issue under control at this point.","David Hochstim","Okay, thanks. Maybe one last quick question before I get in the queue again. In asset recovery, are there contracts that Gila, or the rest of the business is looking at that might be additive this year or is it more kind of a longer term -- I\u2019m sorry.","Jack Remondi","So this is a business that we\u2019ve seen good growth at and our focus has really been growing our business outside of the student loan arena, particularly with state and local governments, that\u2019s one of the big drivers of adding Gila to our portfolio. Those contracts, particularly, at the state and local level are more numerous, they are also smaller in size. So yes, we do see opportunities to win new business in that area this year and will contribute to this year's earnings results.","David Hochstim","Okay.","Jack Remondi","And going forward as well.","David Hochstim","Okay. Thank you.","Jack Remondi","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.","Sameer Gokhale","Great. Thank you. Jack, could you or Somsak just talk about the inventory of those higher risk receivables? Because you\u2019ve talked I think about the dollar amount of loans that are exiting repayment out of this higher risk category, but if you were to just look at this point in time at the dollar amount of those loans which fall into that higher risk category, could you size that for us?","Somsak Chivavibul","You're talking about the nontraditional loans?","Sameer Gokhale","No, because as I understand it, these loans that have contributed to the increase in the charge-offs weren\u2019t necessarily nontraditional loans, they were just higher risk spread across the bucket. And I think you\u2019ve talked about the $2 billion plus in 2014 that entered repayment and then those are $1.8 billion in 2015 and $1.7 billion in 2015 and I was just trying to get a sense for the total inventory of these higher risk loans in total, if you could size that?","Somsak Chivavibul","Sameer, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call them high risk loans. These are just basically loans that are in what we\u2019ve left to go through or the remaining loans in deferment as Jack mentioned. We\u2019ve got $1.7 billion of loans that are scheduled to exit deferment. I think to what Jack is talking about, a good chunk of those loans will now be what I will call traditional deferment exits, more of the traditional borrower that got an undergraduate degree and then got a graduate degree afterwards.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. I mean, because I'm just trying to get a sense for, there were some percentage of your loan portfolio that I think when you initially kind of made the announcement, you said there were some higher risk and I think as Jack characterized it there was -- there would be students who kind of dropped out or went back to school again and then they just had trouble making repayment. So I was just trying to see if you can isolate that piece of the portfolio just so we get a sense for that slug of it relative to the rest of your portfolio, which is performing well. So is there any way for us to size it and that\u2019s what I was really getting at.","Jack Remondi","I thing you need to look at the inventory of what entering or exiting deferment is really what -- I would focus on Sameer. It\u2019s the $2.5 billion that exited in \u201914, $1.7 billion that will exit in 2015 and we expect that number and obviously new borrowers can go to school, but the projections would be for 2016 exists to be under a $1 billion. So it\u2019s moving in the right direction, our portfolio is becoming more seasoned as Somsak provided in his statistics, and the performance becomes more predictable as borrowers are seasoned. This segment of borrowers who moved in and out of school several times during the recession and finally have exited more permanently now, saw loss rate that were 45% higher than what we saw in 2013s cohort. We don\u2019t -- we certainly are reserved for that at this stage in the game, but we don\u2019t expect that kind of performance going forward.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. And then on another note, I was just curious if you could share your thoughts given widening debt spreads, if you could just talk about how you think about share repurchases and capital return to shareholders versus just retiring debt. I know you did some this quarter again versus issuing new debt and kind of refining out maturing debt. How do you think about that at this point in time?","Somsak Chivavibul","So the -- our share return policy and the practices that we follow here are driven by the fact that we generate a significant amount of capital each year from the earnings of our loan portfolio. And so the dollar amounts that we returned this year are really a reflection of those kind of strong and consistent cash flows. As principal comes down and its collective on the loan, the debt is repaid and it\u2019s the spread in the earnings that we generate that goes back to shareholders is that profit margin and in fact, we don\u2019t expect that to change in terms of our philosophy at this point and we will continue to be active in both share repurchases and dividends consistent with the earnings and the excess capital we generate each year.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. And then just a last question on your servicing revenue. It seemed to have jumped a bit to $106 million from I think $77 million or so last quarter, if I\u2019m looking at the numbers correctly and I was just wondering what -- this was not the asset recovery revenue, I was just wondering why that might have increased so much sequentially?","Somsak Chivavibul","Sure. Basically during the quarter, Sameer, we made an adjustment relative to servicing revenue to expect -- to reflect the day one recovery expectation for late fees that are assessed against our portfolio. Basically that is a true-up calculation as previously would have been recognized, the income or late fee income on -- more or less on a cash basis.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. So you just changed your estimate for your expected recoveries of those late fees, that\u2019s essentially what happened?","Somsak Chivavibul","That\u2019s correct.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Good morning. Just have a question on the NIM guidance and your comfort level going forward on the FFELP NIM guidance. Maybe you could just talk about your cost of fund assumption and what the options might be to do better or worse than those assumptions? And then maybe if you could just speak to the specific impacts that you might be seeing right now from the Moody's downgrades, that will be helpful as well. Thank you.","Jack Remondi","Sure. Sanjay, the -- our spread or NIM guidance for the rest of the year is between 81 and 85 basis points. I think given that vast majority of our portfolio is now funded to term, I think that cost of funds element for the rest of the year is pretty much locked in. I think the variable going for the rest of the year is going to end up being where LIBOR rates end up, which will have an impact on ultimately what our unhedged floor income might be and that will be a variable to the spread for the rest of the year.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And the Moody\u2019s, is there a specific impact that you\u2019re seeing?","Somsak Chivavibul","Well, not for the rest of the year. It would only impact any financing activity that we would go -- that would occur going forward. But at this point any of that impact really wouldn\u2019t have much impact on the spread for the rest of 2015, because those transactions would come in late in the year, and I think it would be a little premature to see what the ultimate impact on the future of funding cost will be until they take action, we see what the results are.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay.","Jack Remondi","I\u2019d just add to that, the loans are -- this issue is a timing of payments, not a timing of earnings, capabilities or generation from the portfolio. They are interest accruing loans, they\u2019re generating the margins that we expected them to and it\u2019s actually by extending the term you\u2019re actually increasing the amount of cash flows that you\u2019ll earn from the trust or collect from the trust over the life of the loan. We have tools available to us to kind of manage this process. We do need some, we can work with the investors on this front and I think combined given our size of our issuance in this area and our leadership role and working with investors, rating agencies and the trustees we\u2019re -- we hope that this will -- we\u2019ll be able to come up with some resolutions that will cause no disruption in this marketplace.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. I mean, is it fair to assume that this could be additive for you guys, if you\u2019re buying back these trusts or the pieces of this trust?","Jack Remondi","Not necessarily. It\u2019s just -- you\u2019re just -- all you\u2019re doing is when we buy loans back from the trust you\u2019re recycling them into new asset back securities.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. Got it. And, I guess, I have a question on the segment that you saw a little bit with losses, and I mean are there any other segments like this one in other categories that might -- where there might be higher risks in the future of higher defaults or anything. I mean is there something -- is there anything else that we should be concerned about going forward?","Jack Remondi","So, I think the things that I would -- we pay a whole lot of attention to is the portion of the portfolio that has been making payments for extended periods of time. And once a borrower is in that, that mode the incidence of delinquency and default declines progressively each and every year as the number of payments grow. The majority of our portfolio is now in that mode, and so we had this small segment move in and out of repayment a couple of times. Primarily I would say due to the great recession and as long as the economy kind of stays where it is we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a disruption and in fact we believe our portfolio of performance becomes more predictable as customers mature and season through cycles here.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, great. One final question and I want to follow-up to what Sameer was asking on the share buyback. You guys have talked about kind of at the levels of capital you operate and the fact that you\u2019re operating at higher levels of capital than what you might going forward. I mean, is there any appetite to maybe use some of that excess capital to buyback additional shares given where the stock is?","Jack Remondi","So, I think our capital position has been consistent over this timeframe in terms of both how much we expect to generate, how much we expect to return to shareholders. Generally we like to have -- we don\u2019t want to run right down to the edge of where we set our standards. It gives us flexibility in terms of opportunities to buy loan portfolios. Look at opportunities in the asset recovery business for example, and our preference right now is this is going to stay with that framework.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. Thank you.","Jack Remondi","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Beardsley with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Eric Beardsley","Hi. Thank you. Just a question on the targeted OpEx savings of $25 million, I guess, on an annual basis here you have revenue declining and you have, you just have $25 million to OpEx savings. Just wondering how much incremental ability do you have to take cost out as the portfolio amortizes, and is there any incremental step up in expenses as you have some more of these loans entering repayment?","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes. Well, Eric one of the things that you got to remember also is that within our guidance for -- of $900 million for 2015. There are also one time expenses that we\u2019re incurring into \u201815 related to -- of about $25 million related to the $8.5 billion of loans that we are converting on to our portfolio that we expect to complete later this year. So, in terms of moving from the $900 million to 2015 -- going to 2016, not only do you have the removal of that $25 million, you\u2019ve got another $25 million that\u2019s going to come out of the expense base next year because of our structuring initiative.","Jack Remondi","Yes, I\u2019d just add to that Eric that the $25 million I referenced in my opening remarks was not a forecast for what our OpEx would be in 2016. It was what we would expect to save as a result of this organizational initiative only.","Eric Beardsley","Got it. So, combined you have $50 million that you would expect to get out. On top of that I\u2019m curious, I guess how much more could you hypothetically take out over time? How much operating leverage could you take down further?","Jack Remondi","So these are -- we\u2019re not getting into a forecast of 2016 OpEx, we\u2019ve posted two items that doesn\u2019t -- I want to be clear that, that\u2019s not necessarily comprehensive and we don\u2019t want to -- I don\u2019t want to down the laundry list here at this stage in the year. But when we look at our operating expense items here, they\u2019re driven -- a good portion of them are driven by the variable nature of our revenue. So, as loans mature, and they actually become less costly -- if they can't become less costly to serve as if they\u2019re making payments on a regular schedule or timeframe, our big drivers of servicing expense are the number of units we\u2019re adding as we increase the number of accounts we\u2019re servicing for the Department of Education. So, if you look at our business on the loan servicing side as an example, our account load has actually increased over the last three years even though our loan portfolio is amortizing down, because we\u2019re adding new business and revenues associated with that. In the asset recovery side of the equation, we have a similar activity of our sales related workloads are decreasing, but our other workloads particularly outside of the education lending space have been increasing. So, to some extent operating expense as a function of the revenue drivers that we have going and my preference is of course to see revenues increasing.","Eric Beardsley","Got it. And just, on the buyback, I think you had initially said that it would be an annual buyback. Is there any potential to re-up it this year and accelerate the user driven?","Jack Remondi","So this -- we look at this on a regular basis. We have both internally and with the board and we work with them on a combined basis to decide what\u2019s the appropriate level. I don\u2019t have much more to add to that at this point.","Eric Beardsley","Okay. And then just, not to beat a dead horse, but just on the cohort of the 2014 loans, the exit deferment, I guess what made them different from 2012 and 2013? Were there any characteristics that were particularly different that let you to higher default rate?","Jack Remondi","I think the two biggest things are the ones I mentioned which is that, we had a higher percentage of these borrowers who had demonstrated difficulty in making payments when they were in repayment prior to returning to school and than in prior cohorts. So that gives you an example of an indication that they were struggling to begin with. And the second piece is, the statistic that said more of these customers had moved in and out of school multiple times, not just two but more than two times. Those were the primary differences.","Eric Beardsley","Okay, great. And then just lastly, you had recently filed an appeal on the collections business loss with Department of Education. Is there any timelines of when you expect to hear back on that?","Jack Remondi","Unfortunately the cohorts work at their pace, so no indication at this stage of the game.","Eric Beardsley","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open.","Mark DeVries","Yes, thanks. I just want to discuss the issue of reserves against this problem cohort. I think Jack you indicated you believe it\u2019s mostly covered. Is it fair to assume that when you identify the problems in this cohort with default rates and these characteristics you just mentioned. Given your kind of, usually your two year forward look on reserves that you would then look at what's coming out of firm within next couple of years, figure out which ones kind of share those characteristics and then have reserved for those already?","Jack Remondi","Yes. ","Mark DeVries","Okay. And I assume given the characteristics you mentioned that, these people kind of went in and out perhaps around the recession that its going -- I think you mentioned, you expect only about $1 billion coming out of deferment in 2016, that that cohort is basically going away over the next year or two?","Jack Remondi","Correct. And look, people return to school for multiple reasons. We have the normal trend we would see in our private loan portfolio is undergrads, which is the primary customer for which private loans are made, returning to school to get a graduate degree. Those are generally positive trends. You are getting an advanced degree and all of the history and data suggest that these customers coming out of graduate school have higher incomes, more stable jobs. In fact in our private loan book the best performing segment across the board is loans made to graduate school students. What we saw here is a second group of return to school which has borrowers who -- this isn\u2019t true for the entire $2.5 billion of course, but borrowers who did not obtain their undergraduate degree went back, have took more classes, reentered repayment, went back again. And so these customers take long -- took longer to either obtain an undergraduate degree or maybe did not obtain it at all. And the incidence of delinquency and default on borrowers who take more time to get an undergraduate degree is certainly higher and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in this particular cohort. Generally speaking, every year it takes someone to graduate, increases their debt load by about 10%. So if you\u2019re going from four years to six years you have not only, has it taken you longer to get to the point of where you\u2019re going to generate higher income, but you\u2019ve got more -- you have a higher debt burden as well. I would describe this pool and the losses coming more from customers who didn\u2019t complete their degree.","Mark DeVries","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And just finally, I know you don\u2019t provide 2016 guidance. But as you think out to 2016, how much risk is there from additional NIM pressure if your unsecured funding cost don\u2019t recover, is there kind of a need to refinance some more maturities as you look out next year?","Somsak Chivavibul","Well certainly that will impact the spread going forward, but I think one of the things that we\u2019re going to need to look into is, alternative resources of financing outside of unsecured debt.","Mark DeVries","And then, Somsak I think you alluded to the issue of -- the potential impact of the un-hedged floor income. If the forward curve is realized over the next year or two, should we expect some pressure on FFELP NIM from that?","Somsak Chivavibul","Certainly there will be pressure on that, just given the fact that our older loans that earn floor income will amortize away quicker than our newer FFELP loans that will amortize slower. So, that value won't actually decline over time.","Jack Remondi","So all of that is baked into the projected cash flows that we disclose in our -- in the tax release here.","Somsak Chivavibul","That\u2019s correct. And the other thing I will add is that, we have hedged in or locked in value of about $900 million of future floor income and that\u2019s locked in through, about 2019.","Mark DeVries","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hammond with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Mark Hammond","Thanks for taking my question. Following-up on what you mentioned about the possible alternative sources of financing outside of unsecured. Would you elaborate on that for me?","Somsak Chivavibul","Sure. So one of the things that we\u2019ve got is basically a balance of about $11 billion of collateralization built in with our securitization trust and one of the things that we would look to do is figure out ways to either refinance those deals going forward or using ways to better deliver the balance that are built in within those securitization trusts.","Mark Hammond","Okay. So could I be intervening that as shifting from unsecured to more securitized debt?","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes.","Mark Hammond","Okay, great. And then my last question would be, on the unsecured bond repurchase strategy. I was wondering how you determine which bonds to target. I know you have some short dated high coupon bonds and then some longer dated bonds below par as well.","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes, the vast majority of the bonds that we bought so far this year is really been targeted at the January 2016 maturity that will come in due. So, we had excess liquidity that were sitting on our balance sheet and so we\u2019ve decided to better or manage our NIM by basically buying those maturities out because they were going to be due within the next 12 months anyways.","Mark Hammond","Thanks, Somsak. That\u2019s all.","Somsak Chivavibul","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. I guess, I wish -- wanted to follow-up on the share repurchase and ask how the assumption of no private student loan purchases which I thought there was like a $1 billion annually kind of purchases in the original forecast which I would assume if you assumed a premium and capital against that, wouldn\u2019t that have a couple of $100 million a year of extra kind of capital?","Jack Remondi","So, Moshe, this is Jack. We did take out assumptions of any private loan portfolio or purchase from our 2015 guidance, although as I said we certainly expect portfolios to come to market from some sellers later this year. We just expect \u2026","Moshe Orenbuch","Sell for private though, Jack.","Jack Remondi","Private and sell both actually, but private in particular I was referring to, but they will come too late in the year to have any meaningful impact on 2015 earnings. Clearly we think we are the best buyer for student loan assets in terms of both federal and private given our low cost of -- particularly, to move them on to our servicing platforms given our low cost of servicing and the higher performance that we can generate out of a portfolio or student loan. So sometimes the loan portfolios that are offered don\u2019t have -- aren\u2019t servicing released, we\u2019re going to be less competitive on those deals, sometimes the residuals in which case you\u2019re basically just buying cash flows with no ability to kind of influence the performance. And in some instances on some smaller portfolios when, particularly on the deal that was -- the private loan deal that was sold earlier this year was a residual tranche. It brings in -- because there is no financing requirements and because the servicing is structured as part of the agreement it brings in buyers who are not traditional buyers and they\u2019re willing to pay higher prices than we would pay. The transactions we expect later this year are likely to be whole loans that we would be able to control servicing and therefore we think we have better chances of success.","Moshe Orenbuch","All right. Certainly, good luck. But I would just observe that if a whole year does go by that couple of $100 million would certainly be excess at point. It just doesn\u2019t \u2026","Jack Remondi","Then you\u2019re correct. Yes.","Moshe Orenbuch","As a follow-up on the Moody\u2019s, my understanding is that your plan would be to buy -- to the extent you\u2019ve bought a few $100 million of assets and continue. That doesn\u2019t absorb equity capital, that\u2019s just absorbing kind of liquidity and bank lines of the like, right?","Jack Remondi","Right.","Somsak Chivavibul","Correct.","Moshe Orenbuch","Okay, good. And just, you kind of answered a question before. I mean, I know it\u2019s far from your preferred situation, but to the extent that this does go against the industry from Moody\u2019s and these bonds are downgraded, it would actually present opportunities just like they were for you after the crisis to buy those tranches in at a discount, would it not?","Jack Remondi","I think it will create opportunities for us to buy student loans more than perhaps on some of these tranches, but the things we\u2019re looking for here, are marking sure that the bonds don\u2019t suffer downgrades due to timing issues and we\u2019re working with investors and the rating agencies to make sure that happens. I think we\u2019re better served by having an orderly liquid ABS marketplace.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Tarkan with Compass Point. Your line is open.","Michael Tarkan","Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But just getting back to the rating agencies, you mentioned you have amended 17 trusts since 2013. Can you just give us a sense for how many could be affected by the new actions and maybe what the dollar amount of exposure is there, any color there?","Somsak Chivavibul","Moody\u2019s in their press release said that, that would cover about 50 of our securitization trusts. But keep in mind the vast majority of that had maturity dates beyond five years Mike and actually there\u2019s one in particular I think that has a legal final maturity date of 2043.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. And is there any sense for size or dollar amount of exposure there in the 50?","Somsak Chivavibul","Well, its hard to try to figure out what the exposure there is, I mean there was about $35 billion associated with that 50 trusts, but again I think we need to do work with the rating agencies to give them a little better color on what the actual performance of those trusts are and how we\u2019ve been working to mitigate the issue.","Jack Remondi","We don\u2019t know what that criteria is yet, that\u2019s part of what they are taking time to look at. We obviously have our own cash flow projections. And as I said in my comments we\u2019ve been active in this area since 2013 well before this issue has been raised by the agencies on this topic. So we\u2019ll need to see, we certainly don\u2019t believe that all $50 billion worth of trust have issues here not even close to it -- sorry, 50 trusts and we\u2019ll work with the rating agencies and the investors to make sure that we can restructure the deals or exercise options that are available to us to make sure we don\u2019t have issues here.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. Thanks. And then on the asset recovery side, I think before this quarter you were kind of projecting a $90 million run rate quarterly, you did $99 million this quarter. Can you just talk about where that strength came from, whether it was Gila, ED or guarantee agency collections and sort of how we should think about those three buckets in the back half of the year given that it looks like revenue will drift all of it back down?","Jack Remondi","It was really, it did come from across the board but we had particular strength in the rehabilitating federal student loans for both guarantors and the Department of Education. I think the big variable for us is, what happens with the new contract from the Department of Education on that side of the equation which has still not been -- this is separate from the question that I answered earlier on the appeal. This is, the department has indicated that it is going to sign new contracts with collection agencies. We\u2019ve been expecting an answer on that really since the spring and they keep indicating that it\u2019s coming, but we don\u2019t know the exact date yet.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. And then last one for me, I saw a release from Marlette last week indicating you guys are involved in their most capital raise; I know it\u2019s relatively small. But can just give us a sense for sort of how you\u2019re thinking about marketplace lending and sort of any details around that agreement whether its some sort of forward agreement, any kind of context there would be helpful.","Jack Remondi","So we actually, kind of what's going on in this space is exactly what we have done for 40 years, which is originate loans to consumers outside of a banking arrangement through online processes. So, to some extent I would say we were the original marketplace lender. And we view this as an interesting opportunity to learn a little bit more about the space and find ways to participate in it through a variety of opportunities through, both loan ownership, servicing capabilities et cetera.","Michael Tarkan","Do you service loans for Marlette and would this be strictly focused on the personal loan side or is there a potential for this to get into some student loan refinance?","Jack Remondi","This was just strictly in equity investment. There\u2019s no other contractual arrangement\u2019s here.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. And then -- but just to be clear, this is focused on personal loan side as opposed to, like Marlette is just doing personal loans at this point and there\u2019s no sort of \u2026","Jack Remondi","I think there are opportunities across the board. I think its both personal and student.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alan Straus with Schroder. Your line is open.","Alan Straus","Yes. A few questions, first the Congress of Senate almost passed a bill for tax collections for delinquent income tax. Is that something you might be bidding on and if something goes forward there in a year?","Jack Remondi","So we have to see what that legislation impact -- first of all whether it passes or not and what the implementation and schedule looks like there, but its something we\u2019ve been following.","Alan Straus","Okay. And just beating the dead horse of share repurchase, historically when you were together with Sallie, you guys are pretty aggressive in times of stress, taking advantage of a low stock price. Is there any reason to believe why we wouldn\u2019t do it this time?","Jack Remondi","I think you may not -- I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any change\u2019s in direction and practices here from the past.","Alan Straus","Okay. So, the board, you guys used up authorizations historically pretty quick in these times and the board hasn\u2019t changed that much. I would assume you guys would be re-looking this -- re-looking at the authorization probably by the end of the third quarter?","Jack Remondi","I think that\u2019s -- we\u2019re not -- it\u2019s a process that we go through. We reset the authority at the beginning of the year, it wasn\u2019t -- which is based on an expectation of what kind of capital we would generate in excess of our needs for the year. I would go back to more what are the consumers of other forms of capital, loan portfolio purchases et cetera, as being the main variable in that discussion.","Alan Straus","Okay. Thanks.","Jack Remondi","You are welcome.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Louise Pitt with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Louise Pitt","Yes. Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for the call. Just want to follow-up on the comments about moving to additional secured funding from unsecured. You have a decent amount of unsecured maturities coming out. How many of those do you think you\u2019ll be able to move to the secured portion of your funding? And then the second follow on question is, have you had discussions with the rating agencies about what impact that might have to your secondary ratings?","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes, I think it just depends on what the availability is at this point. One of the things that we\u2019ll open up is that, within our private credit deals that once, we have certain trust that were issued post credit crisis which are paying down on a turbo basis, and at some point we\u2019ll be able to exercise on our 10% call option so that we can buy all the assets out of those deals and take -- refinance those deals, take a good chunk of those proceeds and use those to pay down on secured debt over time.","Louise Pitt","So what is the strategy in the short-term for refinancing the unsecured maturities in the upcoming quarters?","Somsak Chivavibul","Well, we\u2019d be absolutely using our available cash to buyback debt early on as much as possible and to the extent we have ability to raise cash through other sources and we have some things like loan sales previously to be able to raise additional cash. So to the extent it\u2019s economical and makes sense those are the vehicles we would look to.","Louise Pitt","So that\u2019s sounding like you\u2019re not expecting to tap the unsecured markets anytime soon?","Somsak Chivavibul","We will need to tap the unsecured markets from time to time, but one of the things that you\u2019ll -- I think Jack mentioned earlier is that, the unsecured debt is going to be, will be a mix -- an important funding mix going forward. But one of the things we want to do is rely less and less on that mix over time. And again, as our balance sheet amortizes down, we expect the unsecured debt to amortize down along with that.","Louise Pitt","And has the rating agencies commented on the additional plan? The plan for additional secured funding, or else do you think that\u2019s factored into current rating?","Somsak Chivavibul","I think that\u2019s factored into the current ratings, I mean, we have discussions and annual reviews of our projections with them and ongoing dialogue with them constantly.","Louise Pitt","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Stephanie.

Please go ahead, sir.","Joe Fisher ","Thank you, Laurel. Good morning and welcome to Navient 2014 fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi; our CEO and Somsak Chivavibul, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements.","Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the company's Form 10 and other filings with the SEC. During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures, we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the four quarter 2014 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted along with earnings press release on the Investors page at www.navient.com.","Thank you and now I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi ","Thanks, Joe. Good morning and thank you for listening in today. I appreciate your interest and your support. 2014 was a busy and productive year. We started the year as one company with a very long list of tasks to complete, and we finished the year as Navient having successfully completed the legal and operational separation from Sallie Mae. While the separation project consumed most of the resources here, we retained our focus on our business delivering outstanding performance and generating strong financial results. ","Highlights for the year include, of course, our completion of the separation from Sallie Mae, the acquisition of $13 billion in student loans, and we reduced private credit charge-offs by 18% to $717 million for the year. Our servicing skills enabled our federal loan customers to significantly outperform the national average with the cohort default rate 48% lower than all other services. We distributed $849 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we generated $2.10 of core earnings per share. ","I am very pleased with our performance in 2014 and the resulting gains for our shareholders. The separation not only proved to be a catalyst to unlock the value of our business, but is also unlocking Navient's potential to grow in businesses beyond education finance. While I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2014, I want to focus my comments on here and now our plans for 2015.","Our goals for 2015 can be summed by one word, growth. We see growth opportunities in each of our operating areas. In asset management, we continue to see opportunities to purchase both federal and private loan portfolios, and while we are unlikely to repeat the volume acquired in 2014, we believe there will be substantial opportunities in 2015 as the environmental factors remain unchanged. Our competitive advantages also remain intact, but we did see what we believed to be irrational pricing on some portfolios in late 2014. ","We also see continued opportunities to increase the expected cash flows from our federal and private loan portfolios as credit continues to improve, and we benefit from lower financing costs and low interest rates. During 2014, we increased the undiscounted expected cash flows from our loan portfolios by $3.6 billion, including $3 billion from portfolio acquisitions. In our business services segment, while total revenues declined as a result of rehabilitation fee cuts from last year and the wind down of the transition services we provided to Sallie Mae Bank in 2014, we expect to see growth in our loan servicing business from both the department of education and third party service contracts. We also see opportunities to grow our municipal asset recovery business and believe will have the opportunity to bid on meaningful government collection contracts. ","Our success in opportunities in this area are driven by our strong performance. Our goal is to deliver industry leading results and to enable customer success, while doing so in a cost effective and compliant fashion. We believe our industry leading performance, cost efficiency, and control structure are significant competitive advantages. The improving economy and growth and employment for young workers are helping student loan performance. We also see borrowers making better decisions, allowing them to successfully manage their student loan payments. ","The fact is that nationally, delinquencies and defaults are declining. And Navient is leading the way with more customers enrolled in affordable repayment programs in dramatically lower default rates compared to the national average. With the separation complete, we\u2019ll return our focus to improving our operational efficiency. We've a long track record of annual efficiency gains, and we are confident we can continue to produce further improvement. We are also keeping our commitments to return the value we create to investors.","In December, we announced the new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion in our common stock. This authority is based on a very strong capital foundation, and the very sizable and predictable cash flows generated by our student loan portfolio. Given the seasoned nature of our portfolio, our significant reserves and conservative funding approach, we allocate 50 basis point of capital to our FFELP portfolio and 8% to our private loan portfolio. The result is an exceptionally strong capital base, well in excess of our capital allocations. It supports out outstanding debt, our capital return plans, and the investment required to support our growth objectives. ","To borrow a phrase, our predictable cash flow, high percentage of duration match debt, and strong capital base truly creates a fortress balance sheet. While our outlook for growth is positive, I'd like to remind folks that 2015 will need to overcome some significant headwinds. For example, the rehabilitation fee cuts and the amortization of our FFELP portfolio will reduce net income from these businesses by an estimated $75 million in 2015. In addition, we continue to feel the number of information requests and exams from federal and state regulators and expect the level of activity in 2015 to remain similar to last year. ","Though these requests are time consuming and expensive, we are committed to being a responsive partner. We are confident in our ability generate core earnings per share of $2.20 in 2015, and to generate ongoing EPS growth in the years beyond. I see a company and the team of significant strengths and with the cash flows, performance, efficiency, and controls to grow and succeed, creating value for our customers, employees, and shareholders.","Somsak will now provide more details of our financial results for the quarter and the full year. Thank you. ","Somsak Chivavibul","Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation which is available on our website beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. Excluding expenses associated with regulatory matters, we earned $2.10 per share for the full year and $0.54 per share for the fourth quarter. And as Jack mentioned, we expect our core EPS to be $2.20 for 2015. Our fourth quarter operating expenses totaled $206 million and $804 million for the year. These expenses included a $4 million incremental cost, related to the $9.5 billion of loans acquired during the quarter. We do expect to transfer majority of these loans to our servicing platform by the third quarter of 2015. As a result, we expect to incur one time conversion expenses of approximately $25 million and ongoing incremental servicing expenses of approximately $20 million in 2015.","Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP results. Core earnings were $82 million for the fourth quarter compared with $81 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. The FFELP student loans spread was 100 basis points in the quarter as these assets continue to generate high quality predictable returns and cash flows. For 2015, we expect our student loans spread for FFELP to be in the mid-90s. ","We acquired $9.5 billion of FFELP loans during the quarter bringing our year-to-date FFELP loan acquisition to $11.3 billion.","Let's now turn to Slide 6 in our private education loan segment. Core earnings in this segment increased $6 million from the year ago quarter to $92 million. Profitability continues to improve as price remains consistent and losses continue to decline. Our fourth quarter student loan spread came in at 3.99%.","And for 2015, we expect our student loan spread for private portfolio to be approximately 4%. ","Charge-offs for the fourth quarter were at 2.5% which is a significant reduction from the year ago quarter.","We continue to see year-over-year improvement in both our total and 90 plus day delinquency rate. The improvement in our outlook for future charge-offs led to a decrease in our provision for loan losses which came in at $128 million for the quarter. And that's a decrease of $24 million from the year ago quarter.","Slide 7 shows our asset quality trends over time and how our portfolios are dominated by high-quality loans.","Our highest risk segment what we call non traditional loans is now down to only 8% of our portfolio. And as you can see on the chart on right, losses have steadily declined across all our loan segments in the past four years. This portfolio is well seasoned with 91% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments.","Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $98 million for the quarter compared with $187 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. We saw decrease in our asset recovery revenue of $28 million versus the year ago quarter. The decline was driven by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which reduced the revenue earned from helping previously defaulted federal loan borrowers rehabilitate their loans. The new reduced fee structure became effective on July 1, 2014. We do expect our asset recovery revenues to be between $75 million and $80 million per quarter during 2015.","The company now services 12 million borrowers with 6.2 million borrowers under the Department of Education servicing contract. Servicing revenue from this contract was $34 million for the quarter compared with $31 million in the prior year.","Let's turn to Slide 9 and review the increases we've seen in our projected cash flows from our education loan portfolio. This portfolio is expected to generate significant and predictable cash flows of $36 billion over the next 20 plus years. In 2014, we received actual cash collection of $2.7 billion, but yet added $3.6 billion of future cash flows through acquisitions, refinancing, improvement in credit quality and additional floor income.","During the quarter, we added more certainty to our cash flows by hedging $14 billion of loans and locking in our $660 million of future floor income. To date, we have locked in or hedged $1 billion of the $1.9 billion of projected future fore income. Do expect to enhance these cash flows in meaningful ways as we take advantage of the market price overall. ","We are going to move Slide 10 and highlight our loan acquisition and financing activity for the year. We acquired $13 billion of loans for 2014 and closed on the $10 billion ABCP facility that helps finance these acquisitions. We do believe that student loan purchase opportunities will continue going forward. On the financing front, our ABS transactions continue to attract strong investor demand. For the year, we issued $6.8 billion of ABS. Just last week, we priced $689 million private ABS transactions which came in tighter spreads than our previous private ABS deal.","During the quarter, we repurchased 8.7 million shares for $168 million. And for the full year we repurchased 30.4 million shares for $600 million. And during the fourth quarter, the Board authorized $1 billion share repurchase program. Although this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position.","On Slide 11, you will see that since 2006, we have increased our tangible equity ratio as well as our net asset ratio, while at the same time reducing our unsecured debt outstanding from nearly $50 billion to $17.5 billion today. We feel that our debt and maturities are well matched to our expected cash flows and coverage ratios are conservative. ","At yearend 2014, our tangible equity ratio was 2.6% compared to 2.3% in 2013. With the well seasoned portfolio and conservative funding strategy, we believe that the appropriate capital level for our private credit portfolio is 8%. In the past, when we were an originator of private loans, we had provided an additional 12% of capital against these assets. ","And finally turning to GAAP results n Slide 12. We record fourth quarter GAAP net income of $263 million or $0.64 per share. That's compared to net income of $270 million or $0.60 per share for the year ago quarter. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with the SLM BankCo prior to the spin.","Just to reiterate, our core EPS guidance of $2.20 for 2015 includes; FFELP student loan spread in the mid-90s, private student loan spread of approximately 4%, and one time conversion expenses of $25 million and ongoing incremental servicing expenses of $20 million in 2015. And asset recovery revenues between $75 million and $80 million per quarter.","With that, I'd like to now open the call for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets.","Your line is open. ","Sameer Gokhale","Hi, so I just had a couple of quick questions. Just on your asset recovery revenue, it was a bit higher sequentially, and I know you kind of explained the year-over-year declines but sequential increase; it was a bit greater than I had modeled in and I was just curious what might have driven that, that sequential increase in asset recovery revenue? ","Jack Remondi ","So that was -- it was really driven by the fact that with ahead of the fee cut and that was effective July 1. That activity was pulled from that quarter into the second quarter, and what you see in the fourth quarter is a more normalized run rate. ","Sameer Gokhale","Okay, that's helpful. And then as far as the $9 million or so in regulatory, I think you had some expenses related to that, can you just talk briefly about what that related to specifically?","Jack Remondi ","Yes. It's professional fees associated with implementing the consent orders, and some of the exams that we are going through right now. That workflow proved to be a little bit more time consuming principally on the consent orders than anything else.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. And then in terms of your floor income and locking in floor income through hedges, I think it gets cheaper for you to actually lock those in through those forward contracts as rates rise. So what's your thinking around locking in additional floor income? How much would rates need to increase before you maybe have an increased appetite for locking in that floor income? ","Somsak Chivavibul","Hey, Sameer. What we try to do is just go through, and there is no exact science in that but -- what we try to do is looking into the rate environment beyond more than just intermediate period, and the hedge that we entered into, really locked into floor income that went from 2017 and 2019, so what we are trying to do is just lock-in, yes, what I call a longer-term value of floors up to 2019 more than anything else. ","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. And then just my last question on the share buyback authorization, for $1 billion, I mean how should we think about that? Would you plan to spend all of that this year? Is that contingent on how much you might acquire in terms of FFELP or private student loans or how do you think about that or should we assume some of it will bleed into 2016?","Jack Remondi ","So the authorization, it takes into consideration our assumptions for loan acquisitions, our capital generation, the investment that will make into supporting our growth objectives. We do expect the majority, if not all of that, to be used in 2015. However, it is a function of the environment. If we see opportunities to buy portfolios greater than our projections, that could alter some of that particularly if they are private credit loans less so on the FFELP side. So that's our plan at the moment. ","Sameer Gokhale","And what are some of your assumptions as far as acquisitions and portfolios for this year? ","Jack Remondi ","So we are not -- some of that needs to be data that we don't really want to -- don't want to talk about in terms of the pure details here, but it is based on what we see in terms of opportunities that are in the pipeline today as well as opportunities that we think have a strong chance of materializing during the course of the year. I just want to it leave at that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Tarkan with Compass Point. Please go ahead. ","Andrew Eskelsen ","Hi, this is actually Andrew Eskelsen on for Mike. My question is just to clarify regarding the 2015 guidance. Does the $2.20 include assumptions for share repurchase or M&A activity? ","Jack Remondi ","Yes, it does. It is our assumption based on what we have in the plan today.","Andrew Eskelsen ","Okay, thank you. And then on the M&A environment out there specifically from the FFELP standpoint, are you seeing more activity now that the Wells portfolio has moved and on the private side anything to note there? ","Jack Remondi ","Well, the Wells portfolio was the largest portfolio held by banks, and yes, we are seeing some more activity. I think the drivers what we see is being the drivers for banks in particular to sell is the fact that loan growth is growing, so they are seeing demand for loan elsewhere in their business, which gives them an opportunity to redeploy those cash flows. The regulatory environment as it is associated with both consumer assets and the student loans base as well as their obligations to oversee third party vendors are the principal drivers there. ","Andrew Eskelsen ","All right, thank you. And just one more for me. In terms of the servicing on the Wells portfolio and transferring it over to your platform, can you sort of walk us through how that process will work? ","Jack Remondi ","Yes. So these loans are all serviced today by third parties. The majority of the loans are eligible to be transferred. So when we acquired the portfolio, we also acquired the servicing rights associated with them. That portfolio that is eligible to be transferred will be transferred by the third quarter of next year. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Mark DeVries","Yes, thanks. I just have a follow up question on the transfer. I think you referenced $20 million of incremental servicing expense from 2015 as a result of that. Should we assume it is more of like a $40 million annualized number given that it is not going to transfer until 3Q?","Somsak Chivavibul ","No, that's fully annualized number there, Mark. ","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it, got it. And Jack, I think you referenced the opportunity for some operating efficiencies. Could you give us some color on what you have in mind there and whether that's embedded in kind of the earnings guidance for 2015?","Jack Remondi ","Yes. It is in our forecast. But generally what we have been able to do year-over-year is improve the operating cost of our internal operations. And so that would be everything from what is it cost to service loan and repayment to what is our cost of collecting on a delinquent account to porting new acquisitions onto our servicing platform. What we typically do as we measure the unit activities in those areas and over the years we've been automating a number of the functions in that space, improving both our operating efficiency as well as the control structure associated with those activities. And we continue to see opportunities to do that. An example of a big item that we rolled out last year or this fall, 2014 fall, was our mobile web application for customers. And this dramatically simply their ability to make payments on a mobile device which our customers increasingly do. And it gave them the flexibility to actually make allocate those payments to specific loans and that both as a customer experience benefit but it also improved their operating expense as that function was previously more manual. ","Mark DeVries","Got it. And then finally could you just give us some color on the types of FFELP loans you acquired in the quarter outside of the Wells deal? I guess there was $1 billion of other loan. What types of loans was those, and gives a sense of how the returns on those compared to your portfolio, your average portfolio returns?","Jack Remondi ","So they-- it is a variety of different smaller portfolio purchases with the piece of these are, our purchases coming from guarantee agencies as borrowers are rehabilitated and the loans are return to good standing. And then smaller portfolios that we acquire, some of which were on our servicing platform, some of which were not. The returns vary pretty significantly depending upon the different features there, or characteristics of the loan. Obviously loans that are on our servicing platform have, can generate the best returns after operating expense because they -- the incremental cost is relatively low to service compared to a third party service contract as an example. But the returns I would say are consistent -- they are consistent with the spread guidance that Somsak gave for our FFELP portfolio in his remarks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. ","Steven Kwok","Hi, thanks. This is actually Steven Kwok filling in for Sanjay. Just quick question around the guidance as well. Does the guidance include any debt repurchase gains? ","Somsak Chivavibul ","No. They do not.","Steven Kwok","Okay. And then in terms of when we look at it from the service side, you mentioned about the opportunities for a larger piece of the Department of Education contract and third party contracts. Can you drill down little bit more in terms of other opportunities out there? How should we think about that going forward? ","Jack Remondi ","Yes. So each year the department of Ed increase is really coming from two things. It is coming from the loans that were added in the last calendar year, having the full year impact on our -- on the revenue stream, more of those loans in repayment which we get paid higher fees, there is cost associated with servicing those loans. And then each year the department uses their score card mechanism to reallocate the volume and based on our scores for the last measurement period, we increased our allocation share to 24% of new placements for the upcoming year. So those are the big drivers. ","Steven Kwok","Got it. Are there other opportunities outside of the Department of Education? ","Jack Remondi ","Yes. So we do believe that there are opportunities to continue to take on third party servicing roles for other holders of loans, we are seeing more inquiries on that space. And winning some contracts in those areas as well. ","Steven Kwok","Got it, got it. And then just finally on the expense side. In terms of given the puts and takes with regards to the one time cost like how should we think about it on a normalized basis going forward? ","Somsak Chivavibul ","Sure. I mean exclusive of the incremental cost, the servicing costs were-- yes, I just talked about the $4 million of cost we incurred in the fourth quarter. I think we've been running about $800 million annually and given the increased compliant cost and as well as the fact that we are going to be increasing our loan service I think outside of the incremental cost, I alluded to an $800 million run rate probably appropriate going forward. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alan Straus of Schroders. Your line is open.","Alan Straus","Hi. I am just curious what tax rate you guys assuming for the year? And second question is on the private student loan side. Do you see any chance of acquisitions? Is it something you are interested in besides from Sallie? ","Somsak Chivavibul ","Hey, Alan. The tax rate we expect to have is 37% for both 2014 and 2015. ","Jack Remondi ","And on the private acquisition front, yes, we are definitely interested in acquiring portfolios in that area. And we do see opportunities and are pursuing them for acquisitions outside of Sallie Mae Bank. They are much smaller than the FFELP side but the returns, yes; you can see from the margin that Somsak provided in his open remarks are four times what they are in the FFELP space. So those are -- those can be very attractive opportunities. And we deliver a lot of value when we acquire them because of our servicing capabilities. We are very good at helping customers understand their payment obligations and find payment solution that they can afford. Our programs, there have been out and have really led the industry in that side and we see it in our default performance. ","Alan Straus","And just a follow up. What's the stumbling block that there have been so few acquisitions? Is it all priced or is it regulatory issues? ","Jack Remondi ","I think it is a bit of both, frankly. ","Alan Straus","What would you need to break through on the regulatory side? Is that just something that can't be overcome because -- ","Jack Remondi ","No. I think it's just getting people comfortable with the process, and demonstrating what we are doing on that side of the equation and how we are helping customers. I also think that if the loans are third party serviced, the regulatory environment and ownership of the lender over that third party's performance is a growing factor that is driving the interest of banks in particular to sell. And so when you look at on the FFELP side, that's a very significant factor. I got to oversee a third party vendor as if it is my own an internal shop, for a business that I am not in any longer. I think that's a factor that's driving the desire to sell. It is true of both federal and private.","Operator","Your next question comes from Connor Pickett. Your line is open. ","Connor Pickett","Hi, thank you. Could you confirm that you are reducing your equity allocation higher to the private student book to 8% from 12% and maybe provide a little more color on that shift?","Jack Remondi ","Yes. So when we look at what the reserve --what the capital levels are for our portfolios, it is driven by a function of what we expect the loss rates to be and then the cap which are covered by reserves and then an estimate for the capital based on a variety of facts. This is based on what kind of funding capabilities we have on those assets. And what percentage of funding we can obtain and what kind of loss rate we might be exposed to above and beyond our expectations. As our private loan portfolio has seasoned and move through substantially move through its peak default period, and as we see a higher percentage of our portfolio covered by life of loan loss reserves and our TDR portfolio. It is moved capital from-- allowed us to basically move from providing coverage to capital through providing it through reserves. And it does allow us to pull our capital rates down in that area. ","Connor Pickett","So then would you expect to reach that 8% on a capitalization basis over a certain period of time or are you going to continue to operate on the excess to that 8% allocation?","Jack Remondi ","We don't like it is appropriate when we were at 12% and that was such an enormous cushion against kind of the potential credit losses that might occur in stress environments. We tended to run closer to those numbers. At 8%, we feel it is more appropriate to make sure that we have flexibility in our capital position, flexibility to acquire portfolios, flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and flexibility to change frankly some of our funding structure. So I think you see the capital that we are running at to be fairly consistent going forward.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference.

I appreciate your interest and support. This quarter's results continue to reflect the strength of our business model and the value it delivers for our investors. Earlier this year, market conditions presented questions on a few items including credit and access to funding that placed significant pressure on our funding spreads and our stock price. Our deliberate and directed actions and our performance this quarter should indisputably put these questions to rest. Our actions also contributed to this quarter's strong results and put us in excellent position to continue to execute on our business plan and deliver value.","I plan to focus my comments this morning on credit performance, funding including the rating agency legal final maturity topic, new business opportunities, and creating shareholder value. Our results this quarter were particularly strong at $0.51 adjusted core earnings per share. The clear standout this quarter and this year has been credit performance. For our private loan portfolio, we have seen consistent and significant improvement in year-over-year delinquency and default trends. Credit charges this quarter were down 24% versus last year, and the charge-off rate for the quarter fell to 1.9%. The federal loans we service are also experiencing strong credit performance trends.","While the continued recovery in the economy and the jobs market are the prime drivers here, our data-driven approach to loan servicing helps us identify and increase contact rates with at-risk borrowers. Once in contact, we can help identify solutions including income driven repayment programs that allow borrowers to successfully stay on track. As an example, the Department of Education released its latest three-year cohort default data last month. Once again, Navient\u2019s service borrowers experienced significantly lower default rates, 31% lower than all other servicers.","We're also a leader in enrolling federal loan customers into income-driven repayment plans. We are proud of these positive borrower experiences and outcomes and welcome policymakers to visit one of our servicing centers to see firsthand how we consistently deliver superior results.","A major priority this year was to demonstrate our access to a broad array of funding options and to materially reduce our near-term unsecured debt maturities. With a well-designed plan and clear demonstration of strong credit and liquidity, we completed new financings in every area of our liability structure including our first secured financings of new loan types and assets. This activity was capped this quarter with our successful return to the unsecured debt markets with both the five-year and later seven-year issuance.","Earlier this year, we demonstrated our ability to issue FFELP ABS despite rating agency uncertainty on legacy deals. Year-to-date, we have now completed six FFELP deals totaling $4.9 billion using different structures in funding all loan types, including our first bond backed 100% by federal rehabilitation loans. Investor participation has been strong and growing, and funding spreads improved with each deal.","This summer, both Moody's and Fitch announced their new criteria for rating FFELP ABS transactions, and they have recently begun to apply their criteria to bonds previously placed on watch. While their modeling is complex, and we do not always agree with their predicted impact on cash flows, the issue is finally coming to a close. While Somsak will cover the details in his comments, we remain committed to working with the rating agencies and investors to minimize ratings impact. Our steady progress and track record in this area is a clear demonstration of this commitment.","As I mentioned, one of our goals this year was to reduce our near-term unsecured debt maturities. Overall, our new financing activity and strong cash flow has allowed us to reduce our 2016 to 2018 unsecured debt maturities by 50%. Including our announced make-whole call of the January 2017 bond later this month, unsecured debt maturities are $700 million next year and $2.1 billion in 2018, well below our projected cash flow.","On the revenue front, our proactive management of interest rate and basis risk has allowed us to earn stable margins on both our federal and private loan portfolios this quarter. We are not, however, immune from market conditions, and so we expect to see a larger impact next quarter as spreads between one-month and three-month LIBOR are at a historically wide level. That said, we do believe the current environment is technically driven and short-term. Somsak will provide more detail on this area and our management of the conditions in his remarks.","Fee revenue was $179 million this quarter, up from $166 million in the year ago quarter. We continue to see good growth opportunities that leverage our skills and services, particularly in non-education related areas. I was particularly pleased to win a new contract this quarter to work for the IRS. While we don't expect to receive first placements until the spring of next year, all of us are excited to put our expertise to work for the IRS and create value for taxpayers and even more employment opportunities at our New York centers.","The acquisition of federal and private loan portfolios was another priority. Year-to-date, we have acquired nearly $3 billion in loans, including $662 million this quarter, and we continue to see opportunities to add to these totals this year and next. We also continued to aggressively pursue cost savings, particularly efficiency gains, and while we made good progress here in 2016, we have more work to do.","Sometimes these efforts require us to spend more now to create greater savings in the future. One such effort involves moving third-party service loans that we own to our in-house platform. Bringing servicing in-house drives down our future costs and drives up loan performance. We're beginning a new effort here this quarter to move $2.7 billion of loans, and so we will incur higher upfront operating expense in the fourth quarter as we move this portfolio in-house.","We also create value for our investors through our share repurchase program. With a lower stock price, we were able to purchase more shares than we had planned this year. Year-to-date, we have retired 13% of common shares at an average price of $12.21 per share, a price well below our view of intrinsic value. While I would much rather that our stock price traded at intrinsic value, the consolation has been the ability to buy shares at a discount, a significant discount, and to capture that value for our shareholders.","Finally, tomorrow, we will release Money Under 35, our second annual study on millennial financial health. The national survey examines who is faring well and who is struggling in today's economy, and drills down on the details by education level debt and other measures. We conduct this study as part of our efforts to inform policy and identify the groups most in need of help. I hope you watch for this study on Thursday.","I'll now turn the call over to Somsak to provide a deeper look at our financial results and I look forward to taking your questions later. Somsak?","Somsak Chivavibul","Thanks Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I will review the strong third quarter results that we reported last night as well as an update on our earnings guidance for the full year. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation which is available on the Company's Web-site, beginning with Slide 4 which provides a summary of our core earnings.","In the third quarter, we reported adjusted core EPS of $0.51, and that compared to $0.48 from a year ago quarter. Our third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $223 million versus $220 million from the year ago quarter. This slight increase in expenses is primarily related to the additional operating costs of Gila and Xtend Healthcare acquisitions. Excluding the expenses associated with these two acquisitions, our operating expenses were 7% lower than the year ago.","As Jack mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we will transfer $2.7 billion of Navient owned FFELP loans that are currently being serviced by a third-party to Navient servicing platform. As a result of this transfer, we will incur an additional $7 million of one-time operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Even though these additional expenses were not included in our previous operating expense guidance, we remain on pace to beat our adjusted annual operating expense guidance of $930 million.","Before I go into more detail on our quarterly results, I would like to discuss on Slide 5 the recent widening of the three-month LIBOR that we saw during the quarter compared to the one-month LIBOR in the Prime rate and how we manage this basis risk. Approximately $85 billion of FFELP loans are indexed to the one-month LIBOR that reset daily. After the impact of hedges, about $30 billion of these assets are funded with three-month LIBOR that reset quarterly.","Historically, the spread between these two indices have averaged around 11 basis points. In the quarter, the average spread warranted 28 basis points, and today the spread is closer to 35 basis points. We believe the recent increase in the average spread as the result of an ongoing anticipation of rate hikes that have yet to occur and the recent money market fund reforms. The spread widening of the two indices did not fully impact the third quarter NIM due to the timing of resets associated with our three-month LIBOR debt.","Approximately $19 billion of this debt had already reset in July before the significant increase in the spread occurred and will reset again in October 25. The remaining $11 billion of debt we set late in the third quarter and had minimal impact to the third quarter FFELP NIM.","Our Private Education Loan net interest margin is impacted by the timing of when our $15 billion of Prime-based earning assets reset versus when our LIBOR based debt reset. $8 billion of these assets are funded with three-month LIBOR and $7 billion of these assets are funded with one-month LIBOR. Since the last Prime reset in December 2015, we've seen LIBOR increase without a corresponding increase in the Prime rate, and our guidance will assume higher LIBOR cost of funds for the fourth quarter without an increase in the Prime rate.","Due to the impact of the LIBOR basis risk and the additional one-time $7 million servicing expense, which were not included in our previous EPS guidance, I expect us to be at the midpoint of our previously issued 2016 core EPS guidance of $1.82 to $1.87.","Let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $69 million for the third quarter 2016 versus $70 million in the third quarter of 2015. The FFELP net interest margin improved to 87 basis points due to higher hedged and unhedged Floor Income during the quarter. While the impact of the widening one-month to three-month LIBOR spread will be larger in the fourth quarter, we still expect the FFELP net interest margin to remain in the low to mid 80s for the full-year and in the low 80s for the fourth quarter.","In the quarter, we acquired $596 million of FFELP student loans bringing the year-to-date total acquisitions to $2.7 billion. We are optimistic that we will see larger portfolios start to move now that Moody's and Fitch have released their final criterias and have started taking action. We saw significant year-over-year improvement in the credit quality of our FFELP portfolio as late-stage delinquency rates declined by 20% and the total delinquency rate declined by nearly 30%.","Let's now move to Slide 7 to review our Private Education Loans segment results. Core earnings in this segment declined by $17 million from the year ago quarter to $60 million. In the quarter, the net interest margin was 348 basis points, and our guidance for the full-year NIM in the mid-340s remain intact but we expect our fourth quarter NIM to be in the low 320s. This guidance includes updated repayment assumptions, our cost of funds from our LIBOR based debt and no increases in the Prime rate during the fourth quarter.","Our provision for private education loan losses continued to improve as a result of the overall improvement in delinquency and charge-off trends. Charge-offs declined $36 million or 24% from the prior year and loans greater than 90 days delinquent have decreased by $129 million or 15%. The improved performance demonstrates the strong and improving credit quality of our portfolio, and Slide 8 highlights some of these improving trends that we're seeing over the last five years.","Our third quarter charge-off rate fell to 1.9% and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.9%. The chart on the bottom of the slide demonstrates the benefits the improved performance is having on our borrowers' most recent FICO scores. FICO scores have improved by 36 basis points for the non-traditional loans and 24 points for the entire portfolio on average over the last five years, and we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this area.","Let's turn to Slide 9 to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter, and that's compared with $79 million in our third quarter of 2015. Non-education loan related asset recovery revenues increased $18 million from the year ago quarter to $46 million. This increase in revenues is primarily related to the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015. Overall, we expect our consolidated Business Services revenue to come in between $620 million and $625 million for the full year.","I would like to highlight our financing activity that took place in the third quarter and give a brief update on the recent actions from the rating agencies on Slide 10. We just issued our second FFELP ABS transaction, 2016-5, that consisted entirely of 100% rehabilitated loans totaling $1 billion in bonds in the quarter. We are seeing an increase in demand for FFELP ABS and investors' willingness to participate in this market. Compared to our prior deal, this transaction saw both an increase in the size of issuance by nearly $0.5 billion and pricing improved by 13 basis points.","It has now been a few months since Moody's and Fitch have released their final updated cash flow assumptions on FFELP asset-backed securities. As of June 30, these two rating agencies have had $56 billion and $51 billion respectively of Navient-sponsored bonds on watch for downgrade. Fitch has since affirmed or upgraded $6 billion of bonds and downgraded $0.5 billion of bonds to below investment grade. Subsequent to the downgrade to noninvestment grade, we were able to successfully extend the legal final maturity date on those particular bonds and Fitch has since upgraded those bonds to AAA.","Since the end of the second quarter, Fitch has affirmed or upgraded $4 billion of bonds and has downgraded $1.2 billion of bonds to below investment grade. While we continue to wait for Moody's and Fitch to complete their final ratings outcomes, we've been actively extending the legal final maturity date on previously issued bonds. In total, we have now extended the legal final maturity dates on $7.3 billion of bonds.","In the quarter, we completed two issuances of unsecured debt totaling $1.3 billion with maturities in 2021 and 2023. The proceeds of these transactions were used to reduce our unsecured debt by $625 million during the quarter. $538 million of this reduction came through repurchases in the open market. Additionally, we issued a make-whole call that will be effected on October 25 for an additional $691 million of our unsecured debt that will be due in January 2017. Including this call, we will have reduced our total unsecured debt maturities by $2.1 billion and our near-term maturities in 2017 and 2018 by $1.8 billion from the prior year.","In the quarter, we repurchased 14.3 million shares, up $200 million, at an average price $13.95, and at quarter end we have a remaining authority of $180 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.24.","Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 11, we recorded third quarter GAAP net income of $230 million or $0.73 a share, and that's compared with net income of $237 million or $0.63 per share in the third quarter of 2015. The primary differences between the core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions and any expenses related to the restructuring of the organization coming from the Spin transaction.","I will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Orenbuch","Just hoping that you could kind of give us a little bit of maybe further look as to how we should think about the one-month\/three-months issue kind of progressing, I guess is it your hope and expectation that the spread narrows or that there's -- because of the technical factors reversing or is it that you expect the Fed to increase rates at some point, how does this play out over the next couple of quarters?","Somsak Chivavibul","I think it's a combination of things, but I do expect that that spread will continue to narrow. In the guidance that we are providing though, we are assuming for the fourth quarter that that spreads remains at current levels for the rest of the fourth quarter. So to the extent it does come in, it will modestly help the fourth quarter results but will have more of an impact on the first quarter 2017's margins.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. And given the significant progress that you made on the unsecured maturities, is there anything that you are able now to do differently as you're looking into 2017\/2018, like how do you kind of think about that?","Somsak Chivavibul","I think one of the things that we've been able to do, as Jack mentioned, the close to $5 billion of FFELP ABS transactions that we were able to complete. The benefit of having those transactions being completed is that it also creates capacity in our ABCP line that allows us to continue to acquire FFELP loans that might be coming up for sale.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. And then just lastly for me, given the improvement on the private credit side, which was actually better than we had seen in the trust data, any way we should think differently about the reserving practices in 2017, is there any chance that the reserve could come down at a faster rate?","Somsak Chivavibul","I think what we've seen is just that we've seen a continually steady release of the reserve. Today, we are booking about -- this quarter we booked $92 million of provision. Just given the trajectory and the seasoning of the portfolio, we certainly should expect to see a downward trajectory off of that current run rate that we're working off.","Jack Remondi","This is Jack. Our provision is really covering at this stage in the game 2019's expected charge-offs, right, because of our two-year forward look, and so that's really what's driving this. And one of the reasons we put the seasoning charts in our investor presentations is that you can see how loans perform, how loans improve their performance as they move through the number of months in repayment, and that is a big driver here. Now certainly the economy is helping quite a bit and you're seeing this across the board in terms of credit performance on student loans. So, even our FFELP delinquencies fell 20% year-over-year, as an example.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","I guess first question, despite this basis issue with the LIBOR and Prime, when you look at the FFELP NIM, that kind of improved sequentially and year-over-year. Could you just talk about what's contributing to that? And then just clarifying the specific EPS impact of this issue, rough math we get to like $0.04 or $0.05 in EPS. Could you just validate that?","Somsak Chivavibul","I'll answer that last part, Sanjay. You're in the ballpark there in terms of the impact of quarter-over-quarter relative to that spread impact, and obviously we talked about that. Also, as we roll into the fourth quarter, the one-time impact would be the one-time conversion or servicing transfer expenses that we expect to incur. And if you do the math, that sequentially leads to the full year guidance coming in at the midpoint of the range I was referring to of $1.82 to $1.87.","Coming back to first part or your first question related to the improvement of the FFELP NIM, year-over-year that's really been attributable to higher floor income that we've realized from our portfolio, and that has largely so far offset the impact of the widening one-month\/three-month LIBOR, and higher cost of funds that we\u2019re seeing period over period.","Sanjay Sakhrani","So we should expect that benefit to continue until rates obviously rise?","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes, that's going to be the key component. As rates rise, it will impact our unhedged floors. Our hedged floor's position, obviously we've locked in on $1.1 billion of that income over the next few years, so that's pretty much locked in. The variable certainly will be the unhedged floor component.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. Second question, Jack, you mentioned some of the larger \u2013 I'm sorry, it sounds like you mentioned larger portfolios, so maybe Jack, you could talk about it. It seems like they might be on the move sooner than later. Could you just talk about where we are?","Jack Remondi","Sure. So what we have seen as a result of the widening of the FFELP ABS spreads given the rating agency issues, I think put a pause on many FFELP loan sales, and as those have been unwinding, we're seeing more discussions and more actions or interest coming from potential sellers here. Even during this timeframe, we've been able to continue to buy FFELP loans at attractive spreads given our funding costs, and I would expect to see that pace accelerate slightly over the next call it two to five quarters here.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, great. One final question. The servicing transfer, obviously there's a cost associated, but what's the benefit on an ongoing basis?","Somsak Chivavibul","We think the benefit is going to be on a run rate basis $5 million to $6 million a year.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Jack Remondi","And Sanjay, that's just on the operating expense. When we've moved portfolios from third-party servicers in the past, we've also seen a significant improvement in loan performance, which reduces delinquency and default events.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rick Shane from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Richard Shane","You highlight that during the year you've been able to repurchase about 13% of the flow. We calculate that assets are down about 9%. We clearly recognize the intrinsic value here, but one question we get from investors all the time and love to get your view on it is, what is the long-term opportunity for growth? I mean this is a transition period, we get that, but how do you envision reinvigorating growth over the next five years, and would you talk about your preparations as the standstill on private student lending ends, what are you putting in place to sort of establish that network?","Jack Remondi","I think we actually would break our opportunities for growth into a couple of different buckets here. Certainly there's an opportunity to add to our existing student loan holdings by purchasing legacy assets. This would include both federal and private. And as we said, we believe we'll see some significant opportunities in the next several quarters to acquire portfolios in that space and add to the portfolios that we own. Those are obviously easy transactions to understand and easy to understand where the value is created there. As we've said all along, however, our view is that we're buying cash flows, and so any activity to acquire assets here is going to be extremely disciplined that if it doesn't add value, we don't buy it. And so those are kind of the parameters in that space.","We also see some opportunity to acquire student loan portfolios that are not legacy portfolios but ongoing kind of origination activities. These are private loans and they include both perhaps campus originated loans as well as refinancing loans, and that piece of the opportunity grows, is a growing opportunity. It's also one that, as you pointed out, the non-compete issues expire at the end of 2018 and give us some flexibility to go back into that space, or total flexibility I should say if we so choose. That opportunity I think is one that we are interested in, but it is certainly, it's a little bit longer route in terms of the time horizon.","And then finally, where we really have been focusing our activities since the separation is taking advantage of the skills and capabilities that we've developed in our operating environments, our operations areas, to leverage those two different areas and other asset classes. And so we've been doing that in the municipal and state area, and this is primarily kind of a combination of processing kind of asset recovery related work and the same for the healthcare arena where it is mostly a processing type business. Both of these areas are one that we think we can grow in double digits and we'll continue to work in that space.","Adding to that would be opportunities in the federal space. We just recently were awarded the IRS contract. That's something we're very excited about, and we are actively pursuing the Department of Education loan servicing contract which has moved at a slower pace than they had originally indicated, but still seems to be on track for being really sometime in the fourth quarter.","Richard Shane","Got it. That's helpful. A follow-up question in terms of the FFELP opportunity. We have this weird dynamic which is that the opportunity slowed in part because of the uncertainty of ABS funding, and so you have this sort of synchronous growth, synchronous funding scenario. Are you seeing pricing become more competitive because funding has improved?","Somsak Chivavibul","I think the challenge has been that some of the uncertainty in pricing, when you had the wider FFELP ABS spreads, it pushed portfolio values perhaps in some instances below par, and for our government-guaranteed loan, that's just a difficult transaction for sellers to get excited about. And so as you get back to the par type of marketplace, you have a different environment.","We think the opportunity, why we think FFELP opportunities will be there is that the majority of portfolios that are available are serviced by third parties, and the regulatory requirements associated with kind of monitoring third parties and managing that process can start to make some of these deals less attractive, make portfolios less attractive to hold, and hopefully will result in seeing opportunities to acquire those in the near term, as we said.","Richard Shane","That's great. That's helpful color. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mahmood Reza from Omega Advisors. Your line is open.","Mahmood Reza","So I had a couple of things I wanted to touch on. First on capital return, so we have $180 million I think you said left on the authorization. First part of this question is, can we expect that to be used this calendar year? And when you look forward into 2017, our total return this year has been something like $200 million in dividends and $750 million of buyback. Any reason why that would be materially lower next year, other than the fact obviously the portfolio continues to runoff?","Jack Remondi","So we do expect to utilize our remaining authority this year in the share buybacks, to answer your first question. And our share repurchase authority is something that will be presented and discussed with the Board in the upcoming meetings. There's been no discussion to date. Historically though, we have set that level of capital return to be a function of the capital we generate from our business that is not required to support balance sheet growth or other operating activity growth, and it also would include any capital release from the amortization of the portfolios.","As you know, buying FFELP portfolios puts very little demand on capital. Buying private loan portfolios puts much higher demand on capital than the FFELP portfolio does. So it depends a lot on what the opportunities are, but as I said earlier in this call and I've said consistently in the past, buying portfolios has to make sense against all of the alternative and activities that we can do, which would include share repurchases.","Mahmood Reza","Got it. Thank you. And just on the M&A environment, Rick kind of touched on this, but if you go back to sort of the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, we all know what happened in the second half of 2015, but just that sort of 12 month period where you were able to get a large portfolio transaction on the FFELP side, why would we be in a better position today assuming a normalized market and less sort of rating agency jitters versus that period to be able to be the acquirer of choice for the portfolios that do come to market?","Jack Remondi","I think our strengths are crystal clear here. We are first of all capable of executing on very large transactions in single bites rather than having to deal with this over an elongated period of time, one. Two, we have demonstrated an ability, a superior ability, to deal with customer acquisitions and make sure that those customers are properly informed and understand the changes that will take place in a portfolio acquisition, including a servicing conversion. I think the transaction, the accounts that we acquired through the Wells transaction and successfully moved to our portfolio, as we've indicated before, we had actually net more customer compliments than kind of questions or complaints in that process. That gets noticed by not only regulators, it gets noticed by sellers.","And then finally, I think the third piece of courses is our loan performance. If we can drive, if by moving loans on to our servicing platform, we can materially improve the performance of loans from both the delinquency and default perspective, helping borrowers become, better take advantage of different repayment options so they can successfully repay their loans, all of those things point to us as the preferred, I would say, obviously I'm a little biased here, but the preferred buyer of FFELP portfolios.","Mahmood Reza","And so you would say that the competitive intensity is pretty much the same though? In other words, the competing bids and the aggressiveness of those bids are probably [indiscernible]?","Jack Remondi","I think that that point about being able to execute here is a significant and unique advantage from a seller's point of view.","Mahmood Reza","Got it. Final thing for me, just on the debt repurchases. So I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks and also earlier in the call that you retired\/repurchased $625 million, which addressed I think the 2017 and 2018 maturities. I'm curious if you could bifurcate that between how much was for 2017 and how much was for 2018?","Somsak Chivavibul","The vast majority, Mahmood, of that was the 2018 maturity, and you'll see I think on the chart on Page 18 there that we've reduced our 2018 maturity now down to $2.1 billion. So that's where the vast majority of the repurchases went against.","Mahmood Reza","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries from Barclays. Your line is open.","Mark DeVries","Could you discuss how the funding costs of the unsecured debt you issued in the quarter compared to the debt you retired? I'm just trying to get a sense directionally what we should expect for the NIM as you continue to push out maturities?","Somsak Chivavibul","Sure. So the first unsecured deal that we did during the quarter came in on the re-offer price of somewhere around LIBOR plus 5.37. That was the five-year issuance. So our second deal was $0.5 billion and a seven-year deal and that came in at a re-offer spread of L plus 5.77, and the debt that it replaced was somewhere in the L plus low 4 neighborhood.","Mark DeVries","Okay. And how has that debt traded since you issued it?","Somsak Chivavibul","The five-year deal that we did has traded right around [101] [ph]. So, it has traded above par. And our second deal to date, it's traded around par right when I last looked at this.","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it. And then, could you discuss what you've seen with FFELP spreads with the reviews that so far have come out from the rating agencies and rating changes, and also discuss how representative what they looked at so far is of the remaining deals that they've got to evaluate?","Somsak Chivavibul","Remember that new deals that we issue really aren't subject to the legal final maturity issue because we can effectively deal with that by setting a legal final maturity date so that it doesn't become an issue. But one of the things that we've seen is that pricing has continued to come in. Just by way of example, I talked about the two rehab deals that we've done and we've seen sequential 13 basis points improvement in the pricing. And just the other week, we were about to price another, or we just priced another FFELP deal, and that has come in, that was priced at a re-offer rate of around L plus 1.15, which was a 10 basis point improvement over our last FFELP deal. So it's continued sequentially from the other deal that's come in from 10 to 13 basis points.","Jack Remondi","I think it's safe to say that investors have certainly bifurcated those bonds that are on watch from those that are not and have come to I think get a really good understanding of the technical issues here in the process.","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it, great. And finally, Jack, could you discuss the near term and long-term earnings potential of this new IRS contract?","Jack Remondi","So as I said in our comments, we don't expect first placements until the spring of next year, and in a program of this type, your accounts come in and your revenue comes as you actually start to build a pipeline of payers on the unpaid balances. So 2017 earnings contribution will really be minimalist, if anything. It's really an 2018 type of event and beyond for us.","Mark DeVries","Okay, as you look beyond 2018, what's kind of your hopes and expectations for how that program may build in size?","Jack Remondi","It will depend upon how quickly the placements get made and what portion or what size we get. So I think in terms of the impact to Navient, I think we really need to see what those placements look like come next spring.","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Eric Beardsley from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Eric Beardsley","Just on the Private Loan margin guidance for the fourth quarter of low 320s, I guess is that solely the Prime three-month impact, and if we saw Fed funds go up in the middle of the quarter or even we were to look back and say we already had a rate hike, where would that margin be?","Somsak Chivavibul","Sure. I'll start out by working back to the second part of your question here. So approximately two-thirds of our private portfolio is Prime based, Eric. So if you think about it, a 25 basis point rate hike, apply the two-thirds ratio to that, you're going to get to about a 16 to 17 basis point improvement in the spread in [the ordinary] [ph] FFELP NIM right away. So that's sort of the math there. And then to the first part of your question, the NIM is going to be impacted by both the spread and then just the higher cost of funds of old debt rolling off and new debt coming on.","Eric Beardsley","Got it. Also just on the FFELP margin, I know there's some seasonality in there, which is a little bit tough to parse out sometimes, but where we typically see that go from the fourth quarter to the first quarter?","Somsak Chivavibul","That's a really good question. Typically, we do see a seasonal impact coming from just the timing of how we earn floor income and how the formula for our floor rebate gets calculated. Unfortunately, a mismatch there. But typically, you will see anywhere from a 2 or 3 basis point lower FFELP spread in the first quarter, and then that flips around and comes back into the FFELP spread during the second, third and fourth quarter.","Eric Beardsley","Got it. And then just lastly, just wanted to clarify the OpEx guidance, so did you say inclusive of the $7 million charge to bring those loans onto the platform, you'd be below $930 million for the year?","Somsak Chivavibul","That's absolutely correct, yes.","Eric Beardsley","Okay, and does that include the regulatory costs you've incurred to date, I think it was somewhere around $14 million?","Somsak Chivavibul","It does not.","Eric Beardsley","Okay, got it. So the $7 million is baked into the $940 million but the $14 million is not?","Somsak Chivavibul","In the $930 million.","Eric Beardsley","Sorry, in the $930 million, yes, okay, got it. And I guess are those regulatory costs continuing here at this level?","Somsak Chivavibul","They've been running at this level pretty consistently through the course of the year, and we would expect that to continue at least through the fourth quarter. Obviously we would love to see some of these processes come to a close here and working hard towards that, but we don't control the calendar or the time schedule here.","Eric Beardsley","Got it. Then just lastly, I think back to the question about the longer-term growth, if we think about the gradual decline in the collections income on FFELP, is the asset recovery business longer-term, at least over the next couple of years, a growth business or is that kind of flattened out here as you have some opportunities growing on the healthcare side, municipal side and maybe the IRS offsetting the runoff on the student loan side?","Jack Remondi","So we do think it is a growth opportunity here and it's a combination of business activities. It's not just asset recovery that we see as the opportunity, but actually being more of a processing partner with the entity so that we can manage the end-to-end process of everything from billing to payment processing to pursuing recovery of the and payment on the invoice. The IRS contract is a good example. It's certainly larger than the education related space and is something that we're pretty excited about.","And then finally, I think some of the changes in the regulatory environment and requirements that are coming from rules and regulations here really play to our strengths, and those strengths are really a data-driven kind of approach. So this is not just a pure kind of dialing activity that we pursue, we actually work to identify the right contact methods for our customers based on all of the historical success rates we've had in this particular area and use those to minimize the number of attempts that we make to contact a customer and do so in a way that creates a higher right party contact rate. And that is the key to default prevention in the student loan space and it's a key to the recovery rates by being able to get a customer on the phone and explain their options to them and work with them to find a solution that fits their budgets.","Eric Beardsley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hammond from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Mark Hammond","In the release, there's a line about winning a number of new Business Services contracts during the quarter. I'm aware of the IRS win, but would you highlight the others?","Jack Remondi","Yes, a lot of our business activities in our municipal and hospital sides of the equation are smaller contracts, and so we don't name them individually, but we are winning proposals in that space on a regular basis. So almost no quarter goes by where we're not adding new clients or new contracts in both of those areas.","Mark Hammond","All right, thanks. And after acquiring more FFELP during the quarter, I'm wondering if you could put a number on the size of the remaining FFELP that you think are likely to come up for sale, not just what's out there?","Jack Remondi","So I would say, the market opportunities in the next, if you call the next 12 months, would be in terms of what we might see being sold, and then the question would be what portion do we get, would be somewhere in the $7 billion to $10 billion range.","Mark Hammond","Thank you. And then my last question is about delinquencies on the private student loan book. I was wondering what caused uptick sequentially in the book from 6.1% to 6.9% for total delinquencies.","Jack Remondi","So that is seasonal related factors that come into play, and you would typically see them, and we publish these quarterly statistics so you can see the seasonal factors from period to period come in. Now what you are seeing is lower overall delinquencies in terms of dollars and across the portfolio as the accounts season, and that greater than 90 day delinquency rate continues to perform extremely well, both total delinquencies and 90-day delinquencies that are down significantly from the year-over-year comparisons as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Tarkan from Compass Point. Your line is open.","Michael Tarkan","Just a couple of quick ones here. On those regulatory costs every quarter, can you just remind us what's actually in those?","Jack Remondi","It's basically legal expenses, responding to document requests, things of that nature.","Michael Tarkan","Okay, thanks. Regarding the IRS contract, is there \u2013 I know the revenues don't ramp until later, but is there some front-loading of expenses that we should be contemplating for 2017 before the revenues start growing?","Jack Remondi","Absolutely. So preparing your systems to be ready for the IRS requirements are operating expenses that we will incur at the front-end of the process, and then of course labor. So, as accounts are placed and we start incurring salary and postage related expenses before the revenue comes in. Both of those will be factored into our guidance when we provide it on our next earnings call.","Michael Tarkan","Okay, thanks. And then lastly, just I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on the CFPB's that collection report from earlier this week. I know you haven't really been doing much under the direct loan program anymore but just wondering if any of those recommendations or any of the comments there could have any impact on the FFELP collections work.","Jack Remondi","The CFPB's annual report on student loans came out and a big section of it was dedicated to the federal rehabilitation marketplace. A lot of the recommendations or policy recommendations in that report are actually very consistent with ones that we need almost two years ago now and in terms of creating a more seamless approach of taking a borrower from the reasonable affordable repayments that are required under the rehab program into an income-driven repayment plan upon successful completion.","When we take rehab accounts that we acquire in the FFELP space, this is one of the areas that we work extremely hard at in terms of connecting with borrowers immediately upon conversion, because we don't \u2013 a lot of this data doesn't transfer from the collector to the servicer, doesn't at all on the Ed side and on the FFELP side it depends on the guarantor whether they provide that information to us or not. But we work with those customers to make sure that they are successfully, that they remain as successful at loan repayment as they did in the rehabilitation process.","Our delinquency rates per rehab accounts are substantially better than the national averages. And so, some of the statistics and projections quoted in the CFPB report would be much, much higher than what we would see in our own service portfolio.","Michael Tarkan","Understood. Thank you.","Jack Remondi","This really goes to the data-driven approach that we apply to help so these rehab customers would be considered a high risk customer and they are going to get a unique set of treatments and efforts that result, as we said earlier, in higher rates of right party contact so that we can walk them through their options and keep them on track.","Michael Tarkan","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Peter Troisi from Barclays. Your line is open.","Peter Troisi","Just a follow-up on the CFPB, can you just give an update on where things stand with the previous CFPB matter, and even more specifically, what your thoughts are on the recent decision in the PHH versus CFPB case and how that might affect Navient?","Jack Remondi","We have been working with the regulators specific to the facts and circumstances in student loans, and that's really where our focus has been. Our efforts have really been to help, has been to explain what we do that's unique in this space and how that drives higher rates of customer success. And we can see it in the numbers that are published by the Department of Ed in terms of 31% lower delinquency, lower default rates in the federal programs that we service. You can see it in the higher rates of enrolment we have in income-driven repayment plans. 40% of the dollars we service for the Department of Ed for example are in income-driven repayment programs. You see it in overall delinquency rates. Severe delinquency rates for Navient service borrowers are the best in the industry. And it's really, it's those combination of efforts and activities that we're doing is what we're communicating and sharing with regulators to kind of guide some of the direction.","I think most of where you know what they are interested in is helping set better, more uniform standards for servicing federal and private loans, and we certainly are willing to share our best practices, but any new rules or regulations we believe should be industry-wide, and that's the kind of the direction at where things are at this moment.","Operator","And that is the end of the questions. I'll turn the call back over to presenters.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Jacqueline. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. If you have any other follow-up questions, feel free to give me a call. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"15864":["Navient Corp.

My name is Kim and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Navient Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Joe Fisher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference, sir.","Joe Fisher","Good morning and welcome to Navient\u2019s 2015 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO; and Somsak Chivavibul, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations, and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors in the Company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures, we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures, and our GAAP results can be found in the third quarter 2015 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted, along with the earnings press release on the Investors page at navient.com. Thank you.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter\u2019s earnings call. Thank you for listening. I appreciate your interest and your support.","Our results this quarter of $0.48 excluding regulatory expenses, are holding in line with our expectations. They demonstrate the quality of our loan portfolio, the earnings they generate, and our strong capabilities and delinquency in default prevention.","Our provision for private credit loan losses declined to 117 million this quarter, a reduction of 39% from the prior quarter and 10% from the year ago period. For federal education loans we own and service, performance trends continue to improve since the peak of the recession, with Navient delivering results 38% better than our peers. Our results also benefited from our continued expansion into services beyond student loans. Year-to-date, our non-student loan related revenue totaled $75 million, twice the amount earned in the first nine months of 2014.","Gila which we acquired earlier this year as part of our strategy to leverage our asset recovery and business services capabilities has generated a 38% increase in net income year-over-year. In addition to the $8 million in regulatory expense, this quarter\u2019s results also included the impact of $11 million in loan servicing conversion expense, $6 million from the reduction in asset recovery revenue from a change in interpretation of the Department of Education allowed collection fees, and the write-off of $5 million in deferred financing costs as a result of our calling ABS securities.","Today we also completed the acquisition of Xtend Healthcare. This acquisition is consistent with our previously announced intentions. It leverages our core capabilities in the asset recovery and business services area to the attractive healthcare payment sector.","Xtend works with over a 130 hospitals and medical providers to process payments for the large and rapidly growing patient pay marketplace. This transaction provides a footprint in this attractive sector from which we believe we can drive significant organic growth. This transaction will bring value to our shareholders and our franchise will be more accretive than share repurchases even in current market conditions and after the purchase price is cash flow positive. We are delighted to welcome the Xtend team to Navient.","Our business units continued to deliver on the operations front. For example, we successfully completed the conversion of nearly $5 billion in FFELP loans from a third-party servicer platform to our own; our conversion methodology met or exceeded best practices, including robust data mapping and testing, multiple communications prior to and after the conversion to the customer; and a dedicated and especially trained call center team. Our team worked hard to deliver a positive experience for customers. And I\u2019m pleased with rewarding customer feedback.","This past week, we launched a new customer online portal designed to simplify the experience of the customers and improve operating efficiency. We also continued our conversion to a new collections platform that will create flexibility for on-boarding new clients as well as drive lower operating costs. We continue to leverage automation tools to support compliance and consistency while delivering operating efficiency.","In addition, we continue to assist our customers in the successful management of their loans. Last month, the Department of Education released the 2012, three-year cohort default rates. And once again Navient service federal loans defaulted at a significantly lower rate than other borrowers; as I stated earlier, 38% lower.","Our efforts to help customers succeed drive these results we help our customer successfully manage their loans through extensive and targeted outreach efforts to remote affordable payment solutions. For example, nearly one in five borrowers and a third of all dollars serviced are enrolled in income driven repayment plans. We promote repayment options to our 10 million federal loan customers through over a 170 million letters, emails and text each year. And we assisted 345,000 borrowers who paid their loans in full this year.","As you and certainly we as management and fellow shareholders are well aware, several items including industry specific issues are weighing heavily on our stock price and credit spreads. These factors have put limits on our access to new sources of liquidity, particularly new issuance of unsecured notes. Ironically, while the price of our unsecured debt makes it very attractive for us to repurchase, it\u2019s very difficult to find willing sellers.","While these issues have created some uncertainty for our investors, I consider the market reaction to be significantly out of proportion. As a result, I will address the main issues of the legal final maturity date in the current regulatory environment directly. Earlier this year, Moody\u2019s and Fitch placed $34 billion of FFELP ABS on credit watch due to concerns that trust cash flows will not be sufficient to pay all bonds by the legal final maturity date. This concern is based largely on the increased use of income driven repayment programs and other repayment options. While borrowers are in fact using these important options, particularly income driven repayment programs at higher rates, we still expect borrower payments will be sufficient to meet the legal final maturity dates. To provide added assurance, we\u2019ve added call rights on most trusts that allow us to purchase up to 20% of the original balance of student loan sold to the trust.","To help put this issue in perspective of the $34 billion in bonds on credit watch, less than 2.2 billion have a maturity date in the next five years. Even at a 0% prepayment speed, a rate our trusts have never experienced, we expect loan cash flows to be sufficient to meet the maturity dates. Our data show borrower payment did slow with the recovery of the economy and the improvement in the job markets due to a rapidly falling default rates. This is a good thing. Since then borrower prepayment speeds have returned to historical levels and remain at levels that are significantly greater than 0%.","Last week, we released an in-depth loan payment data package including an audio explanation of the slides. And earlier this week, we filed a very detailed response to Moody\u2019s request for comment. We\u2019ll continue to work with the rating agencies to produce the appropriate outcome.","As you know, the CFPB and state agencies have been reviewing our servicing and collections operations. The common public narrative is that the majority of borrowers are struggling with excessive student loan debt. And further if only servicers inform borrowers of the available repayment options, delinquency and defaults would all but disappear. In reality, the vast majority of all borrowers are successfully meeting their payment obligations. And we have assisted more than half of borrowers that we service, covering nearly 70% of balances to select and enroll in an alternative payment program.","At Navient, we\u2019ve developed sophisticated data driven strategies to reach struggling borrowers. When we do connect, more than 9 out of 10 times, we are able to enroll the customer in a program that keeps them out of default. Sadly, over 90% of our borrowers that do reach default do not respond to our hundreds of attempts to contact them. It goes without saying we cannot enroll a borrower in an alternative payment program, if we cannot connect with them.","Some also believe that all borrowers should be enrolled in income driven repayment options. And for some borrowers, enrollment in an income driven payment plan is the right choice. Income driven repayment plans however extend the loan term. As a result for many borrowers, this would significantly increase the total amount paid over the life of the loan. For example, a borrower with $30,000 in loans and a starting salary of $30,000 per year, they would pay 33% more under payee than under the standard repayment term, even though a small portion of the loan would be forgiven after 20 years. For some borrowers, this is just not an attractive alternative.","Finally, there are some concerns that regulatory changes will create significant increases in servicing costs. While we expect regulators to issue standard practices for student loan service in a collection, we believe these standards will establish consistency within the industry and will be beneficial to borrowers and servicers. We would welcome the introduction of standards that are recognized by all of our regulators.","These factors have combined to weigh heavily on our stock price. Many analysts have written that a reasonable discounted value of our stable and predictable cash flows support a stock price north of $20 a share. I agree. Since quarter end, we have purchased 4.7 million shares at an average price of $11.81, bringing our year-to-date purchases to 46.7 million shares at an average price of $17.80. Also since quarter-end, we repurchased 43 million of unsecured debt, mainly at the July 2018 issue.","Our near-term objective is to take advantage of these current market prices. And while we have ample liquidity to service our debt for the next few years, we\u2019re aggressively pursuing options that would allow us to increase our activities in both debt and share repurchases. We have substantial assets available to do so, and I\u2019m confident in our ability to execute here.","For example, we have $5.2 billion in unencumbered student loans, $11.5 billion in net assets in our securitization trusts, and close to $5 billion when servicing cash flows from our securitization trusts.","Bottom-line, our business is sound and is generating the earnings and cash flows we expect. Our student loan assets represent a rock solid foundation of value that we\u2019re well prepared to capture. These assets and our existing operating capabilities will allow us to continue to create value for our investors.","Somsak will now provide more details on the results of the quarter.","Somsak Chivavibul","Thanks Jack. Good morning everyone. During my prepared remarks, I\u2019ll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with slide four, which provides a summary of our core earnings.","In the third quarter, we reported $0.47 of share of core earnings. These results included $0.01 per share or $8 million impact of regulatory related costs and $0.02 per share or $11 million of one-time conversion costs to move nearly $5 billion of FFELP loans to our servicing system.","Our third quarter operating expenses totaled $228 million compared to operating expenses of $195 million a year ago. The increase is related to the cost previously mentioned and additional cost resulting from the recent acquisition of Gila. We expect 2015 core EPS to be approximately $1.85 and operating expenses of less than $900 million. These items do exclude regulatory related costs as well as the impact of the acquisition of Xtend.","And before I go into our segment results, I\u2019d like to highlight the financing activities that took place in the third quarter, on slide five.","In the quarter, we issued a $700 million private loan securitization transaction; the collateral for this transaction was made up of well-seasoned high-quality loans primarily from our SLM 2010-B trust. This transaction resulted in lower cost of funds overall and raised over $70 million of cash after paying off the 2010-B transaction. As Jack mentioned, we submitted our comments addressing the legal final maturity issue to Moody\u2019s earlier this week.","And to help address this issue during the quarter, we funded $852 million of cleanup calls associated with 7 FFELP trusts. Year-to-date, we have funded $1.1 billion of cleanup calls through our FFELP ABCP conduit. And additionally, we amended another 16 trusts to include 10% optional servicer purchase loan.","Our unsecured debt declined by $428 million to less than $16 billion outstanding at quarter end. We maintained a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25 times and purchased an additional $43 million of unsecured debt in October. In the quarter, we repurchased 12.1 million shares for $175 million and have repurchased an additional 4.8 million shares as of October 20th. We have remaining authority of $168 million under our current share repurchase plan as of October 20 although this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position. And we will look for ways to manage the timing of our future cash flows from our student loan portfolio to better match maturity profile of our unsecured debt.","Let\u2019s turn to slide six to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $70 million for the third quarter of 2015 and that compared with $79 million in the third quarter of 2014. For the quarter, FFELP net interest margin was at 81 basis points. And going forward FFELP NIM may be impacted by future LIBOR rates which will impact the amount of floor income in our portfolio. We expect the fourth quarter FFELP net interest margin to remain in the low 80s.","I\u2019m going to move to slide seven to review our private education loans segment. Core earnings in this segment decreased $21 million from a year-ago quarter to $77 million. Third quarter net interest margin came in at 3.77%. The private net interest margin was 6 basis points lower than our expectations, primarily due to a decrease in the spreads between our prime earning assets that were funded with LIBOR based debt. For the fourth quarter, we expect the private student loan net interest margin to be approximately 3.65%. The decrease in our provision for losses of $74 million from the prior quarter is as a result of the additional reserve we booked in the second quarter for a segment of borrowers who exited the firm in 2014 and are experiencing unfavorable credit trends compared to those who exited the firm in previous years.","Slide eight shares our private education loan asset quality trends over the last five years. This is a portfolio that is well-seasoned with 94% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. The third quarter charge-offs were at 2.3% or $10 million lower than the third quarter of last year. Our total delinquency rate was at 7.4% and that\u2019s compared to 7.9% from year ago quarter. Do expect our annualized charge-off rates for the full year to be approximately 2.6%.","Let\u2019s turn to slide nine to review our business services segment. In this segment, the core earnings were $79 million in the quarter compared with $85 million in the third quarter of 2014. We saw an increase in our asset recovery revenues of $20 million versus the prior year. This increase was primarily related to the full integration of Gila which expanded our footprint in the asset recovery and business process outsourcing space. The decline in asset recovery revenues from the prior quarter is written mainly related to three items: First, an expected reduction of volume for student loan collections; second, an expected rate change to our flat unit fee structure associated with the Department of Education collection contract which became effective on July 1; and third, the change in the interpretation of Department of Education which impacted allowed collection fee for FFELP loans that Jack mentioned earlier.","During the quarter, we were awarded the state tax amnesty contract that resulted in an increase in our contingency asset recovery receivable inventory of $5.7 billion. The amnesty program will be conducted from September 15th through November 16th of this year. In the past 10 years, we\u2019ve recovered over $1 billion under similar tax amnesty contracts for states and large municipalities. We expect our asset recovery revenues to be approximately $355 million for 2015.","Finally, turning to GAAP results on slide 10, we recorded third quarter GAAP net income of $237 million or $0.63 per share that\u2019s compared with net income of $359 million or $0.85 per share in the third quarter 2014. And just as a reminder, the primary differences between core earnings and GAAP are the marks related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring or reorganization, and the income associated with SLM BankCo.","With that let\u2019s open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark DeVries from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mark DeVries","Thank you. First question, Jack, with all of the securities in your capital structure trading so cheap, I know you\u2019ve talked about pulling forward cash flows. What\u2019s your appetite here for potentially selling residuals, particularly in private student loans, so you can buy back debt and buy back stock here?","Jack Remondi","Well, we think we have more attractive options available to us to raise liquidity to do both of those things at lower rates and better returns ultimately for shareholders. So, I think selling residuals at this stage in the game is more attractive frankly for us to hold those on our books than it is to sell them and to do financing transactions off of our unencumbered loan portfolios, [indiscernible] overcollateralization in our trust as an example.","Mark DeVries","And what\u2019s your optimism about your ability to do something in the near-term in terms of securitizing some of those unencumbered assets?","Jack Remondi","I am very optimistic about it. I think both of these asset classes, particularly on -- well the unencumbered side of the equation is a well-worn path here in terms of how we get those deals done and an investor base that understands the cash flows and the structure of the deals. So that\u2019s really a function of more the organized time it takes to complete a transaction as you go through the series of mechanisms of rating agency reviews and process et cetera and underwriting the deal. On the overcollateralization, financing against the overcollateralization and the trust, that\u2019s not something that\u2019s been done before but it\u2019s really akin to financing whole loans in a conduit type of facility and something that we are very confident of our ability to pull off here.","Mark DeVries","And should we expect you\u2019re going to be focused more on securitizing your unencumbered private student loans rather than FFELP at this point?","Jack Remondi","Yes.","Mark DeVries","And then how should we think about the use of that cash, would most of that go to smoothing out your debt maturities or will there be some room to buy back stock as well from that?","Jack Remondi","I think a lot of this depends on what you\u2019re actually financing. So to the extent that you\u2019re financing cash flows that you would otherwise expect to be -- that would be financed with our unsecured debt today, clearly those proceeds would go to repurchasing our unsecured debt maturities. Our long-term goal here has been to -- and what we\u2019ve actually accomplished has been to pay down our unsecured debt for the most part but smooth it out. So, we\u2019ve been steady issuers in the unsecured arena over the last several years to flatten out our maturity profile there to better match our cash flows while at the same time we\u2019ve substantially reduced the amount of our unsecured debt outstanding and continue to do so year-to-date in 2015.","To the extent that we\u2019re financing and pulling in future earnings, that\u2019s where you\u2019d really look to creating the capability of enhancing our stock repurchase program.","Mark DeVries","And then finally, just one last question on the private student loan NIM. Could you give us a little better sense of why guidance on that has fallen; what are the moving pieces here that are causing them to come and kind of below previous expectations?","Somsak Chivavibul","The issue on the private NIM is just really more than anything a timing issue, when our asset resets and when -- what our liabilities that fund those assets are tied to. So, there was an expectation there that the prime -- our assets -- two thirds of our private portfolio is tied to the prime rate which as you know has not increased and it\u2019s typically tied to the fed funds rate and meanwhile the underlying LIBOR rates have steadily increased. Once there is an -- I\u2019ll call it an increase in the prime rate, you will see a recovery in that spread between prime and LIBOR.","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it, but you\u2019re just not willing to call for that in the fourth quarter, so you took the NIM there.","Somsak Chivavibul","That\u2019s correct.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. I guess following up on the NIM commentary, switching over to FFELP, I would have thought you\u2019d see a little bit more benefit from some of the cleanup calls. Could you just talk about how much of that is kind of factored into fourth quarter and what other pressures are factored into the FFELP NIM?","Jack Remondi","Well, I do think on the amount of bonds that we acquired in the cleanup call are relatively small percentage compared to the total mix. So that\u2019s a bit of a -- it would be hard to move the entire spread item on that basis. And remember, this quarter, we also -- the NIM, the FFELP NIM would have absorbed $5 million expense resulting from the expensing of the deferred financing costs in the NIM as well.","Somsak Chivavibul","That item effectively reduced the NIM by about 2 basis points, Sanjay.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And so is that going to be ongoing?","Jack Remondi","No, that\u2019s\u2026.","Somsak Chivavibul","That\u2019s a one-time item. And just -- you think about it right, the $852 million of that we call represents less than 1% of our overall FFELP portfolio.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And then I guess looking ahead, as far as the timeline of events of important items, how should we think about what\u2019s on the horizon? I guess we would hear from the CFPB sometime soon. And then maybe if you could just talk about the relevance of Moody\u2019s extending out the comment period to October, when do we get a decision from them; is it a constructive thing that they moved it out to October?","Jack Remondi","So, on the first point of the regulatory items, we have responded to the CFPB\u2019s list of issues and we are now waiting to hear back from them. There is not a specific timeframe for that process, but certainly we\u2019re eager to engage and begin to resolve some of these items. I think it\u2019s important to note that several of the items here on this list are items that were previously covered through other regulatory settlements, particularly with the FDIC. Some items are related to Department of Ed policies and regulations, and to my earlier comments, we and borrowers I think would certainly benefit from a common understanding of regulators of what the rules and program terms and conditions should be. And some we just will continue to work with them are items that we have addressed and changed in prior years, just as we continue to work with customers to make the process of managing their loans easier.","On the legal final maturity date issue, it\u2019s obviously a complicated issue and has lots of moving parts. But at the end of the day, we believe that borrower payments and cash flows coming off the student loan portfolios, while they did slow during that 2008 and 2013 period for lots of various reasons, the activities or the performance in those periods really don\u2019t form a baseline in which one should extrapolate off of. And then if you look at historical norms and that is probably closer to what we\u2019re experiencing today, prepayment speeds for borrower loans are substantially higher than they were during that timeframe. And when you run cash flows and expected borrower behavior off of those numbers, you do get very, very different results.","And so having -- we would certainly rather the rating agencies take more time to evaluate the data and get a more comprehensive understanding of potential cash flows here in borrower behavior than to make a short-term answer or solution. So obviously, we\u2019d like the issue resolved, but it\u2019s certainly better to have it resolved right or appropriately.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Final question, I know you guys talked extensively about how you could sell our assets to buy back stock, but you also mentioned that you want adhere to the tangible net asset ratio of 1.25 times and it\u2019s been hard to repurchase debt. I mean is there anything that would preclude you from exhausting the share buyback or extending it further if you can\u2019t do the debt?","Jack Remondi","No, I mean obviously -- so, our philosophy here and practice has been to as we generate excess capital, both through earnings and through the release of capital from the amortization of our loan portfolios that that would be returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends; I don\u2019t think anything has changed here on that side of the equation. Clearly, the current stock price would encourage us and makes it far more attractive for us to be more aggressive on that front. But that does require the ability to be able to issue in the unsecured markets to be able to smooth out our debt maturities. That\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re very eager to do. We believe that as we address some of the items that investors have, as I said, I would describe them as being out of proportion that you would see credit spreads continue to tighten as we have over the last couple of weeks here and then return to more normalized levels.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Orenbuch","I guess, just a follow-up on that stock buyback question. I guess it kind of looks like you\u2019ve been doing in the neighborhood 60 million a month through the Q3 and I guess a little faster in October, it\u2019s full month yet. I guess what factors, which is -- and I guess probably slightly slower actually in dollars that you were doing previously; is there any constraint in terms of the trading volumes of the stock?","Jack Remondi","No. It\u2019s just really completing the allocation that we had at $1 billion authorization from earlier this year.","Moshe Orenbuch","And you kind of alluded to this in a previous question but I mean how should we think about from the issues related to the CFPB; the fact that perhaps some of the companies that the CFPB has examined and is looking out at this report, haven\u2019t dealt with some of the regulatory bodies that you have? How do you think that influences the process as it goes forward?","Jack Remondi","Well, this is really the first time for us through that with the bureau. So, I think that\u2019s really going to be a wait and see. We feel like we have outstanding controls and practices here to protect borrowers and service their loans appropriately. I think the most important thing we do and the thing that we feel most strongly about is helping customers avoid default and the severe consequences of that that means getting them into repayment programs they can afford. And as the Department of Ed default statistics illustrate here, we do this better than anybody. I mean to take loans that are basically the same across all servicers and deliver a 38% lower default rate, those are the results people are looking for here, right, getting borrowers into programs they can afford. As I mentioned, some folks do believe that income driven repayment is the ultimate solution. What we do is we really work with customers to let them understand the range of options that they have available to them and they get to pick the one that fits their budget best.","And 70% of our dollar volume is enrolled in an alternative payment program which would include everything from income driven repayment solutions to loan consolidation which extends the loan term out. So, these are the solutions that work for our customers and drive the substantially lower default rates. I think that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019ve been working with the regulators in this. And if it means changing some of our practices to be -- to improve outcomes, we\u2019re all-in in that.","Moshe Orenbuch","I mean I was struck by the fact that GAO and their report pointed to the federal government for not advertising some of the repayment options as opposed to the servicers. I don\u2019t know maybe you can kind of put those in the process and kind of round that out little bit.","Jack Remondi","Well, certainly, we would argue here that there is a couple of things that need to happen. I mean certainly encouraging borrowers to contact their servicers is something that we would like to see more of, because when we do contact the customer or connect with them, more than 9 times out of 10, we\u2019re able to resolve that delinquency. And the other big issue here which we\u2019ve talked about before and I have written about is simplification of the program. The share volume and terms of some of these repayment options can be very overwhelming to people who are not dealing with this day to day. It\u2019s hard for them to understand which program produces the best results for them. And if we can simplify them, narrow them, shrink them down into fewer but more simple programs t understand, I think everyone benefits from that.","Moshe Orenbuch","And lastly what I\u2019ve got is, you made a comment that I thought was pretty interesting; you said that the acquisition of Xtend would be better than deploying cash in a share repurchase. Could you just talk a little bit about what the economics are and whether there are other opportunities out there that could be comparable in that fee based area?","Jack Remondi","Well, we have -- sure and that\u2019s right. One of the things that we\u2019ve looked at as we completed the separation is what are our core capabilities and how are those transferable into different areas or different asset classes. And in the asset recovery business services sector, this is an area where we have developed a very, very strong and successful track record of helping our customers manage their cash flows through either asset recovery or business process types of things. And for years, our focus here was on education loans almost exclusively. And we began to develop alternatives, working with state agencies and municipalities. Somsak referenced the state tax amnesty program that we\u2019re running, as an example. We\u2019ve had long standing contracts with a number of cities and states managing their receivables book. And we thought that there are couple of places that we could go to expand our footprint and really put us in a place that we can grow rapidly on an organically basis off of that. Gila, the acquisition of Gila earlier this year was one example of leveraging those skills and capabilities into a broader municipal arena and geographic areas where we were not strong, to begin with; and Xtend does the same thing for us in a new area of healthcare payments.","Our view here was that an acquisition in this space was really necessary for us to bring a resume [ph] to bear and the activities that they do are very, very similar to what we do with other asset classes. And so bringing our scale, our data, sophistication, and strategies to that process is something that we think will allow us to grow those businesses rapidly. And when you look at the opportunity there relatively to share repurchases, that\u2019s where we do our math and understand what we can drive in terms of economics. It\u2019s a better deal for shareholders in our view to allocate that capital to that acquisition than it is to do share repurchases.","I want to be clear, however though that these are small -- relatively small acquisitions that have helped us build the footprint. It\u2019s not -- our strategy is not to buy these businesses through or series of acquisitions, but fill the footprint and grow organically.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors. Your line is open.","Lee Cooperman","I appreciate the call, Jack. It\u2019s really more observations, philosophical rather than a question but they are important to me. I think if my numbers are right that since the spin, we have spent $1.242 billion buying back 69 million shares at average price of 18. And when you increased the repurchase program, I think the response in the Company generally has been that you believe the net asset value is the area of 22 or 23 and that repurchasing to make sense. We agree with that by the way, and number is 23. If we still believe that, we would urge you to find ways of being creative to raise additional funds to double down or triple down. I think you are in sympathy with that, but we would just urge you. There is no better use of shareholder money than buying something back at $0.50 and a $1, particularly in this environment where there is very few things selling at $0.50 and $1. So that\u2019s kind of an advocacy question -- not a question but an advocacy statement.","Second, I noticed recently that a company by name Winthrop Realty announced intention to liquidate. And when I called the CEO -- I was not a shareholder in the company, when I called the CEO, I knew [ph] I asked him what motivated him, he said the thought that the prospect of hidden game of stock to sell at the net asset value that he believed the company had was so remote that he felt the best thing to do is to liquidate the company, return the money to shareholders. And kind of a theme out of that book, you deal with many regulators, some of which have conflicting views. We\u2019re living in with constant criticism and a hostile environment despite the social good you do for the people that borrow money from you. Has the Board considered the advice the ability of liquidating the company by going into runoff to return the money to shareholders, so they can invest in companies that are more appreciated by shareholders or the government? And so that\u2019s the kind of a philosophical question.","And third, your comment, I thought it was very interesting, I have no problem with the Xtend acquisition. Companies cannot repurchase stock to success; you got to grow the business. But when you said that it\u2019s more accretive to stock repurchase, I will probably challenge that because essentially when you buy back stock, you\u2019re probably looking at the earnings per share impact of what earnings you got versus the quest of money et cetera. But in the stock repurchase, you are retiring a 5% dividend and you\u2019re capturing a $9 discount to NAV. And obviously as you retire more shares at $9 discount to NAV then NAV goes up. So, I am not sure you\u2019re calculating correctly the virtue of Xtend versus a stock repurchase, but that\u2019s not a big deal because I think you try to grow the Company. So those are just observations. I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on them, but I mean good luck to you. But we\u2019re very supportive of management. It\u2019s not a complaint, just an observation.","Jack Remondi","Thank you, Lee. We definitely agree with your first point and we are working hard to find those creative alternatives to allow us to do more. And more both in -- two things are on sale here, right, at both the debt end and the share price. And so we\u2019re aggressively working on both of those. And one of the unique parts of our business is if we can finance assets through an ADS transaction, we\u2019re able to raise funds substantially cheaper than our cost of debt in the unsecured arena. So, it\u2019s an easy arbitrage to take advantage of and one that we would like to do, see more of that, same is true on the share repurchase side.","I do want to spend a little bit of time just on your comment about the liquidation issue here. The value or the franchise value of this Company is really anchored in the cash flows coming from the student loan portfolios. And I would say the regulatory issues are coming from our service -- the servicing of student loans. In effect, not because we chose this, it was chosen by Congress, we are liquidating our student loan holdings. They are amortizing portfolio, no new FFELP loans are being created and those loans will -- those portfolios will go to zero over time. And our job is to maximize the earnings of that portfolio. We think we can -- we are doing that and running the operation on that side of the equation. It is frankly not a whole lot different in either kind of alternative structure.","On the servicing side of equation, there is no question that as a business, we do a great job in this space and we deliver value for our customers and tax payers and the results that we generate. If the regulatory environment is not going to allow that business to work can be profitable then it\u2019s not an attractive business. And that is certainly something we would take a look at. We need to work with regulators today to resolve this -- the open issues with the state AGs and CFPB and we are going to do that. And a big part of our strategy is really about driving and producing the results of that all including the regulators are looking for here. So, that\u2019s to be determined opportunity for sure.","Lee Cooperman","I would be willing to take a higher cost temporarily and issuing unsecured debt to buy an asset back at $0.50 and a $1. And the only thing just to keep you seek to the fire little bit and I like you guys, but in the second quarter of 2015, we spent $300 million at 19.76; in the first quarter of 2015, we spent $300 million at 20.52. If we spend $300 million at the -- $600 million at the 20 level, we should be spending $1 billion at this level. That\u2019s all. But easy for me that it is a 20 -- the hindsight is 2020 but we should just find a way of being more aggressive down here because we\u2019re on sale.","Jack Remondi","I agree. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Beardsley with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Eric Beardsley","Just a few follow-up questions on the Xtend acquisition; I guess one, are you going to complete the $1 billion buyback? In other words, are we going to see $225 million on the fourth quarter even with the account [ph] acquisition?","Jack Remondi","Yes. So, the $1 billion buyback is not impacted by this. And as I provided, we have continued to buy back shares since quarter-end, so 4.7 million shares were acquired since quarter-end.","Somsak Chivavibul","We\u2019ve got $168 million of remaining authority left there as of yesterday.","Eric Beardsley","Got it, and then what level of OpEx should we expect following the acquisition? I know you\u2019re originally guiding to somewhere on a $50 million reduction OpEx next year of the 2Q run rate that was getting somewhere at $850 million. I guess how much growth from this deal will we see?","Somsak Chivavibul","At this -- for the fourth quarter, we are going to be taking on some acquisition costs that will --upfront acquisition costs and integration costs that we will have to expense in the fourth quarter. But your just for that particular transaction, it\u2019s early at this stage in the game but it wouldn\u2019t shock me to see additional expenses in the $15 million range.","Eric Beardsley","In the 50?","Somsak Chivavibul","15.","Eric Beardsley","Okay. So, run rate OpEx annually going $15 million, and I think the presentation mentioned\u2026","Somsak Chivavibul","We expect -- let\u2019s be careful. We do expect -- it\u2019s a little early at this point to the extent we can grow that business organically, you will see decreasing expenses as well as associated revenues going forward.","Eric Beardsley","So, if I am looking at the presentation correctly mentioned $70 million of revenue. So, I mean is that coming right into the collections line?","Somsak Chivavibul","It would be part of the asset recovery revenues line. And remember, the guidance I provided, does not include the impact of Xtend, just as a clarification.","Eric Beardsley","So the 355 million for the year did not include any Xtend revenue?","Somsak Chivavibul","Right.","Eric Beardsley","Okay. So, if we were to assume maybe you get 10 million, 15 million or so coming in the fourth quarter from that?","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes. So, the expectation is the impact of Xtend for the fourth quarter is going to be the de minimis to the bottom-line.","Eric Beardsley","So $70 million of revenue, $15 million of OpEx with some growth from organic, is that all in the right way to think about it?","Somsak Chivavibul","Remember 70 is an annual amount.","Eric Beardsley","And the 15 million of OpEx was quarterly or is that annual as well?","Somsak Chivavibul","Quarterly.","Eric Beardsley","Quarterly, okay; so 60 million. Got it, okay. And then I guess where would you need to see the unsecured debt tightened to before you issued?","Jack Remondi","I think the issue here is more about a functioning marketplace. I think investors are looking for some clarity in the process and there\u2019re couple of tools that we have available to us that we think will tighten spreads here that are cheaper for us to pursue opportunities to finance off of our assets than it is to finance in the unsecured and both produce the same net proceed types of things.","And once we can demonstrate that and do it, I think the unsecured spread tighten again. Our goal here, as I said earlier, is to spread those maturities out. So, we would -- we all else being equal, we plan to be an issuer in the unsecured arena. And the sooner those spreads can return to a level that we think is more appropriate, definitely we\u2019d be back in the marketplace.","Eric Beardsley","I was just curious in terms of what you feel some more appropriate level and there is a certain range. I mean your unsecured debt expense with swaps is somewhere around 4% today; I think your weighted average coupon is like 6.2 or so. I mean do you need to see it get back down to that level or are you comfortable taking on some incremental funding costs here?","Jack Remondi","We\u2019d certainly -- we\u2019re not -- to capture the opportunities that are embedded in our debt and stock price does not mean we are looking for perfection on the cost of fund side.","Somsak Chivavibul","I think we also got to look at sort of where -- what the relative cost of funds of other sources of financing would be too, and that will be part of the equation.","Eric Beardsley","And your 1.85 guidance, that doesn\u2019t include any debt tender cost, does it?","Somsak Chivavibul","It does not.","Eric Beardsley","Is there anything else baked in there in terms of non-run rate that we should aware of?","Somsak Chivavibul","No, there is no non-run rate numbers in the 1.85 other than the impact of Xtend and any regulatory related items.","Eric Beardsley","And then just lastly, I guess we\u2019re still yet to see the final terms of what the repay program will look like. Is your expectation that that\u2019ll be open to the FFELP program? And if not, would you expect seeing any consolidation of loans at a FFELP into the direct loan program for that?","Jack Remondi","So, re-payee is an expansion as yet another income driven repayment solution. And the primary benefit of this program is going to be the customers who are new to repayment. So, there are income-driven repayment options available under FFELP. We certainly would see -- expect to see some accounts consolidate into direct lending to capture that program, but the benefits of it are not. If you\u2019ve been paying your loan for five years, you are far better off working through the repayment options available to you in FFELP than you would be to start over again and repay.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.","Sameer Gokhale","Thank you. It just seems apparent to me that you guys don\u2019t have a cash flow issue, but it\u2019s the timing of cash flow concern that the unsecured market seem to have. And I know Jack you talked about this earlier, there are several things that seem to have come together all at one-time from a headline perspective that I think made perhaps bondholders nervous and also some stockholders nervous explaining to sell off. And it seems like to a certain extent when the bond spreads are widened out, that\u2019s also resulted in the kind of cycle where the stock has sold off as well just because people wonder the bond market in nervous then we should nervous as well. So, I was just curious in terms of trying to figure out the famous events going forward. I mean clearly we find out from Moody\u2019s what their thinking is, but you\u2019ve given announced that showing pretty fairly that you have the cash flows to comfortably meet the legal maturity dates and also cash flows over time to meet your unsecured debt maturities and yet now that seems to matter.","So, what are you serious about, to ask question is a little bit differently from what Lee was asking earlier, rather than going to liquidation. In your discussions with fixed income investors, is a concern here in the widening of credit spreads for you guys more a function of some concern that you might split the company up in different sort of servicing and asset management business such that try to spread -- that would be spread widening; is there a concern that maybe you take the company private, given all the headline risks that are out there? Is that something you would contemplate; is this we how sort of get your thinking around that because something here doesn\u2019t seem to add up? So, just your thoughts would be helpful there. Thank you.","Jack Remondi","Well, first of all, I think the items that were on the table both the legal final maturity and the regulatory stuff create but the outcome is unclear that uncertainty creates the opportunity for the events that you just described to happen. Some of those were certainly interpreted by some, incorrectly. So there was a view earlier on that early in the process that the legal final maturity date issue would cause us to span liquidity that would otherwise be used to service our unsecured debt to clean up those asset backhauls. I think we\u2019ve clearly explained that that is not the case, as an example. And as we\u2019ve kind of responded to some of the theses here and items I think you\u2019ve seen both our credit spreads tightened and our stock price improve.","Our goal and objective is of course to produce the outcomes that -- make sure people understanding the outcomes that are likely to occur here. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working on, on both the legal final maturity and the regulatory cost side of the equation. But we do need those items to resolve before I think you get back to completely normal. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, one of the challenges we\u2019re facing is even though, it\u2019s attractive for us to buy back debt, it\u2019s difficult for us to get any kind of meaningful volume here. And that I think tells you a little bit about how the fixed income investors are; they see the same value that we do and if we\u2019re unwilling to sell.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Hammond with Bank of America. Your line is open. ","Mark Hammond","Thanks for taking my call. So with the acquisition of Xtend, I was curious does this introduce a new regulatory body overseeing Navient?","Jack Remondi","No, I don\u2019t believe so. I mean most of what we\u2019re doing in these types of businesses is more of a business process activity. So, in this case, it would be presentment of the resolution of the payment for the medical services and not a -- we\u2019re not participating in a pure collections related business activity here. But even if we were, that would be similar to the same rules and regulations that we\u2019re governed in other areas of our collections or asset recovery businesses.","Mark Hammond","And then turning to the debt side, could you give also the debt maturity and buyback activity you\u2019ve completed during the quarter? And then in 4Q so far, I think the 8.45s of \u201818 were mentioned and then 3.875 also matured during the quarter, just want some clarity on that?","Somsak Chivavibul","So the quarter\u2019s activity was all really due to maturities. The $43 million that we bought during October, Mark, really were mostly coming out of the June \u201818, maturity bucket.","Mark Hammond","Okay. So of \u201818\u2019s, it was 43. And then\u2026","Somsak Chivavibul","The most of that.","Mark Hammond","Most of that. Okay. The 8 million of regulatory related costs, is that does any way related to the CFPB NORA notice Navient received or is that a different 8 million cost?","Jack Remondi","So we have -- there have been a number of regulatory inquiries, both our service and in collections business from a couple of different parties. And as part of that process, there is an extensive amount of data and analysis that was required to be done and delivered just -- and so setting up that information, put it into data storage, doing the analytics work, legal related items is what it all comprises. The biggest part is on gathering the data and analyzing and storing it, then it is say legal fees. But it\u2019s comprehensive against all of the inquiries.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Tarkan with Compass Point. Your line is open.","Michael Tarkan","Most of my questions have been answered, but just from a modeling perspective; couple of numbers were thrown around Xtend; I just want to make sure I\u2019m clear. So 70 million run-rate revenue and 60 million of annual OpEx; is that fair assuming no growth which I know is not the case, but is that just a starting point?","Somsak Chivavibul","So the $15 million I quoted, Mike that does include some, I\u2019ll call upfront transaction and integration costs. So pick that whatever is worth. But just as a starting point for modeling purposes, you can probably use that as a starting point, I think it would be okay.","Michael Tarkan","And then just last one from me. On the projected cash flows, are you factoring in any degree of higher servicing costs in those numbers at this point, or is it just still sort of how you were modeling it before? Thank you.","Somsak Chivavibul","Mike, are you talking about the life of loan cash flows of close to $33 billion that we have in the appendix?","Michael Tarkan","That\u2019s right.","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes, those are gross cash flows, so they are -- those are cash flows before any service and cost.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to presenters.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Kim. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call.

My name is Kareena and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Navient Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Joe Fisher, you may begin your conference.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Kareena. Good morning and welcome to Navient's 2016 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO; and Somsak Chivavibul, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the company's Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures, we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the second quarter 2016 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted on the Investor's page at navient.com.","Thank you. Now, I will turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks Joe. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.","I'm happy to share my thoughts on this quarter's results which are quite good and are a tangible example of the value our company can create. I will take the next few minutes to provide some color on our performance this quarter, the progress we have made on new funding and discuss new business opportunities we are seeing including the Department of Education servicing contract.","Our financial results this quarter were very good and better than planned. They reflect the efforts we have made in credit, funding and operating efficiency. The result we earned an adjusted $0.48 in core earnings for the quarter. Key contributors included private credit loan performance, revenue growth in our non-education business services and operating expense control. While the rhetoric complies student loan delinquencies and defaults are raising, I'm happy to report our customers are continuing to experience very different and positive trends. While some borrowers are struggling, overall delinquency and default rates for the federal and private loans we service are at some of the lowest level since before the financial crisis.","For examples, for federal loans we service we tracked the performance of recent graduates six months after they first enter repayment following their grace period. For the class of 2015, 7% of borrowers were more than 90 days past due after six months in repayment. Three times lower than the class of 2010. It's also 22% lower than the class of 2014. This is very good news. I'd also encourage those who are having difficulty making payments to contact us. We have solutions that can help.","For our private loan portfolio, charge-off this quarter totaled $127 million, 29% lower than the year-ago quarter. We saw a similar improvement in loans more than 90 days past due. The balance here declined by 22% to $668 million at quarter end. Our charge-off in 90-plus delinquency rates fell to 2.2% and 2.9% respectively, the lowest level since before the financial crisis. As a result of the steady and significant improvement in credit performance, our provision for private loan losses this quarter declined to $100 million from $104 million in the first quarter and from $191 million in the year-ago period. Our data points to a continuation of these positive trends.","Our total fee income for the quarter was $176 million with our non-education loan related revenue totaling $49 million. We continue to see strong growth and good opportunities to grow our business services outside of student loans. Leveraging our skills and infrastructure to grow this segment of our business will continue to be an area of focus for us.","Last year, we launched several initiatives to improve our operating efficiency, excluding newly acquired entities expenses fell 8% as we benefited from efforts to improve efficiency in the conversion of third party service loans to our platform. In addition to the strong financial results, we continue to demonstrate the breadth of our access to funding.","During the quarter we completed a $478 million private loan ABS repurchase facility, issued three FFELP term ABS transactions for 1.8 billion, extended our private education loan conduit facility for another year and repurchased or retired $255 million in unsecured debt.","Driven by our cash flows in the past 12 months we have repurchased or retired 2.4 billion in unsecured notes with original maturities in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. We continue to work with the rating agencies as they implement the new cash flow assumptions for term FFELP ABS transactions. While some progress has been made, the pace is much slower and the results much less than we would have hoped. Nonetheless, earlier this year, we decided to move forward and we have successfully returned to the term FFELP ABS market.","Year-to-date we've completed four deals using different structures and funding all loan types, including our first bond backed exclusively by federal rehabilitation loans. Most importantly, investor participation has been growing and funding spread is improving with each deal. Our liquidity profile is very strong and improving in addition to our demonstration of consistent access to a variety of funding sources, we closed the quarter with cash in unencumbered FFELP loans well in excess of the next 18 months of debt maturities.","Our student loan portfolio continues to generate sizable cash flow consistent with our projections. And finally, we still plan to return to the unsecured markets in the second half of this year as we look to smooth out our near-term debt maturities. As I mentioned, we continued to pursue new business opportunities. This quarter we acquired 646 million in student loans, including 23 million in private loans. We also added new contracts in our business services, asset recovery and health care business lines.","The outlook for future portfolio purchases looks promising and I remain bullish in our ability to organically grow our non-education loan business services. Of course, one of the largest business opportunities is the proposed Department of Education loan servicing contract. We were pleased to be chosen along with two others to participate in the next round of this RFP. Secretary King recently wrote about the key skills the Department of Ed is looking for here. I believe our demonstrated track record of scale, efficiency and customer outcomes, including income driven repayment plan enrollment and of course default prevention match up well to these requirements.","For example, for Department of Education service borrowers, if all large services achieved our default prevention results, 300,000 fewer borrowers would have defaulted in 2015. In short, we make a difference, a huge difference where it matters most. We look forward to learning more about this opportunity when the next round of the RFP is issued.","Finally, we've continued to deliver value to our investors through our return of excess capital. In addition to our $0.16 quarterly dividend, during the quarter we purchased 13.6 million shares at an average cost of $12.90 a share, well below our view of the intrinsic value per share. Year-to-date, we have purchased 32.8 million shares reducing our overall share count by 9%. While our stock price is up significantly from it lows earlier this year, it still does not reflect our estimate of the intrinsic value of this company. I believe our strong financial results and accomplishment this quarter demonstrate our commitment and our ability to preserve and create value for our investors.","And I'll ask Zack to provide a deeper look at our financial results and I look forward to taking your questions later. Zack?","Zack Chivavibul","Thanks Jack. Good morning everyone.","During my prepared remarks, I will review the solid second quarter results that we reported last night before highlighting our recent financing activities. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available on the company's Web Site beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.","In the second quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.48 which exclude $0.01 per share of regulatory related costs during the quarter. Our second quarter adjusted core operating expenses totaled $226 million that's compared to $221 million from a year ago. The increase is primarily related to the additional operating costs of the Gila and Xtend Healthcare acquisitions. Excluding the expenses associated with these 2015 acquisitions, operating expenses were 8% lower than a year ago.","Based on the results through the first half of 2016, we are on pace to beat our operating expense guidance of $930 million for 2016. I also expect us to be on the higher end of our previously issued 2016 core EPS guidance of $1.82 to $1.87.","Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $68 million in the second quarter 2016 compared with $93 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFELP core earnings which primarily result the increase recover expectations that occurred in the second quarter of last year. The FFELP managers margin improved to 85 basis points in the quarter, which came in at a high end of our expectations. And during the quarter, we hedged an additional $205 million of core income bringing our future hedge floor income to $1.1 billion.","For the full year, we expect our FFELP net interest margin to be in the low to mid-80s. In the quarter, we acquired $623 million of FFELP student loans bringing our year-to-date total FFELP acquisitions to $2.2 billion.","Let's turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loan segment results. Core earnings in this segment increased $35 million from year-ago quarter to $57 million. Our provision for losses continued to improve as a result of the overall improvement in credit quality, delinquencies and charge-off trends. In the quarter, the net interest margin came in at 350 basis points. We expect NIM for the full year to be in the mid-340s. The private net interest margin continues to be impacted by the timing of when our prime based asset reset versus when our LIBOR based debt resets. This is a result of the anticipated rate hikes that have not materialized.","Since the last prime reset, LIBOR has increased without a corresponding increase in the prime rate. And we're projecting a higher LIBOR cost of funds for the second half of the year without any increase in the prime rate. In addition we've also seen a slight balance increase in programs that temporarily reduce monthly payments through a reduction in interest rate versus a decline in our overall private education loan balance. Charge-offs declined $52 million or 29% from the prior year and loans greater than 90 days delinquent have decreased by $184 million or 22%. Improved performance demonstrate the strong and improving credit quality of our portfolio.","Slide 7 highlights some of these improvement trends that we've seen over the last five years. Our second quarter charge-off rate fell to 2.2% and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.1%. And the chart on the bottom of the slide demonstrates the benefits our improved performance is having on our borrower FICO scores. FICO scores have improved by 36 points for our non-traditional loans and 24 points for our entire portfolio on average over the last five years. And we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this area.","Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter compared with $91 million in the second quarter 2015. The decrease was primarily related to the expected decline in education loan related revenues. Our non-education loan-related asset recovery revenues increased by $23 million from the year ago to $49 million. The increase in revenues is primarily related to the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015. Overall, we continue to expect our consolidated business services revenue to fall between $620 million and $650 million for the full year.","Let's move to Slide 9 to highlight our financing activities that took place in the second quarter. During the quarter, we issued three FFELP asset backed securities totaling $1.8 billion in bonds. From 2016 to our first ABS transaction during the quarter to 2016-3 our second ABS transactions during the quarter which saw three things. One, the size of the issuance increased by $264 million. Two, we saw pricing improve by 13 basis points. And three, the number of investors increased from 18 to 26.","Our third issuance during the quarter, 2016-4 was the first time we issued the securitization made entirely of rehabilitated FFELP loans. These three transactions during the quarter demonstrate the increased demand for federally guaranteed paper and investors' willingness to participate in this market. We believe the assumptions in Moody's methodology that were recently released for divergent from actual loan performance and are well beyond what we expect to see. While we continue to wait for Moody's and Fitch to provide final ratings outcome, we've been actively extending the legal final maturity dates on previously issued bonds.","In total, we have now extended the legal final maturity date on $6.8 million of bonds. In the quarter, we extended our private education loan ABCP facility by another year. We lowered the maximum financing to $750 million and currently have available capacity of $388 million. The facility extension and funding costs are consistent with our plan. And as we've discussed on our prior earnings call, we increased our existing private education loan repurchase facility by an additional $478 million during the quarter. The proceeds from this transaction were used to pay down all unsecured debt.","We reduced our unsecured debt by $255 million during the quarter to under $14 billion outstanding at quarter end. $219 million of this reduction came through repurchases in the open market. At the same time, the balance of our cash and unencumbered FFELP assets increased by nearly $400 million during the quarter. Today our cash and unencumbered FFELP loans are in excess of the next 18 months of debt maturities.","In the quarter, we've repurchased 13.6 million shares for $175 million at an average price of $12.90. And at quarter-end we have remaining authority of $380 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio 1.25.","Finally, turning to our GAAP results on Slide 10, we recorded second quarter GAAP net income of $125 million or $0.38 per share compared with net income of $182 million or $0.47 per share in the second quarter 2015. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the months related to our derivative positions, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM Bank.","With that, I will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark DeVries from Barclays. Your line is open.","Mark DeVries","Thank you. Yes. Thanks for the color around the funding. I think you indicated at least the second deal of the year was 13 basis points inside of the prior one. Could you give us a little more context on kind of where you are today relative to where you were let's say prior to when the funding markets really started to widen out late last year and also kind of where you are relative to your average funding costs?","Zack Chivavibul","So prior to the legal final maturity issue, we were probably issuing ABS at somewhere around LIBOR plus 75.","Mark DeVries","Okay. And today where's that?","Zack Chivavibul","Today, well, we've seen -- depends on the assets, the mix of the FFELP assets that are being securitized. But, we are seeing pricing improve every day on that. But, if we were to go through and do another deal as an example, we are looking at another rehab deal, but we would expect spreads to come in tighter than our previous deal.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Got it. And I think Jack indicated you're still planning to issue unsecured debt in the back half of the year. Do you have a sense for kind of where you might be able to issue when you do that and would that be kind of -- and where would that be relative to your kind of blended unsecured funding costs right now?","Zack Chivavibul","So today are indicative if you look at a five-year issuance, the fixed rate that we would issue, it would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 7.25% for a 5-year issuance. That's before taking into account any new issuance concession that might be taken into account. And certainly it is more -- historically more expensive than the debt that's rolling off, but that's all embedded in the spread guidance that have been provided for both FFELP and private credit.","Mark DeVries","Got it. Thanks. And then, just turning to private student loan credit, just curious what your thoughts are on, if we did go into a recession how might that perform given how -- how seasoned that book is at this point?","Jack Remondi","I think that's the keyword there is seasoned. So our customers are well beyond their in-school periods or in the beginning of their careers, and if we lay out those statistics for you in the earnings presentation, show how it's migrating into how many months of repayment they've been in. Historically the volatility as customers season is much, much lower compared to new to repayment customers, but you're also starting off from rates that are significantly -- that volatility is measured off rates that are significantly lower than what you would see in year one of repayment. So those are very positive trends.","I would just point out here that the -- the statistical data that is in existence, for student loans whether they be federal or private is really driven by whether or not the student graduates and is the biggest factor and we definitely had some exposure points in our private loan portfolio coming out of or going into the financial crisis of borrowers who did not earn their degrees, but what's left in the portfolio today is a portfolio that has a demonstrated track record of performance and we would expect that to be less susceptible to economic swings.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. The securitization of the rehab loans, you mentioned that you could do another one. How much liquidity could be able to securitize those loans kind of add?","Zack Chivavibul","Well, we did about a $0.5 billion in that first rehab loan we did, but I think we are looking to do at least that much on the second deal this stage of the game.","Jack Remondi","Most of our FFELP activity, though, comes out of our conduit facilities, Moshe, so you don't -- they're not -- it's converting from short-term fundings versus the permanent funding sources versus a source of liquidity.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. And kind of relating that as well as the better spreads on FFELP, could you just talk a little bit about on FFELP securitizations, could you talk a little bit about whether -- at what point you think it gets to where there's the opportunity for more FFELP sales from banks and others?","Jack Remondi","So I think we're actually -- as I said, the outlook is quite promising on that front and I think it's driven by a combination of factors including funding, regulatory and servicing-related issues. So we are having more dialogue with more institutions on this -- on this front already and no decisions or processes have kind of started but the direction of the talks and discussions is quite positive.","Moshe Orenbuch","And, Jack, just to follow up on what you had said in terms of servicing standards, any kind of update that you can kind of give us there in terms of how that process is developing.","Jack Remondi","On the regulatory side?","Moshe Orenbuch","On the regulatory side, yes.","Jack Remondi","So we continue to have an active engagement with regulator here, which are both the federal and state-based regulators. A lot of our activity is still around, the processes we use, why customers do and require certain types of transactions over others in different time frames. So one good example is forbearance, I think there's then folks who have thought that forbearance is used more heavily over income-driven repayment. And the reality is, this is about 70% of our customers who go into income-driven repayment need some form of forbearance before they are effectively enrolled in that program as an example, they need a forbearance to bring their account current or they need a forbearance to give them the time to complete the forms that are required to enroll.","So, the dialogue, I think, has been positive, and hopefully, we're providing more insight for them to understand the different activities and actions that are -- that we perform here. I do think at the end of the day, our greatest strength is our ability to work with customers, identify at risk customers and develop strategies that result in higher rates of right party contact so that they default at lower rates.","When we connect with a customer, nine times -- a delinquent customer, nine times out of ten we're able to cure that delinquency. And as I said, if everyone performed at our default prevention measures, 300,000 fewer federal borrowers would have defaulted in 2015. That's no small difference there of course.","Moshe Orenbuch","Do they think that they're helping the process of borrowers accepting that contact?","Jack Remondi","Well, so they -- I think a couple of positive things have come out. Treasury who's been running a pilot project on default collections work recently issued a report on their results, and they -- they were substantially below private sector collection efforts overall. But, what they pointed out is something that we have been saying for quite some time is that contact is key to resolving this and that contact is hard. When you are calling a delinquent borrower, it takes a concerted effort and very distinct strategies to improve connection rates.","If you just do a kind of a mass one size fits all approach, you're going to get default prevention results that I think you see throughout the industry versus the ones that Navient's able to produce. So they -- I do think there's a greater awareness here of that graduation is key, that contact is important and strategies to create higher right party contact rates, combined together produce the best results.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks very much.","Jack Remondi","You saw that in the treasury report as I said and even in the White House report that was issued this week.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lee Cooperman from Omega Advisors. Your line is open.","Lee Cooperman","Thank you. Hope you can hear me. I'm using my cell phone in Utah. Can you hear me Jack?","Jack Remondi","Yes, we can, Lee. Good morning.","Lee Cooperman","Good, good, congratulations on a good quarter. You've kind of touched on my questions but I want to see if I can get you to even be more specific. I think a quarter or two ago you opened up the call very directly, very forthrightly saying, we've been questioned about our stock repurchase activity. The reason we're as aggressive as we are is we agree with those analysts that have a valuation in the high teens if in fact not in the low 20s. We think we're creating great value for our shareholders by buying back shares. In terms of specificity, do you still have a view of value in the high teens low 20s?","Jack Remondi","Well, actually, as you have I think pointed out before Lee is that when we're buying shares at $12.90 and buying back 90% of the shares we actually increase that value to me and shareholders. So, get values higher.","Lee Cooperman","And I assume that the 380 million that's left on the program assuming the stock is in approximately the same area would be used this year?","Jack Remondi","That's correct. That is our plan.","Lee Cooperman","Okay. Now without getting you into an earnings forecast, but just looking at your cash flow models in 2017, would we be able to continue assuming the stock remains on the value to buy back meaningful shares in 2017?","Jack Remondi","So our share repurchase program is very much based on the cash flow that we generate and the equity value or the retained earnings that the business generates. And certainly as the portfolio amortizes it, it comes down a little bit. But, yes, we would expect that that process, barring of course opportunities, to acquire portfolios of loans that might deploy some of that capital at higher returns, we would expect to be a return of capital similar to levels that we've done in the past or similar to our earnings structure as we've done in the past.","Lee Cooperman","Thank you very much. Again, congratulations on a good quarter.","Jack Remondi","All right. Thanks, Lee.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Beardsley from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Eric Beardsley","Hi, thank you. Just wanted to clarify the private loan NIM guidance. Is that mid-340s for the full year?","Zack Chivavibul","Yes, it is.","Eric Beardsley","Okay. So I guess given where we've already come for the first half, does that imply we should expect low 340 or even high 330s for the second half of the year.","Zack Chivavibul","Yes. Probably be closer to the low 340s area Eric, obviously it just all depending on whether the prime rate really resets or increases or not towards the second half of the year.","Eric Beardsley","Got it. And then, I guess just as we think about the buyback going forward, how much unsecured debt issuance do you think you need to do in the second half of this year or the first half of 2017 to maintain at these levels of earnings and also the capital release?","Jack Remondi","We have very modest needs and what our goal here is and what you'd expect to see, again, barring any portfolio acquisitions is that our total amount of unsecured debt would be declining, and any issuance here would be replacing, near-term debt maturities in 2018, 2019, 2020 type timeframes to smooth out the maturities more consistent with the expected cash flows of the portfolio. That is the goal and the driver, so the net financing needs here are very -- are relatively modest.","Eric Beardsley","Got it. Is there a way to size that? I mean would you be looking to do something like $500 million this year and then maybe another $1 billion next year or is there a good way for us to think about that?","Jack Remondi","I think this year is probably a good number and next year we'll have to -- a lot of this will depend, of course, on how successful we are in repurchasing unsecured debt in the open market.","Eric Beardsley","Got it. Great. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Yes, thank you. Good morning. Just following up on that private student loan NIM question, is there any way to hedge to kind of strip out the basis risk between LIBOR and prime? Because it seems like if, we're in this environment where we're speculating rates might continue to go up you might have that mismatch and subsequent impact to NIM?","Zack Chivavibul","Sanjay we've looked at this before. You've got to realize, right, is that as rates have declined our private NIM has benefited, from that characteristics. And unfortunately, as rates started increasing, we've seen the spread, just work the opposite way here. We have looked at trying to hedge this position before, but it's seen that the cost of doing this hedge was just too expensive for us to take on.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay.","Jack Remondi","That's one of the reasons why we moved our -- when we were back as an originator, we converted our index on new loans to LIBOR from prime.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And where do we stand in terms of the mix between LIBOR and prime on the asset side?","Zack Chivavibul","So about 60% of our portfolio today is linked to prime.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Got it. And then, this servicing RFP, what's the time line on this and is the DOE expected to manage the entire process or will there be another party involved?","Jack Remondi","So the Department of Ed indicated that originally that their intent was to have this RFP wrapped up and signed by the end of the year. The original indication was that round two's RFP would have been issued sometime in July, so we're probably a little running a week or two behind on that schedule right now. And they would manage it under the proposed terms, although they have indicated that a number of different entities would be involved in the evaluation or have, some participation in the decision-making process.","The contract terms themselves are not -- the round one was really an evaluation of capabilities unless a specific set of criteria of requirements for the final contract. So we'll -- we're eagerly awaiting the next round's RFP here.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And just to be clear, it's all or none so to the extent you guys aren't a part of this relationship going forward, you lose your existing business?","Jack Remondi","So this is conversation and comments from the Department of Ed officials over the last couple of weeks have indicated that this is more of a systems RFP, so they're looking to pick a single platform for a common customer experience and branding approach but that they would use multiple entities to do the call center, customer service activities associated with the volume.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. Got it. So when we think about the economic impact it's probably a subset of what you're making on the servicing you're doing today?","Jack Remondi","I think we really need to see the next round before we know exactly what the potential is positive or otherwise.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Got it. And final question just on the collections part of that RFP on collections, where are we on that?","Jack Remondi","So those proposals have been submitted and sometime this fall is the anticipated timeframe.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Jack Remondi","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hammond from BofA Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Mark Hammond","Thank you. Good morning. So on a slide presentation at a conference back in May, you wrote that a meaningful growth opportunity was in business processing is portfolio management. Would you provide some details around what that means?","Jack Remondi","Sure. Our portfolio management business is a service that we have provided to primarily to federal guarantors in the student loan arena. And in that business we manage the book of default receivables for the entity but don't actually do the collections related work. So we would allocate the business to various collection agencies. We monitor it. We capture all the data, report it back to the owner of the receivables. We monitor compliance, et cetera. And one of the things that we've done very effectively in that business is drive higher performance levels.","So our guarantor customers in that business, I think we have about 6 guarantors who run through that business today are in the top 8 of collection results in the country, and in instances -- in some instances we've signed new guarantors who have been near the bottom and have taken them and sometimes using the exact same -- some of the same collection agencies they've been working within the past and have driven them up into the top 10 arena. It's a very effective business model and we believe it has applications outside of the education arena. We've just begun to sign some clients up in that space and do some work in that area.","Mark Hammond","Thanks. And then regarding some financing transactions, since you bought back 250 million of bonds during the quarter in the private residual or purchase facility during the quarter raised to 478 million, I was wondering what the use of the remaining 223 million of proceeds was used for specifically.","Jack Remondi","Well, Zack indicated our cash balances are higher.","Zack Chivavibul","Higher, yes.","JackRemondi","And that's primarily, where it's been. Our big challenge when we raise liquidity and funding outside of actual debt maturities is to be able to buy back bonds in the marketplace. So despite, trading levels and spreads that we think are high, our investor base thinks they're high, too, so they like them and have been unwilling to be sellers in size. So that's been the biggest challenge here.","ZackChivavibul","Yes. And I'll note that the repurchases that we took on during the quarter did not result in any meaningful gain or loss on those repurchases.","Mark Hammond","Great. And then my last question was broadly with the self-rating agency issue, I was wondering is there a number following the additional amount that was put on review for FFELP ABS that's on review by at least one of the agencies, a round number?","ZackChivavibul","So the amount of bonds that are under review that Navient or Navient-sponsored bonds is over $56 billion by Moody's and I believe the end number of bonds under review by Fitch is about $52 billion.","Mark Hammond","Thanks Zack. That's all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Shane from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Rick Shane","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Look, you -- the credit statistics are very compelling and you've walked through them both on the FFELP and private loan side. I am curious, we're starting to see in most other asset classes a trough in credit and perhaps even an inflection and your credit trends continue to get better. I'm curious what you would attribute that to. It doesn't look like it's a FICO issue per se. What are the factors, is it exogenous or is it something you're doing internally at this point?","Jack Remondi","I think it's a couple of things. One is seasoning is clearly a particular benefit, so the further one borrower, particularly a student loan borrower seasons they're more entrenched in their career, their income starts to increase and you have much, much better performance. For both federal and more recently originated private loans we're also benefiting from the fact that a higher percentage of that volume has been occurring in more traditional student environments those kids going to four-year schools. You've seen a significant reduction, for example, in volume at for-profit institutions.","And I do think there's a little bit less occurring on the side of customers recognizing that if they're borrowing for education they should be borrowing for tuition and less for living expenses. So that's perhaps more anecdotal at this stage in the game. But if you look at the 2015 graduating class and that's the most recent graduating class statistics we have, 2016 has less school but their grace period doesn't end until December, January of 2016\/2017. I mean to be 22% better than the year before is -- these -- remember, these are not underwritten loans. These are entitlement loans. So these are borrowers who are benefiting from the economy, benefiting from probably better discipline at the front end of the origination process. And certainly in Navient's case, for Navient service loans they are benefiting from our targeted outreach campaigns that put us in contact with those borrowers before they become severely delinquent.","Rick Shane","Got it. It sound like a lot of little things add up to a pretty virtuous trend.","Jack Remondi","Yes.","Rick Shane","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Jack Remondi","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Tarkan from Compass Point. Your line is open.","Michael Tarkan","Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But, I do have a couple of modeling ones. Just on FFELP NIM, I know you mentioned you have taken the load to mid-80s but I think it normally trends up in the back half of the year. I guess I'm just wondering do you still expect that to be the case and anything unusual in the spread this quarter that took it up a little sequentially?","Zack Chivavibul","Yes. This quarter I think we probably benefited a little bit more on the floor positions than past quarters. We did have a situation this quarter where we had some old hedges that were rolling off and new hedges that came on that -- where we picked up additional floor income as old hedges ran off and new hedges came on. I think, going forward the amount of floors will basically dictate what the FFELP NIM for the rest of the year will look like, Mike.","So, I think we're sticking to the low to mid-80s at this stage in the game until we have a little more clarity on where LIBOR rates come in and ultimately what the floors will be on our FFELP portfolio.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. Thanks. And then, on the servicing side, I saw you have 6.2 million borrowers under the current contract; do you have the revenue number associated with the contract this quarter?","Zack Chivavibul","Probably somewhere around 100 and --","Jack Remondi","I think it was flat from the previous quarter, Mike.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. And then, lastly just as you think about sort of the two, fee income lines I would call it, just the servicing line and the asset recovery lines, this quarter and we saw a decline on the servicing side and a pretty decent increase sequentially on the asset recovery side. Should these be the new sort of run rates to think about as we go forward on those [indiscernible]? Thanks.","Jack Remondi","So on the servicing side we benefited in the year-ago quarter from recognition of some higher collection rates on some fees that didn't -- you ran your new baseline. It doesn't cause an increase again. In the asset recovery arena, we have -- or the business services side of the equation, our non-federal, our non-education loan businesses are growing very nicely, and we're still seeing the trail-off of some of the revenue sides from the Department of Ed contract runoff and the legislative changes to the fee schedule. So that -- I think this is the last quarter we'll see the impact of the legislative changes to the fee schedule.","Michael Tarkan","Okay.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded.","I will now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Joe Fisher, Head of the Investor Relations. Mr. Fisher you may begin.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Nova. Good morning. And welcome to Navient\u2019s 2019 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO; and Chris Lown, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures, we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the first quarter 2019 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted on the Investors page at navient.com.","With respect to the proxy contest with Canyon Capital we filed our preliminary proxy with the SEC on April 1, 2019 and we would refer you to that if you have any questions on this matter. We would ask that all questions following our prepared remarks focus entirely on the company\u2019s earnings.","Thank you, and now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks Joe. Good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Our results this quarter were particularly strong; they include contributions from our legacy student loan portfolios and growing momentum in our lending and processing businesses.","Importantly, we\u2019re on track to meet or exceed the financial metrics we established for the year and we\u2019re raising full year EPS guidance from the original range of a $1.93 to $2.03 per share to a range of $2.08 to $2.15 per share. This quarter\u2019s result also demonstrates our ongoing ability to increase operating efficiency, maximize cash flows and execute on our capital management plans.","We also show we are delivering on the value creation opportunities in student loan origination and business process services. Let me share some highlights of the quarter. In the first quarter our student loan portfolio is on track to generate over $3 billion of cash flow in 2019, approximately $100 million more than initially forecasted earlier this year.","In addition, we raised over $700 million through financing activity in the quarter. Our ongoing successes in leveraging the over collateralization in our securitization trust are reducing our unsecured borrowing requirements and lowering our interest expense.","Credit performance continues to be a positive in both our FFELP and Private portfolios. We saw significant reductions in delinquencies with the principal balance of loans more than 30 days past due a quarter end declining 25% in FFELP and 11% in private education loans compared to a year ago.","Portfolio performance here is benefiting from the strong economy and the success of our data driven efforts to assist borrowers. We originated over $980 million in re-fi loans in the first quarter. Our product helps borrowers with strong credit and free cash flow, lower the cost of their student loans and pay off their loans faster. Our mobile digital first solution provides a simple application and quick decisioning.","It also allows our customers design a repayment solution customized for their budget and their financial objectives. This nearly doubling the volume from the year ago quarter was combined with higher margins. Our business processing segment generated strong EBITDA margins and 5% growth in revenue. We also added several new clients in the municipal services and healthcare areas demonstrating our strong value proposition. This segment represents an opportunity to leverage our core workflow processing and performance solutions to create value without consuming incremental capital.","Earnings, cash flows and our strong capital ratios allowed us to return a $146 million to investors in the quarter. A $107 million via 9.4 million shares purchased and $39 million in dividends paid. We expect to utilize our remaining $333 million in share repurchase authority in 2019.","A consistent goal for us each year is improving our operating efficiency. Last year comparable operating expenses fell 11%. For the first quarter, comparable operating expenses declined another 9% to $239 million. In achieving these results we delivered improved operating efficiency in all segments and we expect our ongoing operating efficiency efforts to produce continued company-wide improvements in this important financial measure.","Earlier this month, we launched a new education finance loan for undergraduate and graduate students. This product helps students and families finance the cost of going to college. We leveraged our historical student loan experience along with the innovative technology and user experience developed for our refinanced product to create a more modern user friendly and informative solution for students and families. I'm excited about the opportunities in this space and continue to believe we can generate high-teens return on equity as we ramp up production here.","We are very focused on and you can see the very positive momentum we have towards creating value for stakeholders. Our focus continues to be to maximize the amount and accelerate the timing of cash flows from our legacy portfolios. Our track record here speaks for itself. Through December 2018, we delivered $21 billion in cash flow, $6 billion more than our model projected at the separation.","We continue to improve our operating efficiency evidenced by our 9% reduction in operating expense this quarter. We're leveraging our skills and infrastructure to create value in lending, in business processing with $984 million in loans generated this quarter at the best margin to-date in delivering EBITDA margins in our BPS business of 21%.","And finally, we're still returning capital to investors with $146 million return this quarter representing a 107% payout ratio. We've developed and shared with you a clear plan to create and deliver value. As this quarter's results demonstrate we are successfully executing this plan.","Thank you for listening today and I now turn the call over to Chris for a deeper review of the quarter.","Chris Lown","Thank you, Jack and thank you to everyone on today's call for your interest in Navient. During my prepared remarks, I will review the first quarter results for 2019. I will be referencing the earnings call presentation, which can be found on the company's website in the investor section.","Starting on slide 3, adjusted core EPS was $0.58 in the first quarter versus $0.43 from the year ago quarter. Key highlights from the quarter include the launch of our digital and school product, nearly $1 billion of refinanced loan originations with improved profitability and strong credit metrics, further credit improvement in our FFELP and legacy loan portfolios and the return of $146 million of capital to shareholders representing a 107% payout ratio. In addition, we benefited from an attractive opportunity to repurchase $46 million of unsecured debt, which resulted in a $15 million pre-tax gain.","Let's move to segment reporting beginning with the federal education loans on slide 4. Core earnings were $127 million for the first quarter. The net interest margin was 80 basis points in-line with our guidance. Total delinquencies for FFELP loans declined to $2.1 billion from the year ago quarter. This performance is consistent with our expectations as a delinquency rates has significantly declined from a year ago and charge-offs have performed as expected. Contingency collections, inventory increased by over $10 billion from the prior year. This increase in volume resulted in 42% year-over-year growth in asset recovery revenue.","Now let's turn to slide 5 in our consumer lending segment. Core earnings in this segment were $65 million for the quarter compared to $50 million a year ago. During the quarter, we originated $984 million of education refinance loans. Importantly this meaningful increase in origination volume was executed at consistent average winning FICO scores, higher average coupons and improved profitability. The first quarter consumer lending, net interest margin was in-line with expectations at 322 basis points compared to 323 basis points a year ago.","Our financing and operational initiatives have resulted in stable net interest margins as our portfolio continues to shift to higher quality refinance loans. At quarter end education refinance loans represented 18% or $4 billion of our consumer lending portfolio compared to 5% or $1.2 billion a year ago.","Let's continue to slide 6 to review our business processing segment. Total revenue in the quarter was $68 million with a 30% increase in healthcare revenue year-over-year. We achieved EBITDA margins of 21% in the quarter driven by disciplined cost management and continued focus on efficiency in automation.","Let's turn to slide 7 to provide additional color on shared services expenses. Nearly 75% of our total expenses are allocated directly to the business segments. The unallocated portion is comprised primarily of costs that are related to the management of the entire corporation and benefits shareholders through increased efficiencies. The few examples of these costs include insurance expenses and services provided by our treasury, audit, accounting, FP&A and human resources teams.","Our IT expenses are the most significant cost within this segment and include infrastructure and operations and IT security that are primarily shared across our federal education and consumer lending business segments. We remain laser focused on improving efficiencies across the company and reduced our shared services expenses by 10% year-over-year.","Let's turn to slide 8, which highlights our financing activity. During the quarter the company repurchased 9.4 million shares for $107 million and we have $333 million of remaining authority under our share repurchase program. In the quarter, we issued to private education loan ABS transactions totaling $1.2 billion and raised over $500 million through additional repurchase facilities involving five previously issued securitizations. Importantly, we did this while maintaining a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25 times which is at the high end of our targeted range.","Before turning to GAAP results, I'd like to quickly remind investors of our established targets on slide 9. During the fourth quarter we established these metrics to provide greater clarity on our view of the business. The performance year-to-date puts us on a path to achieve or exceed these metrics for the full year.","Let's turn to GAAP results on slide 10. We recorded first quarter GAAP net income of $128 million or $0.52 per share compared with net income of $126 million or $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2018. The differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions and the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets.","In summary, as a result of our strong performance in the first quarter across all our segments and our confidence in the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full-year core earnings per share guidance by 7% from a range of a $1.93 to $2.03 to a range of $2.08 to $2.15 which excludes regulatory and restructuring expenses.","I'll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yes, thanks. Sorry if I missed this but what exactly changed in the outlook that made you comfortable raising the EPS guidance for the year?","Jack Remondi","There's a combination of factors here. Certainly, our outlook in terms of interest rates and net interest margin and the profitability of our student loan portfolio is a contributing factor continued improvement and credit performance, increases in fee income and ongoing cost efficiency. So, it's really a combination of those factors that combine to drive the forecast up here.","Mark DeVries","Okay. And my next question I guess Tyson to your comment about the profitability of the student loan portfolio. Jack, what are you seeing on the competitive environment, how intense is competition? And what if any benefit did you get on the origination front this quarter from the expiration of the non-compete?","Jack Remondi","And so we've -- this product is designed to help borrowers, those with student loan debt who've been in the workforce for a number of years, demonstrated a successful pattern or payments and have an income in cash or free cash flow that really make them excellent credits.","And I think what's a little bit unique about this customer base is they're also very focused on kind of managing their student loan liabilities to fit their particular budget. And what we do in this space is really have designed an origination, an application flow that is simpler than the competition and really is designed to allow the borrower to pick their payment term that fits their cash flow.","So, the majority of our customers are picking the payment amount that they want to they want to make each month rather than the term. And that gives them that flexibility to kind of set their loan payment to fit their budget in their financial objectives best. So, the competition in this space is really more about how you are working with the customer and acquiring that customer in the front end.","And I think where we stand out compared to the others is our cost to acquire a loan or a borrower relationship is significantly lower than what we think the competition is spending and our ability to customize the loan product allows us to meet those customers' needs without a direct kind of a dollar-per-dollar price comparison concept.","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it. And was there any benefit that you saw in the originations from the expiration of the non-compete?","Jack Remondi","We certainly saw some volume pick-up in that area but we've this is an area where we have been competing to get for our customers who are into the repayment mode. And so, the -- some of the private student loans, the newly originated private student loans wouldn\u2019t necessarily be eligible for refinance yet.","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich of Citi.","Arren Cyganovich","Thanks. Just on the consumer lending, net interest margin, that popped us a little bit quarter-over-quarter. I was just curious as to what was driving that. I would think that the adding of the additional refinancings would have a downward pressure on that on a sequential basis?","Joe Fisher","I think you've at quarter-on-quarter you also have to look at on a year-on-year basis. And so, I inevitably obviously on a risk adjusted basis while the refi loans are very attractive, they do have a lower NIM.","And so that's flowing through into the portfolio over time will reduce the NIM but again at a attractive risk adjusted return the three - we gave guidance at the beginning of the year at 3.10 to 3.20 for NIM for that portfolio. I'd say we're on track to still be within that range.","Arren Cyganovich","And on the net charge off rate for the consumer lending was kind of [indiscernible] that was also impacted by the disaster recovery relief efforts. But the guidance for the year is still kind of 1.6 to 1.8. Why isn\u2019t that coming down further given kind of the same aspect of adding those new refinancing in terms of the book?","Joe Fisher","So, that you are correct the -- if you just look at the delinquencies of our portfolio they\u2019ve been improving significantly year-over-year and what you're seeing in terms of defaults is really the reset for some borrowers who were residing in the disaster forbearance areas.","We see that same phenomena on both the FFELP portfolio as well as the private loan book. And it will - the impact is going to be felt in the first and the second quarter. And so that creates the charge-off rate to be a little bit elevated during those periods before it returns to normal in the second half of the year.","Arren Cyganovich","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks, good morning. Jack, I guess following your comment on the in-school product, I was wondering if you just expand a little bit more on the strategy there. Perhaps you could just talk about how much more of this strategy you're going to execute on in the future.","For example, are you thinking of indirect channels such as banks to tell us to work through. And then, as far as the product goes, how will it skew, will it skew more undergrad versus grad. Thanks.","Jack Remondi","So, our goal right now is to take advantage of the student loan experience that we have over 40 years of participating in this marketplace along with some of the innovation that has been brought to the marketplace to our refi products. And combine those together to offer something that we think is pretty unique in the in school origination front.","Our target audience is through the -- is working with consumers directly and versus through partners at this point. Some of the innovative features that we think we brought to bear here are quick kind of approval checks for the consumer so that they can quickly understand and address the anxiety they have about whether or not they'll be able to finance their college education.","The way a co-borrower is invited to participate in the application process is something that we think is also unique. And then, part of what we've been talking about for the last couple of years here is helping students and families better understand the cost of not just how they finance their college education and what that would be, but ways to reduce the cost over the life of the loan.","And we think those are components that will give us a competitive advantage here. We're pretty modest expectations about what we will originate this year at $150 million of disbursements. That equates to about $300 million worth of loans but we think we can capitalize on our experience, our product innovation and design and really ramp this product up pretty quickly over the next several years.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And so is the plan to just be direct or work through other parties as well?","Jack Remondi","At this stage in the game, it is to be as a direct originator. And I will say I mean our expectations are to generate - that we can generate mid-teens ROEs in this product which is we think is very attractive in the consumer lending space.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And then maybe a follow-up question. Just on all of these political headlines, obviously there is a lot of noise in the background. Maybe you could just talk through how you see that affecting you in any way and maybe your views on the politics. Thanks.","Jack Remondi","Well, I think as we've talked in the past, the student debt has become a large political and media topic and I think there is any time when you have programs with large numbers like that you have in the federal loan programs in terms of debt outstanding and the number of borrowers and the number of students who are borrowing, it drives a lot of coverage.","We think we still see from our front row seat here a very different set of circumstances that often gets portrayed. And that doesn't mean the stories that are told of individuals are wrong but it's just not the norm. and it really this kind of almost like a bar belling type of situation and for those who go to school and graduate the delinquency and default rates of borrowers have been improving dramatically since the end of the last recession.","And we see that each and every year a continued improvement in the performance of those loans. And again, this is not for credit underwritten products. On the other side of the barbell you have a number, a significant increase in the both the number and the dollar amount of being borrowed in terms of the number of meeting students who are borrowing and the dollar amount that is being borrowed, where kids are not graduating.","So, they start their education process and don\u2019t complete into a lesser extent or take significantly longer than the four to six years to graduate that you see and in kind of more traditional sets of circumstances. That's where the struggling typically occurs. And as we've shared before, 2\/3rds of all the defaults in the federal program come from students who borrow less than $10,000.","It's the solutions that really need to be addressed here in our view more about the front end educational side of the equation and helping students and families understand what it's going to cost to earn the degree and how they are planning on financing that and whether or not that financing package makes sense given the income potential of the career they're pursuing.","For giving it on the back end of the equation doesn't solve the problem. It cures the symptoms but it doesn't solve the problem, helping students and families make better decisions at the front end.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors.","Leon Cooperman","Thank you. I would like to focus if we could on the rationale and your thought process behind the stock repurchase program. Several years ago I remember asking the same question on a conference call and you were forthright in your response and I think at that time we had started buying back stock in the 20s and you said very forcefully we're buying it back because we think it's very undervalued.","We think the business is worth in the low 30s. I think in the last decade or so we have bought back almost half the stock average price under 15. The average analyst expectation is $15.22, the highest is $22. Obviously, that three years ago you thought your business is worth in the 30s and you bought back a bunch of stock material lower price that will create a value.","Those prices seem to be unrealistic relative to with the market you're suggesting. I'm just curious if you could discuss the rationale behind the program, what values you think you're buying when retiring stock etcetera. I'm not being critical, I just really want to learn. Thank you.","Jack Remondi","Sure. Thanks, Leon. So, our share repurchase program has really been designed to return the capital that had previously been invested in our FFELP and private student loan portfolio is back to investors as it is as those loans pay off and then earnings accrete from that. And we've been returning it through dividends and share repurchases.","We do believe and still believe today that our stock priced trades below the intrinsic value of the company and that is a reflection of what we would say is the discounted cash flows associated with the portfolio plus the components of the company that are ongoing businesses. And so, that number has changed, the stock price obviously has reflected different expectations here.","I think today's stock price is very much way the some of our regulatory issues and the law suits weigh heavily on that but we see today the ability to buy back stock at today's prices as a significant value creator for our investors before buying back less than the intrinsic value that we see.","Leon Cooperman","Do you think you are buying a dollar bull for $0.50 or is that too extreme?","Jack Remondi","Well, I think at this stage we are certainly buying it back for less than a dollar and significantly less than a dollar. I think the range of people's expectations has a wide range as you point out we would say that the stock the intrinsic value of the company is in the 20s.","Leon Cooperman","Got it. Thank you very much. Good luck. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Valentin of Compass Point. ","Scott Valentin","Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Jack and Chris I think one of you refer to as asked about the guidance increase. It was a number of factors. On the interest rate side and the margin I guess they go together, but just wondering given the competitive environment I assume it's still very competitive. Is there something change in your outlook for interest rates either short term or long term that kind of have increased your confidence in the margin going forward?","Chris Lown","Yes, so I think as Jack mentioned one of the benefits of this price increase or the guidance increase is that it was very broad based. It is across the entire business which gives us a lot of confidence but there are a couple of other things taken into account too. Obviously the end repurchase gain is in that guidance as well. That's $0.05. You all have to remember also I mean there has been a dramatic shift in where people thought interest rates are going what the corporate look like. Take yourself back to October, November and there was, was still talking about tightening meaningfully. There were estimates of two rate increases in 2019. The curve is now flat and inverted.","And so we are just in a significantly different environment than we were to our benefit and so that is inevitably is helpful. The other thing that happened through the year into 2019 is amortization slowed. So our portfolio size it was a little bigger than expectation which obviously accursed store benefit. So there are a number of points which is positive because it wasn't one single thing and it's very broad based and what gives us a lot of comfort around raising our guidance for 2019.","Scott Valentin","Okay helpful. And to take a look further on that I mean I assume it's the outlook for say LIBOR, some of the rates not going up as much as really provided maybe little more confidence in the outlook?","Jack Remondi","That's right. ","Scott Valentin","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jeffries.","John Hecht","Yes, thanks very much for taking my questions. First one is just with the respect to expenses. You guys have the FDC pass-through and I think that expires middle of this year. How do we think of that with respect to the efficiency guide and any adjustments we should be thinking about there?","Jack Remondi","So that revenue and expenses was roughly $7 million in the quarter. That will continue until we are off their system that is a TBD but you can use that as a guidepost. I mean inevitably it is a zero margin element. It washes the expenses and revenues wash each other. So I think that can give you the guidance. We will obviously give you updates and it depends on when everything moves off of the systems but that is still TBD.","John Hecht","I guess we're making the modeling for efficiency ratio should we make that adjustment and expenses?","Jack Remondi","Yes.","John Hecht","And second question is a little bit more strategic. You've done a nice job building up the origination and acquisitions in the private education loan segment over the past several quarters, about a billion dollars quarterly now but that seems to be just replenishing a lot of the runoff of that portfolio. How do we think about your intermediate along term origination goals and growth rates in that category?","Jack Remondi","So that wouldn't be replenishing. Obviously these assets run off call it high teens, low 20s and so obviously we'll continue to build the portfolio but obviously have that runoff and a number in a few years will come to a steadier state from a portfolio size but the portfolio will still be growing.","John Hecht","So what do you -- maybe in a year or two where do we want to see you guys in terms of origination kind of origination pattern?","Jack Remondi","I think, we put out guidance this year of at least 3 billion. I think we feel comfortable with that guidance if not exceeding it. Obviously after having ramps the portfolio and gotten it to a more of scale the percentage increases year over year on quarter-on-quarter will come down but we still think there's room to grow this business even in the long term in the teens.","John Hecht","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hammond of Bank of America.","Mark Hammond","Hi, thanks. Hi Jack, Chris and Joe. I had a couple questions on the cap structure. One, on the bond that you repurchased during the first quarter. Were they another slug of yen bonds?","Jack Remondi","That's right. The 34?","Mark Hammond","Yes. So is there more to do there? I guess there is one more remaining?","Jack Remondi","So, a few things to say. There is there is a little more to do. What I tell you is, I'm not whether they come to us or not is uncertain. Obviously we have dialog with bond investors all the time. This is a investor being in contact with us talking to us and it finally got to a point where we felt from capital allocation perspective it made sense to use capital for that purpose given the inevitable return that we received from it but there's still a little left in the 34s but not a meaningful amount and I wouldn't expect to see this come again anytime soon.","Mark Hammond","And moving to cash flow one slide 14, the private credit residual cash flow that's forecasted cumulatively went down by 1.1 billion from last quarter's report just what's going on there?","Jack Remondi","Hold on. That represents the structured financing that we do against the over collateralization in the securitization trust. So those cash flows are net of structured debt and before unsecured debt. So when we borrow money against the over collateralization it reduces those cash flows because there's a now an introduction of a liability in the proceeds are used to reduce our unsecured debt balances or do other things. ","Mark Hammond","Thanks Jack. And then is there any a quantity or way you can frame the capacity to do more of the repurchase facilities on the private side? ","Jack Remondi","Well, there is more capacity. I think what we're always looking at is optimization of financing structures what we saw as an ability to tap those cash flow facilities and at a cost and benefit to us that were greater than our other alternatives. There is still some capacity and we should be looking at us to optimize our financing structure at all times but if that is the best price of financing it will be opportunity to utilize.","Mark Hammond","Got it and Chris could you quantify that capacity? ","Chris Lown","It obviously changes over time but sub a billion. ","Mark Hammond","That's good enough for me. Thank you all.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane from J.P. Morgan.","Rick Shane","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. When we look at the change to guidance and this was pointed out roughly 30% to 40% of that was from the benefit from the debt repurchase. When we look at the delinquency trends that may are favorable on a year-over-year basis. Is the next biggest component driving that guidance revision a function of a better credit outlook and lower reserve levels as you move through the year?","Jack Remondi","I think as we said the contribution I mean the confidence in our ability to raise guidance at the end of the quarter here is really driven by contributions across the board. So there are contributions as you just mentioned from the net interest margin side of the equation, better portfolio, amortization trends for us improved profitability on the re-fi but also in terms of fee revenue that we're generating. We saw a significant uptake for example in our FFELP related fee revenue in the first quarter and expect that to continue through the balance of the year.","Similarly we're seeing better performance in our BPS origination our BPS businesses and both revenue in margin and then OpEx as a contributing factor as well. And then of course you have to add in the value of our share repurchase programs to those to that component. So I would really look at this as across-the-board contribution versus a single area or one or two areas.","Rick Shane","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. The second question you guys talked a lot about your opportunity and private student lending and the emphasis in many ways has been on consolidation and refinance. The other part of that is the opportunity to re-enter the new loan market. I'm curious as you approach that market if you think there's a chance to do that in a different way? Historically it's been about getting on preferred lending lists but as we've seen in origination in different class and asset classes there's an increasing opportunity electronically to go direct consumer. Is that going to be part of the strategy?","Jack Remondi","Well, certainly our marketing approach here is a digital first approach. So some of the big chunk of this in the re-fi related business marketplace for example is a direct mail related function and we are focused instead on generating customer leads and acquisitions on a digital side of the equation. In terms of how private student loans at the campus level for in school or originate today. The students still are working very closely with the financial aid office to understand what their family expected family contribution will be and oftentimes we'll get information about how to finance it.","The financial aid office in the preferred lender lists are different vehicle today in serve a different purpose than what they did five, ten years ago where customers were very much encouraged to move through those channels because it simplified the back-office operations of the school. Today students and families source their financing needs through a variety of channels including digital direct and through the financial aid office. All of our products though are, will be underwritten certified by the school and disbursed with proceeds disbursed directly to the school.","Rick Shane","Very helpful, thank you very much guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dominic Gabriel of Oppenheimer.","Dominic Gabriel","Thanks for taking my questions. Can you just remind us how many rate hikes that you guys had in your original guidance? And then obviously you had a nice strong start to the year. If you saw a continued acceleration in your various businesses and you said it was pretty broad-based where some of the B came from this quarter. Could you see yourself maybe adding to your remaining 330 repurchase plan for 2019? Thanks so much.","Jack Remondi","So, on the rate increase in our original guidance we have one hike but also remember that the market was expecting future hikes so another decline in rates or flat and the curve. So one rate hike but the curve was still pretty steep and up to the right and then on the return of capital where we are committed is returning excess capital to shareholders we put out a guidance of 1.23 to 1.25 times on a TNA ratio. We clearly feel that is a great B going into C and we like where we are but if we do feel like we are in an excess capital position we will return that capital to shareholders through increased buybacks, etc. So I think you can continue to look at sort of that leverage ratio in our capital generation and think about what could be in store for the rest of the year.","Dominic Gabriel","Thanks and then if you could talk about was it the better amortization across both the FFELP and private portfolios or was it just one? ","Jack Remondi","It was both FFELP versus our internal thoughts.","Dominic Gabriel","And then, there seems to be some additional disclosure on slide 7 for the other segment on the core do some of the expense breakdown which I really appreciate. Can you just talk about the give and takes there where you can see the leverage given that you're looking to obviously ramp some of the origination yet continue your nice efficiency there to? Thanks so much.","Jack Remondi","So I think it's a great question and we're very focused on this segment because these are the shared services that help us operate our business and trying to scale them as the portfolio amortizes it's very important to us.","So, as you know last year we entered a transaction with first data to variable lies, some of our IT expense and that was a big move to help us control and reduce expenses in shared services. And so we think IT is still a place that we can leverage changes in our business model, changes to the technology world and platforms and infrastructures using things like the cloud, etcetera to reduce fixed costs. So on the IT side we think there are clear expenses that can be saved clearly and in corporate facilities as we continue to manage our business and our footprint that clearly something will be focused on regular regulatory related that's something we obviously clearly hope goes down and our expectation is that we'll over time and then finance, vendor management, legal risk, and audit all these things should scale down and all of them can be used to our benefit to drive reductions.","So, I think it's across the board but there are fixed costs we've now converted to variable. That won't immediately change as far as that that's scaling down but actually as we break them down over the next year or two you will see them go down after they plateau for a year. So there is inherent benefit in that variablization that will take about a year, year and a half to work through the system.","Dominic Gabriel","Thanks so much for answering my question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks. I saw on a kind of a legal blog that you guys had that Navient got the ability to depose the former student loan Ombudsman in the CFPB lawsuit. I'm not sure that in and of itself is all that meaningful but any kind of updates on the process with respect to that lawsuit?","Jack Remondi","So it continues to move at the pace that takes place in the sole federal court systems which is slow unfortunately. I think at this stage in the game the facts that we have discussed in the past are still the most important that after more than two years of discovery process the CFPB has yet to present a single example of a customer who is harmed in a way that matches up against their initial allegations and it's not surprising considering that they filed their lawsuit before they had listened to a single customer phone call but it had been searching for customers to support their claims from the beginning.","We're hopeful that the legal process will accelerate here. There was a special master appointed that is moving through some of the open items helping that process move on a little bit faster and we do expect the deposition process to continue to support. What we said all along is that these claims are unfounded. ","Moshe Orenbuch","And just kind of following up on Lee's question earlier if you go back to before you did by earnest and that kind of shift in strategy stocks probably down in the upper teens percent in the markets up almost a comparable amount. So I guess I struggle with even how to ask the question but what do you think Navient has to do to get investors to recognize that that strategy has value?","Jack Remondi","Well, I think what we have to do is what we did this quarter which is demonstrate that we can generate very attractive returns from each component of our business and so if you look at the results this quarter you see very strong returns on the legacy portfolio side of the equation. You see strong origination growth with we said higher margins. You see fee revenue increasing and you see operating expense declining. I think that's what we need to do. That's what we control here within the company to delivering and creating value for our stakeholders.","The stock price unfortunately doesn't reflect the value that we see in it and we think a piece of this is the regulatory side of the equation and certainly even some of the noise associated with the recent proposal and retraction from Canyon and now the proxy process. We prefer to be focused on growing the business and executing our business plan and delivering value for shareholders and that's hopefully where we'll be very, very soon.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Henry Coffey from Wedbush.","Henry Coffey","Yes, good morning. Just two questions one on the refinance business my impression and obviously correct me if I'm wrong is that it's mainly sort of a high dollar business focusing on super prime borrowers with classical professional degrees; doctor, lawyer, investment banker, engineer. Is there any thought process of going further down the, not down the FICO food chain but further down the economic chain to other successful professionals teachers whatever to see if there's a refinance product that would work there? Or is it still pretty much focused on that kind of traditional high-end market?","Jack Remondi","So you're correct in saying that this is, we're very much focused on consumers who have a demonstrated track record and free cash flow to support their student loan debt and part of this is designed to be we want to be able to offer a product to the consumer that is significantly better than the loans that they are exiting and that includes both the interest rate and to some extent some of the payment flexibility options that exist in the federal program if those might be needed.","But to your second point is I think this is one of the significant advantages that we bring to the marketplace here having been in the student loan origination and servicing space for private and federal loans for almost 40 years now that we have tremendous insight as to how customers move through the repayment cycles and the ability to identify customers who might look like that super prime customer several years before they get there and be able to offer products to those consumers earlier in the repayment mode saving them interest expense at a larger level and at an earlier time.","Certainly there are other professions and the ones that you mentioned teachers and nurses are great examples of customers with very stable incomes and very stable and predictive payment streams that are attractive customers for us here as well.","Henry Coffey","And then earnings are moving higher. You are buying back stock which is wonderful but a lot of the people we talk to that are involved in your stock are there for the income. Why not put some of that increased return of capital into dividends now that earnings per share seem to be moving higher? ","Jack Remondi","I think is the capital allocation decision and discussion in inevitably to be honest corporate theory around capital return would suggest that dividends and buybacks produce the same result from the perspective of the shareholder from the return perspective to share price. Clearly we're paying a pretty high dividend today compared to the market and compares to the averages. I did something we do think about and talk about internally and so if we were to change that obviously we would signal that. I do feel like we're in a good place but it's something we do consider and think about. ","Henry Coffey","I mean is there a view that a 5% dividend yield is pretty much as high as it's going to go and if you add it to the dividend the stock would go up or is the fear that if you add to the dividend the stock won't react?","Jack Remondi","Again the capital is being returned to shareholders in one way or the other either it is coming from a dividend or buybacks, to some degree there is -- to that but if you look at where we rest from a yield perspective versus almost any other stock we are in the top probably -- and so the incremental benefit there versus buying back stock we think it leans towards the buyback program.","Henry Coffey","Thank you very much and congratulations on a great quarter.","Jack Remondi","Thank you.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to you, Joe Fisher for closing remarks. ","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Nova. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. If you have any other follow-up questions feel free to contact me. This concludes today's call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

My name is Shannon and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Navient Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] ","It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s call over to Mr. Joe Fisher, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Fisher, you may begin your conference.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Shannon. Good morning and welcome to Navient\u2019s 2015 fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO; and Somsak Chivavibul, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations, and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors in the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures, we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures, and our GAAP results can be found in the fourth quarter 2015 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted, along with our earnings press release on the Investors page at navient.com. Thank you.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thank you, Joe. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Today\u2019s call is particularly important. The financial markets have created pressure on both our debt and equity erasing significant value from investors. This morning I\u2019ll address the factors impacting our enterprise value, what we're doing to manage them and demonstrate why the intrinsic value of our company remains strong and intact. Front and center for us and I know many of you, is our access to and cost of liquidity. ","The legal final maturity date topic has caused spreads to widen and trading to be limited in the FFELP ABS market. This, along with the disruptive high-yield market, has caused our unsecured debt spreads to widen. Some investors have asked about our ability to continue to return excess capital to shareholders while meeting our unsecured debt maturities. Let me be perfectly clear: I am confident we can continue to do both. In fact, we have a plan to do so. ","I am confident because our $123 billion portfolio of student loans generate sizable and predictable cash flow. This cash flow totaled $3 billion in 2015 and is projected to be $2.7 billion in 2016. In addition, we have a very long track record of securing funding from the assets we own. For example, in the fourth quarter we completed two new first-time financings for over $900 million at a cost that was several hundred basis points inside of our unsecured debt spreads. We used the proceeds to take advantage of market conditions and we repurchased $691 million of unsecured debt generating a gain of $21 million. ","We also confirmed our confidence in our cash flows with the new $700 million share repurchase program. And we used our authority, in 2015 we repurchased 56 million shares and since January 1, we've acquired an additional 5.4 million shares. Combined, over 15% of shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015. ","In 2015, we took a number of steps to address the legal final maturity topic. During the year we amended six trusts to extend the maturity date, amended 16 different trusts to provide us with an additional 10% loan purchase option, and we exercised cleanup calls on 12 ABS trusts totaling $1.1 billion. Notably, these actions consumed little additional liquidity, nor did they increase our costs. ","We also provided extensive data to the rating agencies and investors to demonstrate the stability of federal student loan cash flows, even under the unlikely deferred payments trust scenarios. While the rating agencies have yet to issue their final AAA criteria for FFELP ABS, we are confident they will be less stringent than their preliminary statements. ","We also maintain significant liquidity for loan purchases. This liquidity is most often in the form of limited purchase -- limited purpose structured debt facilities. We\u2019ve used these facilities consistently for close to 20 years to support our loan acquisition activities, including the acquisition of loans from cleanup calls associated with our ABS trust. These facilities provided the liquidity to purchase $3.7 billion in student loans and $1.1 billion in cleanup call acquisitions in 2015. ","The prepayment and default assumptions that drive our projected cash flows are based on our over 40 years of data and experience. Each year the cash flows realized have closely matched our projections and we\u2019ve been able to add to the expected future cash flows with servicing skills that reduce default rates, by capturing floor income, and by purchasing student loan portfolios at appropriate prices. ","This is not our first experience with difficult markets. Our long track record here demonstrates our deep understanding of our assets and our ability to confidently and creatively manage our liquidity and maximize our cash flows. ","Headlines covering student loans have created storylines that lead one to believe that most student loan borrowers have an overwhelming debt burden that cannot be met. That's far from the typical experience. For example, 85% of our federal loan customers are current. Still some student loan borrowers do have more debt than they can reasonably afford. This is usually due to dropping out before they earn their degree, taking six years or more to complete their degree, or paying more than the degree is worth. ","At Navient, our practices are designed to assist struggling borrowers with solutions that keep them out of delinquency and default and instead drive repayment success. For short-term issues, payment deferral may be a good solution while income-based solutions address longer-term challenges. Paying down the loan balance is, however, the true objective. That's why we continue to recommend that federal policy should include programs to provide students with actionable information about the financial resources they will need to earn their degree on time and whether or not their degree supports that investment. ","Many are surprised to learn that the average bachelor's degree recipient who borrows for a four-year degree and not all do, leave school with less than $29,000 in loans. Furthermore, while a small percentage of undergraduate borrowers owe more than $60,000, defaults are far more likely to occur among those who borrow substantially lower amounts. ","In addition, many are not aware that program-wide default rates and delinquency rates have fallen significantly since the end of the Great Recession. In fact, at year-end our total delinquency rates for both our federal and private portfolios are at the lowest levels in over a decade. ","Finally, student loans are on the agenda of several regulatory agencies. While we continue to be responsive to the request from regulators, we also work to demonstrate the effectiveness of our servicing practices and data-driven servicing solutions that we use customer feedback to drive changes and how we lead efforts around industry best practices. It's important to acknowledge here that for federal student loans, neither FFELP lenders nor Department of Education loan servicers set the price, school charges, the amount a student can borrow, the interest rate on the loan, the repayment terms, nor a borrower's eligibility for any of the over 40 alternative repayment and deferment options available to them. And we like all federal loan servicers must follow rules and regulations issued by the Department of Education. ","Over the years, the federal student loan program has added numerous loan programs and repayment options. These programs often have very similar sounding names, like income sensitive, income-based, pay as you earn and revised pay as you earn. We assist our customers in understanding the different options so they can select the payment program that best fits their needs. Still, the numerous options, unique terms, lengthy applications can all be overwhelming to borrowers. We continue to advocate for program simplicity as a way to meaningfully increase customer participation. Policies and programs should encourage borrowers to contact their servicers, not overwhelm them. Contact works and it should be encouraged. ","The regulatory focus on student loans has led some to believe that new regulations could significantly increase our cost to service our loans. We have a decade\u2019s long track record of managing regulatory changes while simultaneously improving our operating efficiency. We\u2019re able to do this as a result of our expertise and scale and expect to be able to do so going forward. For example, this year we automated our processes for SCRA benefits and enrollment and re-enrollment in income driven repayment programs, including the new revised pay as you earn program. Both of these examples would otherwise be very labor-intensive tasks. ","During 2015, our great team maintained our focus on our business and building value. I am proud of our work and thankful for their commitment. For the year we generated core cash earnings of $1.85, reduced outstanding unsecured debt by $2.3 billion. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reduced private credit charge-offs by $58 million or 8% ending the year at the lowest delinquency rates since 2005. Expanded our business services with the acquisition of Gila and Xtend. We converted nearly $5 billion in FFELP loans to our servicing platform. We enrolled or reenrolled over million borrowers into income driven repayment programs, assisted 728,000 severely delinquent customers who are now current, and finding a solution that help them avoid default, and we improved our operating cost and efficiency. ","For 2016, we\u2019re focused on realizing the value of our portfolio and leveraging our core skills to generate growing earnings from our student loan and non-student loan businesses. The current financial market conditions, however, will likely limit opportunities to purchase student loan portfolios in the near term. ","While our net financing plans are modest in 2015, we do plan to issue FFELP and private asset-backed securities shortly and unsecured notes later this year. While Somsak will provide more details later in the presentation, we believe our business will generate core EPS between $1.82 and $1.87 per share in 2016. ","Yesterday, our stock closed at $9.45 a share. I do not believe this is an accurate reflection of our value. It\u2019s not even close. In today's earnings presentation, we provide a summary of our expected future cash flows from our existing student loan portfolios. These cash flows are expected to exceed $31 billion before unsecured debt and operating expenses. The $31.7 billion in cash flow is also not discounted. ","Several research analysts have estimated the net present value of these cash flows, including unsecured debt and including operating expense. They produce per-share estimates in the high teens and low 20s. I agree with these estimates and strongly agree with them. Our focus for 2016 is to realize this value. We will do so by focusing on maximizing our earnings and cash flow and by using excess capital to repurchase our shares -- shares that are trading at a very deep discount. ","We intend to utilize the full $755 million available at January 1 under our share repurchase authority this year. At today's prices, this would equate to buying over 20% of shares outstanding. ","Thank you for your interest and support. We\u2019re committed to on delivering our enterprise value to our investors and I'll now turn the call over to Somsak for more a detailed review of the financials. ","Somsak Chivavibul","Thanks, Jack. Good morning everyone. During my prepared remarks, I will be addressing the fourth quarter results, highlighting the recent financing activity and I\u2019ll provide additional detail behind the company's 2016 earnings guidance. I will be referencing the earnings call presentation which is available on the company's website and let me start with Slide 4 which provides a summary of our core earnings.","In the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.49. These results exclude $0.01 per share or $7 million of regulatory related costs during the quarter. Our full year 2015 core EPS was $1.85, excluding regulatory related costs. ","In our fourth quarter, adjusted operating expenses totaled $228 million versus $206 million a year ago. This increase is related to the additional cost resulting from the acquisition of Gila and Xtend Healthcare. And as Jack mentioned, we expect our full year 2016 core EPS to range between $1.82 and $1.87 and we expect our operating expenses to be under $930 million for 2016. Both these items exclude the impact of any regulatory related costs. ","The primary driver for the increase in operating expenses from 2015 will be the full year run rate for Xtend and Gila. Excluding the operating expenses from the two companies, our 2016 projected core operating expenses will be 6% lower than 2015 levels. ","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $74 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. In the quarter, our FFELP NIM was at 84 basis points, and we expect the full year 2016 FFELP NIM to remain in the low to mid 80s. Our FFELP NIM may be impacted by future LIBOR rates which will determine the amount of floor income in our portfolio. But since quarter end \u2013 since the quarter ended, we\u2019ve hedged an additional $217 million of floor income, bringing the future hedged floor income total to over $1 billion. ","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loan segment results. Core earnings in this segment decreased $36 million from the year ago quarter to $56 million. During the quarter Navient sold a $178 million of low coupon private education loans which raised $157 million. The reduction in interest expense from paying down the debt and servicing fee income we retained had a net present value greater than the loss in the future expected spread income from this portfolio. ","Our third-quarter net interest margin came in at 3.61%. The private net interest margin continues to be impacted by the timing of when our prime based earning assets reset versus our debt that is funded with LIBOR. As a result, we are forecasting the full-year 2016 private student loan net interest margin to be in the mid-350s. At year end we have approximately $17 billion of prime earning assets funded by liabilities indexed at LIBOR. ","Slide 7 highlights our improving private education loan asset quality trends over the last five years. This is a portfolio that is well seasoned, with 94% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. Our fourth quarter charge-offs came in at 2.3% or $33 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year. ","Our total delinquency rate of 7.2% at year-end is at the lowest rate that we\u2019ve seen since 2005. And for 2016 we expect our annualized charge-off rate for the full year to be between 2.3 and 2.5%. ","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment results. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter compared with $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was related to an expected $8 million reduction in asset recovery revenues related to a legislative reduction that we highlighted in the third quarter along with the decrease in education loan related expenses \u2013 revenues. ","Our non-federal student loan related asset recovery revenues increased by $70 million for 2014 to $118 million for 2015. The increase in these revenues was primarily related to the additions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015. And we expect our full year 2016 business services revenues to range between $620 million and $650 million and that revenue excludes any intercompany loan servicing revenues. ","I would like to highlight the financing activities that took place in the fourth quarter on Slide 9. During the quarter, we issued a $359 million private loan ABS and this transaction was unique since it was a first of its kind from Navient with collateral consisting entirely of seasoned performing non-traditional loans. While the term non-traditional may have negative connotations, the assets in this deal improved from the average FICO score of 625 at origination to a current score of 690. This demonstrates the positive impact the seasoning had on the credit quality of this portfolio. ","Of the $2.1 billion of non-traditional loans in repayment or forbearance on our balance sheet, nearly 90% of these loans have made more than 12 payments. We also raised an additional $500 million in the quarter through a new two-year private education loan repurchase facility. This is the first time we have structured the facility to allow us to advance against the over-collateralization associated with our private education loan securitizations that have a turbo repayment structure. After this transaction, we have similar securitizations with $3.1 billion remaining at current OC levels, and that's expected to grow to $4.5 billion at expected maturities. ","During the quarter, our unsecured debt declined by $734 million to $15.2 billion outstanding at year end. Of the $734 million reduction in unsecured debt, $691 million was achieved through repurchases, through tender offers and open market transactions. And during the quarter we repurchased 14.1 million shares or $170 million and announced an additional $700 million share repurchase authorization. ","Since January 1, we\u2019ve spent $55 million and as of today we have remaining authority of $700 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and resulted in a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25 times. We continue to reduce and smooth out our debt maturity profile to better match the cash flow generated by our asset management business. ","Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded fourth quarter GAAP net income of $286 million or $0.79 per share as compared to net income of $263 million or $0.64 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our dilutive position, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM Bank.","I will now \u2013 let\u2019s open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch ","Great, thanks so much, and nice work on the debt side, and comments on the equity side also. Jack, I was wondering if you can kind of elaborate a little bit, given the tools that you have, like how do you see the progression over the next few months or quarters with respect to dealing with the outstanding unsecureds?","Jack Remondi","So I think we made \u2013 to your point, we made great progress at the end of 2015, reducing 2016 debt maturities and our focus really now is on continuing to access the capital markets to knock down our maturities in 2018 and \u201919. So that\u2019s really where the focus is. When we look at our liquidity balances, both cash on hand and assets that we believe are financeable, we feel we\u2019re in a pretty good position here to be able to access the liquidity we need to address our unsecured debt maturity, the higher balances in \u201818 and \u201919. ","Moshe Orenbuch ","Kind of separate question, you did buy some FFELP assets this quarter. Could you just talk a little bit about what is going on there and you did mention that you expect to be able to do FFELP securitizations, so can you talk about what you're seeing is the likely terms on that?","Jack Remondi","Yes, so we do buy FFELP. We continue to buy FFELP assets where prices make sense. A lot of that activity is associated with rehabilitation loans and the economics of those transactions even at current funding levels generate a good economic returns for us and we will continue to see more of that we believe in 2016. ","On the FFELP side of the equation, as I said, I think we are of the view that the criteria for the stress test scenarios will come inside of where the rating agencies have discussed to date, which means that we believe we can get deals rated and plan to test that market in the near term for a FFELP transaction, there will be some unique characteristics to this that \u2013 well, I can\u2019t probably talk about at the moment but we think it will be something that can get done and get done at levels that make sense. ","Moshe Orenbuch ","Just to follow up on that, I understand you can\u2019t talk about what the characteristics are, but what\u2019s the outcome? In other words, to the extent that you can do that, does that mean it would become more efficient to buy portfolios?","Jack Remondi","So, on that particular point, we are always willing to buy portfolios. The question is more is there --is the seller willing to sell at the prices that make sense given the cost of funds? So we have more than ample liquidity to buy FFELP loans primarily through our conduit facilities. We ended the year with about 3.6 billion of liquidity in that size -- in those areas. The issue is more particularly for banks who own these portfolios, these loans are government guaranteed, there\u2019s not a credit risk, they\u2019re funding them with deposits. They\u2019re not willing to sell at a loss. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.","Mark DeVries ","Yes thanks. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on why you expect the private student loan margin to be 3.5% which is down I guess from the 3.8% you expected going into 2015, and the 3.65% you guided to for this quarter. Are you expecting that, that whole timing mismatch issue to persist for the full year?","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes. Mark, this is Somsak here. Certainly, what you saw was an increase in the prime rate that occurred late in 2015. I expect that, that timing issue will, from a seasonal perspective, benefit the first quarter private spread. But to the extent there is an increase in LIBOR rates for after the first quarter 2016, without a corresponding increase in the prime rate, you might see some of that timing mismatch for the remainder of 2016. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re reflecting in the guidance there. ","Mark DeVries ","And then Jack, given the anxiety that\u2019s clearly reflected in both the equity and the debt markets, did it make sense at all to think about suspending the dividends, so you can use that cash flow to either buy back more stock or retire even more debt than you are? Certainly seems like a better use of cash flow to buy back your stock at half of what we analysts think as the intrinsic value than just give it back to shareholders?","Jack Remondi","Mark, that\u2019s a good question. We\u2019re going to spend over almost $220 million in dividends in 2016 and it would clearly be better used in share repurchases. I think when we look at the dividend and we just confirmed and declared the same dividend rate for the first quarter here. We\u2019re really not looking to create or add to some of the investor concerns about liquidity access, what it means and so while we debate at that topic, I think it\u2019s best that we keep the dividend rate as it stands today. ","Mark DeVries ","Do you think you could address this by announcing like a simultaneous cut to the dividend and increase to the repurchase authorization?","Jack Remondi","Yes, no, I think, I mean it makes economic sense. I don\u2019t disagree with that. It\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s growing, making sure what the market sentiment is a reaction to that, when there is already concerns about liquidity. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lee Cooperman from Omega Advisors.","Lee Cooperman ","Thank you. It\u2019s a little bit of a different approach to prior gentleman who asked this question. I am going to give you credit for knowing more about your business and its value than myself, given the complications and actually my confidence in management, I think you guys do a very fine job and you keep us informed. I wanted to verify some numbers and better understand the motivation for the buyback. I think you\u2019ve given all the answers. You said that the net present value in the high teens, low 20s, you strongly agree, et cetera. And this is my observation. In 2014, you spent $600 million to buy 30.4 million shares, you paid $19.70. In 2015, you spent $945 million, or 56 million shares at $16.88. On 12\/31\/ 2015 you said, you had $755 million left, you bought $55 million worth of stock, 5.4 million shares, you paid $10.19 so far this year and you have left $700 million which I believe is roughly 23% of the market cap of the company. Why are we not \u2013 and the stock is somewhere between 6% and 7%. Why don\u2019t we engage in accelerated repurchase and spend that $700 million now because we\u2019re seeing with the stock so far disjointed from the economic realities as you portray them, and being uncertain environment in the market which creates this opportunity, it seems to me that we should really accelerate the repurchase program retire [22 within the company] and by the way, unless I am missing something, if you bought back 23% to the company at call it, $10 or $11 and you think the real value to low 20s, that creates significant value to remaining shares, so the value goes up, not exponentially but goes up quite significantly. So my question is, we paid the prices of $20, $17 for so much stock, why don\u2019t we accelerate it, how dangerous it is, how risky is it to buy 11 months in advance today? I am going to leave the operational questions to my partner, Mahmood who knows more about the business than me.","Jack Remondi","So well, first of all, thank you for your comments on our confidence here, we appreciate that. We are being aggressive on our share repurchase programs and as we begin the process here after the earnings call, I think you'll see us be more aggressive than we were in the first month of the year to acquire those shares. If you look at the daily trading volume we are already through the first month of the year acquiring roughly a little over 10% of trading volume. So we\u2019ve been fairly active to begin with. And to the extent that we can accelerate those and capture today's prices which we totally agree are far, far below the net present value or the intrinsic value of the company. We should hit -- we will continue to do so. ","Lee Cooperman ","Yes, I don\u2019t know what your limitations are but I noticed the other day that Ashland, the ASH symbol accelerated a very large repurchase program and this is commonly done, I guess, through -- separates the men from the boys is making these right judgments, if you really believe your business is worth more than twice what is trading for, and you can legally engage an accelerated repurchase, I would strike when the iron is hot, rather than when everybody's optimistic and the stock is trading at a more realistic level. But I will shut up and just try to plant that seed, it seems to be the most logical thing to do. So thank you and good luck. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani ","Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify the commentary, Somsak, on the private loans, student loan NIM. So assuming the spreads remain static as they are today prime to LIBOR, your NIM would probably be much higher than what you are guiding to, right? I understand you're looking at the forward curve assuming rates might go up across the year but if that gets deferred, delayed and that gap doesn\u2019t happen, your NIM should outperform your expectations?","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes.","Sanjay Sakhrani ","And then I guess following up, Jack, given your opening remarks on the impact of the Moody's downgrades, potential downgrade. I was wondering what your discussions with the agency lead you to believe in terms of their understanding of the gravity of the situation. I am just still surprised we haven't gotten any clarity yet.","Jack Remondi","Yes, I think we\u2019re all surprised or disappointed that the analysis has not been complete yet. This has been a long, long process and too long obviously. We\u2019ve provided -- part of the issues here I think are just the significant complexity of the programs and not just understanding what options are available to borrowers but how they interconnect. And as the analysis -- and you can see from the reports that we published, and we shared everything on our website with what we've responded to both Moody\u2019s and Fitch. You can just see that there's a fair amount of complexity here. I do think we made some excellent progress with both Moody\u2019s and Fitch on this topic helping to provide the data that they need to -- that can drive assumptions or stress scenarios that can at least theoretically happen, instead of impossible to happen. And we are continuing to work with them. We do \u2013 do make them aware of the consequences that the delays are having in the financial markets and across our capital stack. And they assure us they are aware of them and working hard to get this resolved as quickly as possible. ","But as I said in my comments, our plan to come to market now ahead of likely a decision -- final decision from the agencies is really a reflection that we need to \u2013 you just can\u2019t wait forever for the process to unfold here. And I do think we\u2019ve got enough information out there that investors can make informed decisions and understand that any new deal won't be subject to \u2013 we\u2019re doing the right things to make sure any new deal won\u2019t be subject to downgrade risk base on new criteria. ","Sanjay Sakhrani ","Maybe a similar question on the CFPB issue, I mean we haven't really heard much from them as well. I was just wondering if you guys have any thoughts on kind of timing?","Jack Remondi","We don't. There hasn\u2019t been any kind of meaningful activity here on that particular topic. Again I think the process that we have utilized here as we engage with regulators is to be responsive to their needs, make sure that they understand the purpose of our policies and practices. For Department of Education loans, I mean a lot of the typical consumer arguments is that someone is doing something that generates more interest or fees or whatever for the lender in the Department of Education loan servicing side, we have \u2013 we don\u2019t benefit from any duration extension or get harmed by duration shortening. We don't \u2013 there are no fees that are assessed to consumers and our job is really to work with the customers according to the guidelines of the Department of Ed set for us and within the fee structure that they pay us to help customers find solutions that make sense. And we\u2019ve touted this number more times than I can count but our customers default at a 38% lower rate than all other services combined. Our view is helping customers stay out of default and no one works harder to collect a liability due to them than the federal government. Keeping them out of default is the best thing that we can do and it helps to minimize their expenses and the total cost of loan ownership and we excel at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Beardsley from Goldman Sachs.","Eric Beardsley ","Hi, thank you. I just wanted to dig in a little bit into the OpEx guidance of less than $930 million. I guess relative to the fourth-quarter run rate, excluding the regulatory costs, what are the moving parts for us to think about next year, or I guess I should say this year? ","Somsak Chivavibul","Well, Eric, that $930 million guidance reflects really the full year impact of the Gila and Xtend acquisition. One of the things I will remind you is that the Xtend acquisition happened in \u2013 towards the latter end of October, October 22 I believe. And so as a result, you\u2019re going to picking up close to a full year\u2019s operating expense load for Xtend Healthcare and to a certain extent you\u2019re going to see an increase in expenses for Gila also. So if you were to -- like I said, if you were to strip out the two -- the expense impact from the two companies, we expect to see a 6% reduction in operating expenses year-over-year. ","Eric Beardsley ","So, next year, it's really the elevated -- or maybe just say that you don't have any cost savings on a net basis because you have further investments in those two businesses. And I guess what kind of revenues are we seeing on the other side of that? ","Somsak Chivavibul","Well, on the other side of that, as we noted during my comments, our full year non-federal student loan related asset recovery revenues increased by $70 million from 2014 to \u201915, and most of that increase really came from the impact of Xtend and Gila. ","Eric Beardsley ","And I guess the guidance for $620 million to $630 million of the business services revenue, is there a way to think about how much of that is from student loans and how much is from the non-student loan business?","Somsak Chivavibul","Just a clarification that, that guidance is \u2013 that range is $620 million to $650 million. And then just as a frame of reference, our non-federal student loan asset recovery revenue was $118 million in 2015 and we expect that to grow fairly aggressively given the fact that we've got a full year of Gila and Xtend that we\u2019re going to incorporate.","Eric Beardsley ","And do you have any clarity at this point in terms of the new allocation model that the Department of Education will be using on the servicing side? ","Jack Remondi","No, not yet. They have not issued their numbers yet for the first six months of the year. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hammond from Bank of America.","Mark Hammond ","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two or three here. You mentioned a plan to meet unsecured debt maturities. By my numbers, you don't have to come back to market in 2016. So, would you share some details of that plan you mentioned to explain why you'd be back in the market on the unsecured side in 2016? ","Jack Remondi","Sure. So our goal is to raise liquidity well before it\u2019s needed and certainly to the extent that we can issue unsecured debt, we can take advantage of opportunities that the market is presenting today to buy back unsecured -- older issues of unsecured debt with near-term maturities at attractive prices. I think one of the things for investors to keep in mind is that trading prices of our debt are not necessarily reflective of economics to us because most of those are fixed-rate securities that we have swapped back to floating, and even bonds that might be trading over par could still produce economic gains for us as we unwind the hedge as well. ","Mark Hammond ","So, your bonds are between 9% and 10% in the long end of the curve, call it, \u201824 even out to the \u201833s]. So, what yield would you want to issue at, that would be advantageous and what's the roadmap to get that yield down to the area that you'd like it? ","Jack Remondi","Well I think for us it's going to really be \u2013 so as I said our plan is not to come to market in the first part of 2016, because these spreads are too high. But it really depends on how we can use it and how we can put that fund -- those funds to work. And the fourth quarter of last year is a good example of what we did, when we tap into two new forms of financings for this company, securitizing our non-traditional loans and borrowing against the over-collateralization in some of our private credit ABS trust, those transactions not only just demonstrate that we can actually tap funding off of our balance sheet but more importantly do so at substantially lower rates than our unsecured debt costs as you just mentioned. ","So when we look at our funding alternatives, that's exactly what we do. We look at what the alternatives are and what the use of proceeds are and make decisions accordingly. I like our balance sheet as it sits today. I like our liquidity position. We\u2019re not in a position where we\u2019re being forced to issue -- to do things. Obviously the ability to declare and get authorization for a $700 million share repurchase program speaks about the confidence in our cash flows and we plan to utilize that as I said, so we are in good shape. And the last thing I would just say is that we recognize here that our ability to produce value for shareholders is dependent upon us having a stable access to the unsecured market. So both sides \u2013 we have both of those investor groups in our mind here.","Mark Hammond ","And then my last question is more of just an idea. So, instead of accelerating share repurchases, which would favor shareholders over bondholders, why not buy your \u201833s that are trading at $0.67 on the $1 today, booking a gain of $0.33? So, that would benefit shareholders and bondholders at the same time. ","Jack Remondi","We have bought some of those bonds back in 2015. They are very thinly traded and when their opportunities present themselves we are usually there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Shane from JPMorgan.","Richard Shane ","Thanks, guys. Can you hear me this morning?","Jack Remondi","Yes.","Richard Shane ","Excellent, okay. Sorry, we are having a little bit of a phone problem here. Anyway, just want to talk a little bit about the maturity wall, Jack. You had talked about -- you'd addressed the 2018 wall. Historically, it looks like the pattern is, entering the year you try to knock down the maturities to about $1 billion, $1.1 billion, before you get into the year, and then address that during the year. With the big spike in 2018, is it possible that you will approach this by leapfrogging the 2017 maturities, and start knocking away at the 2018 and 2019 wall? ","Jack Remondi","First of all, the phraseology of a wall here -- these numbers are larger in \u201918 than they are in \u201817 but they\u2019re certainly very manageable for us and much much lower than they had been in prior years. Our goal is to \u2013so where would we play? We would play where we have and can drive the most economic value and as we get closer to the \u201817 debt maturities, they tend to \u2013 there tends to be little economic value that we can extract by repurchasing them in the new open market other than carrying costs, right? So we end up with liquidity on our balance sheet ahead of the -- in preparation for the debt maturity. So \u201818 has been -- as we said it really at the end of 2015, our focus has been \u201918 and then as we move into \u201816 it's going to push those \u2013 push that out a bit. ","End of Q&A","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to the presenters.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Shannon.

And welcome to the Navient Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Joe Fisher. Thank you. Please go ahead.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Sean. Good morning, and welcome to Navient's 2019 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO; and Chris Lown, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the company's Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures, we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures, and our GAAP results can be found in the fourth quarter 2019 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted on the Investors page at navient.com.","Thank you. Now I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks, Joe. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Navient. I'm thrilled to share with you our exceptional results for the quarter and for 2019 overall. Our results illustrate success in executing our strategy of maximizing cash flows from our loan portfolios, improving our funding and operating efficiency, leveraging our scale and expertise in our business processing and generating high-quality loans at attractive risk-adjusted returns. I am very pleased with the results in each of these areas in 2019 and the strong foundation and momentum they have created for us to continue this success in 2020.","Our actions this year also demonstrate our commitment to manage capital efficiently, to maintain a strong balance sheet while returning meaningful capital to shareholders. The results, adjusted core earnings increased 16% for the quarter to $0.67 per share, and 26% for the full year to $2.64 per share.","Adjusted core net income also increased in 2019 by 12% to $616 million.","Our Federal Education Loan segment delivered stable net interest margins in 2019. Benefits from declining interest rates and the execution of more efficient funding strategies more than offset a negative basis spread environment and the natural trend to lower margins.","Total fee income in this segment increased 8% in 2019 on exceptional performance from our asset recovery services, which generated $230 million in asset recovery revenue in the year, a $67 million increase as we delivered outstanding results for our clients.","In our Consumer Lending segment, we originated $4.9 billion in high-quality, high-value education loans, a 75% increase over the prior year. Our efficient and customer-focused origination platform makes it easy for clients to refinance their loans at rates based on the credit they have earned, generating typical savings of thousands of dollars in lower interest expense.","Our digital marketing approach delivers a low-cost of acquisition and our underwriting model delivers best-in-class portfolio performance. The result is a portfolio of loans that generates a very attractive risk-adjusted return.","As a result of the outstanding success from our team, our ending private education loan balance has grown in each of the last two quarters. Our private education loan net interest margin improved to 3.3% as we continue to execute more efficient funding strategies that more than offset the increasing mix of lower margin, but higher quality refi loans in the total portfolio. It also led to a 3% increase in net interest income in the fourth quarter.","The continued improvement in credit performance in this portfolio contributed to a $73 million reduction in provision expense this year, and we are seeing stronger performance in delinquency and default levels, driven by a strong economy and our data-driven approach to support our customers.","As discussed last quarter, the launch of our in school loan product did not meet our expectations. We've been hard at work taking the learnings from this experience to eliminate the issues that prevented us from achieving our goals. We continue to see a value creation opportunity here, and we are determined to demonstrate this in the upcoming back-to-school season.","In our Business Processing segment, we absorbed the impact of two significant contract losses, one on price in 2018 and one this year, when the state ended the program we supported. We won numerous new contracts in both the government and health care segments, and in particular, revenue in the health care division grew by 12% in 2019. We continue to see value in this business segment.","In 2019, we applied a concerted effort to leverage our operating efficiency skills and customer simplification solutions to improve our operating margins in this segment. So while revenue declined by $9 million, our cost reduction efforts led to an 11% increase in EBITDA to $49 million for the year and a 12% increase in our EBITDA margin to 19%. Our focus on increasing both revenue and efficiency will continue in 2020.","Since we launched Navient in 2014, we've had a strong focus on maximizing cash flow and improving efficiency. During the year, we conducted detailed reviews of the projected cash flows from our loan portfolio and a study to how to accelerate our operating efficiency. These projects helped us shapen our focus and accelerate our progress. This continued focus on operating efficiency led to a 3% decline in comparable operating expense in 2019 even as we meaningfully grew asset recovery revenue and new loan volume.","Also, while the more visible owned federal loan portfolio declined 19% in the year, the total federal loan volume we service for ourselves and third parties declined by a much smaller 2% due to new account placements from the Department of Education. The ending loan balance in our Customer segment was also unchanged at year-end.","While significant attention is applied to operating expense, interest expense is by far our largest cost. In 2019, we continued to implement innovative solutions to more efficiently fund our loan portfolios. These efforts have both reduced our highest cost funding source unsecured debt and lowered the cost of our structured financing solutions.","As a result of our efforts in 2019, we reduced the interest expense we would have incurred by over $90 million, while providing the liquidity to retire $2 billion in unsecured debt. Continuing to improve and accelerate our funding and operating efficiency remains a top priority for us. We have numerous initiatives underway that will continue to accelerate improvements in 2020.","Another key component of our enterprise value is maximizing the cash flow generated by our loan portfolios. In 2019, the education loan portfolios generated $5.3 billion in cash flow, including $2.7 billion from financing activities. This strong cash flow allowed us to retire $2 billion in unsecured debt and return $587 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.","In addition to a dividend yield in 2019 of nearly 5%, our share repurchase program decreased outstanding shares by 13%. Our strong earnings allowed for this impressive capital return while we maintained a strong balance sheet. As a result, we are extremely well positioned for the implementation of CECL. Our confidence in our capital generation forecasts led to the new $1 billion share repurchase program announced last October, which we began implementing this year.","Our results this quarter and the year were exceptional. We saw strong contributions from all areas of the company. We are confident that our efforts in 2019 will continue to deliver strong results in 2020. Thank you for your time and interests and I'll now turn the call over to Chris for a deeper review of our financial results. Chris?","Chris Lown","Thank you, Jack. And thank you to everyone on today's call for your interest in Navient. During my prepared remarks, I will review the fourth quarter and full year results of 2019. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which can be found on the company's website in the Investors section.","Starting on slide 3, adjusted core EPS was $0.67 in the fourth quarter and $2.64 for the full year. Full year EPS was nearly 30% higher than our original guidance given at the beginning of 2019. Key highlights from the quarter and full year include, refinance loan originations of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, more than doubled our volume from a year ago, which contributed to net interest income growth in our consumer lending segment.","Total refi originations in 2019 are $4.9 billion, sustained improvement in credit quality across our entire education loan portfolio, further optimization of our capital structure, industry-leading efficiency ratio of 49% for 2019, core return on equity of 18% for the quarter and 19% for the full year and the return of $111 million to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of 5.8 million shares.","Moving to segment reporting beginning with federal education loans on slide 4, core earnings were $136 million for the fourth quarter and $525 million for the full year. The net interest margin was 87 basis points for the fourth quarter and 83 basis points for 2019. These margins benefited from the continued improvements in our funding efficiency, along with our favorable interest rate environment.","As the portfolio of FFELP loans continues to amortize, we remain focused on managing our net interest margins across the portfolio and reducing charge-offs and expenses to maximize cash flow. Charge-off rates have significantly declined from a year ago, with the annual charge-off rate at 7 basis points. This performance exceeded our original estimate of 8 basis points to 10 basis points. As previously reported by the Department of Education, our federal servicing contract was extended in December for a one-year period with two additional six-month options.","Asset recovery revenue increased 27% or $14 million from the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily driven by our asset recovery team\u2019s impressive efforts to achieve higher account resolutions on a declining inventory of previously defaulted federal education loans.","Now let's turn to slide 5 in our consumer lending segment. Core earnings in the segment were $89 million for the quarter and $316 million for the full-year. The year-over-year increase was driven by an improvement in net interest margins, strong education refinance loan originations and improved credit quality. A highlight of our effort to improve our funding efficiency was the restructuring of one of our bank facilities which raised nearly $650 million in the fourth quarter, had a significant interest savings.","Credit quality in this segment continued its strong performance, as the total delinquency rate declined to 22% and the forbearance rate declined 10% year-over-year. The total private education portfolio of $22.2 billion was flat year-over-year, primarily driven by the growth in refi originations. During the quarter we originated $1.6 billion of education refinance loans at attractive spreads. In addition to the improvement in refi spreads, we saw a benefit from our favorable interest rate environment in the quarter. Our 2020 net interest margin guidance of 310 basis points \u2013 300 basis points to 310 basis points reflects our less favorable interest rate environment along with a greater proportion of high-quality refinance loans in the consumer portfolio. We expect full year private education loan refinance loan originations at least $5 billion in 2020.","Let\u2019s continue to slide 6 to review our business processing segment. Total net income for the full year grew 10% to $33 million. This was accomplished by growing EBITDA margins to 19% which was at the high-end of our guidance. For the full year, we achieved EBITDA of $49 million and expect to see similar levels in 2020, as we replaced revenue from contract terminations in 2019 with new contracts in 2020 and continue to drive expense efficiencies.","Let's turn to slide 7, which highlights our financing activity. During the quarter, we returned $111 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reducing shares outstanding by 13% year-over-year. As of year-end, we have $1 billion of authority remaining on our multi-year share repurchase program and ended the year in a very strong capital position as we approached the implementation of CECL.","In the quarter, we issued $1.2 billion of term private education ABS and $497 million of term FFELP ABS. Our 2019 refi ABS transactions are being executed at attractive margins and in line with our long-term ROE goals. During the fourth quarter, we reduced our 2020 unsecured maturities through make-whole call of $1 billion, resulting in a loss of $14 million in the quarter. Overall, we reduced unsecured maturities by $2 billion during the year and realized gains of $33 million. This has reduced our total unsecured outstanding debt to $9.6 billion.","As we have previously stated, the implementation of CECL will reduce our capital ratios, which will rebuild quickly as a result of continued increased profitability in 2020. We estimate our incremental pre-tax allowance to be approximately $800 million on Day 1 of implementation, which is in the middle of our previously disclosed range.","As we referenced on the third quarter earnings call, with the implementation of CECL and the growing mix of private education loans, the TNA ratio is less aligned with our capital management targets. As our consumer assets become a greater overall percentage of our balance sheet, we feel it is appropriate to move to a tangible equity ratio that is more in-line with the capital and leverage views of rating agencies and investors.","Adjusting for assets and equity related to our FFELP portfolio, we plan to maintain a tangible equity ratio above 6% by year-end 2020. This change in metric does not change our capital return philosophy and we remain committed to ensuring excess capital is returned to shareholders. We expect our 2020 capital return to be broadly in line with 2019.","Before turning to GAAP results, I'd like to recap our full year 2020 EPS guidance and targeted financial metrics on slide 8, which excludes expenses associated with regulatory costs and restructuring expenses. In 2020, we expect the targeted financial metrics on slide 8 to contribute to core earnings per share between $3 and $3.10, core ROE in the high teens to low 20s, and the core efficiency ratio of approximately 50%, while ending the year with an adjusted tangible equity ratio above 6%.","Finally, let's turn to GAAP results on slide 9. We recorded fourth quarter GAAP net income of $171 million or $0.78 per share compared with net income of $72 million or $0.28 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. The differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions and the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets.","In summary, 2019 was a very successful year. We meaningfully exceeded our targeted financial metrics for the year, saw a significant margin improvement, grew our refi business, maintained expense discipline and strengthened our capital position while returning nearly $600 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We look forward to continuing this momentum into 2020 and I will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Rick Shane with JP Morgan.","Rick Shane","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions this morning. Related to the refi portfolio, I have two questions, when we look at this on a CECL basis, what should we \u2013 as a lifetime loss rate for that product?","Chris Lown","So that's a great question. It's 1.5%, the estimated life of loan loss and what I\u2019d highlighted and you can see this in the trust data, we are running well ahead of that as a life of loan estimate, but that is the estimate we're utilizing.","Jack Remondi","Well below it.","Chris Lown","Well below it, sorry.","Rick Shane","Perfect. Thank you. And then when I look at slide 17 and sort of try to reconcile the volumes with the deals that you did during the year that makes sense. I'm not sure I necessarily understand the free cash flow metric though, if you could just put a little \u2013 if you could just articulate or explain that a little bit more related to the deal size and the free cash flows?","Chris Lown","Yes, so that's a great question because it may have been a little confused and that's the free cash flow estimate of the underlying borrower, it's a key metric that ABS investors look at to determine credit worthiness, it's just another metric along with FICO, et cetera for people to determine the underlying credit of the broader portfolio.","Rick Shane","Got it, okay. Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark DeVries with Navient [ph].","Mark DeVries","Yeah, I guess I just changed the companies.","Jack Remondi","You changed jobs there, Mark?","Mark DeVries","So once again, your refi consolidations really came in quite strong above expectations. Can you just give us some color on kind of, what's driving that and kind of what your outlook is going forward?","Jack Remondi","Yes, I think this is a growing awareness of the opportunity by consumers in this space. And when you look at the way that federal loan programs work and some other private loan programs for the in-school side of the equation, they have higher interest rates, in particular on the private side, but also in the Grad PLUS arena.","And for the many customers, those higher interest rates reflect the uncertainty of the customer's ability to graduate or the likelihood that they'll graduate and what kind of job opportunity they get. When we come to the refi side of the equation, we\u2019re addressing customers who've been in repayment for three to four years and as Chris just indicated on the last question, have substantial free cash flow. That gives them the ability to demonstrate their credit worthiness stronger and so we're able to reprice those loans, saving the customer thousands of dollars, often thousands of dollars a year in interest expense.","And so more and more people are becoming aware of that and taking advantage of it. Overall it's still a small fraction of the amount of loans that are made in the federal loan space. So we estimate the annual originations to be around about $16 billion a year in refi compared to about $100 billion a year of federal loans and another $15 billion or so, $12 billion to $15 billion of private education loans a year.","On the outlook for 2020, as Chris said, we expect to originate at least $5 billion. And we \u2013 nothing we see at this stage in the game, where we said at this point in January would indicate anything other than a continued strong demand for the program.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Got it. And then I think Chris indicated that, the NIM guidance that you provided contemplates less favorable rate environment and I got some mixing out of some of the lower rate refi originations. But, I think Jack you alluded to seeing additional efforts in 2020 that continue to improve the funding cost, is that contemplated in your guidance? And if not, does that mean there's upside there as you execute on those opportunities?","Jack Remondi","It is contemplated and we continue to look for ways to improve on that side of the equation. So that comes from, executing at attractive spreads. We just priced an ABS deal yesterday at very attractive spreads, I think the way the market price is working today or functioning at the moment, but that's a good opportunity for us to continue to improve efficiency. Some of the financing transactions that the finance team took on this year, really leverage the excess collateral in our securitization transactions that allowed us to borrow at substantially lower rates than where we would have traditionally in the past in the unsecured markets. And you're seeing that in the net interest margins in 2019 in the roughly $90 million of interest savings that we experienced or benefited from in this year.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Lee Cooperman with Omega.","Lee Cooperman","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations on your excellent performance. I have a question. You have an authorization of $1 billion that you put in October. That represents about 30% of the market cap. Stock is trading at five times the earnings guidance that you've provided, yields 4.5%. Have you ever thought about accelerating your program and doing a Dutch auction tender to get the shares out before the stock goes up a lot more?","Jack Remondi","Thanks for your comments, Lee. We have actually looked at a number of different ways that we can execute our share repurchase programs both more efficiently and in some instances more quickly as well. Because of the size of our program, we're actually buying pretty close to 10% of the trading volume, which is about where you can kind of cap out there and when we look at some of these other programs, like accelerated share repurchases or tenders, we actually don't expect that we would get a whole lot more than what we're acquiring in the open market.","So to date, this has been our view that this is the most efficient way to do that. But we always look at new opportunities and evaluate this regularly going forward as well.","Lee Cooperman","It may change tomorrow, but I noticed your top four holders are reducing their exposure. So Vanguard shows 22.9 million shares, they sold 2 million shares in the third quarter, Canyon reduced to under 10%, BlackRock reduced, Barrow, Mewhinney a large holder sold 5 million shares in the fourth quarter.","It seems to me that you might be able to get more stock than you think on a tender offer and its highly accretive. What is the \u2013 a housekeeping question, what is the actual shares standing at year end?","Jack Remondi","The average CSC is about 222 million.","Chris Lown","The actual was 218 million, around 218 million, 218 million.","Lee Cooperman","218 million, so $1 billion, I assume most of the $1 billion is left?","Chris Lown","Yes. Well, we just started executing against that or implementing.","Lee Cooperman","I would reconsider it. Just ask your advisors, what they think would happen because it seems with the return on equity that you're projecting that the stock deserves to be selling at a much higher price is trading at and my guess is as you continue to shrink the cap, if you reproduce the results you're producing, the stock will be higher. I think the idea is to get it at the lowest price possible at the highest price possible, just a thought, but congratulations on your excellent performance.","Jack Remondi","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. Jack, you mentioned the growth in the consumer lending NII this quarter and in the fourth quarter. And I was wondering if we're getting to the point where that growth rates inflected sustainably? Or maybe you could talk about when we get there, both in consumer lending and maybe in the future on a consolidated basis.","Jack Remondi","Well certainly the consumer lending portfolio, as I said, the net interest income actually increased in the fourth quarter and that's benefiting from two things, right. One is improving NIM and the other is the addition of the refi business.","Certainly, as the refi portfolio grows to be a more material percentage of the total private loan portfolio, those factors will combine to drive net interest income higher. Our forecast right now is for the net interest margin to decline in 2020.","We had a big \u2013 we had a nice benefit from the rate environment, particularly in the fourth quarter as when the fed cut relative to when the loan portfolio reset. We're not anticipating a repeat of that in 2020. So those are some of the drivers there. But we're getting very, very close to that inflection point as you pointed out.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And then I guess sort of follow-up question on some of these regulatory items that are outstanding, could you just give us an update maybe on the CFPB, some of the ED contracts as well and maybe also just touch on what might be out there in the marketplace in terms of portfolio acquisitions. Thank you.","Jack Remondi","Yes. So on the regulatory front, with the, these cases just move at a \u2013 unfortunately at a snail\u2019s pace and that's just a function of the legal process in the civil matters. At this stage on the CFPB side of the equation we\u2019re through fact discovery, we're in the midst of expert witness discovery and resolution. We hope to have that wrapped up sometime in the first half of this year. That would then allow us to file our typical motions for summary judgment.","As we've pointed out and as the courts have actually released information, we have summaries of the depositions of the witnesses that the CFPB plans to present at the trial. And as we pointed out in the past, not a single one of those witnesses has actually asserted that we failed to disclose the information that the CFPB has said we had, in fact, they all said \u201cNo, Navient did provide me with information about income-driven repayment\u201d.","And one-third of them were actually enrolled in income-driven repayment program, so little perplexing on that side. Obviously our desire is for swift justice here. We're confident on the facts and circumstances of the case. We lead the industry in enrollments in income-driven repayment. We've developed innovative solutions that help borrowers enroll in the program more easily.","I'll just take a little side tour here. We implemented a program, that the way the income-driven repayment program works under the department of ED is that, the customer has to leave a servicer\u2019s website and go to studentloans.gov to complete a 10 page application. And we found that customers either weren't doing that or the complexity of the form was a bit overwhelming. And so we were seeing only about 27% of customer success who we\u2019re qualifying for a lower monthly payment under IDR, successfully completing that form in 60 days.","We developed an electronic solution, where we take that information, populate the application for the customer, send it to them for e-signature and we were able to increase the success rate from 27% in 60 days to 72% in 10 days. And so we're really making, these are the types of efforts and innovation that we bring to the table to help our customers, find solutions that keep them out of delinquency and default. We hope these cases get resolved quickly. And as I said, our case, our facts and circumstances remain strong.","On the development side of the equation, the opportunities to buy federal portfolio is obviously getting smaller and smaller. We acquired about $500 million in 2019, most of that is rehabilitation loans. And certainly as the portfolio continues to amortize, on our books, you're seeing the same opportunities amortize away on another entities and just the sheer volume of sellers is relatively small at this point in time.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Jack Remondi","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hammond with Bank of America.","Mark Hammond","Hi, Jack, Chris and Joe. On the capital held, why is over 6% or 6% the right level for basically private loans?","Chris Lown","Great. Thanks for the question. The primary reason that it aligns with the rating agencies with their metrics to keep our ratings where they are and so it really is a metric that supports the \u2013 where the other rating agencies metrics are, so our analysis which is just somewhere above 5%, 6%, keeps us in compliance.","Jack Remondi","And if I could, I would just add to that, if you look at our securitization transactions and the advance rates, it's kind of \u2013 it's more or less consistent with that process and with the adoption of CECL, we're no longer \u2013 we've moved from a holding capital for unexpected losses in the near term to reserving for the full expected life of loan losses. And so a combined \u2013 the combination of the loan loss reserve and the capital levels are actually much, much higher than just the 6% level that you would have seen historically.","Mark Hammond","Sure. On the FFELP loan delinquencies year-over-year, they were up 150 basis points. And I'm just wondering if you guys are seeing anything, I guess, more broadly, that can explain that trend?","Jack Remondi","So as we came out of 2018, there are a number of natural disaster forbearances that got applied. These are program rules have been issued by the Department of Education. So if a county or areas they declare a natural disaster, any delinquent account is brought current and then held in forbearance until the disaster period is lifted. And so you end up with \u2013 as those disasters are lifted, you end up with a little bit of a bubble that moves through the curve, and that's really what you're seeing in the delinquency statistics there.","Overall, our performance and our expectations on delinquency and defaults continues to be extremely strong. We're at or near all-time lows in terms of both delinquencies and defaults on both the federal and private loan portfolios and see that continuing in 2020 given the current strength of the economy.","Mark Hammond","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then a last one for Chris. Your unsecured cost of debt on a spread basis is, is that a five-year low? I wonder, roughly, what's the difference between the cost of funding on that restructured bank facility you mentioned compared to where you think you could raise unsecured funding?","Chris Lown","So it's definitely narrowed, but it's kind of pegged at somewhere around 100 basis points, but obviously, there's a term in the high-yield market, depending on tenor. So obviously, we also have noticed and been encouraged by our credit spreads getting back to where they should be or continuing to tighten but there still is a little bit of delta between the two, although I would highlight that, obviously, the tenure is different, and that is important as well.","Mark Hammond","Totally, so roughly 100 basis points?","Chris Lown","I think today, where you're talking \u2013 I mean, I think, you're probably quoting something in the low fives-ish including the LIBOR spread, so it's somewhere around give or take.","Mark Hammond","All right, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Henry Coffey with Wedbush.","Henry Coffey","Yes, good morning. And let me add my congrats on a great year. On the political front, I know you mentioned a little bit about the servicing contract. I hope I got that right, I did got on late. But on political front or the education reform front, the Trump administration has basically got a year to go. Are there any initiatives that they're looking at in the Department of Ed that are of substance that you think will get accomplished by year-end, I mean, by next January? Or what exactly \u2013 I mean, we had great expectations going in. What exactly is the agenda? And what are likely accomplishments that would help education finance side of the Department of Ed, if any?","Jack Remondi","Well, the big initiative that the Department of Ed is working on, is next-generation servicing platform. And that process has been underway. And been through various rounds of RFPs now for a couple of years. The expectation is that they will actually award contracts in 2020. But to be honest, I would have said the same thing in the beginning of 2019. So we'll have to see how that goes.","There is a new leadership team at FSA. They're very focused on the customer experience and improving outcomes. And really working with servicers to be able to achieve that on a kind of a collaborative way, which we view as a positive. So those are probably the biggest initiatives that we have going on. There's a lot of talk, of course, about borrower activity, how much \u2013 who's financing their loans, whether or not they're affordable. There's also a discussion about some of the repayment options that have that allow for lots of negative amortization on the loan programs, and those are things that we have talked about in the past, and pointed out that there needs to be maybe some better solutions to helping customers be successful in pursuing higher education, completing it and then also how they finance it.","Chris Lown","And it's how would you judge the probability of us getting something of substance done by the end of 2020? Good, great?","Henry Coffey","Good it\u2019s great goal.","Jack Remondi","I would say it\u2019s good. I would say it\u2019s good.","Henry Coffey","Alright thank you very much.","Chris Lown","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question \u2013 [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Moshe Ari Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch","Great, thanks. You guys have mentioned that your kind of core expenses were flat with the third quarter and a year ago, and the guidance for 2020 is a 50% overhead ratio up from 49% this year. Could you kind of maybe square the circle on that a little bit? I mean, are you expecting, given that the margins are expected to be down in 2020. Could you just talk a little bit about what the actual outlook for expenses kind of is in 2020 for, in dollars?","Chris Lown","So we're giving the efficiency ratio as an estimate. Obviously, that can give you guidance around from a dollar perspective. We didn't give a dollar perspective. But what I can tell you is, from a dollar perspective, it will be down as we continue to amortize \u2013 or as we continue to work on our expense base and drive expenses down. So expenses will be down, efficiency ratio will be relatively flat, but we didn't give a specific dollar range this year.","Jack Remondi","We are working on a number of initiatives to continue to improve operating efficiency. When we sold our servicing platform, we began a process, which we're continuing to do work for the acquirer on that space. We expect many of those things to wrap up in 2020. We expect to be able to retire our mainframe as an example, which \u2013 these are some of these items that as we complete this year and move into 2021, we'll continue to see ongoing improvements in our overall operating efficiency ratios.","We're pleased with what we've been able to accomplish to date. As Chris said, we expect total expenses to be down again in 2020 despite continued growth in loan origination volume and relatively flat service levels \u2013 service volume for the loan portfolios.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch","Right. I struggle with the fact that the interest rate environment has been very, very healthy, and you're doing the absolute right thing to take advantage of that as much as you can and for as long as it persists. But there is no kind of guarantee that, that kind of stays with you, and it's good that your expectations for 2020 do have some pressure on that net interest margin. But I guess, that's where it's kind of tricky. I guess, the question in there is, [indiscernible] business long term, I mean, no doubt the demand will be there. But how do you think about in a \"normal interest rate environment\" what you think the volumes you would be willing to do?","Jack Remondi","Well, I think the volumes are really \u2013 the opportunity here is not just the demand side of what customers want, but what we're willing to finance. I think the presentation includes that summary of the financing transactions we completed in 2019 for refi originations, and those types of margins are kind of what we would expect to be able to continue to deliver. We're pricing our product for \u2013 relative to our funding costs. And we expect to generate attracted \u2013 to get to the ROE targets that we're shooting for. These are the types of margins we think we need to continue to target.","What demand would be, is really a function of what the underlying interest rates are in the borrowers' loans. So for Grad PLUS and private student loans, the coupons on those loans are relatively high, and in some instances, particularly private, the majority of those loans are variable. And so customers are looking to take advantage of the fact that they borrowed when they were unemployed and a prospective good credit to three, four years into repayment are now an excellent actual credit, and the prices that we can offer them on those loans based on that credit profile are substantially better than one can get from being a prospective good credit.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Thanks guys for taking my questions. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. So a couple of kind of interesting ones. Number one is, you guys have had very strong originations. Is there any characteristics that you would say were the source of momentum that's persistent?","Jack Remondi","I think our success in the refi space is really driven by a couple of things. One is the way customers can apply for a refi loan here. It's very intuitive. It's very customer friendly. It's very \u2013 it's \u2013 the user experience is, we believe, is the best in the industry. The underwriting model we \u2013 that we employ also gives us greater insight into prospective capabilities, not just the trailing FICO score. That free cash flow number is an important part of our underwriting metrics, and it allows us to be able to better manage and understand the credit profile of the customer.","And then the last feature I'll just add on that side of the application flow is the customers in this area are really looking more about how much \u2013 making a payment based on what they can \u2013 what they want to fit within their budget. And so oftentimes instead of saying I want a ten-year loan or a seven-year loan, they are looking at this and saying, I want to pay x dollars per month and that equates to a 7.2-year loan. And our underwriting process and pricing models are geared towards that, which means that they can get rates that are more interpolated relative to a five- or seven-year term, let's say, a competitor might be offering.","And then the last piece I would say is our marketing approach is principally a digital marketing approach. And so we are working through digital channels, which is where our customers really want to really live and are active, and that's meeting them where they are, but it also drives a cost of acquisition of a typical account that we estimate is about half of what the national average is in this space because we don't have a heavy reliance on things like direct mail.","John Hecht","Okay. Thanks very much for that color. And then second question is you guys historically evaluated, you're purchasing FFELP portfolios, you've bought some special servicing platforms. Just wondering any discussion points around an acquisition pipeline or opportunities around that?","Jack Remondi","I think the opportunities to acquire legacy student loan portfolios continues to shrink as we would have expected. We made a concerted effort when we were launched in 2014 to do that. I think cumulatively, including refi loans, we've now acquired $37 billion worth of student loan since 2014. The majority of those would have been FFELP and private loan portfolios acquired. But our focus today is now on the greater opportunity, which is originations of both refi, and then for the upcoming back-to-school season, in-school lending.","John Hecht","All right. Great, thanks guys.","Jack Remondi","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Arren Cyganovich with Citi.","Arren Cyganovich","Thanks. The contingent collections receivables for the Business Processing business are -- have been rising, but you still have a declining amount in the federal side. Is there any opportunity to get awarded additional on the default of the federal side? And if not, should we expect just the total asset recovery revenues to decline in 2020?","Jack Remondi","Yes, on the federal side, we received a one-time very significant placement from accounts from the Department of Ed back in 2018. And that portfolio is what contributed to the growth in asset recovery revenue that has been shrinking, although will continue to be a meaningful dollar amount in 2020. We certainly are looking for more opportunities in that space with the department.","One of the things that we would point out is that our recovery rates, which is really a function of assisting customers who previously defaulted on a federal loan, rehabilitate that loan, get it back in a good standing and give them the opportunity to be able to perhaps continue to pursue their education and complete it. It has been far ahead of the competition. In terms of the just the success rates in that space, we estimate that we're about 46% better than the next best performing collection agency in that space in terms of recovery rate. So I will certainly continue to pursue opportunities in that arena going forward.","Arren Cyganovich","Thanks.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Joe Fisher.","Joe Fisher","Thanks, Shaun. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. Please contact me or my colleague, Nathan Rutledge, if you have any other follow-up questions.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Navient Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would like to turn the call over to Joe Fisher. You may begin.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Lance. Good morning. And welcome to Navient\u2019s 2018 fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO; and Chris Lown, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the fourth quarter 2018 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted on the Investors page at navient.com.","Thank you. And now, I will turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, and for your interest in Navient. Our fourth quarter results capped a strong year. Our adjusted core earnings per share of $0.58 brings our full year earnings per share to $2.09.","Our 2018 results demonstrate that we have the expertise, systems and data driven strategies to create value by maximizing cash flows, originating high quality loans, growing our fee revenue and improving operating efficiency.","Our actions also demonstrate our commitment to manage capital appropriately by maintaining a strong balance sheet, supporting our loan origination opportunities and returning significant capital to shareholders.","This commitment and focus on creating value produce meaningful contributions in 2018 from all areas of the company, including net interest margins, student loan additions, portfolio performance, fee revenue growth, operating efficiency and capital management.","For example, the net interest margin in our federal and consumer loan segments benefited from our efforts to lower our overall funding costs, we executed on solutions that raise funds at lower rates, refinanced existing facilities and reduced our need to issue unsecured debt.","We developed and implemented successful hedging strategies for our one-month, three-month LIBOR exposure. We improved our return on temporary cash positions and we retired or repurchased $3 billion in high cost unsecured debt.","During 2018, we originated or acquired over $3.6 billion in student loans. This includes 2.8 billion in refi loans. In the last three years, we have added nearly $20 billion in student loans to our portfolio.","Our ability to successfully generate new refi loans demonstrates the strength of our earnest origination platform, combined with our operational expertise and funding capabilities. Importantly, we were able to steadily improve the net interest margin of new refi loans, achieving the highest margins of the year in the fourth quarter.","Credit trends in our FFELP and Private Loan portfolios continued to improve, the strong jobs market in our innovative data driven customer focused strategies had led to lower charge-offs and improving delinquency rates. For example, Private Loan charge-offs declined 16% to 1.7% rate and our FFELP portfolio of 90-day plus delinquency rates are at the lowest levels in over 10 years.","In our Business Processing segment, fee revenue increased 26% to $267 million in 2018 and we delivered 20% organic growth in both our Government Services and Healthcare businesses.","Total revenues also benefited from the full year contribution of our 2017 acquisition of Duncan solutions. Our EBITDA margins in this segment also improved increasing over 30% to 17% in 2018. We continue to leverage our skills and workflow processing, account resolution and data driven strategies to deliver value to our over 600 clients in these markets.","We are always developing new strategies and solutions to improve operating efficiency and customer experience, 2018 was another year where we delivered on these goals. On an apples-to-apples basis, operating expenses declined 11% to $819 million.","We also rolled out a new website for our student loan customers and launched a digital process for income driven repayment application. This all digital application flow greatly benefits our FFELP customers by dramatically simplifying a very complex process. It\u2019s a prime example of how we continue to automate and innovate processes that benefit all stakeholders.","Finally, our goals in 2018 included strengthening our capital ratios, while continuing to return capital to our investors. We did both. Our TNA ratio improved to 1.25 times from 1.20 a year ago.","We paid dividends of $166 million and repurchased $17.4 million shares or 7% of shares outstanding. While we have taken a brief moment to celebrate 2018 results, we are now clearly focused on 2019.","We expect to deliver stable margins in our student loan portfolios by focusing on both the yield and reducing funding costs. Our goal is to add over $4 billion in student loans, including a billion dollars of FFELP and at least $3 billion in refi loans.","Demand for our Refi product remains strong with January shaping up to be our best month ever. We will also benefit from the end of restrictions on who we can market to. We continue to believe, we can generate double digit ROE\u2019s from this low risk product.","Later this year, we planned to launch a new in-school loan product. Our capabilities and insights give us an opportunity to develop a highly competitive offering that promotes responsible borrowing and meets an important need for many families.","The in-school lending market is an attractive opportunity for us. We have the infrastructure, credit expertise and unique marketing insights that will generate assets that we believe can deliver mid-to-high teens returns on equity. Our target this year is modest. It is to disperse at least $150 in 2019.","I am excited about leveraging our skills and infrastructure to generate attractive low risk assets and to deliver value from our refi and in-school lending products. We also expect to see strong credit performance in both our FFELP and consumer loan portfolios, and we are starting the year off in a strong position and expect these positive performance trends to continue.","Our ongoing efforts to improve our operating efficiency will deliver results again in 2019. We continue to develop and implement new automation tools, and deliver simpler solution tools to our customers. Even with growth in our business process, servicing and new loan origination segments, our total adjusted operating expense will decline again in 2019.","Finally, our strong starting capital position and cash flow generation will allow us to return nearly $600 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Though only three weeks into the year, we are off to a strong start and are excited about the ability to deliver value for our customers and our investors. I look forward to your questions later in the call.","Now let me turn the call over to Chris for a more detailed review of this quarter\u2019s results.","Chris Lown","Thank you, Jack, and thank you to everyone on today\u2019s call for your interest in Navient. During my prepared remarks, I will review the fourth quarter and full year results for 2018. I will be referencing the earnings call presentation, which can be found on the company\u2019s website in the Investor section.","Starting on slide three. Adjusted core CPS was $0.58 in the fourth quarter versus $0.43 from the year ago quarter. For the full year adjusted core EPS was $2.09.","A few key highlights from the quarter include refinance loan originations of $769 million, improving credit quality and lower adjusted operating expenses. In addition, we benefited from a lower effective tax rate of 19% in that quarter and then $18 million gain from the repurchase of $1.4 billion of unsecured debt.","For 2019, we are providing additional transparency on the key targets and metrics we use to measure the success for the company and its business units. These metrics and targets are highlighted on slide four.","As the portfolio of federal education and legacy private education loans continues to amortize, we remain focused on managing our net interest margins across the portfolio and reducing charge-offs to maximize cash flows.","With regard to our fee-based businesses, improving our EBITDA margins and generating organic growth opportunities are key measures of success. Contributions from these segments coupled with our nascent loan origination businesses, the end of our non-compete with Sallie Mae should generate attractive mid teens ROE\u2019s for the company.","In addition, we remain committed to our tangible net asset ratio range of 1.23 times to 1.25 times and ensuring that excess capital is returned to shareholders. As mentioned on the previous slide, we are laser focused on maximizing the cash flows from our education loan portfolios.","As can be seen on slide five, we generated an additional 6 billion of cash flows between 2014 and 2016 versus our original projections at separation from Sallie Mae. These cash flows are generated primarily through enhanced financing activities and education loan acquisitions. Our updated cash flow projections can be found in the appendix of this presentation and do not include the benefits of future loan originations or acquisitions.","Let\u2019s move on to segment reporting beginning with the Federal Education Loans on slide six. Core earnings were $147 million for the fourth quarter and $580 million for the full year. The provision for FFELP loans declined 17% from the year ago quarter. This is consistent with our expectations, as the delinquency rates have significantly declined from a year ago.","The net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 86 basis points and our full year net interest margin of 83 basis points ended the year at the high end of our guidance. This positive trend was a result of numerous proactive financing transactions we executed throughout the year. Contingency collections inventory increased by over $13 billion from the prior year. This increase contributed to the 21% growth in asset recovery revenue from the third quarter.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide seven and our Consumer Lending segment. Core earnings in this segment were $66 million for the quarter and $252 million for the full year. During the quarter, we originated $769 million of Education Refinance Loans and $2.8 billion for all of 2018.","We continued to see healthy demand and strong credit performance in this product, and we have continued to increase our average coupon rate on new originations. We are excited about the additional opportunities to expand our product in 2019 and expect at least $3 billion of refi originations.","The full year consumer lending net interest margin was 324 basis points, in line with our expectations. Our financing and operational initiatives have resulted in improving net interest margins on both our legacy and newly originated refinance loan products.","At year end education refinance loans represented 14% or $3.2 billion of our Consumer Lending portfolio, compared to 3% or $761 million a year ago. Our NIM guidance of 3.1% to 3.2% for 2019 is a result of the shifting mix of our portfolio towards the higher quality refinance loans.","Let\u2019s continue to slide eight to review our Business Processing segment. Fee revenues on the segment grew 10% from the year ago quarter, with EBITDA margins improving by 50%. The 26% increase from the prior year, contingent collections inventory is primarily a result of increased placements from federal and local government services contracts.","In 2019, we expect full year revenue of at least $270 million, with EBITDA margins in the high-teens. While we anticipate high-teens revenue growth in our Healthcare segment, the loss of the previously discussed tolling contract will mitigate overall growth in this segment in 2019.","Let\u2019s turn to slide nine to provide additional color on our continued focus on expenses. For the full year, our ongoing operating expense initiatives resulted in an 11% decline in adjusted operating expenses, exceeding the decline in the average balance of our total education loan portfolio.","For 2019, we expect operating expenses, excluding regulatory restructuring costs of between $940 million and $960 million, which is a 5% year-over-year decline, when excluding the one-time non-cash impact of the contingency reserve release in the second quarter of 2018.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 10, which highlights our financing activity. During the quarter, the company repurchased $10.6 million shares for $125 million and we have $440 million of remaining authority under our share repurchase program. Importantly, we did this while increasing our tangible net asset ratio to 1.25 times. For 2019, we expect to continue to operate within a 1.23 times to 1.25 times TNA ratio range.","In the fourth quarter, we actively repurchased $1.4 billion of our unsecured debt to make calls [ph] and open market transactions. As a result of these actions, we were able to reduce our 2019 maturities by $1.3 billion, while also taking advantage of the recent market dislocation to realize the core earnings gain of $18 million in the quarter.","In the quarter, we issued two private education loan ABS transactions totaling $1.3 billion. For the full year, we issued $3 billion of private education loan ABS, compared to $662 million for all of 2017.","Before turning to GAAP results, I\u2019d like to recap our full year 2019 guidance on slide 11, which excludes expenses associated with regulatory costs and restructuring expenses. In 2019, we expect core earnings per share between the $1.93 and $2.03, operating expenses between $940 million and $960 million, full year FFELP net interest margin in the low to mid 80s, full year private education loan and interest margin between 310 basis points and 320 basis points, full year private education refinance loan originations of at least $3 billion and full year business processing revenue of at least $270 million, with expected EBITDA margins in the high-teens.","Let\u2019s turn to GAAP results on slide 12. We recorded fourth quarter GAAP net income of $72 million or $0.28 per share, compared with a net loss of $84 million or a loss of $0.32 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative position.","In summary, in 2018 we meaningfully reduced operating expenses across the company, successfully executed on our earnest business plan, developed and executed multiple financing transactions, bolstered our capital position and returned nearly $400 million in capital to shareholders. In addition, we are well-positioned to execute on our 2019 plans and look forward to another successful year.","I will now open the calls for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, my first question is on the in-school origination channel, obviously, you guys put some targets out there. Could you just talk about what the driving factors are, whether would come in in-line weaker or more. I guess, Jack you have talked, historically, about, there might be other avenues through third-parties to actually accelerate the growth there. What kind of discussions have you had so far?","Jack Remondi","So, our -- first of all, we view this market as an attractive opportunity for us based on our expertise in this particular area and really the strong insights and data that we bring from servicing loans for so long. I also think there\u2019s an opportunity for us to really differentiate our products in a marketplace that really hasn\u2019t seen a whole lot of change or innovation in the last 10 years.","Our focus is a direct to consumer approach through the school channels. So it is marketing the product similar to the way we do our refi products, which is a digital first approach. And $150 million represents origination volume that is just the first half of the disbursements that would typically take place in an academic year cycle. So full academic year originations booked and processed in 2019 would total about $300 million.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And do you think that there\u2019s room to do better on that number and what might accelerate that?","Jack Remondi","Well, certainly, if you look at the market opportunities here, our focus will be on first time borrowers. So we expect that many borrower -- many students and families who have borrowed previously in the private education marketplace will return to their existing lender. But these are, as I said, I think, these are modest expectations and we would certainly work hard to beat them in any way we can.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And just one follow-up on the refi product, obviously, you guys had a very strong year this year and you are expecting more of the same. Could you just talk about where the opportunities lie going forward? Is that part -- is part of the optimism there, just as a result of the non-compete ending or is there opportunities without that even to hit those targets? Thanks.","Jack Remondi","So, I -- it\u2019s a good question and I think the opportunities here really come from a couple of different sources. One is expect graduate school students who have been borrowing in the Grad PLUS marketplace are generally paying still or paying relatively high interest rates and there\u2019s an opportunity for them based on the progression that they have experienced in the job market and their income levels to materially reduce the interest rate that they pay on their loans. That\u2019s still represents an opportunity for us as more recent graduates move into that very, very strong credit quality perspective.","And certainly on the private education loan side of the equation refinancing those loans is also an -- effectively an expanding opportunity for us in 2019 as the non-compete expired on January 1st, so it\u2019s really a combination of the two markets.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Jack Remondi","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Tarkan from Compass Point. Your line is open.","Michael Tarkan","Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the credit side on -- in Private. Thanks for the color around the charge-off guidance. I am just kind of curious if you can touch on how you think about reserves as you are continuing to mix towards earnest? And maybe if you can unpack sort of how to think about reserves on the legacy portfolio versus earnest, versus what you are going to be reserving for on the in-school product?","Jack Remondi","So which -- we are seeing very strong trends in credit performance really across the Board, but particularly strong performance in the refi portfolio. Our credit losses continue to come in below the guidance levels that we have provided in the past and on our legacy portfolio you have got -- the non-TDR segment of the portfolio credit losses are continuing to push into new historic lows and that\u2019s really a function of the -- seasoning of the portfolio and then, of course, a very strong economy.","The outperformance that we continue to see is really coming though from the TDR portfolio. These are borrowers who have experienced some difficulty in the past. As you know, we are reserved for the full life of the loan, loss expectations there, but credit performance has been particularly strong really as we have been able to continue to find innovative solutions to make sure that we are able to connect with these customers and work with them to find solutions that make loan payments affordable and manageable for them.","And I think that -- the biggest contrast I would put here in this portfolio compared to the Federal Loan programs is that we work to make sure that consumers are still amortizing their loan balance. So that they are seeing themselves make progress towards paying down that debt and moving forward. So those are the combination in the drivers there.","Michael Tarkan","Thanks. Just as a follow-up, I mean, as it relates to your reserves as a percentage of loans and repayment. Should we continue to expect that or should we expect that to drift lower in \u201819 and \u201820 as the mix shifts more towards earnest?","Chris Lown","Yeah. I think it should -- you should see that on two parts. One the mix shift, obviously, moving towards the higher quality portfolios, and as Jack mentioned, our refi product is performing better than our expectations, which is a great result.","But in addition, as these loans are seasoned and amortized, we are seeing better performance as well. Obviously, we are heading into seasonal, not all -- that will change how we manage this on that loan basis, but for 2019 what you said to transpire.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. Thanks. And then last one for me, just back to the in-school product, do you view kind of the competitive environment and where pricing is generally across your competitors. Do you think there\u2019s an opportunity there or I am just kind of curious what the go-to-market strategy is to scale the product a little bit faster?","Jack Remondi","So we will be launching this a little bit later this year as the 2019, \u201820 academic year cycle begins and I think I\u2019d rather reserve our marketing strategy and approach until we officially launch the product there.","Michael Tarkan","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Just, first of all, on the guidance, could you just tell us how much buyback is in -- is kind of in your guidance for 2019?","Chris Lown","Well, as I have mentioned, there\u2019s $440 million of remaining authority. That\u2019s all we have in the authority that\u2019s what\u2019s in the -- in our guidance.","Moshe Orenbuch","In the guidance, great. And I guess, given that you are at your 1.25 TNA ratio, what -- not to sound greedy. But how do we think about the possibility of having more available than that, like, how do you think about that and how do you think about the trade-off between that and some of the asset growth choices that you are making?","Chris Lown","I think, Moshe, as you well know, we are all heading into seasonal in a year, we are all trying to make sure that we manage in through that process in a way that is at least disruptive as possible for the business and to capital return and to the markets, and we are all still want to make sure that in that transition we are prepared, there\u2019s still a lot of questions from the rating agencies and from the regulators that we are all still trying to determine.","And so, historically, I have talked about the 1.23 times to 1.25 times range, I have probably talked about wanting to be at the top end of that. I think about the amount of capital return we are going to have in 2019, which as Jack mentioned, nearly $600 million plus, hopefully, being able to transition through a seasonal in a way that is least impactful.","So, obviously, if there is an opportunity where we find ourselves in an excess capital position or generate excess cash then we would, as we have committed to return that excess capital to shareholders.","But I think we have a pretty strong plan in place now with a lot of transparency that should give some pretty good guidance.","And as you think about capital allocation that you talked about, I think, the new products versus what we are doing. Again, I think, what we are trying to do is manage that capital allocation process.","We still believe that at scale the refi business and the in-school business is a low-to-mid-teens plus ROE business and when you think about that from a capital generation -- from a return perspective that\u2019s a pretty compelling opportunity, as well as returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders. So it\u2019s a -- but it\u2019s a great question, that\u2019s what we think about all the time.","Moshe Orenbuch","Just to follow-up on, I think, Jack made a comment on the refi business is being kind of at the highest margins of the year in the fourth quarter. I guess, I wanted to square that with the securitization data, which kind of showed margins of -- over 2.2% earlier in the year and 1.6% in the December securitization, so that\u2019s kind of down 60 basis points. And now you have got you know key buying lower road [ph]. I guess maybe can you kind of square those things with that expectation?","Jack Remondi","So margins, what we securitized in the fourth quarter would not have been Q4 originations and there\u2019s a -- in a rising rate environment, our hedging activities effectively don\u2019t show up in the securitization spreads. So when we are hedging those fixed rates that we are offering to consumers, when we go to securitize the benefit of those hedges don\u2019t show up in the cost of funds reported there.","But margin pressure, we definitely saw in a rising rate environment, particularly a more rapidly rising rate environment and it\u2019s not, of course, it\u2019s not just what the Fed does, but it\u2019s what the markets are doing. Margins were pressured in the mid part of 2018. We made a concerted effort to focus on improving those, and as I said, we had the highest margins of the year in the fourth quarter.","Moshe Orenbuch","I am not sure I understand that, maybe we can take it offline. But if there are benefits from hedging that are not in the securitizations, I mean, because usually\u2026","Jack Remondi","You are locking in\u2026","Moshe Orenbuch","\u2026some money, yeah.","Jack Remondi","Well, if you are locking in the rate, if you are making loans and you are offering a fixed rate to a consumer and you are locking that in through a derivative trans -- well, hedging that to a derivative transaction, but not issuing the debt until three months or four months later or two months later, that hedge accounting rules don\u2019t allow you to transfer that hedge over into the securitization cost of funds. We can -- well, we can take it offline now if you don\u2019t understand with more detail [ph].","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Giambrone from Barrow Hanley. Your line is open.","Mark Giambrone","Good morning.","Jack Remondi","Hi, Mark.","Mark Giambrone","Congratulations on the great quarter and the concise information of what\u2019s going on. Most of my questions have been asked, but one question I did have is for the refinance loans, what is the life of loan there? How long you expect those to stay on the balance sheet?","Jack Remondi","So the weighted average life of those loans, obviously, terms go well classless, but the weighted average life of these loans is three and a half to four years and so as they cycle through the securitizations that\u2019s our expectation and that\u2019s what we have seen. The speeds have been relatively constant, this is a pretty fast paying off loan and so from a risk return perspective we do think it\u2019s pretty attractive.","Mark Giambrone","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Jack Remondi","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hammond from Bank of America High Yields. Your line is open.","Mark Hammond","Thanks. Hi, Jack, Chris and Joe. I had two quick ones, so far in-school, in-school origination, do your existing private loan facilities except those loans as collateral, I am just trying to get a sense for how you will finance the in-school originations in the near-term as it ramps up?","Jack Remondi","So we will be structuring new warehouses their facilities today don\u2019t contemplate an in-school loan, it\u2019s obviously a different loan, it\u2019s a different disbursement and different hold. But I can tell you is that there is a lot of banks who are discussing with us about warehouse opportunities. This isn\u2019t an uncommon structure, it is attractive from a financing perspective, so if there is a significant amount of capital out there we are looking to continue to finance assets and are very attracted to this loan as well -- this loan type as well.","Mark Hammond","Okay. And then, my second loan was regarding the mention of longer dated bonds that Navient repurchased in 4Q. Would you happen to be able to share, which bonds are repurchased. I know the five-year and five-year base [ph] of 2033 are out there, but it\u2019s not the only ones. So I was wondering if you can share?","Jack Remondi","Right. So we had the opportunity in the dislocation. We were offered a bond that was at a very attractive price and as I think about this from a capital allocation perspective, we look at the term of that bond, as you said it was in the -- it was past 2030. It was a foreign currency bond, which means there was a derivative against it and there is capital against it.","And so as I looked at that it was -- we as a team look at what that discount represented from a return perspective versus what our cost to issue a new five-year or seven-year was. What the benefit was to the P&L from that perspective, those are all very attractive, so we decided to retire that foreign currency denominated bond.","Mark Hammond","Got it. Thank you. Much appreciated.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Rick Shane from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Rick Shane","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. I just want to go through, I think, you started to touch on it and provide some color in the last response. But from a GAAP basis you reported a $28 million gain on the retirement of the bonds, from a core perspective you reported an $18 million gain. I just want to make sure we understand the difference? And also, if you guys can sort of help us understand why we should think about that gain as a part of core income?","Jack Remondi","Yeah. The primary difference is there is a difference in accounting for the derivatives and so really it just a derivative issue what you see in our core versus GAAP numbers normally. So it\u2019s just the unwind of that and we can take it offline, I mean, it\u2019s just simple as that.","Rick Shane","Got it. And in terms of how to think about this in terms of core income?","Jack Remondi","The gain.","Rick Shane","Yeah. As opposed to, I mean, because again core income suggests recurring and I just want to when we think about the things we add and subtract from core income, want to hear your thoughts on why you\u2019d include this in core?","Jack Remondi","I mean it falls within our definition of core and net income. I would just go back to that definition and think about it from that perspective. I understand what you are saying, but it \u2013 again, from a perspective of definition it falls within it.","Chris Lown","We are highlighting it, so investors can see that was a benefit that is not something we expect to repeat in every single quarter. But it\u2019s not a mark-to-market related issue that we exclude on the derivative transactions, for example, under GAAP.","Rick Shane","Got it. Okay. That makes sense. That\u2019s a good distinction. Thank you, guys.","Operator","There are no questions at the moment. Joe Fisher, please continue.","Joe Fisher","Thanks, Lance. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. If you have any other follow-up questions feel free to give me a call. This concludes today\u2019s call.","Operator","Thank you for joining. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Jessa and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Navient First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Joe Fisher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Jessa. Good morning and welcome to Navient\u2019s 2016 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO and Somsak Chivavibul, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future maybe materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures, we call our core earnings. A description of our core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the first quarter 2016 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted along with the earnings press release on the Investors page at navient.com.","Thank you. And now, I will turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our results for the first quarter are consistent with our plans. We earned an adjusted $0.44 in core earnings per share, with student loan margins and operating expenses in line with expectations. Credit was a bright spot this quarter and I will touch on this topic a bit more in a moment.","During the quarter, we continued to focus on several key areas: improving our access to and the cost of funding, delivering value to our customers and clients, capturing new business opportunities, improving our operating efficiency and growing the value of our company. While the work in these areas is never complete, I am pleased with our efforts, execution and results this quarter. We have been working on a number of fronts to address our access to funding and specifically funding for our government guaranteed FFELP assets. As you know, Moody\u2019s and Fitch have been reviewing their criteria for rating term FFELP asset-backed loans. Unfortunately today, they have not issued any updated guidance.","While we currently believe that the final criteria will be more favorable than the initial draft proposals, we have decided not to wait any longer to restart our FFELP ABS program. We completed our first FFELP ABS transaction in the first quarter, followed earlier this month with the second sale. Combined, we have now issued $1.6 billion in FFELP ABS bonds, investor reception was good and more importantly, even stronger in the second deal. We also completed an extension of our FFELP conduit facility, pushing the maturity date out 1 year to 2018. This facility was also scheduled to decline to $7 billion in size. Given the potential for FFELP portfolio purchases, we increased the size to $7.5 billion. And extending this facility and returning to the FFELP ABS market demonstrates the high quality of the FFELP portfolio in the confidence of lenders and investors in our securities.","We are also addressing the potential rating agency impacts on outstanding bonds. As of today, we have extended the legal final maturity date on $4.8 billion in bonds. While we believe the assumptions used to determine the new maturity date of these extensions are unnecessarily long or said differently, we certainly expect the loans to payoff prior to the new maturity dates. We have worked with bondholders to extend the maturity date of their bonds in order to protect the value of their investment.","Also on the financing front, we completed a private loan securitization in the first quarter. And last week, we completed our second private credit residual financing. Combined, these transactions raised over $525 million in free cash. The proceeds will be used to further reduce our unsecured debt. Combined, our steady and significant financing activity ensures that we have ample liquidity to run our business, pursue portfolio acquisitions and increase the intrinsic value for shareholders.","As we all know, it\u2019s an election year. So student loan performance and indebtedness continues to be a regular political and media topic. The data reported here is often misleading, confusing and driven by anecdotes instead of facts. For example, it was recently reported that few student loan borrowers are making payments on their loans. The calculation here is complicated by the way the program reports outstanding balances. Unique to the federal loan program is that cumulative defaults are included in delinquency and repayment statistics since there is no charge-off for bad debt used by the federal government. This would be fine if the statistics also included the balances that were paid down, but they do not. As a result, borrowers who successfully repaid their loans are excluded from the analysis.","For the record, the loans we own our customers are successfully making payments on their loans, having made over $3.6 billion in payments to principal in the first quarter. What we see from over 12 million customers with over $300 billion in balances is continued improvement in credit performance. For our private loans, our 90 plus delinquency rate fell to 3.2% at March 31, down from 3.6% a year ago. And importantly, the dollar balance of loans over 90 days past due declined over 20% from a year ago to $749 million. The charge-off rate also improved declining 17% from the year ago quarter to 2.4%. And the performance this quarter and the reductions in delinquent dollar balances at quarter end are positive signs for the remainder of the year.","We continue to work to capture new business opportunities. During the quarter, we acquired $1.5 billion in FFELP Loans. We are beginning to see signs that opportunities to purchase additional student loan portfolios will increase. Our processing business in the municipal and healthcare areas is also growing nicely. For example, we have recently won a new multiyear contract in New Jersey as well as new contracts in Arizona, Pennsylvania, California and Mississippi to name a few. And we expanded our healthcare receivable services to new hospitals in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Wisconsin.","This month, the Department of Education issued an RFP for a single servicing platform. The request for proposals is to provide a servicing platform not loan services. Our existing servicing contract extends into 2019. Our team here is actively engaged in evaluating the opportunity with respect to the system RFP. Like most financial services entities, we are working to continuously improve our operating efficiency and we have several initiatives underway to accelerate our pace here. We plan to exit 2016 with a lower run rate operating expense level and where we are today. This is another example of our efforts to add value for our clients and other stakeholders.","During the quarter, we purchased 19.2 million shares at an average price of $10.42, a level significantly below what we see as the intrinsic value of the company. Capturing the opportunity here allows us to increase the intrinsic value per share to non-selling shareholders. Our stock price is up significantly from its low earlier this year. Still, it does not reflect the full value of the company as we see it. Our focus on funding, capturing new business opportunities, improving operating efficiency and taking advantage of the mis-priced market has allowed us to add value. We will continue this focus and execution going forward.","Now, I will turn the call over to Somsak for a deeper look at our financial results and I look forward to taking your questions later. Sak?","Somsak Chivavibul","Thanks Jack. Good morning everyone. During my prepared remarks, I will review the first quarter results before highlighting recent financing activities that took place. I will be referencing the earnings call presentation available on the company\u2019s website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.44, which excludes regulatory-related costs during the quarter. Our first quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $243 million versus $230 million a year ago. The increase in these expenses is related to the additional costs resulting from the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare. Excluding the expenses associated with these acquisitions, operating expenses were lower \u2013 6% lower than a year ago.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 and discuss our FFELP segment results. In the quarter, we acquired $1.5 billion of FFELP student loans. While many major holders continue to wait for the resolution from the rating agencies related to the legal final maturities, we are beginning to see renewed interest in portfolio sales as well as FFELP ABS transactions. FFELP core earnings were $66 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $85 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFELP core earnings was primarily a result of the lower FFELP balance compared to the prior year and a net interest margin of 81 basis points, which was in line with our expectations. The FFELP net interest margin declined from the fourth quarter, due mainly to the seasonal impact of floor income rebates that occurred during the first quarter of each year. During the quarter, we did had some additional $295 million of floor income, bringing future hedge floor income to $1 billion. We are also seeing improving credit trends in our FFELP portfolio, as demonstrated by the 17% improvement in our 90-day delinquency rate.","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 6, for a review of our private education loan segment. Core earnings in this segment decreased $16 million in the year ago quarter to $61 million. The decline is primarily the result of the declining balance in our private education loan portfolio and lower net interest margin. The decline in NIM was partially offset by the $16 million reduction in our loan loss provision. This reduction came as a result of the improved credit performance that we continued to see in our delinquency forbearance and charge-off rates. Charge-offs declined $46 million or 24% from the prior year. The improved performance demonstrates the power of seasoning that we have seen in our portfolio.","Slide 7 highlights some of those improvements in our private education loan asset quality trends over the last 5 years. This portfolio is well seasoned with 95% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. Our first quarter charge-offs came in at 2.4% and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.2%. The chart on the bottom of this slide demonstrates the benefits of improved performance it\u2019s having in our borrower\u2019s FICO scores. The non-traditional loans that we have in our portfolio today have improved their FICO scores by 35 points on average over the last 5 years. Today, these loans are non-traditional in the name only and we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this segment of the portfolio.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $75 million in the quarter compared with $86 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily related to the expected decline in education related revenues. Our non-federal student loan related asset recovery revenues increased by $30 million from the year ago quarter to $51 million. The increase in these revenues was primarily related to the additions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015. As Jack noted, we have been leveraging our skills and platforms to grow our non-federal student loan related businesses steadily over the last few quarters and we continued to win additional contracts in this space.","On Slide 9, I would like to highlight our recent financing activities that we completed so far in 2016. In the past two months, we have issued over $1.6 billion of FFELP asset backed securities. $1.1 billion in 2016-1 transaction that took place in the first quarter was the largest FFELP securitization in over 2 years. This transaction was done in conjunction with the loan acquisition from the third party and was unique because we did not utilize any funding capacity for this transaction. Lastly, we closed down an additional $497 million FFELP securitization. This was the first broadly marketed FFELP transaction since June of last year. And this securitization was met a strong investment demand and included over 18 unique investors receiving allocation. This portfolio reduced securities priced at one month LIBOR plus 138 basis points, with the weighted average life of 5.2 years, with rest rating agencies safety concerns, both these transactions are structured with long legal final maturity dates and is date specific full turbo feature. While we continued to wait for Moody\u2019s and Fitch to provide final ratings methodology, we have been actively extending the legal final maturity dates on various trusts. Just on Monday, we announced the maturity extension on $1.2 billion of bonds. And since December 2015, we have now extended the legal final maturity date on $4.8 billion of bonds.","As Jack mentioned earlier, we also increased and extended our FFELP A, B, C, D facilities. This facility\u2019s revolving period was extended to March 2018. The maximum financing amount, which was originally scheduled for step down of $7 billion was increased to $7.5 billion. Facility extension and funding costs were consistent with our plan. Not all of our activity was related to FFELP during the quarter. We also issued a $488 million private education loan ABS in January in the AAA portion of this transaction priced at one month LIBOR plus 231 basis points, with a 4.9 year weighted average life. On April 15, we added three trusts to our existing private education loan repurchase facility, providing an additional $478 million of financing. This facility allows us to borrow against private student loan over-prioritization and our private education loan securitization that is like full turbo repayment feature. The proceeds from these transactions will be used to pay down our unsecured debt.","On that front, our unsecured debt declined by $1 billion in the quarter to $14.2 billion outstanding at quarter end. And I will note that over the last 15 months, we have reduced our unsecured debt outstanding by $3.3 billion or 19%. So as you can see, we remained focused on reducing the total amount of unsecured debt outstanding and smoothing out the maturity profile that are not predictable cash flows from our education loan portfolio. In the quarter, we have repurchased 19.2 million shares for $200 million, at an average price of $10.42. And at quarter end, we have the remaining authority of $565 million under our share repurchase authority. All of this activity was undertaking, while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25x.","Finally turning to GAAP results on Slide 10, we recorded first quarter GAAP net income of $181 million or $0.53 per share and that\u2019s compared with net income of $292 million or $0.72 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the months related to our dilutive position, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM bank that we spun from.","That concludes my remarks and we will open now the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Beardsley from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Eric Beardsley","Hi, thank you. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the business services revenue should ramp up over the course of the year and if we should still think about the guidance of $620 million to $650 million as still being the target?","Somsak Chivavibul","Eric, that is absolutely still the target there. I think we are on track to meet this target based on these first quarter results.","Eric Beardsley","Got it. And then just on the credit I guess given the strength that you saw in the first quarter, I think certainly the trend is implying better than the guidance for 2.3% to 2.5% that you had, I guess how much upside could we think about to the provision here for the year into the charge-off rate?","Somsak Chivavibul","Still obviously, it\u2019s just the first quarter, but the trends here are positive. I think the big number to look at is the amount that is in the 90-day plus delinquency balance, so $749 million gives you an indication of what the potential of what\u2019s available and in fact the default over the next 9 months. But we are \u2013 we are keeping our guidance the same here and we certainly look to benefit from better performance and expected.","Eric Beardsley","Got it. And then just lastly, after you did the latest private loan O\/C deal, how much capacity left to do you have in those turbo loans through similar deals and could you just talk about your appetite to issue unsecured debt still over the rest of the year?","Somsak Chivavibul","Well, let me take the first part of that question, Eric. So as of today, we have got about $2.1 million of O\/C balances left in these turbo deals that we have not finished yet. However, those balances will grow over time and by the time they reach their call date it\u2019s expected to grow to about $3.1 billion. Then the second piece of the question was related to the unsecured debt. Certainly, yes, we would like to access the unsecured debt market, but the cost right now is high relative to other sources of financings that we can access. But certainly, we think that once we get through the legal final maturity issue and some of the other unknowns out there, we want to be able to access the unsecured market hopefully in the second half of the year.","Eric Beardsley","Okay, great. Thank you.","Jack Remondi","And I would just add to that, we have more than enough liquidity to meet and service our debt obligations here, including our peak maturity periods. What we really want to do is as Somsak said smooth out those items to create a little bit more flexibly for us, particularly if we see opportunities to buy student loan portfolios. It\u2019s \u2013 we are certainly pleased with the improvements we have seen in terms of access to funding and liquidity over the last both what we did in the fourth quarter of last year and what we were able to accomplish this quarter. The return to the FFELP ABS market is a good indication of the broadening of that access and we will continue to be opportunistic where we see those opportunities.","Eric Beardsley","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Good morning. First question, I feel like I asked the question in many calls. Could you just talk about maybe the timing of potential ruling for Moody\u2019s or kind of resolvement of the issue and then where your discussions are with CFPB? Thanks.","Jack Remondi","Sure. So, on the rating agency side, obviously, this has been an open item now for over a year. It\u2019s \u2013 we are clearly disappointed in terms of the amount of time it\u2019s taking to get to a resolution. You know the challenge here is the cash flow aspects of federal student loans are fairly complex, there is over 56 different repayment options available to borrowers, including I think nine income driven repayment solutions alone. And what we have seen historically is that while borrowers can in fact take advantage of multiple opportunities in some form of sequential fashion that\u2019s actually not \u2013 that\u2019s not how the practice actually unfolds. And so I think the struggle has been what the customer \u2013 what customers are eligible to do versus what they really do. And what we are seeing on the FFELP side of the equation as we see in our private loan is that as the portfolios season, borrowers grow, their actual income and their income potential grows and delinquencies fall and repayments increase. So, we are looking to get the rating agencies and work with the rating agencies to get this issue resolved as quickly as possible.","But as we said in our comments, at this point in time, we decided to not wait for those resolutions and return to the FFELP ABS market. On the regulatory front, we continue to have ongoing dialogue with the entities. I think a lot of the issues and items are related to how borrowers access and understand the different programs that are available to them. We are a firm believer that the program terms and options are too many and too complex, but at the end of the day, we know that when 9 times out of 10 when we reach a delinquent customer, we are able to explain those options to them and get them into a repayment plan that keeps them out of default. Our biggest challenge in preventing defaults and helping people enroll in income driven repayment programs is contact with the customer. Over 90% of the loans, federal loans that we service that do end up in default and we are at a much smaller rate than all other servicers, not those consumers do not respond to the extensive efforts we make, to reach them. And as you know, we can\u2019t help a delinquent customer take advantage of the opportunities that are available to them if we can\u2019t reach them.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Do you envision both of these issues being resolved over the next 6 months or so or is it more open-ended?","Jack Remondi","Well, if you are asking me what I wish and what we are able to do, I mean, we are one side of the transaction and so we can\u2019t \u2013 we have been very responsive to the rating agencies. We provided them with extensive amounts of data and analytics to help them along in their way, but we can\u2019t convene the meetings and take the votes. On the regulatory side of the equation, we are working aggressively with the regulators to make sure that they understand what we are doing, how we run our business and certainly, more than willing to work with them to improve the way the federal student loan program works and operates so that we produce better results. We and our peers in the industry produce better results. But I can\u2019t tell you when, we are one side of the transaction, I can\u2019t help \u2013 I can\u2019t predict when all of these things unfold and resolved.","Sanjay Sakhrani","That\u2019s fair. One quick follow-up on, for Somsak, I guess Somsak you mentioned there is renewed interest in portfolio sales, can you just talk about the nature of those M&A potential deals?","Somsak Chivavibul","Sure. This particular, the first deal was one that I think came in conjunction with that ABS transaction. The fact that we are able to get back to an ABS deal I think opens the door for future transactions nearly because there was that avenue previously over the last year to be able to acquire portfolios unless you had access to term funding. So, I think the fact that we return to the ABS market with two ABS transactions will open the door to acquisitions and I will remind you if we did, we did acquire in addition to the $1.1 billion portfolio. We did acquire another $400 million of loans. So, I think once we get through this and then get through the legal final maturity issue, I think the opportunities for acquired portfolios will open up.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And to be clear, the motivation is still there by the larger banks to sell their portfolios not to retain them?","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes. But as you know, right the pricing will be \u2013 was partly determined by what the funding cost is to fund these assets and the cost or assets to funding is not there or the cost is elevated, it\u2019s going to impact the pricing that sellers might be willing to accept.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Just a follow-up on the whole FFELP situation, the spreads on those transactions were still on the wider end, does it require the kind of resolution by Moody\u2019s to get the spreads down, how do you think about that recognizing, you would obviously rather have it rather sooner, but do you have any thoughts there?","Jack Remondi","I think we saw spreads tightened and there are tightening even without a resolution from the rating agencies side. But your point is correct, I mean we believe they would tighten it even further if we were able to close this issue. The legal final maturity dates that we are embedding in new deals and the dates we are using to amend old deals is very long. And so we believe that is providing the protection to investors to make sure that the ratings will exist throughout the life of the bond. At the end of the day, what the rating agency assumptions are however, don\u2019t really don\u2019t impact what the cash flows actually are in the transactions. And we are confident based on the payment activity that we see of our behavior that those maturity dates are \u2013 those legal final maturity dates are well in excess of what\u2019s required. The deals that we acquired, the portfolios, the 1.5 billion of FFELP loans that we acquired this quarter, reflect current spreads and funding costs and term ABS. And so from our perspective, we believe we aren\u2019t \u2013 the earnings that we will generate from those transactions is similar spreads were tighter. We just believe that as spreads tightened, we will see increased opportunities to buy loans, which is obviously what we are hoping for.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. And maybe could you just talk a little bit about where you would want to see unsecured spreads before you actually were kind of willing to issue unsecured debt because it just feels like I mean you have done so much of varied sources of financing, but there still seems to be some doubt and I think that would probably put people\u2019s mind at ease a little more, could you just discuss that?","Jack Remondi","Yes. I think the \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013 I am not sure we want to provide an exact level of where we would be issuing here. I think the big opportunity for us is we don\u2019t need to borrow funds to grow our liability base. We just want to smooth out our unsecured debt maturities. So to the extent that spreads are unattractive, we just changes the timing of certain cash flow distributions, but it doesn\u2019t change the aggregate story. When we look at the financing transactions that we have done, particularly these private credit residual financings, those cost of funds are several hundreds of basis points inside where our unsecured debt levels trade in and that\u2019s kind of the trade-off we look at is, what\u2019s the opportunity between different alternatives there. Frankly our biggest challenge right now is the \u2013 and this I think tells the story a little bit of where we see unsecured spreads going is buying unsecured debt in the open market. Our investors that are telling us they are very happy with what they hold and not looking to sell. And that is the biggest challenge, but it also tells you that where the direction is likely to go in spreads here.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Shane from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rick Shane","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions and mostly have been answered. I will make an observation and then ask the question, it does feel like in the last three months, the environment has changed immeasurably, I think it\u2019s interesting that I think throughout this you guys have just sort of consistently done the same thing and I think that\u2019s a good sign, I would love to talk a little bit more following up on what Sanjay and Moshe asked about the FFELP markets, my takeaway from what you just said is that the pricing on asset sales has recalibrated so that the returns on those deals offer a different for you from what you have experienced historically, I am curious you talked about the spread on the $1.1 billion deal you did last quarter, I am curious where pricing was on the second deal?","Somsak Chivavibul","Sure. The second deal came in at we talked about that on my prepared remarks actually. The second deal came in as a LIBOR plus 138 basis points, with approximately 2-year weighted average life.","Rick Shane","I am sorry I transposed things, what was the first deal\u2026?","Somsak Chivavibul","The first deal was 109, but that was a privately placed deal.","Rick Shane","Got it, okay. That\u2019s what I missed, okay. I got 138 in my notes, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lee Cooperman from Omega. Please go ahead.","Lee Cooperman","Thank you very much. I just want to go back to the last call that you had and I just want to kind of do a reality check. Jack, you very forcibly opened up the call basically saying that the reason I think up until this quarterly you had booked back about $1.3 billion stock average price pay $17.20, the stock was hovering around $9 or $10, and you said that the reason we are returning money aggressively through share repurchase is because we agree with those analysts to have value in the high-teens actually you had said low-20s and this was a justification of the buyback. We kind of agree with that, I am just curious whether your view is similar and that the $555 million remaining on your repurchase program that your plan is to execute that this year, so that will be question one, just kind of update us on your thinking about valuation and the repurchase program. And second, if there is an order of magnitude, I would think operating expenses were to be lower, given the business shrinking as we pay down loans, what kind of leverage is there to the shareholders from reduced operating expenses? Thank you.","Jack Remondi","Thanks Lee. So, our view on the intrinsic value of the company is not changed. In fact, our ability to buyback 19.2 million shares at $10.42 actually increases that value for our remaining shareholders. And that\u2019s the type of activity that I said when we see a mis-price market like this we are trying to take advantage of that in order to add value to the base here and we will continually continue that process. We do expect to utilize our remaining authority in this year. We were a little frontloaded in the first quarter, taking advantage of what we saw is a very low or ridiculously low stock price and bought back more shares than kind of the pro rata portion there. On OpEx, first quarter\u2019s OpEx are always a little bit elevated because of basically taxes and compensation in taxes on composition and compensation pay expenses that take place for the annual programs in February. So we do expect those numbers to come down.","And as I have said, we fully expect to exit the year on a lower run rate than where we were \u2013 where we entered the year for 2016. When we look at OpEx, some of the things that we do look at, we take a look at, it\u2019s not just the absolute levels but where we are spending, what it cost us to perform different levels of activity, so that we are working to become more efficient in that side of the equation. I will say some of the areas that we are operating in have the fee income side of the equation have different ratios of OpEx to revenues than what you would see saying FFELP loan ownership versus FFELP versus federal loan servicing as examples. But there is no question, we are working to try and become and continue our process and our success rate of becoming more efficient here. And as the FFELP and private loan portfolios amortize, you will see those expenses decline.","Lee Cooperman","Just a housekeeping question currently, is this 330 million shares outstanding or less than 330 million the actual shares outstanding at the present time?","Jack Remondi","The ending is.","Somsak Chivavibul","It\u2019s a little over that.","Jack Remondi","Yes, on a common share equivalent, I think it\u2019s about 338 at the end of the quarter.","Lee Cooperman","Yes, got it. Okay, so if we execute the program, we bought back another 13% of the company by the end of the year?","Jack Remondi","At these prices, yes.","Lee Cooperman","Great, okay. Thank you. Good luck. Thank you very much.","Jack Remondi","Alright. Thanks a lot.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Tarkan from Compass Point. Please go ahead.","Michael Tarkan","Thanks for taking my questions. So, on the servicing side, regarding that service portal RFP, just curious do you have a sense for what kind of impact that could have on the business? And then is that a contract that you could theoretically bid on or would be interested in even though you are still one of that servicers?","Jack Remondi","So, the Department of Ed is interested in having all of its loans serviced on a single platform and the RFP at this stage in the game I would say is round one here is initial proposals and concepts. So, terms and conditions are not set forth yet and even the final business requirements are not established. So, it\u2019s premature to say what kind of impact this might have. Are we interested? Yes. I mean, we are the largest servicer of federal loans. We have a system that is highly efficient, highly scalable, probably more importantly, highly automated. So that it\u2019s not just the IT operating infrastructure components, but what it means for the back office servicing as well and we look forward to responding to the RFP.","Michael Tarkan","Okay, thanks. And then I guess from a prepayment perspective, are you seeing any major changes in loans that are getting consolidated away from you guys? It seems like that may have picked up a little bit this quarter.","Jack Remondi","So as you know, the repay program was launched last quarter, fourth quarter, and there was a small increase in prepayments for customers who needed to move into the direct loan program in order to be eligible for that income driven repayment solution. But for borrowers who are eligible for some of the other repayment income-based repayment solutions, they are usually better programs, because they have shorter repayment terms for the larger balance accounts. So, we don\u2019t expect to see any more significant increase here. We already have a higher \u2013 a high percentage of our customers that are in repayment signed up for income driven payment solutions as well. We have been actively marketing and promoting this program for a number of years and again for borrowers who have signed up for those programs, they are generally better off persisting in them rather than converting to a new one.","Michael Tarkan","Okay, thanks. And then just last couple of modeling ones, are you still expecting NIM on FFELP in the low to mid-80s and then private in the mid 350s for the year? And then just one more on OpEx, I think previously you had guided to a number of less than $930 million for the year, ex-regulatory expenses, is that still the case? Thanks.","Somsak Chivavibul","Hi, this is Somsak here. Yes, we are not changing any of those guidance from what we have provided in the last quarter.","Michael Tarkan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark DeVries","Yes, thanks. Just to follow-up on the Department of Ed RFP, is that part of the move for them to eventually move the servicing in-house or are they just looking to get all of their outsourced servicers on the same platform?","Jack Remondi","It\u2019s not clear where what they would want to do long-term in this side of the equation on that front, but they made no indications of any desire to bring operations in-house to-date.","Mark DeVries","Okay. And sorry if I missed this, could you remind us on what your total capacity is in terms of unencumbered assets that you could securitize whether that be the POC or just unencumbered loans?","Jack Remondi","Okay. So, let me provide a breakdown of unencumbered assets and O\/C with a few different things. Today, we have got a little over $700 million of unencumbered FFELP longer, $4 billion of unencumbered deposit. But in terms of our private credit O\/Cs that are tied to our turbo deals today, we have got $2.1 billion of balance that we can continue to finance, but that balance is expected to grow over time and is expected to go to about $3.1 billion by the time we reach the call date for those particular deals.","Mark DeVries","Okay. And is that the primary source of liquidity you look to tap as you look towards smoothing out the kind of chunky 2017 unsecured debt maturity coming up?","Somsak Chivavibul","Well, yes, those are the primary sources we have been tapping. Remember that we have been accessing these resources of liquidity that we have an access in the past. I know there were some questions about whether we could access them. I think the activities we have entered into over the last few quarters clearly demonstrate that we have been able to access those. And I think between that and the cash flows that we generate from our operations should give everyone confidence that we are going to be able to service our unsecured debt. And obviously we want to be able to access unsecured debt going forward to provide flexibility, to continue to grow our business going forward.","Mark DeVries","Okay, great. And just one more, have your spreads gotten tight enough on the latest FFELP deals you have done that it\u2019s the economic to look to securitize some of the FFELP loans you have acquired or do you need to see more tightening?","Somsak Chivavibul","Well, I think we have done so with the second FFELP deal we have just completed. But you know, so the second FFELP deal we did was securitization that came out of our Blue Ridge APCP facility. So, there was a securitization of the ones that we acquired as well as the first deal that we did.","Mark DeVries","Okay. So, you are already at levels that enables you to still check your IRR on this one?","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes. Remember as Jack mentioned, the most that we have acquired today reflect the price to reflect current funding.","Mark DeVries","Yes, sure. But the wells deals you acquired before the market really kind of blew out, but you are already at levels now we are still attractive enough to fund those markets in the FFELP market?","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes.","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it. Alright, thanks.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Mark Hammond from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Mark Hammond","Thank you. Good morning. On the private student loan repurchase facility, I was wondering what O\/C was pledged to get to $478 million I am looking to get some sort of advance rate?","Somsak Chivavibul","Yes. So, you are looking for the particular deals, Mark?","Mark Hammond","That would be helpful as well, yes.","Somsak Chivavibul","Sure. So, the deals that we did with the 2012-A trust, the 2012-B trust and 2013-A trust. I am sorry?","Mark Hammond","As when you say collectively, how much O\/C was that?","Somsak Chivavibul","A little over $1 billion.","Mark Hammond","Okay, thanks. And then a follow-up question, so Moody\u2019s has written about a $4 billion unencumbered asset threshold that have gone below can prompt a ratings downgrade on the unsecureds. At the end of the quarter, unencumbered student loans now total about $3.8 billion. S&P has seemed to flag something like this as well. Have you had any recent conversations with the rating agencies not on the FFELP ABS, but actually just on unsecured ratings?","Jack Remondi","Well, I think the issue is here what your cash flows look like in your debt maturities to ensure that you can repay your \u2013 meet your obligations without financing activities. And one of the things that we have been clear in our comments and analysis that we have provided to the rating agencies is that we have sufficient cash flows to service our debt maturities as they occur. And that\u2019s the kind of the critical component here. So, if one were to encumber the unencumbered loans and use the proceeds for something other than debt service, I could see where that might be a concern. But if you were to encumber the loans and pay down the debt, I am not sure why that changes the credit profile of the company. Well, I know it would not change the\u2026","Mark Hammond","As a matter of fact, it\u2019s going through that exercise actually improves our net tangible assets and coverage ratio.","Joe Fisher","Alright. Thanks, that\u2019s all.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Jessa.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Joe Fisher. Please go ahead.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Christie. Good morning and welcome to Navient\u2019s 2017 fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO and Chris Lown, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future maybe materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the fourth quarter 2017 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted on the Investors page at navient.com. Thank you.","And now, I will turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Navient. This morning, I will share my perspective on 2017\u2019s operating results and I will also provide color on my outlook for the year.","2017 was a successful year in a number of fronts. Highlights for the year include adjusted core net income of $502 million or $1.79 a share, acquisitions of $10 billion in student loans, including $1.2 billion in refinancing loans. We generated $475 million in business services revenue. Private credit charge-offs fell 14% to $443 million, the lowest level in over 10 years. We reduced 2018 unsecured debt maturities by one-third and we returned $616 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. While 2017 started with the challenge of the CFPB and Attorney General lawsuits, I am particularly proud that our team did not let these unsubstantiated claims distract us from executing our business plan.","For example, in 2017, we continued to deliver exceptional service to our student loan clients customers outperforming the industry in student owned delinquency and default rates in fact 37% better, delivering high levels of income driven repayment enrollment with more than half of loan balances serviced for the government enrolled and IDR. And we have highlighted numerous initiatives to improve customer outcomes by making it easier for borrowers to navigate the complexity of the federal student loan programs.","We also continued to win new business across all areas of the company, including new and renewed federal contracts, state and municipal contract wins, significant student loan acquisitions and new healthcare revenue cycle management contracts. In order to distract us from growing our franchise capabilities through corporate acquisitions as we welcome Duncan Solutions in earnest to our franchise. Our financial results, new contract wins and business expansions demonstrate the commitment and dedication of our team to focus on our customers, clients and business objectives. I am extremely proud of what team Navient accomplished in 2017.","There is one area in particular however that does not reflect what was accomplished in the year and the foundation we built for 2018 and beyond, our stock price. Our goal is to continue to demonstrate the embedded value in our legacy student loan business, the growth and value potential in our business processing and asset generation businesses and to put to rest the negative pressures impacting the values here. During 2017, we invested over $450 million in capital in student loan portfolio purchases and corporate acquisitions, which we believe will generate returns well in excess of our cost of capital. These transactions leverage our existing infrastructure and skill set and will meaningfully contribute to our growth in 2018.","On the regulatory front we continue to present the facts which clearly demonstrate the quality of our work, the superiority of our results and the clearing accuracy of the claims. We will continue to defend our performance and put forward solutions that address the real issues impacting student borrowers, most notably college completion. While the legal process is slower than we would like and it\u2019s incredibly frustrating to have to deal with these false acquisitions, I am eager to move as quickly as possible to the presentation of the facts and the resolution of these cases.","The passage of the tax reform act in December was big news and big value for Navient. While it resulted in the $224 million reduction in our deferred tax assets, we will ultimately have a very positive impact, most significantly it will materially lower our effective tax \u2013 federal tax rate to 21% and increase our net cash flow. The increase in net cash flow will help support investments in new products, people, systems and services, will also allow us to be more competitive and will result in better returns for investors. You will see this immediately in our projections for 2018. In December, we announced our plans to invest some of the benefits of the tax change in our team. We paid out an immediate $1,000 bonus to over 6,500 teammates or 98% of all employees and we are also committed to evaluating other ways to invest in our people, products and systems to deliver increased value.","Our business objectives for 2018 are progressed on maximizing value from our legacy student loan business, growing our business services revenue and generating at least $1.5 billion in student loans to our refinancing programs. We are also focused on continuing to improve our operating efficiency and to expand on this we expect our legacy student loan portfolios will continue to deliver predictable cash flows as the portfolios amortize and to maximize those cash flows, we are focused on interest expense, credit performance and continuing to materially improve our operating efficiency. In business services, we expect to deliver 30% growth in our non-education related services and improve our operating margins. We expect growth here will come from both our government municipal clients and our healthcare clients. We expect to originate $1.5 million of refinancing student loans. We believe our product offerings, digital marketing strategies and origination platform provide a unique competitive advantage allowing us to generate very attractive assets with excellent risk adjusted returns.","Finally, our focus on operating efficiency will result in meaningful cost reduction with operating expense 3% lower compared to 2017 and 12% lower when normalizing for our in-year corporate acquisitions saving over $110 million. Our 2017 financial results reflect the value of our business franchise and the commitment of our team to our customers\u2019 clients and investors. Our investments in products, systems and people built momentum during the year and have positioned us to improve operating efficiency, maximize our legacy cash flows and deliver on the growth potential of our business services and student loan originations in 2018. I am excited about the year and looking forward to delivering on the franchise strengths in 2018.","Thank you for your interest and I look forward to your questions later in this call. I am now going to turn it over to Chris for a deeper look at the quarter and the year\u2019s results.","Chris Lown","Thank you, Jack and thank you to everyone on today\u2019s call for your interest in Navient. During my prepared remarks, I will review both the quarterly and year end results for 2017. I will be referencing the earnings call presentation which can be found on the company\u2019s website in the Investor Section. Starting on Slide 3 adjusted core EPS was $0.43 in the fourth quarter, flat from a year ago. Full year adjusted EPS was $1.79 compared to $1.86 from a year ago. During the quarter, we recognized a $224 million non-cash re-measurement loss as we wrote down the value of our deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed in December. This resulted in a reported net loss of $0.50 per share for the quarter and reported full year EPS of $0.89 per share. We expect a change in the federal tax rate to reduce our effective overall tax rate from approximately 37% to approximately 23%. During the quarter, we incurred $3 million of regulatory costs and a $29 million restructuring charge. This restructuring expense, along with other operating efficiency initiatives, is expected to reduce operating expenses by approximately $110 million in 2018 before corporate acquisitions.","Let\u2019s now move into our segment reporting beginning with FFELP on Slide 4. FFELP core earnings were $65 million for the fourth quarter versus $68 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the amortization of FFELP portfolio and slightly lower net interest margin. The net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 87 basis points compared to 89 basis points in the year ago quarter. We continued to enter into derivative contracts to hedge our projected floor income and 1 month versus 3 month LIBOR interest rate risk, with more than 90% of these risks hedged today. In the fourth quarter, we acquired $463 million of FFELP loans bringing our year-to-date FFELP acquisition total to $5.7 billion.","Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 in our private education loan segment. Core earnings in this segment increased to $43 million from $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter, the net interest margin was 331 basis points. The decline from the third quarter was expected and a result of the cumulative adjustment that occurred in the third quarter and the acquisition of $822 million of private education refinance loans, including $380 million of loans that were originated in the fourth quarter. Newly originated private education refinance loans that we acquired have an average borrower rate of 5%, which is approximately 300 basis points lower than the yield on our legacy private education loan portfolio but have significantly lower loss expectations.","We expect the NIM on refinance loans to be closer to 2% as we transition loans to our lower cost ABCP facilities in securitizations. Refinance loans do not require the same seasoning as new in-school originations and we anticipate that we will be more actively securitizing this portfolio. As a result of the amortization of the legacy portfolio, along with the newly originated refinance loans, we expect our total private education NIM to be approximately 325 basis points in 2018. We are very pleased with the continued improvement in our credit quality as private education loan losses and delinquencies continued to decline year-over-year. Charge-off rates are at the lowest levels in over 10 years and outperformed our expectations as we transitioned the $3 billion portfolio that we acquired in the second quarter.","Let\u2019s continue to Slide 6 to review our business services segment. We are very proud of the growth we have achieved across business services and we feel that as we ship beyond the education space, it is important to give more detail into the performance of each unit within the segment. Non-education fee revenue grew 201% in the year and 49% in the fourth quarter alone. Excluding the acquisition of Duncan Solutions, non-education fee revenue grew 10% and 19% respectively. We continue to win over new contracts in the space, including our first healthcare RCO contract. This gives us the ability to manage the entire revenue process cycle. Opportunities like this allow Navient to leverage our servicing experience to drive better results and streamline efficiencies for our customers.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 which highlights our financing activity in the quarter. 2017 was a fantastic year for education loan acquisitions, with $1.3 billion acquired in the fourth quarter and $10 billion for the year. We have available capacity in FFELP ABCP facilities of $2.4 billion and available capacity in our private education loan ABCP facilities of over $925 million. We plan to continue to fund our education refinance loans with ABCP facilities before we securitize them the term. In that quarter we issued one FFELP ABS transactions for $751 million. For the year we issued $5.7 billion of FFELP ABS. Our first FFELP deal of 2018 price yesterday almost financed at a re-offer spread that was 41 basis points tighter than our first deal in 2017. We also issued our first mixed private education legacy and refi transaction allowing us to bring our cost of funds to tighter levels. As we discussed in our third quarter call this transaction price that is spread of 101 basis points with a weighted average life of 3.5 years. On the unsecured side, we continued to focus on our maturity profile by using the proceeds of $250 million re-opening during 2022 to address near-term maturities. We reduced our 2018 maturities by 36% during the year.","Moving to Slides 8 to 9, I want to discuss our long-term capital allocation philosophy and how we prioritize capital allocation. Consistently and dynamically balancing capital adequacy with capital allocation opportunities including organic growth stock repurchases and acquisitions is paramount to delivering value to our shareholders. And we are committed to ensuring excess capital as we turn to shareholders. Turning to Slide 9 from the perspective of capital allocation prioritization, we believe that it is important to maintain a stable quarterly dividend. This is followed by organically growing private education refinance loan originations and opportunistically acquiring education loan portfolios. We then look to invest our excess capital on share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. Importantly in 2018, we will focus on integrating the acquisitions we made over the past 2 years and driving organic growth to deliver value to shareholders.","Since separation we have returned over $800 million in dividends, $2.5 billion of share buybacks and invested approximately $585 million in complementary growth businesses. We have historically used our TNA ratio range guidance to provide debt and equity investors with a view of our leverage, capital requirements and capital guidelines. In light of the company\u2019s continued transition we believe it is appropriate to provide investors with a tighter near-term range within our 1.20x to 1.30x guidance to provide more capital transparency. This tighter range is informed by our cash flow projections, refinancing requirements, internal and rating agency models and discussions with rating agencies and our equity and debt investors. At year end our TNA ratio is 1.20x. By the end of 2018 we expect to manage our capital position to result in 1.23x to 1.25x TNA ratio. In light of this guidance and our increased confidence to generate capital in 2018, we plan to resume and complete our existing share repurchase authority in the second half of 2018. The existing authorization has $160 million remaining.","Let\u2019s now turn to full year 2018 guidance on Slide 10. We expect the following; operating expenses between $910 million and $930 million, excluding expenses associated with regulatory costs, full year FFELP net interest margin of approximately 75 basis points, full year private education loan net interest margin of approximately 325 basis points. Our guidance for NIM includes the impact of two interest rate hikes of 25 basis points each in 2018. In addition our 2018 guidance includes the following assumptions. Full year private education refinance loan originations of at least $1.5 billion, full year growth in non-education related revenues of at least 30%. Finally we see core earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95 excluding expenses associated with regulatory costs and restructuring expenses.","Let\u2019s turn to GAAP results on Slide 11. We recorded fourth quarter GAAP net loss of $84 million or $0.32 per share compared with net income of $145 million or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter 2016. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions.","I will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from John Hecht of Jefferies.","John Hecht","Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. The first one is, you have discussed $110 million of net savings through some restructuring plans and you mentioned that\u2019s, I think that\u2019s net of you are not accounting for the expense run rate from Duncan and Earnest, I am wondering, are you able to share any context of that with us to give us a sense for that might add to the core base in order to properly model the expenses going forward?","Chris Lown","Yes. So we don\u2019t give specific guidance for either those entities, but I think there is a simple way to get back into it and that if you look at sort of 2016 OpEx to move out that $110 million, you can get to and then you look at our guidance, our operating expense guidance of 9 \u2013 10 to 9.30, you kind of come to a number that should give you a rate of where those companies operate. And it\u2019s good general assumption that they both equally weighted upon an expense side, if you just want to think about it that way.","John Hecht","Okay, that\u2019s perfect. And then how should we think about the provision for this year, you have \u2013 it looks like your Chase portfolio is performing a little better in terms of loss content, but then you are going to be you are adding on some of the Earnest loans, could you give us a sense what the loss content is there and how to think about provisions for this year?","Jack Remondi","Yes. So \u2013 on the JPMorgan Chase portfolio, as we said \u2013 I said in my prepared remarks, we clearly are experiencing great trends on the credit side and that came through on that portfolio as well. I think while we haven\u2019t completely migrated that portfolio on to our services \u2013 servicing systems, we were able to utilize a number of our strategies and analytics and help drive better results with the sub-service there and so we feel very comfortable and confident of what\u2019s going on in that portfolio and generally, in the overall portfolio as you see in the credit trends. And so on the Earnest side of the loss content there and significantly lower and so I think you should continue to expect us to see that provision number decrease over time.","John Hecht","Decrease as a percentage of assets or in an absolute basis?","Jack Remondi","Both.","John Hecht","Okay, very good. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","And you have a question from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks. Actually, couple, two questions, first, I guess is how do you think about the profitability of the Earnest kind of the vis-\u00e0-vis your guidance back at the time of the acquisition given this restructuring, is it similar or is it better given that you have taken these expenses out?","Jack Remondi","While our expense focus Moshe is on \u2013 it has been on the legacy business side of the equation as our portfolios is amortizing, we are really looking to continue to drive operating efficiency in that space. And we also believe on some of our business processing areas, there is significant opportunities for us to take advantage of many of the same things we\u2019ve done in student loan servicing related to automation and data analytics that are starting to take hold there. On Earnest, we are looking for \u2013 we believe we can generate net interest margins in the 2% range in that space and given the excellent credit performance on refi loans, that these loans will generate returns on equity in the \u2013 in the mid to high-teens. Our job in that space though is in the asset generation arena is really to invest in that business, invest in the \u2013 the technology that we used to originate loans, the technology that we used for our marketing related purposes and to grow those businesses. So I would look at that as more of a investment side of the equation versus cost take outside of the equation.","Moshe Orenbuch","Right. And maybe if you could just talk a little Jack about, what you think of is the asset growth, prospects in 2019 and how that would impact your TNA ratio and further capital allocation decisions?","Jack Remondi","So the way we see, I mean we look at the refi business is where, because of a significant \u2013 significantly better performance in terms of credit outlooks and the shorter average life of those loans, we do allocate a lower level of capital to that product and we did on the traditional or legacy private student loan side of the equation. And when you look at the amortization of the existing portfolios both FFELP and private in the amount of capital that, that amortization releases. When you combine that with the capital that is generated by the portfolios themselves in the business processing services segments of our company, we are generating more than enough capital to allocate to asset generation and continued to return capital to investors. Our decision on the share repurchase front was more a reflection of what we actually invested in 2017 over our $450 million of capital work was invested in allocating capital to the private loan portfolios we purchased in the year in the two corporate acquisitions rather than a reflection of the capital demands of asset generation.","Moshe Orenbuch","Just wanted to be clear though in \u201819 obviously you are going to start potentially originating private student loans yourself, I mean, any thoughts about the magnitude that, that could be in that period, because those would have potentially different capital?","Jack Remondi","Right. Yes, the way the cycle works and campus originations as you really won\u2019t see any meaningful originations until the second half of \u201819 because you are just because of the academic year cycle January disbursements are really second disbursements on loans made in the prior year. So, it does not have a big capital demand for us in \u201819.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. Thanks.","Jack Remondi","Christie, next question?","Operator","We do have a question from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. I guess this goes back to a question that\u2019s previously I guess when we think about where you would end up in excess capital based on the range that you are assuming for your TNA, it would imply you could probably do a little bit more than the $160 million that\u2019s left on the share repurchase? Can you just talk about whether or not you are expecting to just exhaust what you have left on the share repurchase or even do more?","Jack Remondi","So, I would say two things. One, I think it\u2019s going to be very important going forward from that people it seems that you may have done is that there people fully understand the TNA ratio, the rollout for the portfolio and the generation of capital in this business, because this should give everybody a pretty much tighter range of where the excess capital is and what the opportunities are around that capital. I think I would say two things. One, we clearly are now committed to exhausting our 2017 repurchase authorization at the second half of 2018 and the other statement I had made that is declarative is that we are committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. And so there are a lot of ways to do that and we will obviously assess on a weekly, monthly, quarterly basis, our capital position and you have our view that we are committed to that returning policy.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And when we think about other portfolio acquisitions or acquisitions, are there active opportunities on that front for 2018 that could meaningfully impair your ability to return some of the other excess?","Jack Remondi","Sanjay, most of the large portfolios have been acquired at this point and there is certainly student loans \u2013 legacy student loans out there that we would be interested in acquiring, the majority of them are FFELP which as you know require very little capital. So, I don\u2019t see anything on the horizon on that front that would materially alter our capital requirements situation.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And on the servicing side?","Jack Remondi","You mean on the federal contract or the just\u2026","Sanjay Sakhrani","Generally like other tuck-ins that you have things like you have done in the past.","Jack Remondi","For corporate acquisitions, we are going to be focusing 2018 on integrating our businesses and driving organic growth. So, when we talk about the non-federal fee revenue that we expect to generate in 2018 that is coming from businesses that are in place today and effectively organic growth rates that we expect to generate next year or this year.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And then maybe to touch on the point you made on the DOE collections, some of that came back in December, could you just talk about what that opportunity is for you all in this new paradigm. And then just secondly, I also want to make sure, I understood the impact of CESO [ph] to the extent that there is any as we look into early 2020, I know it\u2019s a while the way, but I just want to think about that and how it relates to your capital management priorities? Thank you.","Jack Remondi","Sure. So on the first question, on the Department of Ed contract, we were awarded effectively a continuation of our prior contract with the department and they made a very large placement of collections with us in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s not clear, what happens next, this was the largest single placement that we had ever received in the 10 plus years. We have been doing this work for the department, it\u2019s an attractive business for us under those metrics and we are continuing to demonstrate the success rates of the department is looking for in that space. I think as the business moves forward, as \u2013 and we have this RP going on with the servicing side of the equation it is possible that this whole metric gets wrapped up and treated differently than it has \u2013 it has in the past. On CESO maybe Chris can elaborate a little bit more on what we are thinking here.","Chris Lown","Yes. So clearly 2020 is a ways off, but I would highlight a couple of things, one, the revised TNA guidance that we have given starts to take into consideration if you are around the potential impacts of the CESO. Two, when you go out and speak to the rating agencies about the impacts of CESO they are still not giving a lot of clarity around what basically the impact and how it changes their views on things. So we are closely monitoring it. We clearly will like every financial institution be impacted by that change in accounting standard, but we have started to at least take into consideration as we think about our TNA ratio guidance and what the impact would be in 2 years.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And we don\u2019t have an initial estimate of that?","Chris Lown","We do not.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Rick Shane of JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. You have provided some good clarity in terms of how to think about yields on the refi loans versus the traditional private student loans and obviously, what that really benefits from is the positive selection on the refis due to the graduation rates, can you help us fill out sort of \u2013 you filled out the yield metrics, can you fill out the graduation rate metrics and the lifetime loss metrics, so we can think about that, I am assuming the grad rate on the refi loans is close to 100%, what is it on the traditional student loans and what are the lifetime loss assumptions for both types of loans?","Jack Remondi","Well, so the refi marketplace has generally focused exclusively on customers with student loan debt from graduate schools. So they \u2013 these are borrowers who have not only grad, completed their undergraduate, they have also completed their graduate program as well. They have relatively large balances in terms on both their majority federal and private loans that may get attractive for them to be able to refinance into products like we offer. It is a function of their income, their credit and most of these borrowers have been working for several years, by the time they are actually looking to do a refi component. So it\u2019s a more traditional underwriting process than just what you see in the legacy student loan space. When we look at student loans in the aggregate across both federal and private student loans, graduation rate is clearly the single best predictor of \u2013 our graduation is a single best predictor of loan performance, in that portfolio, when you can just see this by one metric that\u2019s published by the Department of Ed that is two-thirds of all federal student loan defaults come from borrowers who have borrowed less than $10,000 and that is the leading indicator that they started school and did not complete in the process. By contrast, only 4% of defaults come from borrowers, who have borrowed more than $40,000. I know that\u2019s the opposite of what the media portrays as the problem or writes about it the problem in student debt of high debt balances, but those are the statistics from the federal loan program. We believe that our data, our history in performance here will allow us to identify high-quality borrowers based on a variety of metrics that are not just credit bureau related that we can expand our offering in the refi space and generate meaningful volume of very, very high quality accounts going forward.","Rick Shane","Okay. But when we are trying to pull those down to what\u2019s the lifetime loss expectation on a refi versus a traditional private student loan, can you give us some clarity there?","Chris Lown","So, we would expect that loss rates in the refi space would be less than one-third what you would traditionally see in the in-school lending life of loan losses and the in-school lending.","Rick Shane","Okay. And just so I don\u2019t walk away confused which sometimes happens to me when you say less than one-third if we are looking\u2026.","Chris Lown","So, typically, yes, I am sorry, so in the in-school space today\u2019s private student loans are generally estimated to have somewhere between a 6% to 7% lifetime cumulative loss and we would expect losses to be under 2% in the refi space.","Jack Remondi","In fact, if you look at current trust \u2013 if you look at trust data today at the refi loans, you would actually see the evidence of something more in sort of the 30 to 40 basis point range. So, again, we are at a very attractive cycle, these are very attractive assets about less than 2% number is a fairly conservative number when you look at the data.","Rick Shane","Got it. I appreciate that. And I appreciate your willingness to be clear on that, also wanted to say I think from a guidance that\u2019s helpful, you talked about $160 million remaining on the buyback that is in fact the buyback that you reinstated is in fact greater than the tax savings. I am curious why be that aggressive, is it because you see that opportunity in terms of the stock price is it because the growth opportunity in terms of FFELP loans moderating or is it just really a response to what we have seen in the market over the last 6 months?","Chris Lown","Yes. So, I think we look at it differently. As Jack mentioned, our suspension in the buyback took a number of factors into consideration some that you mentioned also the fact we are going to a origination business the fact that our leverage had increased since spin out and gotten down at the bottom end of our range. And so as we think about what\u2019s transpired since October, we obviously went through a fairly meaningful restructuring in a cost efficiency exercise, which will generate longer term capital generation going forward. In addition, obviously, there is the tax benefit, but there are a number of factors that give us a lot of confidence in our ability to generate excess capital for the long-term. And so we feel like that $160 million resumption of the authorization of 2017 was a prudent plan and again it will happen in the second half of the year and on the first half. So, we will build capital through the first half of the year and get within that by the end of the year.","Rick Shane","Perfect. Thank you very much guys.","Operator","And you do have a question from Arren Cyganovich with Citi.","Arren Cyganovich","I apologize if I missed this when you are discussing the FFELP margin, but the 325 basis points guidance includes the new refinance loans and I think Jack you said that that\u2019s about a 2% NIM that you are expecting around there, if you were to strip that out of the last quarter, what would have the FFELP NIM been for the legacy assets?","Chris Lown","Yes, I\u2019d say it would be sort of 7 or 8 basis points higher and I think what you should expect for us in the future is as that portfolio scales we will look to break them out separately to give you more specific guidance to be able to model the two separate portfolios. This does not really have scale yet to do that.","Arren Cyganovich","Got it. And thanks for the new disclosures on the fee business side, that\u2019s helpful. In terms of the breakdown of the piece that is the remaining education services how much of that is in runoff going forward?","Jack Remondi","Anything that is FFELP related is runoff. Really, the only piece that we have related to the direct loan portfolio is our servicing contract, which is also as you know up for is likely to be bid out sometime in the next several months here. And that was \u2013 that\u2019s roughly about $150 million worth of revenue in the Department of Ed servicing contract a year.","Arren Cyganovich","So, the $345 million with that I guess you also would see a decline in the intercompany servicing as well?","Jack Remondi","Correct. I mean those revenues \u2013 this effectively if you think of the business of having a legacy student loan portfolio and related services contracts associated with those, those will all be amortizing down over the remaining life of the loans. That\u2019s certainly nothing new or unexpected there. We have been modeling and providing folks with the expected cash flows from the loan portfolios over time. Those cash flows have actually been coming in little bit better than the projections that we have shared and we are trying to provide a little bit more disclosure on the fee side of the equation to see if you model those out as well.","Arren Cyganovich","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly the 30% expected growth in the non-education related revenues, does that \u2013 how much of that is organic versus I guess you made some of those acquisitions kind of in the middle and late part of last year?","Jack Remondi","Well, it does not assume any corporate acquisitions in 2018. So, it does include the full year run-rate of Duncan Solutions in that component, but the rest, I mean it is effectively all organic growth.","Arren Cyganovich","Okay, alright. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] You have a question from Mark Hammond of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Mark Hammond","Good morning, Jack, Chris and Joe. I have two debt questions. So, I appreciate the specificity on the tangible net asset ratio guidance, but I was wondering beyond 2018, what will you manage the ratio to, anything more specific than 1.2x to 1.3x?","Chris Lown","So, we obviously haven\u2019t given guidance past 2018, but I do think it is a good benchmark to think about out a year or two obviously, there are number of things we are going to manage through over the next 2 years we are building out the origination franchise. CESO was mentioned as an accounting convention that will come in 2020. So, I do think that guidance is a good benchmark out of here, but we will look to provide updated guidance. I mean, as I mentioned, it is very much informed from our discussions with rating agencies, their models, our models etcetera to make sure that we are in compliance with what they are thinking about from a ratings perspective.","Mark Hammond","Alright. Thanks, Chris. And then touching on the $250 million add-on to the 2022, one end of the decision to add-on to the $1 billion plus maturities in 2022 rather than issuing longer dated bonds into years that have less maturities?","Chris Lown","Sure. So, a coulee of things, one obviously, the weighted average life of our portfolio is going down, it\u2019s not going up. And so as I think about our costs within the business issuing longer dated debt is more expensive, you are talking up to a whole 100 basis points increasing cost to go further out. Two, if you go to Page 15 of our Investor Presentation, you will see we have added some new disclosure in there around our private education loan cash flows, along with our FFELP cash flows. There is because of the turbo facilities that were put in place during the crisis, there is a lot of release of capital for us from those facilities past 2020. And so, we are also trying to do is match our cash flows more closely with our maturities and so my ability to reopen the 2022s when I know that there is going to be a lot of cash available and save costs, made a lot of sense and I felt very secure about our ability to manage that debt load given our operating income expectations. And so it really was a cost benefit analysis and a review of our cash flows and our ability to service that debt.","Mark Hammond","Thanks. So that\u2019s something that going forward we might see more of rather than full $500 issuances or a $1 billion full stop new out into the future?","Chris Lown","So I would say actually we are going to have to do \u2013 we can do both. I mean, there is some ability to tap a little bit again we are cognizant of what sort of a max maturity would be in any year past 2020. And so we never want to push that boundary, but there are couple of years that we can still reopen, but inevitably as we get through our 2019 and 2020 towers, we still have to issue somewhere longer dated debt, but again trying to reduce the amount of debt outstanding we have bigger buckets in the outer years, that we can increase. So we have a lot more flexibility and it just huge amount of confidence in our 2019 and 2020 maturity towers and our ability to refinance them and then beyond that just a clear path to managing the debt maturity schedule.","Mark Hammond","Great. And thanks for the disclosure of Slide 15.","Jack Remondi","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Michael Tarkan of Compass Point.","Michael Tarkan","Thank you. Just on the FFELP, maybe I don\u2019t know if you touched on this, but can you tell us why it ticked up so much in the fourth quarter and then why it\u2019s giving that back in 2018?","Jack Remondi","Yes. So it\u2019s a great question. And as you know we do try to reduce the volatility in our FFELP portfolio and we have increased our hedging position as well. There is some variability in our cost of funds in the FFELP portfolio. That is actually in order to our benefit over the last two quarters, we are not projecting that to continue that is a bit of meaningful impact as well. Also our floor income is an amortizing asset and rising environment has an impact on that too. So again we feel very comfortable in our 75 basis point forecast and to be true play of our forecast historically over the last year was sort in the high-70s and we did reap some of this benefit from the financing costs. And so pretty much in line with where we were there was just these benefits on the expense on the interest expense side that we were receiving given some variability, but we do not expect to continue going forward.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. And then just how many rate hikes are you assuming in your guidance for 2018?","Jack Remondi","We assume two rate hikes, 25 basis points each.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. And then lastly, just on the regulatory side, it seems like some of the pressure from CFPB given new leadership there is maybe easing a little bit, but is there any chance or how do you view potential states turning up the heat a little bit on the overall industry? Thanks.","Jack Remondi","So first of all, we have been presenting the facts in our case and the facts are that we deliver high quality services to our customers, our customers perform better than \u2013 than other loan servicers. And our enrolments in the repayment programs are the \u2013 in the federal loan program that are available, just really that the basis of all of these cases is inconsistent with the fact, right. Our customers are more likely to be enrolled in alternative repayment plans and other servicers and somehow that fact gets in the way of I think some of these politically motivating cases. Couple of things that we think are happening here, one is that in the federal student loan side of the equation, the statue it\u2019s higher education act makes it very clear that these are federally regulated loans and not subject to additional state rules or regulations. And we are \u2013 we do think that changing regulatory wins here make that something that will be more prominent. Obviously, yesterday\u2019s release of kind of the new direction of the CFPB is something that we have been hoping for our sense of beginning right, which is that this organization should be charged with protecting consumers, but not creating rules, new rules to enforcement related actions. And we are hopeful that change will lead to a different related outcome here. We do \u2013 one of the big things that we look at in the student loan space and I think this is a unique challenge in this particular asset class is the public narrative on that has been going on here is one of rising delinquency in default rates, excessive debt from student graduates that is causing them to alter their economic behavior in terms of what they can and cannot do. The reality is that student loan delinquency and default rates have been declining significantly since the end of the financial crisis. The delinquency rates for new borrowers in repayment for example is one-third the rate it was back in 2010, but it\u2019s difficult to get those statistics out there and one of the reasons for that is the federal government does not charge-off student debt. And so in the numerator of all these calculations is the cumulative amount of all loans that we have technically declared as being in default, but the government has not written off. And so it\u2019s if you are never clearing out defaults, of course, your delinquency rates look like they are rising. And as I pointed out earlier, the real challenges that we see in the federal student loan program in terms of delinquency and default rates come from borrowers who start schooling do not complete and that\u2019s evidenced by the significantly higher default rates that we see for those borrowers and the fact that two-thirds of all defaults come from borrowers who are less than $10,000.","I will say the other piece that we have been continuously working on and I think we do a better job at this than anybody else is reducing some of the complexity factors in the federal loan program that make it difficult for borrowers to kind of navigate their way through the process. There are 56 different repayment options available to borrowers, for example, having to borrow who is struggling to make payments be able to understand what those different options are and be able to select the right one is a challenge. The forms are complex and numerous. One example we just recently have highlighted for our customers in income driven repayment plans is showing almost a 3 time increase since successful completion rates for those borrowers as they are looking to enroll or reenroll in their income driven repayment plan. Those are the types of things that we can do and really should be \u2013 we believe rather should be the focus of these changes in regulatory related reviews.","Michael Tarkan","Thank you.","Operator","And there are no other questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Fisher.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Christie. We would like to thank everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Navient Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Mr. Fisher, you may begin your conference.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning and welcome to Navient's 2018 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO; and Chris Lown, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the company's Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the third quarter 2018 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted on the Investors page at navient.com. Thank you.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. And thank you for your interest in Navient. Our third quarter results continue this year's strong performance. With adjusted core earnings per share of $0.56, we saw contributions from each of our business segments, leading to higher earnings, improved cash flow and stronger equity ratios.","Earnings this quarter are once again driven by continued success in refi originations, consistent private credit performance, stable student loan margins and lower operating expense. As a result, we are confident in our ability to meet or exceed the high end of our earnings expectations for the year.","Highlights for the quarter include $903 million of refi loan originations, a 44% increase from the second quarter. Year to date, we have originated $2 billion in loans, significantly above our original target of $1.5 billion for all of 2018. The unique technology platform and digital marketing tools our earnest colleagues have developed provide a strong competitive advantage. These platforms have allowed us to capture increasing volume, while maintaining very strong credit profiles.","In addition, we are also executing at a significantly lower cost of acquisition compared to industry averages. Even in a rising rate environment, our value proposition remains very attractive and current market conditions have not reduced overall demand. With $2 billion originated to date, we now expect full year originations of $2.9 billion.","In our Business Processing segment, we saw a 13% increase in contingent receivables inventory. And we remain in our ability to capture organic growth opportunities in the healthcare and municipal marketplaces. Earnings and EBITDA margins in this segment can be more variable, especially as we ramp up to board new clients as we saw this quarter.","This quarter, we were notified that our contract to provide toll services in Puerto Rico will end sometime next year. As a result, this quarter's GAAP results include the write-off of the balance of the amortized and intangible asset we assigned to this contract at the time of the acquisition.","We have previously discussed the impact from the major natural disasters that took place last year. In both our federal and private loan programs, we grant temporary payment relief to delinquent borrowers impacted by a natural disaster. This results in loans in various stages of payment being brought current. As a result, for some, defaults are delayed and concentrated in a few quarters. This is the principal driver of the higher defaults this period.","For example, roughly $40 million in private loan defaults this quarter were related to borrowers who are experiencing payment difficulty before the hurricanes and other disasters hit, and then received payment relief as a result of the natural disaster declaration. We will see a similar but substantially smaller event next quarter. This default experienced was expected and we had appropriate reserves established prior to the natural disasters.","As a result, while defaults are higher this quarter, our provision for loan losses remains stable. High priority for the management is delivering ongoing improvements and operating efficiency. And we have a very successful and long track record in achieving operating savings each year. So the gains we make here are sometimes difficult to see due to business growth within the segments and new accounting rules.","Slide 7 in the earnings presentation released this morning highlights some of these items more clearly. More specifically, our operating expenses declined when compared to the year ago quarter by 17% in our Federal Loan segment, 28% in the Consumer Lending segment, and 17% in our other segment, after adjusting this quarter's operating expenses for acquisitions, accounting changes that required new gross-up of revenue and expense, and also the transition services we are providing to First Data which are offset by equal amount of revenue.","The Department of Education servicing contract RFP has moved to the next stage this year. In this latest round, the department has changed the structure of the RFP and some of their original objectives. We are continuing to work with our teaming partners to construct a response that helps improve the program and more importantly create appropriate business opportunities.","Finally, our financial performance has us within our target range for equity. This allowed us to announce a new $500 million share repurchase program, while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet. Our share repurchase program is consistent with our long-stated plan of returning excess capital via dividends and share repurchases.","Overall, this quarter's results reflect our ability execute our business plan, and deliver strong value for our customers and investors. I'm pleased with the results of the quarter and the strong commitment and focus of my teammates.","I'm also pleased to announce that our board has again been recognized for gender diversity, this time by the Forum of Executive Women in Philadelphia. I'll now turn the call over to Chris for a more detailed review of our financial results. And I look forward to your questions later in the call. Chris?","Christian Lown","Thank you, Jack. And thank you to everyone on today's call for your interest in Navient. During my prepared remarks, I will review the third quarter results for 2018. I will be referencing the earnings call presentation, which can be found on the company's website in the Investors section.","Starting on Slide 3, adjusted core EPS was $0.56 in the third quarter versus $0.56 from the year-ago quarter. This brings our year-to-date adjusted core EPS to $1.51. A few key highlights from the quarter include are 44% quarter-over-quarter growth in Refinance Loan originations, improved net interest margins, 16% year-over-year growth in business processing revenue and continued focus on expense management.","Let's now move in to segment reporting, beginning with Federal Education Loans on Slide 4. Core earnings were $148 million for the third quarter versus the $157 million in the third quarter of 2017. Contingent collections inventory increased $12 billion in the quarter. The increase in placements beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 contributed to the 24% growth in asset recovery revenue for the prior quarter.","The provision for FFELP loans in this quarter was unchanged from the year-ago quarter and declined $30 million from the prior quarter. This is consistent with our expectations as the charge-off rate and late-stage delinquency rates, while elevated from a year-ago as a result of natural disasters have improved from the prior quarter.","Our current allowance for loan losses for both our FFELP and private loans reflect the estimated impact from the most recent hurricanes. We encourage every borrower to contact to their servicer if they have any questions. The net interest margin for the third quarter was 82 basis points, unchanged from the prior quarter and higher than the 71 basis points in the year-ago quarter.","Operating expenses increased primarily due to $14 million expense increase from a revenue recognition accounting standard adopted in 2018 and a temporary $9 million expense increase from a transition services agreement with First Data, both expenses were offset by corresponding revenue. Excluding these items, operating expenses declined 17% in the segment from a year-ago quarter.","Now let's turn to Slide 5, and our Consumer Lending segment. Core earnings in the segment increased to $72 million from $60 million in the third quarter of 2017. The Consumer Lending net interest margin was 335 basis points in line with our expectations. The increase from the prior quarter was primarily attributable to the timing of the resets on the underlying assets, a reduction in the use of loan modifications and lower cost of funds.","During the quarter, we originated $903 million of Education Refinance Loans, and through the first nine months, we have originated $2 billion. We continue to see healthy demand and strong credit performance in this product with late stage delinquency and charge-off rate at or below 10 basis points. Education Refinance Loans now represent over 10% of our Consumer Lending portfolio.","During the quarter, we updated our long-term recovery rate expectations from 21% to 19.5%, resulting in a $32 million increase in charge-offs. Provisions declined $20 million year-over-year, as the charge-off rate and delinquencies were in line with expectations.","Let's continue to Slide 6 to review our Business Services segment. Fee revenues in this segment grew 16% from the year-ago quarter. The 30% quarter-over-quarter increase in contingent collection inventory is primarily a result of increased placements from Federal and local government services contracts.","Let's turn to Slide 7 to provide additional color on our continued focus on expenses. We continue to build on our strong track record of improving operating efficiency and managing an expense structure that compares very favorably to our peers. Year-to-date, our ongoing operating expense initiatives have resulted in a 10% decline in adjusted operating expenses, exceeding decline in the average balance of our total Education Loan portfolio.","Let's turn to Slide 8, which highlights our financing activity. During the quarter, we increased our unrestricted cash by $520 million, primarily through the refinancing of the FFELP Loan facility that was set to expire in 2021. We refinance these assets into another facility with more favorable overall economics and we continue to aggressively pursue additional financing efficiencies.","In the quarter, we issued $992 million FFELP ABS transaction, and $632 million Private Education Loan ABS transaction. Year-to-date, we have issued $2.3 billion of Private Education Loan ABS compared to $662 million for all of 2017. We retired or repurchased $86 million of unsecured notes in the quarter, which resulted in $1 million loss and do not have any remaining maturities due in 2018.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 6.9 million shares for $95 million, and have $565 million of remaining authority under our share repurchase program. At the end of the quarter, our TNA ratio was 1.23 times, and we continue to expect to end the year between 1.23 and 1.25 times.","Let's turn to GAAP results on Slide 9. We recorded third quarter GAAP net income of $114 million or $0.43 per share compared with net income of $176 million or $0.64 per share in the third quarter of 2017. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions.","In summary, we delivered positive results across the board. We remain laser focused on driving efficiencies, we expect to meet or exceed the high-end of our full year 2018 earnings per share guidance, and we are well positioned for 2019.","I'll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Thanks. Can you talk more about the services agreement with First Data and what kind of expense savings or changes we can expect to see after the transition?","Jack Remondi","So the agreement basically converts - we sold our platform to First Data, and principally, to create a more variable cost structure for the company, but also to convert the platform from what we believe is the industry-leading platform used exclusively by us to a more neutral platform that could be leveraged to other student loan servicers.","It's more a variable cost structure arrangement for us versus a major cost reduction related effort as our portfolio amortizes and depending on what happens with the Department of Ed contract. The expenses that both Chris and I referenced for the transition services agreement is, once the platform was sold it's - you can't just pick it up and move it day one. And so, we are continuing to run that platform in our data center for First Data. And we are billing them or the cost that we incur. So it's basically a pass through structure from an operating expense until the system is converted likely sometime in 2019.","Mark DeVries","Got it. And, Jack, I think you indicated despite higher rates, you're not really seeing much of an impact on the incentive for borrowers to refinance. Can you just confirm that you're kind of effectively passing on most of the cost of higher rates, and therefore, more or less preserving margins here as the rates move higher?","Jack Remondi","Yes, so we have been steadily increasing rates in the refi program, as interest rates have risen in 2018. We still would like to see wider margins in this space and have been gradually working towards that goal. But demand for the program is really a function of a combination of the higher rates that consumers are paying principally on PLUS and Grad PLUS loans, and to a lesser extent, private student loans. And that demand has not - while the savings that a consumer can achieve might be smaller, they are still significant. And so, the demand for the product remains very robust.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hammond with Bank of America High Yield.","Mark Hammond","Hi. Good morning, Jack, Chris and Joe. I had three quick questions. So the first one, in the Federal segment, would you be able to break down the $18 million in other revenue that occurred this quarter?","Christian Lown","Yeah, so you should think half of that as to relate with our transaction with First Data and half of it was the pass-through revenue from the TSA agreement that we discussed. So think about it roughly a 50\/50 split. So half of it is pass-through and half of it is roughly the gain that we realized on the platform.","Mark Hammond","All right, thanks, Chris. And then, on the FFELP cash flow slide, I see the cash flow from residuals, the secured FFELP is $6.1 billion. That is down $700 million sequentially. Just asking what drove that.","Christian Lown","Yeah, the biggest - it's what I talked about earlier as we refinanced our FFELP portfolio from one facility to another. One of our facilities, while attractively priced from a financing perspective had fairly strong or a fairly wide advance rates. And so, we were able to move those assets into another facility in an all-in cost that was better than that facility. So that was the primary result. You see the big increase in the cash position in our balance sheet.","Obviously, we are storing capital with the maturities we have coming up. So we feel very comfortable with our ability to not only address the 2019 maturities, but also the 2020 maturities.","Mark Hammond","Got it. Thanks, Chris. And then, lastly, on Slide 11 too, unsecured debt is labeled pro forma. What's it pro forma for?","Christian Lown","I think it's pro forma for just the calculation. It's just the calculation for what we say. I mean, it is the outstanding debt today. It's a good question. It's probably a - and it's been something historically. But it's just the number that the debt outstanding is today.","Mark Hammond","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. Hey, Chris, the financing that you just referenced, could you talk a little bit about whether that sort of thing helps or hurts the TNA ratio? And kind of related, whether - given that you are kind of at the lower end of that, are you going to be able to use more than a quarter's earnings? Or how do you think about the amount available for share repurchase in that context?","Christian Lown","Well, so, obviously, well, we gave guidance, when we find the TNA ratio of 1.23 to 1.25 times was by year end. And we managed to achieve within that sooner than expected. That financing actually helps our TNA ratio. What it does is it raises cash of our balance sheet instead of to pay down debt, instead of having to go to the high yield market issue, more debt longer term to pay it off.","So what you see us really aggressively looking at is our asset base and looking for opportunities to raise cash off of our assets instead of refinancing simply by rolling, and so, all of that inevitably inheres to the benefit of our TNA ratio and our capital structure. And also highlighting the situation, it was at a much better cost. So it was really a win-win.","As you are well aware, we have a very strong treasury team. We spend a lot of time looking to optimize our financing structure. And that was a great transaction for us to realize cash at a lower cost to improve our capital position. So for us it really was a - it just shows the strength of the team and also the desire to continue to look for efficiencies across the board.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. And kind of on a separate matter, given what you mentioned about the Puerto Rican toll collecting contract, is there a way to give us some breakdown of the various contracts and when they're up for renewal, so that we can kind of have a sense as to what's coming down the pike with respect to this, because it just seems like we tend to find out after the fact?","Christian Lown","So we have thousands of contracts broadly defined within our company. And so, I clearly understand the question. But we don't generally talk about contracts individually. And that clearly was a surprise to us of what happened. And we're working with the island to ensure a smooth transition. But we don't provide that specific guidance on individual contracts.","Moshe Orenbuch","Right, well, maybe it's something you should consider for the more material ones. Thanks.","Jack Remondi","I would just add on the funding side of the equation. Our operating at first are really not just focused on operating expense, but also the operating efficiency of our financing activities. And I think some of the things you see this quarter, both in terms of hedging the basis risk and some of these new financial vehicles, whether they are residual financings or just different structured deals, are really designed to improve the cash flows of the company, improve the net interest margins and they do also benefit the TNA ratio structure as well. So it's really been a solid performance on that front for us in addition to the operating expenses I should say.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. So the NIMs have been coming and better than your expectations FFELP and loan portfolios. Can you just talk just what's driving that?","Christian Lown","Sure. I think, it goes back to what both Jack and I just said, is that there has been - as we rolled into the year this year, we had a lot of thoughts and ideas around how we could improve financing structures and things we could do to keep NIM in place. Obviously, last year, you remember, we put in place the 1-3s [ph] programmatic hedging policy that has been very helpful in stabilizing our NIM.","Our financing benefits on warehouse costs on advance rates have been very helpful. This FFELP transaction that we just did again very helpful to how we think about our capital structure and cost of financing.","And then finally, we just continue to look for under every rock to see what we can find, this has just been a strong push to try to improve our cost from a financing perspective that inevitably benefits NIM. It's hard going into the year. We thought, we could make some of this happened, but obviously, you need the markets to be conducive, you need to find partners to be able to do these transactions with you, and we've been fortunate enough to do that.","So again, we feel very confident and comfortable with where we are on our NIM, but there has been a lot of work that's gone in behind it.","Sanjay Sakhrani","So this is sustainable level for both those assets classes?","Christian Lown","Well, sustainable is obviously dependent on a number of things, but we feel very good about our NIMs in the short- to medium-term. Then what I'd highlight is, the only thing you may see on the private credit portfolio is obviously as that portfolio amortizes, we are replacing the legacy portfolio today with the refi portfolio, which on a risk-adjusted basis, we think, it's a very attractive return, but clearly has a lower NIM than the private credit portfolio.","So you should see - you'll see that NIM come down not because there is deterioration in the NIM is just we're replacing assets with the refi assets. But otherwise, like-for-like, NIMs are - historic NIMs are at or potentially even better than where they've been.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And then on the refi product, I mean, those have trended well ahead of your expectations by almost like 50%. And you've only been able to focus on like half the markets. So should we assume these levels are pretty good run rate for the future, because you now have another opportunity as we move into the next year?","Christian Lown","So we haven't made a decision on another opportunity. Obviously, that's the decision we can make until January 1. What I would say to you is, the team has done a phenomenal job, building out the portfolio of the technology efficiencies behind it, and really driving a better result in the acquisition cost result. We are today as focused with volumes, as we are improving or achieving margins that we're looking for.","So I think, as Jack mentioned, the rest of our year, we're looking for $2.9 billion of total refi volume, which is basically on par from an origination perspective fourth quarter versus third quarter, should be relatively similar. And so you should look us going forward to maintain that sort of volume, but also try to improve margins, et cetera. And if there is that opportunity in 2019, clearly, we'll be looking to take advantage of it.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. I guess, the first one is sort of a follow-up one from Sanjay's question. It sounds like the FFELP portfolio margin NIM has been pretty stable, and based on your hedging and so forth in your efficiencies, you're suggesting that you anticipate that at least for the visible future. I'm wondering though for the Consumer Lending segment, it's been a lit bit more variable in my assumption is because there is a mix shift there, seasoning and so forth. Can you just clarify for that specific portfolio, what we should think about for the next few quarter in terms of margin?","Christian Lown","So we've gave guidance for the full year of $325 million for private credit. You saw in the first half of the year, we are below that in the second half of the year, we expect to be above that. I would say that we still feel good about that from a guidance perspective and maybe even a little bit about that. But that guidance still holds firm.","Going into 2019, I - our finance position for private credit for some of the financing actually starts to improve, some things roll off, so we feel very good about the cost structure of that business. I would just highlight that there is going to be a bigger refi portfolio within that Consumer Lending segment, which is going to start to reduce the NIM overall. But again, on a risk-adjusted basis, we feel very good about those assets in the return profile. But you would just have that attrition. And we will obviously provide 2019 guidance in our fourth quarter call for the full year 2019. But again, the shift will be almost purely because of a shift in the portfolio, not because of the deterioration in NIM in the legacy portfolio.","John Hecht","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Second question is, the over time, we've talked about different opportunities for you guys to buy various portfolios for certain banks. I know, it's competition-oriented, market-oriented and rate-oriented. Do you guys have any update on that opportunities in that regard?","Jack Remondi","So on the FFELP side of the equation, most of the large bank FFELP portfolios have transacted at this point in time. And so the opportunities are really would be from entities that have traditionally been long-term holders, non-profits state agencies. We certainly remain opportunistic in that space. And if we see opportunities to buy portfolios, we are active and bidding on them. But we're not going to see repeats of what we saw in prior years.","On the private credit side of the equation, all of the legacy portfolios where banks were originating loans and stopped, have been sold. We are really the prime and natural buyer in that space. And certainly to the extent getting portfolios were to be made available would be active in that front.","One of the things we bring we have some significant advantages in that arena. And that is we have really honed our strategies with customers to help identify high-risk borrowers, offer them alternative payment plan that keep them - keep their payments manageable and help them successfully stay current on their loans. We see that when we buy portfolios both in the FFELP and private side of the equation and that's how it's - as they moved onto our platform, we materially improve the overall performance. And so those advantages help, but you need willing sellers too.","John Hecht","Okay. Thanks for that update. And then final question. I think, you guys referred to reduce recovery rate some of the Consumer Lending segment. Maybe you can - is that just a onetime adjustment or how do we think about the catalyst for that than anything going forward for that adjustment?","Christian Lown","So that is a onetime adjustment. You should think about it, as we've been monitoring our recovery rates, we monitor them obviously quarterly, but we're monitoring them over the year. And what we've been doing over the year is provisioning for that potential change in case we had to change the recovery rates.","So our change from 21% to 19.5%, that's why there was no impact on the provision this quarter, it's already been accounted for in our expectation is that, that recovery rate today holds very well to our portfolio, and what we're seeing in the market. And therefore, there shouldn't be any of the adjustments going forward. It's just something we monitor all the time to ensure that our portfolio will recover back, what we expect from charge-offs.","John Hecht","Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Tarkan with Compass Point.","Michael Tarkan","Thanks for taking my questions. Just back on the earnings mix shift on NIM. Can you talk about, how to think about the mix shift as it relates to credit and maybe reserves. So specifically, I'm looking at reserves 5.6% of loans in repayment. I know, Earnest losses are coming in much lower, but can you talk about sort of where you're reserving for those loans? And how to think about that metric as we think - as we move forward?","Jack Remondi","So I think, it's in the refi side of the equation, we have talked about life of loan loss expectations of under 2%. Our performance would certainly support that number and more. So we're very confident about where we're heading here. Remember, these are portfolios, unlike traditional private student loans that are made during the in-school period. These are borrowers, who have been in successful repayment for a number of years have established themselves and their career in income opportunities.","And you see as a result, not unlike that we would see the same results in our legacy private loan borrowers, who reach that stage have very, very low levels of delinquency into fall.","Michael Tarkan","Thanks. On the expense side, you've lapped Duncan, and I guess in July, you're going to lap Earnest in November. Is it fair to say that, I know, you don't want to give guidance on 2019. But how do we think about the migration of expenses, I mean, should they be lower in 2019, as your core numbers are actually going lower?","Jack Remondi","So our focus, as both Chris and I had mentioned, is really on improving operating efficiencies. And so when we looked at some of these BP - these Business Processing business lines as an example. We've been able to take their expertise - the acquired entity's expertise in this product space or service space and marry it with our operating efficiency expertise. So improving workflows adding automation, adding data analytics to the process to dramatically improve operating results. You see it very clearly in the refi space, for example.","Earnest had developed excellent technology in terms of the underwriting capabilities, the modeling capabilities, the digital marketing strategies. We were able to marry that with some of the operating workflows that we've developed and become experts and to improve flows. And as we said, lead the industry in what we believe is the lowest cost of acquiring an account in that space.","We do the same thing a little bit less visible, because of the smaller business sizes and public transparency and other entities in the healthcare in the municipal arenas, but we've done exactly the same thing there as well.","Christian Lown","And I'd say it also permeates through the middle back office as well. And the CFO group, we've enacted automation and robotics. We're reconciling thousands of monthly transactions automatically today versus manual intervention. So there is, it's just at all across the board focused on driving efficiencies, driving automation, improving the business, not only as it amortizes down, but as we continue to scale our growth businesses.","So I think, your question was on the expense side, we continue to expect to push that expense base down and drive efficiencies as the business continues to mature.","Michael Tarkan","Okay, thanks. And then just last one for me. Just the increase in inventory in the asset recovery side, I know, the placements are very fluid. But we should expect that revenue associated with those fed inventory not to really pickup until, I guess, back half of 2019. Is that fair to say?","Christian Lown","That's right. We've started receiving placements at the end of 2017, and obviously 2018, we've received more and that will roll through a little bit starting at the end of this year, but then really start to roll through in 2019 and into 2020.","Michael Tarkan","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Henry Coffey with Wedbush.","Henry Coffey","Yes. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Two items sort of unrelated, but number one on the private student loan margin. The spending of the reset timing has been an issue. As rates rise, is that still likely to be an issue where rates rise and is a month or two lag, before everything kind of realigns itself or have with all the refinancing and other work you've done this year. Do you think, you've adjusted that to the point where this is more of a simple correlation between rising rates and trends in margin?","Christian Lown","So there are still short-term variability, but again there has always been catch up. It's interesting. We look at the fed dates is very important. What day of the month, the fed date falls on determines whether you get caught in that quarter's reset or that monthly resets, so we follow those closely. But again, there is usually less than a month lag. And some of these resets also on our amortizing portfolio, so it becomes less and less an issue as times goes on.","But also highlight when we get to the top of this rate environment, and then on the backside, where rates come back, we have that short-term beneficiary as well. So it is a minor issue. It is something, we aggressively follow on and track, but in the totality of our cash flows and our revenue, these are blips. They aren't real meaningful issues.","Henry Coffey","And then completely unrelated question, when you look at most of the complaints and lawsuits, et cetera, around student loan servicing, it seems the primary culprit is just how complex the processes for everybody. Can you give us some sense of where the Department of Ed is going to go, once they finally get through this whole contract process? I mean, are they - I mean, there's been a lot of rhetoric, but how do you think they will change hopefully improve simplify the servicing business for both obviously servicers and students - student borrowers?","Jack Remondi","Sure. You're correct on the first point, I mean, when we look at for example, the inquiries that are submitted to the CFPB portal, 98% - in the last year's review of that 98% of those comments were comments or complaints about federal program design. I don't like my interest rate. I want a credit bureau delinquency reporting retraction, those types of items. Then it points to the overall complexity of the program. There are 56 different repayment options available to borrowers in the federal loan programs.","The income based repayment application is over 10 pages long. It's filled with typical government jargon. It's definitely something that we have been advocating to simplify some of the tools that we've been able to bring to the table have dramatically improved results.","And we're advocating that, we'll be able to bring those to the Department of Ed portfolios, as a whole as well. For example, on income drive repayment forms, we've been able to increase the successful completion rate from 27% within 60 days to over 70% in 10 days, simply by helping borrowers complete the forms on the FFELP side and use - you would think not super modern technology, but like e-signatures to be able to simplify the process for consumers and would love to be able to bring that to the direct loan portfolio as well.","Henry Coffey","Great, thank you.","Jack Remondi","But that is in their hands.","Henry Coffey","I mean, they haven't - had they really laid out anything per se in the RFP process or is this kind of a\u2026?","Jack Remondi","Some of it is in the RFP and some of it would require legislative changes as well.","Henry Coffey","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan.","Richard Shane","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. When we look at the capital markets activity over the last year, you guys have done a good job buying back stock, balancing maturities and funding, rotating the funding. In 2019, you have $2.2 billion remaining maturities. You have $2.9 billion of unencumbered assets. I'm assuming that you will continue - if the unsecured markets are available, you'll try to keep a higher percentage of unencumbered assets just as a cushion. But I'm curious what the plan is headed into 2019 to meet those maturities and where you see on the term structure the best opportunities for unsecured issuance?","Christian Lown","So as you've seen in the last year, one of the things we've been trying to aggressively purse is finance or raise capital off of our balance sheet, instead of raising high yield debt. Obviously, we have an issue for a little while. And I think from our perspective what we're trying to do is, in these markets raise additional cash from the balance sheet instead of going to the high yield market. You saw that from the transaction we talked about. In the FFELP side, as you mentioned we have a pretty large unencumbered portfolio that we think a lot about. And there are other things that we can be doing around some facilities as they get closer to expiration, that can realize some cash as well.","So you mentioned the maturities we have in 2019. We have over $2 billion of cash in our balance sheet today from the activities we've done. We obviously are going to generate a huge amount of cash over the next year as well for 2020. And so, I would - there will be mixed of use of, there could potentially be high yield issuance in 2019. We'll look to raise additional cash off the balance sheet. We're in a very strong cash position today. So I think we feel really comfortable with where we are in 2019 and 2020, almost regardless of any scenario.","But we also have a lot of levers to pull to get over that last maturity in the unencumbered and the high yield market in this asset base. So I'm not sure if that exactly answers your question. But I think we - a mixture of all, but a strong desire to reduce our high yield footprint if possible.","Richard Shane","Okay. That's actually very helpful. It sounds to me - I kind of looked at it as repositioning to optimizing the secured structures in Q3 in anticipation of some unsecured issuance in 2019. But it sounds to me, now hearing that - the answer to that question, like you're going to from a funding mix percentage, reduce the unsecured going forward.","Christian Lown","We will continue to pay down our unsecured debt. Jack reminds me almost every day that the highest cost of this company is financing cost. And therefore, our goal is to continue to reduce that cost. And looking for ways to finance away from the high yield market, clearly benefit the company overall. And quite honestly, it's the things that we should be doing. It's what finance companies do and it's what we should be doing ourself.","Richard Shane","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Nair with Citi.","Ashish Nair","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick couple of follow-ups, one on Mark's question earlier. Could you remind us what the underlying NIM assumptions are for the 2019 sort of cash flow as you show in your slides, the $1.5 billion?","Christian Lown","We don't provide that guidance. For - we will be providing a fourth quarter NIM guidance for 2019. But you can assume that our - the NIMs that are probably within those forecast assume current market, broadly defined. And then any - obviously, things happen to that NIM over time, right. The floor income will go away over time. We've increased our disclosure around floor income. It shows you sort of the three years forward to lock in floor income. You see that amortized down over time, but away from that we feel very comfortable with what we've locked in from a NIM structure.","Ashish Nair","Got it. And also, just want to clarify on the provisions. I wanted to make sure you said that the current - the disaster form [ph] you've seen this year is already in that sort of number you have provisioned. And so, should we assume the $75 million that you had talked about earlier for 4Q? And also related, if you could sort of talk about how a higher rate environment affects your private loan portfolio, private education loan portfolio?","Christian Lown","I'm sorry, which portfolio?","Ashish Nair","The private education loan portfolio.","Christian Lown","Right, so let's talk first about the provision guidance. We still - that $75 million for the second half of the year still holds true. We feel very good about that going into the fourth quarter. So no change there on the $75 million.","And then on a rising rate environment, it was a little bit - that was discussed before. Our assets do reset. Our costs reset quicker. But they - all these costs do reset. And so, there is some short term negative drag as you missed a month or two of that reset. But it inevitably catches up.","And like I said, when we get on the backside of this rate environment it goes to the other way. And that short term benefit helps us. And so as we think about the long term value of this company and the cash flow that we generate and we think about this company as much on an ECF basis as anything else that is contemplated through the cycle of those cash flows. And therefore, those drags are already encompassed within our thought process.","Ashish Nair","Right, I should have clarified. I meant, the impact on sort of charge-offs and provisions.","Jack Remondi","The biggest driver, of course, of charge-offs in federal and private student loans is the jobs market and the economy. And the economy is obviously extremely strong right now. Unemployment rates for across the board are at decades lows. And we're seeing that in terms of both our existing loan portfolios as well as new borrowers entering repayment. If you look at the last graduating class that has entered repayment, which would be the 2018 graduating class is not yet entered repayment.","But for 2017, the delinquency rates of that portfolio 6 months into repayment are 60% lower than where they were at the peak of the recession. And that's really all driven by the strength of the economy and the jobs opportunities there versus interest rates.","Ashish Nair","Great. That's very helpful. And just another point I wanted to clarify, I don't know how much you were able to discuss at this point. But it was great to hear that you're looking to reduce your unsecured debt footprint. I assume you would - that would be consistent with any new issuance or rolling of maturities would be consistent with your sort of 1.23 to 1.25 TNA ratio target. Do you foresee increasing that or that's sort of the level you look comfortable with for the long-term?","Christian Lown","No, let's say - well, let me break that into two points. I mean, the refined guidance was to provide both equity and debt investors just an understanding of the capital that was available on our balance sheet, how we're going to run leveraging the company, and therefore, how we would pay down debt and also capital we could return to shareholders to stay within that guidance.","You should assume that that - we haven't formalized it for 2019, but you should assume that 1.23 to 1.25 times is a good range for 2019. I think it's important to remember all these - every financial institution is heading into CECL for 2020 and we're all being prepared for that.","And we think that that 1.23 to 1.25 times area provides us a good position to head into CECL and manage with adjustments from CECL. So there are a lot of reasons and rationale for that guidance. And clearly holds true going into CECL.","Ashish Nair","Got it. Thank you so much, guys. And good luck for rest of the year.","Jack Remondi","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Travis Pascavis with HIMCO.","Travis Pascavis","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Most of my questions have been answered, just maybe a general question around the attraction, the refi book, great job exceeding expectations. But I'm curious, what is your thinking around how you're attracting those assets to those borrowers. Given competition out there, how do you attract them and differentiate yourself, besides obviously just the lower rate and the compellingness to the borrower?","Jack Remondi","So it is principally a financial benefit to the consumer. That is the driver of a consumer looking to refinance your loans. And we're able to take a relatively high coupon Grad PLUS loan or a private loan and lower that rate materially, based on their exceptional credit profile. How we attract those customers to our portals ahead of the competition is really a digital marketing approach that has been developed here. We are principally marketing through those digital channels versus direct mail channels that most of our competitors focus on primarily.","That allows us to get to the customer in the venue that they're most likely to be searching, which is digitally versus mail. We're also - our origination platforms and capabilities internally allow us to provide rate quotes to the consumer earlier on in the application process based on minimal amounts of information provided, and then, to close those loans far quickly than others. And so, that combination of search, rate check, and processing speed are really the things that differentiate us compared to our peers.","Travis Pascavis","Great. And would you say there is any - of these particular attributes that could be extended to - the new opportunity in the primary market in January or should I think about that distinctly different in terms of the marketing proposition and kind of winning market share?","Jack Remondi","Well, I think in the refi space, we are presently not refinancing private student loans from the second largest holder of private loan Sallie Mae.","Christian Lown","After us.","Jack Remondi","After us - sorry. And so that opportunity is available to us in January. And then the other opportunity, of course, is - in-school lending is available to us beginning in January as well. And that's something that we're evaluating, but cannot say under - until January what our intentions are for students in that space will be.","Travis Pascavis","Understood, understood. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.","Jack Remondi","You're welcome.","Operator","That concludes our Q&A session for today. Mr. Fisher, do you have any closing remarks?","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Lisa. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. If you have any follow-up questions, feel free to call me directly.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. ","I will now turn the conference over to Joe Fisher. Please go ahead.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Christie. Good morning and welcome to Navient\u2019s 2018 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO and Chris Lown, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. ","During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the first quarter 2018 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted on the Investors page at navient.com. Thank you.","And now, I will turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Navient. Our financial results this quarter were very strong and delivered on the potential we outlined in January. We also are presenting our financial results in new business segments this quarter that reflect how we are managing the business. This new format is designed to provide you with greater insight in to the performance of our legacy and new businesses and to shine a more focused light on the potential within each of the new business segments. ","Our new business segments are; federal educations loans, here we combine the earnings from our FFELP portfolio and the servicing and asset recovery work we provide to federal education loan lenders, guarantors and the Department of Education. The consumer lending segment includes our private education loan assets and servicing including our newly launched refi origination business. ","The business processing segment includes the various management and processing services we provide to our clients in the government and healthcare markets, and our other segment is where we report our centralized overhead functions and our corporate liquidity portfolio. ","Starting on a consolidated basis, we are off to a very strong start in 2018 and our financial results reflect this. Our adjusted core earnings of $0.43 per share was driven by strong performance in each business area, expense management and from the lower tax rates implemented with the tax act. The results build off the corporate and student loan acquisitions we made in 2017 and our focused efforts to improve operating efficiency. For example, on a comparable basis operating expenses fell almost 8% from the year ago quarter. ","Highlights for this quarter include excellent growth in our refi and business processing business lines, continued improvement in credit quality, stable student loan margins, improving operating efficiency and lower taxes. ","In the federal education loan segment, we delivered improving student loan margin of 83 basis points and a meaningful reduction in operating expense, 17% when you exclude the new revenue recognition accounting rules. In consumer lending, we delivered very strong refi origination volume, $500 million in the quarter, value from the student portfolios we acquired in 2017 and improving student loan margin of 3.23% and improving credit quality evidenced by the $59 million decline in charge-offs.","I\u2019m very excited with our success in refi originations in the first quarter and continue to see a very strong ability to grow originations in this environment. Our products deliver meaningful cost savings to customers who have the ability and desire to amortize their student loan debt more rapidly. ","The ability to create value here can be clearly seen in an analysis of our recent refi ABS transaction completed in the first quarter. And Chris will describe the details of this in his remarks. In business processing, we set out to leverage the workflow skills and high performance results we have demonstrated in student loans and deploy those in the government and healthcare markets. ","Our strategy has been to acquire the right foundational base and combine these with our operating skills to deliver strong organic growth and attractive margins. Our results this quarter and prospects for 2018 are demonstrating the value we can create in this segment. Results this quarter include revenue growth of $29 million or 66%, with an organic revenue growth rate of 32%. And we delivered increased efficiency and scale that led to a 50% increase in the EBITDA margin to 21% overall. ","The government and healthcare markets represent a very attractive opportunity for us. Both markets are very large and they continue to move to a partnership services model to deliver lower cost and higher performance. Our service leverage our workflow designs, use of data analytics and strong compliance systems to deliver exceptional value and higher performance. They are also not capital intensive. ","Most importantly, they allow our clients to focus on the core services they provide to their constituents, patients and other customers.","I see continued strong growth trends in this area and more specifically we expect to deliver full year organic revenue growth of 30%, while continuing to improve EBITDA margins. ","Credit quality in our private loan portfolio was another bright spot this quarter. The provision for loan losses declined by $18 million to $77 million for the quarter. In the charge-off rate for our consumer loan segment fell to 1.4%, the lowest level in more than a decade. Our outreach efforts in alternative payment programs allow us to help borrowers with loan terms they can afford and most importantly programs that amortize their loan balances. ","We also continue to support federal student loan borrower success, and new department of that data shows, we continue to lead comparable services in enrollment and income group and repayment plans with the lowest of all grades. ","Lastly, we are and our teaming partners submitted our round one proposal for services under the Department of Education next-gen servicing RFP. We believe this combined comprehensive proposal is best-in-class and look forward to the opportunity to work the department here. ","By delivering on our mission to enhance the financial success of our customers, we help millions of individuals achieve their goals for themselves and their communities. For 2018, we are focused on delivering outstanding results for our customers, clients and investors. Our goals are to maximize cash flows, create value by growing our refi and business processing businesses and continuing to improve our operating efficiency. ","This quarter\u2019 results begin to deliver on the potential and promise we talked about in January. As our strong financial results improve our capital ratios, we will return additional capital to shareholders beyond dividends to include share repurchases. Our goal is to create value that is recognized in the share price. ","Thank you for your interest this morning, and look forward to your questions later in the call. Chris.","Chris Lown","Thanks Jack, and thank you to everyone on today\u2019s call for you interest in Navient. During my prepared remarks, I will review the first quarter results for 2018; I will be referencing the earnings call presentation which can be found on the company\u2019s website in the investor section. ","Starting on slide 3, adjusted core EPS was $0.43 in the first quarter compared to $0.37 from a year ago. And as Jack mentioned, we have changed our reporting segments to provide investors with greater visibility and to Navient\u2019s underlying growth in how we manage and value the business. ","In conjunction with the filing of our first quarter 10-Q, we will provide three full years of historical financial statements as they would have reported in these new segments beginning with 2015. Let\u2019s now move in to our new segment reporting, beginning with federal education loans on slide 4. ","Core earnings were a $141 million for the first quarter versus a $129 million in the first quarter of 2017. The interest was primarily related to reduced operating expenses and a lower tax rate, partially offset by a $23 million decrease in fee income associated with the new terms contained in a previously disclosed modified contract. ","The net interest margin for the first quarter was 83 basis points compared to 78 basis points in the year ago quarter. The recent dislocation in one month versus three month LIBOR rates has been mitigated by our new hedging strategy implemented last year. At quarter end, 93% of this risk was hedged for the remainder of the year. We now expect a full year FFELP student loan NIM to be in the mid to high 70s. ","Now let\u2019s turn to slide 5 in our consumer lending segment. Core earnings in this segment increased to $50 million from $38 million in the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter, the consumer lending net interest margin was 323 basis points in line with our expectations. We continue to expect full year NIM to be approximately 325 basis points. However, as we have discussed previously, Navient is negatively bias to a rising environment and we continue to closely monitor the feds and funding rates. ","On slide 11 in the appendix, we provide additional detail to the long term profitability of newly originated education refinanced loans. As we continue to transition loans from outstanding facilities to securitizations and build our portfolio, we expect the student loan spread on these loans to approach 2%. The economics provided on this slide are based on our most recent private ABS transaction. ","We are very pleased with the continued improvement in our credit quality, as private education loan losses and delinquencies continue to decline year-over-year, with total delinquency rates declining by 16% from the prior year. ","Due to a number of significant natural disasters, over the last three quarters, we have seen an elevated use of disaster forbearance compared to a year ago. We believe this will ultimately lead to a higher charge-off level this year, compared to the current quarter. ","We also expect to see slightly higher charge-offs for the rest of 2018 associated with the $3 billion portfolio that we acquired last year, but are still below our original projections. As a result, we anticipate that quarterly provision for loan losses to be in the low to mid-$80 million range for the remainder of the year. ","Let\u2019s continue to slide 8 to review our business services segment. Fee revenues in this segment grew 66% from the prior year. Excluding the acquisition of Duncan Solutions, non-education fee revenue grew 32% organically year-over-year. Our EBITDA margins also increased to 21% from 14% last year as a result of our continued focus on expenses and growing our client base. ","We continue to see organic growth opportunities in both government services and healthcare revenue cycle management and on pace to achieve our guidance of at least 30% revenue growth year-over-year. ","Let\u2019s turn to slide 7 for additional detail on a reported first quarter total expenses of $282 million. During the quarter, we incurred $7 million of restructuring and other reorganization expenses in connection with our continued efforts to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency. This quarter\u2019s regulatory related legal expenses were $4 million, virtually all of which stem from the CFPB case and related matters. ","Excluding restructuring and regulatory costs, we reported operating expenses of $271 million in the first quarter compared to $234 million a year ago. Taking a closer look at these expenses, first quarter operating costs related to Duncan Solutions in earnest which were acquired in the second half of 2017 totaled $29 million. ","We also incurred $3 million of servicing fee and one-time expense of $9 million related to the transfer of a $3 billion third party service portfolio to Navient. This $9 million investment will be accretive to earnings going forward. ","We adopted the new accounting revenue recognition standard in the first quarter, which resulted in a $14 million increase in operating expenses that primarily impacted our fee base contracts in the federal and education loan segment. Further details can be found in the full earnings release. ","As a result, only of the newly adopted accounting revenue recognition accounting standards, we now expect operating expenses for 2018 to be $70 million higher than our previous guidance resulting in new guidance between $980 million and $1 billion excluding restructuring and regulatory costs. This does not alter our $1.85 to $1.95 EPS guidance for 2018. ","Let\u2019s turn to slide 8, which highlights our financing activity. In the quarter, we acquired over $800 million of education loans with $500 million originated organically. At quarter end, we had $2.4 billion of available capacity in our FFELP facilities and $723 million in our private facilities. ","We expect to further reduce the size of our FFELP facilities in 2018 to more effectively manage expenses associated with unutilized excess capacity. In the quarter, we issued two FFELP ABS transactions for $2 billion. These two transactions were financed at re-offer spreads that were 35% tighter in our first deal of 2017. ","We also issued our first securitization that consisted entirely of private education refinance loans. There were significant investor interest across the capital structure that led to a re-offer spread to swaps of 56 basis points, a tighter spread of any benchmark student loan refi ABS transaction this year. In addition, we closed our $1.4 billion of ABS repurchase facilities that included the refinancing of $478 million of existing facilities. This raised $849 million of net new cash at a weighted average cost of funds that was nearly a 120 basis points lower than our previous facilities. ","In addition to reducing our outstanding maturities by $167 million in the quarter, we also announced a $1.2 billion of make whole call effective April 27 for unsecured notes due in June. As a result, our next unsecured maturity isn\u2019t until January 2019. ","Let\u2019s turn to GAAP results on slide 9; we reported first quarter GAAP net income of $126 million or a $0.47 per share compared with net income of $88 million or $0.30 per share in the first quarter of 2017. The primary difference between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions. ","In summary, our financial results this quarter was strong across the board and were highlighted by robust growth in our refi and business processing business alliance and continued improvement in credit quality, operating efficiencies and financing costs. ","And with that, I will open the call up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Mark DeVries","This quarter\u2019s implied run rate on the consolidation originations of 2 billion was above what you guided to. Is that a good run rate going forward or do you kind of get off to a harder start than you expected?","Jack Remondi","Well we certainly got off to a great start in the first quarter and we expect the trends here to continue to be similar to what we are seeing so far this year. Our guidance right now is \u2013 we left at the same at $1.5 billion but clearly we\u2019re on a pace to surpass that. ","Mark DeVries","Is there any kind of seasonality in that activity which would suggest this quarter might be bigger than normal?","Jack Remondi","No. ","Mark DeVries","Okay. Jack can you give us a sense of the addressable market there, both sit at the current rate of closer to 5% and how might that change if benchmarks rates rise enough that you have kind of move the rate and your nuance to 6% or higher?","Jack Remondi","Well the majority of the customers that are looking to refinance their education loans have been [out] of school for a number of years, and have demonstrated very strong employment trends and earnings profiles. And these are customers that are generally looking to take advantage of the fact that their cash flows are more than sufficient to amortize their debt more rapidly than the standard terms in the federal programs and are taking advantage of that by selecting your program terms that give them a better rate and a lot of them to pay their loan off faster. ","I think the combination of activities when you look at where the loan products are that we are refinancing their balances that have been outstanding for a number of years. The opportunities are coming as I said from graduates, from those folks who primarily have attended graduate schools and we really don\u2019t see that market place slowing down even though rates have been rising here over the last couple of quarters are expected to continue to increase over the next couple of quarters. So we\u2019re optimistic about the opportunity and the ability to play a meaningful role in this fix. ","Mark DeVries","And then finally for Chris, I heard you indicated that you still got in to a private (inaudible) 325 bps, I think you qualified that I think. You negatively buy at higher rates, could you just give us a sense of what type of rate assumptions are embedded in that guidance and kind of what could happen to the NIM if rates kind of moves materially higher than what you\u2019re assuming. ","Chris Lown","Sure, so our original guidance in January obviously the move shifted pretty meaningfully after our earnings call in January, and so we are fighting that negative bias and we had in our plan two rate increases. So obviously the expectation now is for the rate of four and timing matters as well. So there is a negative bias, but there is a lot we\u2019re doing to try to stem that bias as well. So we do feel comfortable maintaining that 325 basis point NIM guidance. But it\u2019s just something we do considering and look at if the debt raised is sooner, the dates of when the fed rates matters as well. So we just continue to monitor that. Number of raises will probably have the biggest impact. ","Mark DeVries","So should I take from that we it would need to be in excess of four raises before we would see any kind of erosion from that 325 guidance?","Chris Lown","No, I actually think it would be less than that. But as I mentioned that we are employing some other strategies to try to do other things to solidify that NIM. So it\u2019s still a lot of work on our side to try to [switch] that rising rate environment. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","I guess first Jack, I\u2019m just curious. When we think about the competitive environment and the potential for M&A for portfolio acquisitions, is there anything that\u2019s meaningful changed in the market place and maybe you could just qualitatively talk about what\u2019s happening and how you\u2019re positioned?","Jack Remondi","In the legacy arena this would be FFELP portfolios and older private loan portfolios. The large financial institutions that own portfolios that are no longer in those businesses have for the most part sold their portfolios, and so we definitely had expected and projected I should say and would expect the volume opportunities to decline. ","The rate environment and the funding capabilities in the ABS phase has certainly made that market place more competitive as well and as you know where as the last five years or so we\u2019ve been very disciplined in terms of on the pricing side of the equation when purchasing portfolios. We view these as basically buying cash flows, its\u2019 not a franchise purchasing opportunity. And so if they don\u2019t generate the returns that we find attractive, we don\u2019t participate. ","So our view at this stage in the game is that the opportunities or purchase portfolios will be somewhat modest and will be impacted by competitive forces. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","And we\u2019ve heard about some of the larger players that actually are sort of retrenching potentially from the market. Is that an avenue or window in for you as we look towards 2019, and maybe reengaging in the market? ","Jack Remondi","You\u2019re talking about for FFELP portfolios or --?","Sanjay Sakhrani","For private.","Jack Remondi","In loan sales or loan originations?","Sanjay Sakhrani","Origination. ","Jack Remondi","Sorry, I was responding to portfolio purchase opportunities before. I think in the origination side of the equation, the market place is dominated obviously by three large players and certainly we\u2019re seeing one of those players be less aggressive in that space. We look at that market place as being an attractive opportunity for us to potentially play in the future. We have that non-compete that restricts us from participating there until 2019. ","But it\u2019s certainly something we\u2019re looking at and when we look at the skillsets, the infrastructure, the existing infrastructure that we have in this place, our ability to understand the performance of borrowers and the different risk profiles there, we definitely see ourselves if we play in that spaces having a distinct competitive advantage. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","And then Chris, just two questions for you. One, the margins in the business processing segment, they\u2019ve done quite well year-over-year. Obviously you expect them to sort of moderate for the remainder of 2018, but what is the margin potential in that segment overtime? Can we an expansion from these levels and to what levels or what points? And then on (inaudible) have you given any updated dots around (inaudible) and how it might affect you?","Chris Lown","On the business processing segment, what you\u2019re seeing in that margin expansion is as we\u2019ve acquired these businesses, we\u2019ve been able to drive synergies through them as well as focus on originating new business and driving value in to these franchises. We\u2019ve only owned these businesses for a couple of years so it\u2019s all starting to come together in a way that we expect it, but it\u2019s obviously from our perspective very attractive and we look forward to the development going forward. ","The margin of 21% we had historically guided towards to mid-to-high teens EBITDA margins in this business. If there are opportunity to get through 21% sure, but I think we feel very good about the margins we\u2019re producing today and the opportunity and you look at comparable margins at other BPS businesses these actually fairly attractive numbers from that perspective. ","On the [CESO] perspective, we obviously are monitoring what\u2019s happening very closely. You saw some announcements from the regulators recently, the rating agencies still haven\u2019t given a lot of guidance on how they think about the implementation of CESO. We are starting to do our work and our analysis around that, but we don\u2019t have anything else to plan on at this time. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Tarkan with Compass Point. Please go ahead. ","Michael Tarkan","Just on the credit side, so understand some higher charge-offs flowing through this year with storms, but the TDR portfolios has come down sequentially now for three straight quarters and reserves are flat. The provision guidance is helpful, but how do we think about reserves longer term especially as you\u2019re mixing in earnest loans and then eventually in-school loans. Should that 5.8% of loans in repayment should that start to trend down and then as a follow-up just on the CESO comment, when do you be better positioned on a relative basis given that TDRs are over 40% of your portfolio and you\u2019ve already reserved for life of loan losses. ","Jack Remondi","A few comments there, your comments around the reserve and the blending of the refi product clearly will have an impact and you see the performance in the refi product, you can look at the trust, but not only our trust, but other trust, and cleaved in very strong. So we\u2019d expect the trend that you\u2019re seeing to continue. So that is our expectation and we provided that guidance for the rest of the year. ","With regard to your second was --?","Michael Tarkan","On CESO and TDR.","Jack Remondi","So if you look at our portfolio, we have a $24 billion to $25 billion private loan portfolio and as you mentioned roughly 10 billion is TDR and the other 14 plus is non-TDR. That 14 billion of portfolio is still a fairly large portfolio and so inevitably we will be impacted by CESO in a meaningful way given a two-year reserve window given the size of that portfolio. But having that TDR portfolio provisioned for does help. But it does not mean that we won\u2019t be impacted either. ","Michael Tarkan","And then just as a follow-up, with the earnest loans how should we think about reserving for those loans? I know loss compens\u2019 is really low, but you have to do the two year forward. Just what kind of reserves do you build for earnest and then where do those stabilize?","Jack Remondi","Actually if you look in the appendix, you can see sort of the way that we have projected out the trust for that information and you could model that pretty identically going forward with additional originations and as we finance it. So you got a little information on slide 11 in the appendix to give you some numbers. ","Chris Lown","That\u2019s right. We definitely expect credit losses to be a small fraction of what we see in our legacy private loan portfolio. The charge-offs rates in this portfolio are running 10% of what our legacy portfolio is running to day, and the CESO impact in the TDR side of the equation is 43% of our portfolio overall. ","The challenge with the CESO implementation is as we discuss this internally any number we give here we all know it\u2019s going to be wrong, right, because it\u2019s a projection of life of loan losses which will vary depending on economics and life impacts of our customers. So that\u2019s just something that we are trying to gauge and provide perhaps a broader range versus a narrow target.","Operator","Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","Maybe could you guys discuss a little bit your thoughts about capital return, given the success you\u2019ve had on the capital markets front, but then again the success you\u2019ve had kind of generating these refi loans and how you think about that particularly in the context of the core FFELP portfolio seems to declining at least in the first quarter at what would be an annualized double digit rate. ","Chris Lown","As you saw in the earnings presentation, our TNA ratio rose to the level that we had expected in the quarter at 1.21 times. We feel either more confident in our guidance of being at 1.23 or 1.25 times by year-end and our expectation to return to buying back stock in the second half of the year. As you mentioned, there are a number of moving factors that maybe generating a little more capital and I think we\u2019ll be committed in the last call is if there is an opportunity where we see excess capital beyond the guidance we\u2019ve given, we clearly will take advantage of that, but we do feel very confident in the guidance we gave last quarter. ","Moshe Orenbuch","And does the stock price itself factor in to that, in terms of where the stock is thinking about buying it back at current levels versus something could be at a different level at a future point in time?","Chris Lown","There\u2019s no question stock price is a factor here and obviously we\u2019d prefer to be buying back stock at lower prices versus higher ones. But we\u2019d also prefer a higher stock price and a lower one in total. But we\u2019re certainly going to take a look at what the opportunities present themselves and how we might take advantage of today\u2019s stock price for third and fourth quarter stock repurchases. ","Moshe Orenbuch","And just on a separate matter, kind of went through some of the restated financials and the regrouping of your groups and it\u2019s a little difficult because that history is not really there for most of the metrics. But could you talk a little bit about how you think about the 80 million in the quarter of essential cost which is a number that I guess is probably significantly higher than you\u2019d had in that other segment before and how it relates to your cost allocations to the government loan segment. ","Jack Remondi","I think the focus of putting centralized overhead and liquidity cost on to another bunker rather than distributing them is in part to sign more focus on that make sure we are being responsible at managing those costs down. We move things around a little bit in the buckets here, but the overall expenses in that side of the equation are trending down as we look to continue our focus on improving operating efficiency. ","And the focus here on operating efficiency is not just about OpEx. Chris talked about the efforts we\u2019re making on the interest side of the equation and what can we do to reduce the impact of the drag in earnings as caused by maintaining a liquidity portfolio, managing our funding capacity and FFELP programs for example to maintain more lines than we need to the financing transactions that we completed during the quarter. ","We got much better pricing on our term ABS fields, we refinanced some of our private credit ABS repurchase facilities to materially lower cost and from the prior financing transaction, but they are also substantially lower than unsecured debt cost as well. All of which are contributing to improved operating efficiency. ","Chris Lown","And I think what we really try to do is make sure that cost with the business leaders that we were embedded within their segments were costs that they could control and that they could manage. Well we found historically that there were some costs there that they really couldn\u2019t control and moved other costs that were uncontrollable in to the overhead bucket where Jack and I can actually focus on and then spend a lot of time in trying to manage them and get them down. So it really was an alignment exercise so that we can all be held accountable and take charge of the costs that are embedded within our business units. ","Moshe Orenbuch","Just kind of following up on that, the question of how much of those costs by each segment particularly on the centralized segment and then the government servicing are fixed versus variable would be extremely helpful to understand as we\u2019re kind of looking at those businesses particularly given that how much you showed on what I think was slide 7 in terms of the performance of that business.","Chris Lown","That\u2019s a good thought and we\u2019ll think to [review] that as that\u2019s a good comment. ","Jack Remondi","I do want to point out is, just because something appears to be a fixed cost does not mean we are not focused on ways to reduce it. And I understand your point, but it doesn\u2019t reduce our efforts there. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Please go ahead. ","Arren Cyganovich","The FFELP margin guidance coming, I guess is a little bit higher than last, but still somewhat lower I think in this past quarter. What\u2019s driving that down for the remainder of the year?","Jack Remondi","There are a couple of things that resulted in NIM on the FFELP being a little better than expectations. One, slower premium amortization of the portfolio which benefits the NIM margin on the FFELP portfolio and that is partially a result of similar forbearance we saw in the natural disasters and so we would expect that to equalize overtime, although we are just seeing a little slower premium amortization than we had expected. And then also with an asset index mismatch there and there\u2019s the benefit FFELP portfolio in a rising rate environment and so again as that moderate and we see rate stop rising when you look at the curve that rises to our mid-to-high 70s guidance. ","Arren Cyganovich","Is the hedge that you put on in place of that that includes expectations rising past the hedge \u2013 to continue hedging that over time? ","Jack Remondi","So we\u2019ve mitigated the one (inaudible) risk for 2018 as we\u2019re mostly hedged. So it really doesn\u2019t come in to play given all the hedging activity we did last year to really neutralize that risk in the FFELP portfolio. But we\u2019re really eliminate that risk from an impact on the FFELP portfolio. It doesn\u2019t do much to bolster or benefit the NIM.","Arren Cyganovich","For the remaining life of the portfolio?","Jack Remondi","For the remaining 2018. Obviously we are having to keep hedge going in to 2019 and we are actually hedging by going out and buying contract that starts six to nine months out, but inevitably in 2019 we are facing a wider once through these basis versus what we have hedged in 2018. ","Arren Cyganovich","And then in terms of the combined next gen RFP, maybe you can just give a little bit of a color on some of the nuances around that contract and what your expectations are from a timing standpoint. ","Jack Remondi","So the contract provides basically segments, the services that the department is seeking for in to individual components, and people can bid on the individual components or chose to bid on a comprehensive basis for all of the other components. We chose to bid on comprehensive basis for all of the components. We believe that can drive both higher levels of success in terms of the conversions of portfolios and management of borrower outcomes and also probably most importantly drive lower cost for the Department of Education. ","In terms of timing, the expectation is that later this summer we will hear from the department on round one selection and then they will issue a timeline for the submission, and more details of the specifics they\u2019re looking for and around two processes and the timelines for that. But there\u2019s a fair amount of noise and discussion on this including some restrictions coming from Congress as to how the department can operate this contract if you have to fully play out. ","Arren Cyganovich","And with ASC 606, looking at the higher expenses, there were also higher revenues focuses here. Can you talk a little bit about; one, what specifically does that represent? I read through the disclosure and I still don\u2019t fully quite understand the timing impact here and what the ongoing impact it is pertaining to those contracts representing in the financials. ","Chris Lown","So the majority of our 606 adjustment came through our portfolio management contract which is a gross up of our expenses and revenues. And if you think of that 70 million guidance basically the majority of it is really coming from that what becomes a pass-through for us of a gross up of revenues and expenses on the PM business. ","You\u2019re right in there, there was a little increase though there is a little delta between the revenue and expenses as a result of the adoption of 606. And that was in particular to one contract where we were expecting to realize the revenue throughout 2018, because of 606 that actually accelerated that acceleration and expenses in to the first quarter versus over more of 2018. That tails off until the majority of it really ends up just becoming the adjustment as a result of the portfolio management 606 adjustment. ","Jack Remondi","I think just to add a little more color there. In the PM contract effectively those expenses that Chris is referring were netted against revenue so this is nothing more than a pass-through process that will now gross up revenues and expenses by an equal amount in that particular contract of the (inaudible). ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Hammond with Bank of America High Yield. Please go ahead. ","Mark Hammond","Three questions and pretty quick. So the first one is, with the new segments, what\u2019s the allocation of unsecured debt between the federal consumer and other segments?","Chris Lown","We obviously look at the allocations from a number of perspectives. The reality is a lot of the unsecured today, unsecured debt is allocated against the private portfolio, but there is some minor allocations also to the refi product as well as the FFELP portfolio. But the majority of that unsecured debt is aligned against the private portfolio, and specifically the legacy portfolio versus the refi portfolio. ","Jack Remondi","And the liquidity portfolio. ","Chris Lown","And the liquidity portfolio.","Mark Hammond","And that liquidity portfolio that\u2019s in the other segment, right?","Chris Lown","That\u2019s right. ","Mark Hammond","And that\u2019s just, trying to get a sense for what\u2019s that is funding, just assets and liabilities. I know the unsecured debt would be funding part of that, but what is it funding exactly?","Jack Remondi","The liquidity portfolio is there to meet our cash needs of maturing debts. So, one of the things Chris mentioned in his comments is that we did an equal call for the final debt maturity we have in 2018. If we did not do that we would be sitting on a larger balance of cash in anticipation of that debt maturity. So we\u2019re actually sitting on that in March 31, but where if by calling it we were able affectively minimize the impact of that negative drag of short term cash investments versus unsecured debt cost of funds. ","But the allocation and we look at how we allocated the unsecured debt. It really is about the \u2013 and if you look at the advance rates that we get on securitization transactions and FFELP portfolios the advance rate is very high and so therefore they consumer substantially lower levels of unsecured debt in the process. ","Chris Lown","And inevitably we run liquidity and you can see it on our balance sheet, just as Jack mentioned to manage maturity, but also to make sure that we\u2019re in compliance with buffers etcetera, liquidity buffers that we require to be prudent. So it\u2019s really just the management of that to ensure that we can meet obligations, fund the business and maintain our ratings. ","Mark Hammond","And then moving on with the segment name change, is there any reason why you chose the broader consumer lending name as oppose to be more specific like calling it the education lending segment?","Jack Remondi","I\u2019ll just take that. The reality of the Earnest business that we acquired, when we acquired it they were originating a very small amount of originate to sell assets in the personal unsecured loan space and on the mortgage space. So these are not balance sheet loans, these are loans that are originated to sell. We like that model, we think that model can potentially be grown. And so in order to accomplish a broader number of products we need to consume the lending. ","And you\u2019re correct, the reality today it is primarily an education\/refi segment, but there is the opportunity for us on the originate to sell basis to grow those businesses, and we are exploring that opportunity. ","Mark Hammond","And then last one is on, typically we hear talk about purchasing performing loan portfolios. Has Navient ever considered purchasing portfolios of delinquent or non-performing consumer loans and then collecting on them?","Jack Remondi","That business was something we were in many years ago, but we exited that space and have no plans to return to it. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","John Hecht","You need to address a certain ways, but we\u2019ve got cost related to Duncan where it was trying to get about 29 million a quarter. How scalable are those costs given some of your growth prospects in each of those segments. And then second related question is, we\u2019ve talked about Earnest and some of the volume opportunities there. I wonder if you can give us some update on Duncan in that same regards.","Chris Lown","So both of these businesses have what you would effectively call volume related cost components to them. In the Earnest side of the equation it\u2019s the variable cost that we incur to acquire loans that\u2019s marketing, the digital strategies and efforts that we make in that space. The leverage opportunity in that area is to drive those variable costs down as we become \u2013 as our digital marketing strategies become more efficient. That is something that has happened in Q1 versus Q4 as an example. That\u2019s also to leverage the core infrastructure cost associated with running our data analytics, the modeling and strategy build off of a larger base of origination volume. ","In Duncan, you have similar kinds of metrics here although as volume ramps up the cost opportunities of leveraging the overhead and management structures in the systems are definitely achievable. And I would add one more piece in Duncan that\u2019s different than Earnest and that the efforts that and the customer we serve in that space had some overlap with the work that we were doing and that we do (inaudible) particularly in the total space, and the opportunities to, for lack of a better word, capture synergies out of that combination of business activities is pretty significant. ","And then the last thing I would just mention in terms of our business processing opportunities broadly is, one of the things that we have done an excellent job at in the student loan servicing side of the equation is using workflows and analytics to automate and materially improve operating efficiency over time and we think there\u2019s a significant opportunity for us to do the same in the BPS phase and working aggressively on that front. That\u2019s part of why you\u2019re seeing the margin expansion in Q1 for this reporting period. ","John Hecht","And as a follow-up you mentioned some improvement in customer acquisition costs at Earnest. I am sure you can\u2019t disclose those in detail, but I am wondering can you give us in order to kind of quantify the opportunity what type of percentage decline have you seen recently and how far can you drive that down over the next year or two?","Chris Lown","Our efforts right now in the \u2013 we\u2019ve owned the company for five months. I think it\u2019s probably a little bit too early to say where we can drive it to. But they had detailed plans on how to reduce those costs over time and build more efficient digital strategies and models there. But we are definitely looking to continue that process. Some of that is of course also just how you originate the loan product as well so that you become more efficient at moving volume through the underwriting pipelines in the process. We\u2019ll talk more about that later in the year I think in terms of where we are headed. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Rick Shane","When we look at some of the outlook commentary, a little bit of spread compression or mean compression in the FFELP business, higher provision expense in the consumer lending business. It strikes me that those businesses will probably trend flat to down slightly from a Q1 level. I guess the FFELP business probably trend down slightly, the consumer business will be offset by some growth. ","Impulsively your guidance suggests that there is about $35 million of net income that\u2019s going to be picked up in the remainder of the year. Is the expectation that that\u2019s really going to come from the new business or from the business processing segment? Is that really where we should see that growth?","Jack Remondi","So the purpose of the new business segments were to provide greater transparency in the performance of the individual segments, but in the federal education loan segment business itself and you\u2019re correct and we\u2019ve had a very declining business, right. No new FFELP loans have been originated and the vast majority of the revenues and earnings in that segment come from either owning FFELP loans or providing services to FFELP loan participants in that process. ","That would provide the forecast of the cash flows that we expect to derive from that space of 20 years. It\u2019s a sense that portfolio is nationalized in 2010, this has been kind of what that business is. We\u2019ve been able to alter it a bit by buying portfolios, but those opportunities that we see is becoming smaller and smaller. ","And when we look at where we could drive future earnings growth, it is coming from a combination of activities. It\u2019s primarily coming from growing in the BPS and consumer lending segments as you pointed in refi, but also the opportunity to expand that perhaps in to in-school originations. It\u2019s coming from our focus on operating efficiency, driving down our cost, improving the margins that we have in the business and minimizing or reducing interest expense in the process as well as a component of the overall spread. ","So those are the principal drivers that we\u2019re focused on for the balance of 2018 and really beyond. ","Chris Lown","And then also capital return will have impact as well as you get in to the second half of \u201918 and in to \u201919, which will clearly benefit earnings per share as well. ","Rick Shane","Look, I want to put a little bit of a final point on this that sort of back the envelope math and I\u2019m talking about assume some repurchase. I understand that obviously the sort of wasting asset nature of the FFELP business, but in 2000 in the back half of the year, it sounds like there\u2019s going to be a little bit of NIM compression. ","So let\u2019s assume that we saw sort of peak earnings at least for the year in that segment. In the consumer lending business you talk about additional provision expense, certainly there\u2019s going to be growth there, potentially if you move back in to in-school, there\u2019s going to be expense associated with getting back on preferred lenders lists. ","So, realistically that business is going to be perhaps flat for the year from here and that\u2019s fine. But what I\u2019m trying to understand is, does it really, and again can you sort of walk us through the path in terms of the revenue growth objectives on the EPS to sort of drive that incremental 35 million. And again it is not 35 million per quarter, it\u2019s $35 million gap where you are today and where you would need to be at the end of the year if it hit the low end of guidance. Is that the way to think of this?","Jack Remondi","Our goal and our guidance in the EPS space is for 30% organic revenue growth in 2018. We certainly benefit from the acquisition we made in terms of total revenue of Duncan mid-way through 2017, but generally speaking we\u2019re looking to drive increased revenue and increased profitability from that business segment, and frankly that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019ve created this new business segment and highlighted it here for you to see and see the revenue grow specifically and see the margins specifically.","But everything you\u2019ve said Rick is generally correct, the pressure is on FFELP in private are there. Those are things that we\u2019ve been expecting since the business was nationalized in 2010. ","Rick Shane","With that in mind I appreciate that you guys are going to provide \u201915, \u201916, and \u201917 numbers broken out annually because of the way that everybody sort of looks at the numbers. Quarterly numbers for \u201917 at least, \u201916 would be ideal. But if you could include \u201917 numbers sooner rather than later, rather than rolling them out when you report each quarter, that would be really helpful as people go back and reconstruct their models. ","Jack Remondi","Noted, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Henry Coffey with Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Henry Coffey","There\u2019s going to be a lot of work, but on that topic, breaking them down and then breaking the line of businesses in to new categories is obviously very helpful. I\u2019ve had some questions around that and this answers all of them, so thank you. The consolidated number are modeling of sort of the revenue and the consolidated businesses, except for the fact that you\u2019ll be achieving your goals of being more effective on certain fronts. That\u2019s not really going to change that much. Is that an accurate way of thinking about it? When I look at the P&L, it\u2019s not going to be radically different. ","Jack Remondi","Well, I do think your mix of components of business is changing, right, because one, your largest business, our largest segment, the federal education segment is amortizing and its amortizing at a pace that\u2019s pretty much in line with what we expected, sometimes it\u2019s\u2019 a little faster, sometimes it\u2019s a little slower, as the ones this quarter. But that is declining and then the other businesses are expected to replace that, not dollar for dollar of course, but they are pieces they are growing and growing at different paces than the \u2013 as other businesses are declining. ","I think probably one of the bigger items that has been and we hope this and I appreciate your comments on the value of the new segments that you provide here is that the amortization and profitability that\u2019s been coming on the portfolio is coming from a spread business which is being replaced with in many instances revenue on a fee based business and the dollars are smaller and profitability on the margins might be attractive and smaller as a result of that. ","And so that has always been part of the challenge in the mix issues as it gets I think explained and disclosed to investors, breaking it in to the segments is our attempt to make some of those points more transparent and easier for investors to see the results and frankly growth opportunities. So those are -.","Henry Coffey","No, I agree, I\u2019m just thinking about it from \u2013 I agree completely, I had questions around all of this and then now you\u2019ve solved them. But the actual modelling of job is \u2013 the challenges are about the same, you headed now the FFELP, you had to think about the loans in here. So it\u2019s a lot of work for you and then we just have to redo our models, but the intellectual task is actually simplified here. ","On a sort of unrelated topic, you opened the discussion already, but mortgage, the biggest issue facing successful former student loan borrowers now successful professionals is getting a mortgage because their DTI numbers tend to still look horrible, their FICOs are fantastic. I have one so I know. I have one who is going through all this, so I know all this. But the ability to get a mortgage is going to be challenging for this demographic. ","When you look at doing mortgages it\u2019s just something that they happened to be doing because so far it happened to be doing it or is this an area where you\u2019re going to invest capital and maybe even work on some product innovations and the like with other \u2013 in the buy\/sell business you\u2019d be working with the buyer of course. ","Jack Remondi","Well a couple of points on this. I think there are broad comments made about student debt and the impact of things. We have a distinct advantage and that we have 12.5 customers and so we actually see details versus broad statistics. When we go through and survey our customers and look at actual borrower activities, borrowers with student debt actually have mortgages at similar rates than they\u2019ve had in prior cycles. ","The biggest challenge and this is a policy issue that we have advocated for a change here. But the biggest challenge for customers is that when they were coming in to repayment during the great recession and experience an inability to get a job and now they have one is they have delinquencies on their credit bureau report and the stringent mortgage underwriting criteria see that delinquency and denies the borrower a conforming mortgage. And as you know, alternative mortgage products are relatively few and far between these days. That is the biggest challenge facing this demographic, not DTI and the product. ","It\u2019s that inability to qualify because of our prior delinquency event. In our Earnest side of the equation, this is very much a pilot opportunity for us and we\u2019re just exploring what the opportunity is and how attractive it could be. It is not capital intensive, we have no intentions of owning a service that is originated in services and soul servicing released and we would be expect it to be a modest related business that we think we might have potential to cross out to our customers on a wider scale down the road, but that is to be determined and to be proven concept. ","Chris Lown","Very much a technology solution.","Henry Coffey","Exactly, you\u2019re going to supply the intellectual and technology capital. Would you be exploring the delinquency side of the business which means going down cycle a little bit, even though not all cycles are created equal or would you be looking at a project or product for the high net worth side of the student loan equation? ","Jack Remondi","Our customers in this phase are very hi-fi. These customers are very hi-fi, go by a very high income. So if we\u2019re talking about cross-selling products, that\u2019s where we would be focused. ","Operator","And it\u2019s all the questions that we have for this time. Back to you Joe.

My name is Chrisa and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Navient Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Joe Fisher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference, sir.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Chrisa . Good morning and welcome to Navient's 2016 fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are, Jack Remondi, our CEO, and Somsak Chivavibul, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors in the company's Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","During this conference call, we\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP measures, we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the fourth quarter 2016 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted on the Investors page at navient.com.","Thank you. And now, I will turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks Joe. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and support. Before I address our financial results for the year and the quarter, I would like to provide some color on the announcements of the state Attorney Generals in the CFPB from last week. ","After three years of engagement and our full efforts to share our servicing practices, our high performance results, the robust programs that drive enhancements in customer tools, communications and education and our extensive list of recommendations to improve our outcomes, it was disappointing that regulators disregarded the facts in order to make a political statement. This political statement is based on a false narrative about the practices and outcomes Navient delivers for borrowers. ","Just because they say it doesn\u2019t make it true. It ignores the fact that we follow the service and rules and regulations issued by the Department of Education, the owner of the majority of loans we service, it attempts to create a new service at new servicing standards and apply them retroactively via lawsuits versus the rule making process that has been the foundation for establishing servicing rules and regulations in years passed and it ignores the fact that the CFPB has had over five years to develop and implement new servicing standards to their pool making authority yet has failed to do so.","In one accusation the claimant said, Navient feared borrowers in to forbearance versus income driven repayment plans. This accusation was made despite the fact that 49% of the balances we service for the federal government are enrolled in an income driven repayment program. It was made despite the fact that borrowers serviced by Navient used forbearance at a lower rate than others. ","It was made despite the fact that forbearance is often needed to cure a delinquency, as delinquent loans are not eligible for income driven repayment plans. It was made despite the fact that services are actually paid less for our accounts enrolled in forbearance and it calls that end in forbearance are actually longer than other calls.","It\u2019s inconceivable and disappointing that these very helpful services would be portrayed as harmful. The irrefutable facts are that Navient service borrowers are more likely to be enrolled in alternative payment plans including IDR. Navient borrowers are also less likely to be severely delinquent and ultimately are 31% less likely to default. This is the exact opposite of borrower firm. ","Navient welcomes and will continue to support clear and well-designed guidelines that all parties can follow. This is what we work in good faith with the regulators to achieve. We cannot and will not however admit to false accusations, allow penalties or payments for new rules applied retroactively. ","We have an obligation to defend ourselves and we have faith that our courts will seek and hear the facts and rule accordingly. I\u2019m also committed to keep this action from becoming a distraction to our business. Our team remains focused on executing our business plan and capturing the significant growth opportunities we see in 2017. I will cover these in a moment, after some color on our 2016 results. ","We started 2016 with our access to the debt capital markets in question. These issues were largely driven by the rating agency review for the timing of FFELP ABS cash flows. We sat out a very specific plan to close this issue with the rating agencies, and to complete a broad range of funding transactions well in excess of our needs. ","I\u2019m very happy to report we did both. The rating agencies published their revised ratings criteria and are nearly complete with their ratings reviews. The impacts have been better than market expectations and we\u2019ve worked with bond holders to amend terms to return the ratings to triple A on nearly $10 billion of bonds. ","During the year, we completed nearly 8 billion in term financings across our full stack of liability structures and we materially reduced near-term unsecured debt maturities. We are in an excellent liquidity position as we enter 2017, with only 700 million in unsecured debt maturities this year. ","Our credit performance in 2016 was exceptional, private credit charge-offs declined a $146 million or 22% over 2015 and loans greater than 90 days past due ended the year at $801 million, $45 million lower than a year ago. We also have more borrowers successfully making payments and amortizing their loan balances. ","A strong starting point, the improving jobs market and rising pay rates combine to create a very favorable outlook for credit in 2017. ","Net interest for 2016 was 1.6 billion and reflected the 8% and 12% amortization of our FFELP and private loan portfolios. Net interest income was also impacted by the higher cost of funds and the negative relationship between our asset and funding indices. ","To be conservative we assume the negative relationship will continue for most of 2017, as the amount and timing of rate increases remain uncertain. Somsak will provide more details on this in his remarks. ","We made excellent progress in growing our non-education fee revenues in 2016. Total non-education fee revenue for the year was 174 million, a 77% increase over 2015. We added a number of new contracts in 2016 including contracts with the IRS, [pooling] authorities, states and healthcare providers. ","Other highlights from the year include adjusted core earnings of $1.89, $0.02 better than the high-end of the guidance we provided a year ago. We acquired 17% or 60 million of our common shares, we converted 5.7 billion in FFELP loans on to our servicing platform. We assisted over 628,000 severely delinquent customers who are now current and finding a solution that help them avoid default. ","We acquired $3.7 billion in student loans and continued to improve our operating efficiency. Our team did a great job this year delivering these results, creating more than adequate liquidity and positioning the company for further success in 2017. And despite the politically driven noise, they continue to hold their heads in pride of the work they do each day. ","I\u2019m excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2017 and beyond. I see meaningful opportunities to add value across our business. For example, in our legacy businesses, we expect to see increased opportunities to purchase both federal and private loans, expand our guarantor services and add third party servicing. ","One aspect of our legacy business is the service we provide the federal loan guarantors. We\u2019re the largest player in this space today, with USA Funds being our largest client. At year end, Great Lakes Higher Education Assistance Corp. assumed control of USA Funds, and as part of this transfer they notified as a guarantant to rebid the work we provide here upon the exploration of our contract at year end. ","We\u2019re excited about this opportunity and look forward to demonstrating the value we deliver. Any new opportunities or changes here are likely to begin in 2018. ","In business services, we are excited to begin work for the IRS and see significant opportunity increase revenue from our other non-education clients. In fact, we expect revenues here to grow by more than 20% in 2017. We also believe we are uniquely qualified to deliver on the requirements of the Department of Education servicing RFP. ","Finally, we plan to increase our participation in the student loan and refinance market place. In 2016, we purchased 225 million of refinancing loans, mostly in the last four months of the year. We see the potential to play a more meaningful role in this market in 2017. ","Since our separation we have consistently work to increase the value of our business. In 2016, we did this through portfolio of acquisitions, growing fee income and repurchasing 60 million common shares at prices well below intrinsic value. ","Our focus for 2017 is to continue to create value by increasing the cash flow delivered to our legacy businesses, growing our business services revenue and generating new assets through the refinance market place. We will also continue to return capital to shareholders and will seek to maximize the shares we acquire at discounts to intrinsic value. ","While the actions brought by regulators is creating noise, we are determined to defend our practices and superior results and not let these items distract us from supporting customer success and capturing the value creating opportunities we see in front of us. ","Thank you for your interest and support and I look forward to delivering again on our promises. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Somsak to review the quarter and year in more detail. ","Somsak Chivavibul","Thanks Jack. Good morning everyone. During my prepared remarks, I will review both the quarterly and year-end results for 2016 that we recorded last night, as well as provide guidance for 2017. And I\u2019ll be referencing the earnings call presentation available on our company\u2019s website beginning with slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. ","In the fourth quarter, we reported an adjusted core EPS of $0.47 compared to $0.48 in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year of adjusted EPS, we recorded a $1.89 compared to a $1.82 for 2015. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $226 million versus $228 million from a year ago. ","During the fourth quarter, we transitioned $2.7 billion of Navient owned FFELP loans that were being serviced as a third party to Navient servicing platform. As a result of this transition, we incurred an additional $7 million of one-time operating expenses in the quarter. ","For the full year, total operating expenses before regulatory related and a legal contingency cost were $917 million. Excluding the expenses associated with the Gila and Xtend Healthcare acquisitions and the one-time servicing transition cost, we reduced our operating expenses by 7% which is better than the 6% reduction we guided to at the beginning of the year. ","In the fourth quarter, the company identified an error which understated previously reported FFELP loan net charge-off and the provision for losses in 2015 and earlier years. The impact of this error to all prior period was immaterial and the numbers throughout this presentation and the earnings release reflect this correct. ","Let\u2019s now turn to slide 5 discuss our FFELP segment results. In 2016, we acquired $3.5 billion of FFELP loans and while we are optimistic about the opportunity to purchase FFELP portfolios coming to market this year, our 2017 guidance will reflect acquisitions at similar levels that we saw in 2016. ","Our FFELP core earnings were $68 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with $71 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 came in at 89 basis points and reflects the revised application of prepayment grades disclosed in the third quarter of 2016 Form 10-Q.","As a result of this change, the FFELP loan premium balance increased by $7 million, which resulted in the same increase to our net interest income. The FFELP net interest margin in the quarter was primarily higher than anticipated due to this change. We also saw significant year-over-year improvement in the credit quality of our FFELP portfolio, but the late stage delinquency rate declined by 23%. ","Let\u2019s now turn to slide 6 in our Private Education Loan segment. Core earnings in this segment declined by $15 million from a year ago quarter to $41 million. In the quarter, our net interest margin was 308 basis points and reflects the impact from the prepayment adjustment mentioned earlier. ","The private education loan discount balance increased by $9 million, resulting in a corresponding decrease to net interest income and a 14 basis point decrease to the private education loan NIM in the fourth quarter. The decline in the NIM from the prior years and the third quarter is attributable to this adjustment as well as higher cost of funds from our LIBOR based debt and the timing of when our private based earning asset reset versus when our LIBOR based debt [refresh].","The outlook for private education loan losses continued to improve as a result of the overall improvement in our charge-off trends. Charge-offs declined a $146 million or 22% from the prior year. While the total delinquency rate increased slightly from the prior year, our delinquency rate declined by 19% for our non-TDR portfolio and by 3% for our TDR portfolio. In addition, we saw double digit declines in our forbearance rates. ","Our charge-offs on a dollar basis are expected to decline in the mid-teens in 2017, with provision falling at a slightly lower pace due to the additions of newly acquired private education loans. ","Let\u2019s turn to slide 7 to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $71 million in the quarter, compared with $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This decline is primarily driven by the increase in reserves for legal contingencies and one-time cost to transfer third party to our servicing system. ","Our non-education to fee revenues increased 77% from the prior to $174 million, and we\u2019re excited about the growth opportunities in this space in 2017 and beyond. ","During the year, we grew our total federal loan servicing book by $5 billion and recently submitted our bid for the Department of Education single servicing solution. While the contract was originally anticipated to be awarded in February, the contract is currently under bid protest by another bidder that could potentially delay the announcement of the award. Our guidance for 2017 does not include the impact from this potential contract. ","I\u2019d like to highlight the financing activity that took place over the course of 2016 on slide 8. In 2016, we completed a renewed financing transaction in every area of our liability structure including returning to the FFELP ABS market where we issued $5.8 billion of FFELP ABS through seven transactions, and FFELPS spreads improved 17% from our 2016-2 transaction to our most recent deals. ","We also issued term private ABS of $488 million. We renewed conduit facilities in our both FFELP and private - both our private education portfolios. We completed a second private credit residual financing transaction and finally we issued unsecured debt of $1.25 billion through two transactions. ","In 2016, we reduced our total unsecured debt outstanding by $1.4 billion and reduced through repurchased our near-term debt maturities in both 2017 and \u201918 to very reasonable and manageable levels. We\u2019ve reduced our 2017 debt maturities to $700 million and will continue to work towards reducing our 2018 and \u201919 debt maturities throughout the year. ","During the quarter, we repurchased 12.5 million shares for $180 million at an average price of $14.43. And for the full year, we reduced our outstanding shares by 17% through the repurchase of 16 million shares at an average price of $12.68. In total, we\u2019ve returned $956 million to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends in 2016. ","On December 8, 2016, we announced a new share repurchase program for up to $600 million from the company\u2019s outstanding common stock. All of this activity was undertaking while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.24. And we have managed this ratio within our target range of 1.2 to 1.3 over the past five years. ","Slide 9 provides a full year 2017 guidance, in addition to the growth opportunities that Jack highlighted for 2017 and beyond. In the third quarter and in recent company presentations, we had highlighted the widening of the three month LIBOR rate compared to the one-month LIBOR and prime rate and how we manage this basis risk. ","While we have already seen these spreads come down off its most recent highs, our guidance is based on a higher than historical one month or three month spread for the mid-20s for 2017, which is not where we are today. Our guidance also includes the impact of two interest rate hikes of 25 basis points in 2017. ","As a result of these factors, we expect full year FFELP net interest margin in high 70s and full year private education net interest margin in the mid-320s for 2017. Also included in our 2017 guidance are our operating expenses below $900 million excluding regulatory cost and business services revenue excluding inter-company loan servicing to range between $630 million and $660 million. ","And finally, while we see potential opportunities to grow EPS from our 2016 levels and are eager to pursue these opportunities, we expect 2017 core earnings per share to be between $1.80 and $1.84 excluding expenses associated with regulatory costs. ","Finally, turning to GAAP results on slide 10, we recorded fourth quarter GAAP net income of 145 million or $0.48 per share compared with net income of 283 million or $0.73 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions and expenses related to structuring of the organization. ","I will now open the call for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open sir. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","My first question on Somsak\u2019s point on the NIM in the guidance, and could you just talk about how you factor that in as the rates rise. Do you expect the spreads to gap out more or maybe if you can give us a little more color on that?","Somsak Chivavibul","All we\u2019re really doing at this point, because with where rates and one month, three month LIBORs are uncertain. We are just projecting just based on what the curve is telling us today. And if you just - our forward curve is just sliding out that the one-month, three-month LIBOR is going somewhere around the mid-20s for 2017 at this point. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","And to the extent that the rate rises don\u2019t happen, what would be the impact on the FFLEP\u2019s NIM?","Somsak Chivavibul","So if the rate rise doesn\u2019t happen, it will mean that we\u2019ll probably end up picking up a little bit more in unhedged floor income. But one of the things I\u2019ll note Sanjay embedded in this NIM guidance is the fact that as we went in to 2017 we have hedged more of our core position and this was something that we did at the beginning of 2016 anticipating that eventually rates will rise. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","And then Jack on the CFPB lawsuit, could you just talk about the next step for you guys in terms of defending of yourselves, and have you had any communication with members of the new administration in terms of the CFPB and their motives as you mentioned?","Jack Remondi","We didn\u2019t take this action lightly. You never want to be fighting with your regulator, but we really felt like we had no particular choice here just given the facts as they exist in our portfolio versus the accusations. Our focus in the near term here is going to be to continue to communicate and demonstrate how we deliver borrower success. ","This means helping borrowers manage their payments, as I mentioned a few times in terms of some of our statistics our customers are less likely to be delinquent, they are more likely to be enrolled in income driven repayment programs and they are substantially less likely to default. ","We believe that those measures are the complete opposite of our harm that actually create far borrower success and we do a better job at that then all the other servicers out there. This process will take some time and I think as it will move through the court systems, it moves at a slower pace than we probably all would like, but we are confident on the facts and the data that backup our position here. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","Final question just on this re-fi industry entry in the fourth quarter, can you just talk about the addressable market there and how much growth potential is there for you on the annualized basis in that market?","Jack Remondi","We believe that the market opportunity here exits through a combination of both borrower balances in the federal and the private loan sector, and as you know virtually every student loan is made today based on the prospective ability of the borrower to pay it. That is that they will complete their education, earn their degree and gain or get a job that produces the income necessary to support that. But there\u2019s risk with that, there\u2019s risk that those things don\u2019t happen. And so in the re-fi market place it\u2019s an opportunity to basically reward customers who have achieved those objectives by providing them with loans that have better terms than their existing student loan product. So we see an opportunity here to significantly increase our participation. But at this stage in the game we haven\u2019t - I\u2019d like to leave it at that. Just that we see a significant opportunity to increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with DA Davidson. Your line is open. ","Arren Cyganovich","In terms of the FFELP portfolio acquisition opportunities, I think in the past you said 7 billion to 10 billion. So wondering if that still stands is what you think is potential for a 2017 versus the 3.5 billion that you have in your forecast, and whether or not the legal action impacts those discussions at all?","Jack Remondi","So we do believe that legacy holders of FFELP loans will be more inclined to sell. I think actually some of the regulatory comments and questions might actually accelerate the desire to sell. We don\u2019t believe that they create any barriers for us to be the acquirer. ","Arren Cyganovich","And then in terms of the private education loan net interest margin, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about obviously a very sharp decrease year-over-year, you said 14 basis points of that was due to the revised pre-payment rates. Is that just a one-time issue and then that bounces back and what else is in there besides the one month few more spreads it seems like there\u2019s something else that\u2019s causing that decline a little bit more?","Jack Remondi","Overtime we\u2019ve continued to issue new unsecured debt and new ABS transactions that as they get added on come in at a bit of a higher cost than the legacy debt that replaces. So that overtime puts a little bit of pressure on the NIM. So that\u2019s going to be also a component that we also take in to account in to our private NIM guidance. ","Arren Cyganovich","And then just lastly the legal reserve that was established, is that to establish expected payments algo is that just expenses that you\u2019re going to anticipate having over the next 12 months. I\u2019m just curious as to what specifically that represents. ","Jack Remondi","It represents expense, it\u2019s unrelated to the CFPB, it\u2019s just normal kind of legal activity in the course of business here. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors. Your line is open. ","Lee Cooperman","I was wondering if you made a statement that the repurchased shares all have been repurchased well below intrinsic value. I\u2019m just curious if you could kind of articulate your view of intrinsic value and what you\u2019re buying back, as you buy back shares in the market, because the current authorization is about 13% of the market capital of the company, that\u2019s a significant investment and just curious to your view of intrinsic value. ","Jack Remondi","We see intrinsic value in the low to mid 20s per share. The 60 million shares that we acquired last year were purchased a little over $12 a share, so obviously a significant benefit or a significant discount to intrinsic value. And to the extent that we are able to execute at those types of levels obviously has an impact increase as the intrinsic value for the remaining shares outstanding. ","Lee Cooperman","It\u2019s probably the academic kind of gad fly question. But with the management and your team working so hard to deliver value to your customer and the regulators being so hostile and the intrinsic value so far above where the stock is trading, have you ever thought about just giving everybody back their money and just kind of out of business and let the government worry about this?","Jack Remondi","I do believe the actions taken are politically driven here and that they are not uniformly shared across members on the Hill or in Washington. We think we create value for our shareholders in these activities. Clearly our legacy cash flows are a big part of our intrinsic value and that is something that we believe we can add to and continue to maximize and as we have this year and we believe we\u2019ll continue to next year. ","I think if you look at where our other growth opportunities are in terms of the business services that we have, we are really leveraging the skills and capabilities that we\u2019ve developed in our loan servicing operations scale, data analytics, performance driven results that are valuable to other entities and we see this in terms of some of the new contract we sign like the IRS, some of the tooling authorities and the expansion we\u2019re seeing in healthcare. ","And then on the re-fi side of the equation, these are real opportunities for us and really are a function of our data. We believe we have a better ability to kind of look at borrowers and their credit profile and understand what their outlook looks like based on 40 years of experience and to be able to use that to capture value in the form of these refinancing loans that are taking place in the market place. ","So we think at the end of the day, we create more value for shareholders by running our business than we do by not. ","Lee Cooperman","Appreciate your efforts that you share with us and hopefully the new administration will appreciate your efforts as well. Good luck. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open. ","Mark DeVries","I had a follow-up question of the FFELP NIM. Your new guidance of the high 70s is so material step down from the mid-80s you realized in 2016 and I guess much of the year was impacted by that three month, one month dislocation. Are you saying that much of that incremental step-down is related to the additional hedging cost from what you did to protect floor income this quarter or there are other forces kind of pushing the NIM down further?","Somsak Chivavibul","Mark it\u2019s not related to the hedging cost at all. It\u2019s related to the fact that as rates rise you will record less unhedged floor income overtime. I know our total floor income that we recorded in 2016 was around 50 basis points and so in that guidance reflects the fact that as rates increase a piece of that floor income will decline depending on what rates are. But I\u2019ll note that while a vast majority of that floor income - it\u2019s at 50 today. We will capture a vast majority of that. A significant greater portion of our floor income next year will come in the form of hedged floor income. ","Jack Remondi","And I would just add to that is that, when we look at our business we are looking at what we expect to generate in terms of cash flows from our portfolio. And the amount of floor income that we were forecasting is based on the forward curve, right as I said earlier. And that number is still $2 billion in terms of estimate based on that forward curve at 12\/31\/16. And if you think about where it was a year ago, plus what we collected, this number has actually grown not shrunk. So it shows up differently in terms of the spread, but it doesn\u2019t show up, it\u2019s been growing in terms of value to the overall business. ","Mark DeVries","I was hoping to get more color Jack on your comments around the USA Funds acquisitions by Great Lakes. Does Great Lakes compete in that services business for guarantors, are they rebidding it with a view to potentially taking that away, if you were just kind of wondering what the opportunity of risk is around that?","Jack Remondi","They did not provide the services for other guarantors, they do manage their own book. And most of the work that they do in this space is outsourced. So this would be a continuation of that effort. That\u2019s where we believe it will go, but they obviously are the decider here.","Mark DeVries","And you indicated you are excited about the opportunities, is there an opportunity for you to pick up more of their business as part of this rebidding?","Jack Remondi","We don\u2019t provide services to them today. So as they rebid this, we would be hopeful that we would see an opportunity to bid on the entire book of business, not just the funds piece. ","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it. And any color on how meaningful that could be, if you are successful there?","Jack Remondi","Well the opportunity in this space is like the FFELP loan business, it\u2019s an amortizing business. But the biggest opportunities we provide is helping borrowers who have previously defaulted on their federal student loans recover from that and we rehabilitate their loans. And so our services that we provide here to USA Funds and other guarantors puts us as the top performing entity in this particular space and that\u2019s where we see the opportunity. ","If we can deliver better results, it increases the cash flows for us, it also increases the cash flows for the guarantors, and it obviously delivers a better result for the customers. So it\u2019s a win-win solution for folks. But there is not RFP outstanding, we\u2019d have to see what that looks like and respond when it\u2019s released. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hammond with Bank of America. Your line is open. ","Mark Hammond ","Since Gila and Xtend, company acquisitions on that front have been quite. Is there anything in particular driving this?","Jack Remondi","I\u2019m not sure what you mean by the question, quite in terms of other acquisitions? ","Mark Hammond ","Just what you announced recently, right. Was it more focusing on operations internally or just priced too high kind of thing?","Jack Remondi","So a couple of things I think in this (inaudible), you know our acquisition philosophy has really always been to kind of - if we\u2019re looking to get in to a new space is to buy something that has enough of a foundation and solid reputation that we can grow off of that organically and that\u2019s been our focus. So in years passed when we moved in to the asset recovery space, that\u2019s exactly what we did and then worked extremely hard to grow those organizations at very significant levels on an organic basis. ","We see those opportunities in both Gila and Xtend in both our state and municipal and tooling activities as well as our healthcare. We think the opportunities are very significant. We think they leverage our skills and probably more importantly our data analytics capabilities, all of which are designed to deliver higher returns, higher cash flows for our customers. And so the focus has been on organic growth there.","Mark Hammond ","And then timing on those single servicing solutions solicitation award, last I read was February. Is there any better sense from your end?","Jack Remondi","So February was their original date, they did delay the response, the delivery of the responses of submissions by about a month. They didn\u2019t change their new date. As Somsak mentioned, one of the three bidders did submit a bid protest not against us but against the really another one of the bidders in the process, and so that has to be resolved before any award can take place. ","In the mix of a transition administrative change we fully expect that there\u2019d be some delays here. And until the Secretary of Education is in place and starts to applying on some of the stuff it would just be guessing. ","Mark Hammond ","And then my last one is more of a balance sheet question. Would you talk a bit about the restricted cash balance line items? I had modeled it just falling with the portfolio going lower by about 300 million but it really didn\u2019t change quarter-over-quarter. What\u2019s driving this or how can I think about their strategic cash balance going forward?","Jack Remondi","I think that can vary from quarter-over-quarter based on seasonality or timing of when interest payments are made, and when distributions are made overtime. So we got a trust that paid at various different months within the course of the year. So year-over-year you should see that restricted cash balance wind up with loan portfolio. But from quarter-over-quarter it can have some seasonal impact come through because of timing of interest payments. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Moshe Orenbuch","Jack, one of the things that\u2019s been kind of absent from this whole discussion about the CFPB is actually the Department of Ed. Is there any chance that they are going to weigh in on their servicing rules? I mean I assume that they\u2019ve kind of looked at your performance overtime. ","Jack Remondi","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s probably any student loan service out there that has been audited or reviewed more than we have over the last three years in terms of performance and compliance aspects. You\u2019re pointing to something that has been a bit of a frustration for us is that in the student loan space there are multiple entities who are all vying for oversight and responsibility on servicing. You see at the Department of Ed, who is responsible for, you have the CFPB who is supposed to be monitoring some of the stuff and proposing improvements, enhancements in that area. And then you got a whole variety of state entities engaged I think all because of the political headlines around students Ed. ","The reality is, part of our biggest challenge and then why there are so many people involved is the public narrative is very different from the reality what goes on. The struggling borrower for the most part is someone who has borrowed and has not completed their education. So the statistics here is that two-thirds of all federal loan borrowers who default each year, owe less than $10,000, yet the average media story shows the borrowers owe more than $80,000. ","Large balance borrowers are generally students who went to graduate schools and they are amongst the best performing loans in any federal loan portfolio. So that is part of the issue, and we certainly have advocated from day one as we\u2019ve been working with the regulators that a successful and appropriate approach would be to have all parties in the room, the Department of Ed, the CFPB and servicers. So that we can work together and say look, this practice doesn\u2019t work and how can we make it better, and a lot of it has to do with federal rules. ","So I would point to IDRs as just one great example, the application for an income driven repayment plan is 12 pages long. It does not reside on our website because it\u2019s not allowed to. A borrower has to go to studentloans.gov, the Department of Ed website where they complete the form and then it gets returned to us by the Department of Ed and often times that form is not completed accurately or the borrower indicates they want to sign up for a plan that they are not eligible for and we have to move them to a different direct. ","It\u2019s that kind of complexity in both program design and process that we think could have material benefits in terms of making a process easier for borrowers and therefore improving borrower success. ","Moshe Orenbuch","I got two other smaller questions. Any kind of sense as to the financial terms of entering the refinance private loan market, like are you buying these loans par or premium. Any sense you can give us to that?","Jack Remondi","So any loans that\u2019s made is - new loans that are made are typically acquired at the equivalent of a premium, whether that\u2019s the cost that we incurred will originate or the reimbursement of those cost bagged out. But when we look at buying portfolios or originating portfolios it takes in to consideration those items and the capital we would allocate to that business and whether or not we can earn an attractive return on equity through that investment. ","As I said, one of the thing that we have that\u2019s unique to Navient compared to all other players in this space is we have 40 years of data. So a borrower with a particular credit profile, there may be other that we can or not may be, there are other attributes that we would look at on that borrower that would help indicate whether that borrower is going to over-perform or out-perform or under-perform what that credit profile might look like and that\u2019s where we add value. ","Same on the servicing side of the equation, our servicing processes are all data driven and so we typically see and can identify problems or issues ahead of time and will reach out to that customer for a contact, and the result is that we have higher rates of right party contact on start loaning borrowers, that\u2019s why our delinquency and default rates are lower than everybody else\u2019s and would bring that to bear in the process as well.","And then finally our private loan portfolio and we expect this to be less of an issue in the re-fi space. Within our existing portfolio there are borrowers who are struggling and the solutions that we offer to those borrowers we think are not only highly effective in terms of keeping them out of default but also very beneficial for the borrowers. ","Our programs are designed to allow borrowers to make payments and amortize their balances. So we\u2019re not putting into programs where they are negatively amortizing like many in the income driven repayment plans still or just kicking the can down the road. We are working with them to create a payment amount that is affordable and as I said, and reduces their principal balance each year. ","Moshe Orenbuch","Just one quick follow-up on the private side, I noticed that the TDR balance continues to creep up modestly as the entire portfolio is kind of running down and so if that trend were to continue to the TDR balance could be half of the total portfolio with an 11% reserve against it. Can you talk about how that will impact provisioning at some point in the future and when we might see that change, because you\u2019ve got life of loan reserves against those.","Jack Remondi","So once a borrower is designated TDR, they are never undesignated TDR. So for a borrower who is non-TDR today has some difficulties that requires a temporarily delay in payment where the modifications to the terms it automatically moves in to the TDR status and stays there. ","You\u2019re seeing delinquencies and charge-offs in that segment decline year-over-year, and the balances are amortizing, its\u2019 just that there\u2019s a transition going from non-TDR to TDR. As you know in TDR loans we reserve for the life of the loan in that portfolio, and so the periodic provision is less of a function of adding an incremental year of our incremental quarter of periodic expected charge-offs as you see in the non-TDR space and more of a function of how has the life of loan loss expectations changed from the prior period. ","So most of our provisioning today is a function of adding the additional, the next quarter in the two year window for non-TDR loans and adding the life of loan provision for borrower to moving into TDR status versus adding reserves for the previous TDR portfolio, if that makes sense. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Tarkan with Compass Point Research. Your line is open. ","Michael Tarkan","Just a quick follow-up on USA Funds, can you just give a sense for how meaningful that was in 2016 for you guys? Any color there. ","Somsak Chivavibul","Mike revenue from the contract low under $170 million for 2016.","Michael Tarkan","And then as a follow-up on the re-fi loans, so I\u2019m assuming the spreads are a little tighter but credit probably a little bit better. I\u2019m just wondering sort of vis-\u00e0-vis you current book how to think about the returns there versus sort of you existing private portfolio?","Jack Remondi","You\u2019re right on both of those points. The spreads are - well they are certainly consistent with a higher quality loans that we made as an originator for in-school volume years ago. They tend to be shorter, average life loans because you are [listening] a lot of times they are because you\u2019ve eliminated the in-school period and they tend to amortize a little bit faster. So fund spread, growth spread is or the coupon is tighter, funding cost should be lower because of the shorter average life servicing cost are more about processing and less about outreach kinds of activities. So net-net when you add those together and you look at the appropriate levels of capital, we think we can earn a return on our capital here, very consistent with what would be our need in our private loan portfolio over the last couple of years.","Michael Tarkan","And then just a clarification, are you servicing those re-fi loans as well? ","Jack Remondi","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open. ","John Hecht","Somsak can you remind what\u2019s the seasonality between the 4Q and 1Q spreads? I believe there are inflexions there?","Somsak Chivavibul","The seasonality really exist in the FFELP loan space where the day count on what we receive in the gross flow income on our entire portfolio versus the day count that\u2019s calculated for a floor rebate that we have to payout to the federal government, the formulas are different. So you will see a little bit of it, all else being equal, you would see a little bit of a dip in the first quarter FFELP NIM from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. But as I see it based on where rates are today, I think at this point we are sticking to the mid to high 70s NIM over the course of 2016. Pretty consistent when you are over the course of all the quarters in \u201917 at this point. ","John Hecht","And then with respect to the - you seem like you\u2019re indicating a consistent year of acquisitions in the FFELP [play] like last year. Is there a seasonality with respect focusing opportunity or is it just shares kind of pace that over the year?","Somsak Chivavibul","For purposes of guidance I think it\u2019s fair to pace it over the course of the year. ","John Hecht","And then last question more just schematic, we\u2019ve seen both portfolio credit trends looking positive in terms of their trajectories, and I know that the servicing costs are - our working loan is much different than something where you have to have a little bit more hands on. At the current pace of credit trends is there a chance or intermediate or long period of time that you can really reduce overall servicing costs or I guess the servicing margins are relative to total margins, or how should we think about the opportunities here over the long term?","Jack Remondi","So no question a current borrower making payments has a lower cost structure to the company, because we\u2019re servicing for third party like the Department of Ed at a higher revenue stream as well. You have seen delinquency rates improve across our book of business. I think we track this data pretty closely, borrowers coming into repayment during the recession which peaked for our new graduates in 2010, and we saw early 90 day plus delinquency rates early in the life of repayment cycle six months in north of 20%. Those numbers have come down to about seven, so they are about one-third of where they were in the peak of the economic recession, and there\u2019s not a surprise when joblessness is increasing new graduates have a harder time finding jobs. As the economy has improved and the job markets has improved, those numbers have improved as well. ","We do expect that to reduce our cost, its cone of the things - but we always look for ways to improve efficiencies across all aspects of loan servicing. We do that through automation, through better services for customers. We just launched a new IVR for example, voice response system for our customers that allows them to speak in a natural language versus pushing buttons for, if you want this, push one, that has dramatically - we think that will result in higher borrower satisfaction but also higher ease of borrowers to find the solution that they\u2019re looking for and also self-serve the things that are relatively easier for them to do.

My name is Taihana and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Navient's 2017 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background nose. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Joe Fisher. You may begin your conference.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Taihana. Good morning. And welcome to Navient's second quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO, and Chris Lown, our CFO.","After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions. Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations, and forward-looking statements.","Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the company's Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the second quarter 2017 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted on the Investors page at Navient.com.","Thank you. And now, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in Navient.","This morning, my opening comments will cover my perspective on this quarter's results and our outlook for future growth. Our adjusted core earnings of $0.44 was better than we had forecasted. The results reflect solid performance across the board as our net interest margin, credit performance, fee revenue and operating costs combined to contribute to this quarter's strong results.","Net interest income from our student loan portfolios was down as a result of the amortization of the seasoned portfolio and the spread relationship primarily between our prime-indexed private loans and our LIBOR-indexed cost of funds, partially offset by the addition of the acquired loan portfolios.","While Chris will provide more details here, as a reminder, our prime-indexed assets lag the rise in short-term rates by as much as a quarter. As a result, in periods where rates are rising, our private student loan net interest margin is lower, but it increases the following quarter.","The credit performance of our federal and private student loan portfolios was strong and continues to improve. The portfolio trends are benefiting from strong increases in employment for millennials, rising pay and our continued efforts to deploy data-driven strategies that increase customer contact.","We see these positive trends in both new to repayment customers as well as customers who have been in repayment for some time.","For example, at June 30, our 90-day-plus delinquency rates were 6% and 2.8% for our FFELP and private portfolios respectively. Both are at or below 10-year historical lows and point to further improvements in future charge-offs.","These positive trends are often surprising to folks as a self-reinforcing availability cascade has created the impression of excessive debt balances and pervasive struggles. When I speak with reporters or policymakers, they're often surprised that the actual statistics vary so significantly from the common narrative.","For example, of those who borrow for college, 84% borrowed less than $40,000, not the $80,000-plus one typically reads about. And two-thirds of all defaults are from borrowers who borrowed less than $10,000. This statistic on defaults is particularly jarring as it is not the result of excessive debt, but it's the consequence of not graduating.","The view that we have an excessive debt issue leads to a focus on alternative payment programs instead of the real driver of student loan defaults \u2013 students who borrow, but do not complete college. In fact, 40% of students who enroll do not complete within six years. Accurately diagnosing the problem is essential to developing appropriate solutions.","One real and addressable challenge for some borrowers is the impact a prior delinquency has on their ability to rent an apartment, buy a car, purchase a home or even secure employment.","As borrowers transition from school to repayment, some encounter payment struggles, life events or have difficulty establishing a rhythm of making monthly payments on time. ","Servicers are required by law to report delinquency to credit bureaus. And these delinquency events remain on the credit bureau for several years even after a strong pattern of on-time payment.","We continue to advocate for changes that would allow servicers to grant limited and justified relief when borrowers have reestablished a positive payment record. In fact, the number one request I receive from borrowers is for a courtesy credit bureau retraction. The ability to grant this request would be beneficial to both borrowers and the economy. ","We also saw strong performance in our Business Services segment in the second quarter. For the quarter, we earned $185 million in fee-related revenue, a 5% increase year-over-year, with non-education loan related revenue growing 16%. We see significant opportunities to grow in this area, which I'll discuss in a moment. ","Finally, even with new investments and growth in business process services, we held operating expenses flat at $227 million for the quarter. While this is in line with our plans, we are increasing our focus on improving our operating efficiency.","As we started 2017, we identified opportunities to create value in all three of our areas of focus \u2013 legacy student loans, business services and asset generation. We're executing on these opportunities and see our pipeline continuing to grow.","In our legacy student loan business, we're focused on maximizing the cash flow from our existing portfolios and adding to these cash flows with high-value portfolio acquisitions. We are executing on this strategy. And last month, we had closed the previously announced acquisition of $6.5 billion in federal and private student loans.","Year-to-date, we have acquired $8 billion in student loan assets and we continue to see opportunities to purchase additional portfolios this year.","In Business Services, we provide loan servicing, business processing and revenue management services to clients in federal, state and municipal markets, and in the healthcare provider markets. Here, we added a number of new clients in 2017, including new contracts with the IRS, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and others. Our goal this year is to organically grow our non-education fee revenue by 20%, a target we fully expect to achieve.","One of the largest opportunities is the re-compete of the federal student loan servicing contract. The process has seen some delays, but final bids were submitted earlier this month. We believe our proposal meets or exceeds the deliverables set out in the RP.","Our strengths include our proven track record of high quality customer-centric account conversions, systems integrity, positive customer experience and, of course, exceptional default prevention skills.","Further, we would bring our superior track record of innovation and leveraging data analytics to drive customer success. For example, we recently piloted new technology that substantially eases the process and increases the completion rate for borrowers enrolling and re-enrolling in federal income-driven repayment plans.","This is an example of the innovation and improved outcomes that they gave [ph] to help us achieve and what we would bring to the proposal. We're excited about this opportunity and the merits of the proposal.","Earlier this year, we discussed our plans to play a larger role in the student loan refi market. Year-to-date, we have acquired over $210 million in refi loans and we will ramp up our acquisitions over the balance of the year.","We believe our deep insights into borrower performance is a source of distinct comparative advantage. In addition, our operating scale, customer solution set and access to funding and capital and a strong compliance control environment will allow us to capture a significant share of the market opportunity in this area.","The combined opportunities in acquiring legacy student loans, loan servicing, business processing and asset generation are both meaningful and executable. Our performance to date demonstrates our ability to create value in each of these areas. We're excited about the opportunities to create additional value going forward.","The results this quarter reflect the strength of our business model and the ability to capture and create value through growth. With the $6.5 billion portfolio acquisition now complete, we've updated our earnings guidance for 2017 to $1.75 to $1.80 in adjusted core earnings per share.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris for a deeper discussion of this quarter's results and guidance. And I look forward to your questions later in the call. Chris?","Christian Lown","Thank you, Jack. And thank you to everyone on today's call for your interest in Navient. Throughout this call, I will be referencing the earnings call presentation, which can be found on the company's website in the Investors section.","Starting on slide three, we reported adjusted core EPS of $0.44 in the second quarter compared to $0.48 from the prior year. The decline from a year ago was mainly due to the reduction in net interest income, primarily resulting from the amortization of the total education loan portfolio.","As we highlighted last quarter, we continue to experience higher-than-forecast amortization in both our FFELP and private credit portfolios, which is currently running around 15% excluding loan acquisitions, capitalized interest and premium and discount amortization. We expect this trend to continue into 2018.","This was partially offset by the continued growth in our fee businesses and a lower average share count. During the second quarter, we purchased $7.1 billion of education loans. As a result of these acquisitions, during my prepared remarks, I\u2019ll provide updated guidance on the impact to both our FFELP and private education loan portfolios, as well as updated 2017 EPS guidance.","Let's now move into our segment reporting, beginning with FFELP on slide four. FFELP core earnings were $57 million for the second quarter of 2017 compared with $68 million in the second quarter of 2016.","The net interest margin for the second quarter of 2017 was 80 basis points compared to 85 basis points a year ago. We have previously discussed how the dislocation between one month and three-month LIBOR rates was negatively impacting our FFELP portfolio's net interest margin.","This quarter, however, we benefitted from the tightening of the spread and we continue to programmatically enter into swaps to hedge the portfolio to mitigate this risk going forward. Additionally, we have been actively hedging our eligible floor income, which is now 85% hedged through 2020 versus 68% a year ago.","In the second quarter, we acquired $4 billion of FFELP loans. As a result of these acquisitions, we anticipate FFELP NIM for the third and fourth quarters to be in the mid to high 70s.","FFELP credit quality improved meaningfully year-over-year as late stage delinquencies and forbearance rates both declined 17%.","Let's now turn to slide five and our Private Education Loan segment. Core earnings in the segment declined by $18 million for the year-ago quarter to $39 million. In the second quarter, the net interest margin was 328 basis points. The higher-than-anticipated net interest margin was primarily due to the one-month contribution from the recent portfolio acquisition.","We anticipate that the third and fourth quarter NIM will also benefit from incorporating a full quarter of interest income from this portfolio. We expect the NIM in the third quarter to be in the high 3.40s. With expectations of continued pressure on rates, we expect fourth-quarter NIM to be slightly lower in the low 3.40s. ","With 62% of our private loan assets indexed to prime, we continue to face headwinds from the rising rate environment as our assets reset after our liabilities, which are primarily indexed to LIBOR. Private education loan losses and delinquencies, excluding the recent acquisition, continued to decline as the portfolio amortizes.","Charge-offs declined 4% from the prior year to $122 million and credit trends remain stable, as the total delinquency and forbearance rates slightly improved from the prior year. However, we did see a slight uptick in the charge-off rate year-over-year.","The private educational loans we've purchased at a discount last quarter require that we report provisions for losses as charge-offs occur. As we migrate the portfolio from its former 120-day charge-off policy to our 212-day charge-off policy, the complete impact of charge-offs will not be fully reflected in our P&L until 2018.","As a result of this transaction closing in June, we expect charge-offs and provision related to this portfolio to be approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter.","We will now turn to slide six to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter compared with $81 million in the second quarter 2016.","Non-education fee revenues in the second quarter grew 16% to $53 million. In the quarter, we began work on new federal, state and local contracts that contributed to this increase and our collections inventory rose due to work on estate tax amnesty program that began in the second quarter and will end in the third quarter.","Let's turn to slide seven, which highlights our financing activity in the quarter. In the second quarter, we issued $500 million of unsecured debt maturing in 2025. This marks our longest-dated issuance since 2014 and was met with strong investor demand.","We used a significant portion of these proceeds to reduce our 2018 maturities to below $1.5 billion. And in the past year have reduced our 2018 maturities by $1 billion or by over 40% from the prior year.","In the quarter, we also issued a $1 billion FFELP ABS transaction, which was financed at an all-in cost of funds that represented a 10% improvement over our first transaction at the beginning of the year. We continue to see improvement as demonstrated by the additional $1 billion FFELP ABS transaction that priced yesterday.","In addition, we close on a $2 billion private education asset-backed commercial paper facility maturing June 2020. We also increased the maximum financing amount in a FFELP ABCP facility from $6.75 to $7.75 billion and extended its maturity date to April 2019.","During the quarter, we also purchased 10.9 million shares for $165 million at an average price of $15.10. In total, we returned $210 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Importantly, this activity was successfully executed, while maintaining a strong capital position in a tangible net asset ratio of 1.22 times.","Before I turn to GAAP results, I\u2019d like to review our 2017 guidance on slide eight. We expect core earnings per share between $1.75 and $1.80 excluding expenses associated with regulatory costs.","For our FFELP portfolio, we expect NIM to be in the mid to high 70s for the third and fourth quarter. In our private education \u2013 in our private credit portfolio, we expect NIM to be in the high 3.40s for the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to be in the low 3.40s along with a $30 million increase to private education loan charge-offs and provision as a result of the $3 billion portfolio acquisition.","Finally, let's turn to GAAP results on slide nine. We reported second-quarter GAAP net income of $112 million or $0.39 per share compared with net income of $125 million or $0.38 per share in the second quarter of 2016. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions.","I will now open the call for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yes, thanks. Would you expect to term finance more of the private student loans you acquired this quarter that looks like \u2013 at least some of which was funded in an ABCP facility. If so, kind of what would the impact on cost of funds be? And is that kind of contemplated in your NIM guidance?","Christian Lown","Yes. Our expectation is to continue to securitize the ABCP facility on the private side. And our expectation is that \u2013 it is in our NIM guidance for 2017 and going forward.","Mark DeVries","Okay, great. And then, Jack, just an update on expected timing for decisions around the deal servicing contract?","Jack Remondi","So, the Department of Ed has indicated that they would make a decision in October, but that's a \u2013 there's no requirement to do so. It's just their indicated time.","Mark DeVries","Okay, great. And then just finally, Jack, I think you indicated you expect the refi opportunity to ramp more in the second half here. How big do you think that could be on an annualized basis?","Jack Remondi","Well, we think the market opportunity is pretty sizable. The real question is what makes economic sense for us. We believe that our data \u2013 the access to the deep history we have in terms of student loan performance really gives us some unique abilities to attract different types of customers and offer products that will create a better return than some of the super prime kind of borrowers that you\u2019ve seen access this marketplace to date.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Is it reasonable to think that could be like $1 billion a year in loan originations? ","Jack Remondi","We'll have to see in terms of when we actually get to kind of the full marketing stream that we plan to launch later this year.","Mark DeVries","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of J.P. Morgan.","Richard Shane","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. I just want to talk about the NCO guidance for the fourth quarter on the acquired portfolio. Implicitly, that\u2019s roughly about a 4% loss rate in the first quarter. I'm curious how we should think about that trajectory into 2018. That seems like a pretty high number. And I'm wondering if there's a surge that then abates or if we should assume that on that $3 billion portfolio we should continue to assume that high loss rate.","Christian Lown","By the fourth quarter, we should be feeling most of the full impact of the portfolio. It will slightly elevate going into the first quarter, but then it will start to tail off. So, from the perspective of modeling or thinking about it going into 2018, we're pretty close to run rate in the fourth quarter.","Jack Remondi","And one thing that we think we can bring to that over time, of course, is that these loans are serviced by third parties today. And what we have demonstrated over \u2013 consistently over time is that our strategies and approach to customer contact and account resolution help more borrowers to successfully manage their loan payments and we expect to push that number down over time.","Richard Shane","Okay. So, I think I\u2019m then getting confused a little bit on the risk-adjusted margin on this. You talk about a \u2013 obviously, you didn't give the NIM breakout for that specific portfolio, but we're talking NIMs in general in the 3.40 range. Walk me through the economics here.","Christian Lown","Well, inevitably, obviously, we bought the company at a discount and obviously an attractive discount from a return perspective. And that will amortize through. It doesn't represent a huge portion of the portfolio. So, if you remember, last quarter, we had a NIM of 3.16. We continue to see pressure on the portfolio in a rising rate environment, which, obviously, contradicts \u2013 or interacts against the natural flows of the portfolio. So, I'm trying to understand where your question is going, but inevitably there is an uptick that we'll see that'll be a little bit assuaged by the rising rate environment. But, again, it's still a nice boost from where we were in the first quarter.","Richard Shane","So, what would the long-term NIM on that be with the level of yield accretion and potentially higher rates?","Jack Remondi","So, I think the gap here is probably that the purchase price that we acquired the portfolio for effectively is covering the expected loss rates on the portfolio. And so, the net interest margin is less impacted by that because of that discount.","Richard Shane","Okay. I think I\u2019ll pick this up with you guys offline. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Tarkan of Compass Point.","Michael Tarkan","Thanks for taking my question. On the FFELP NIM guidance, I guess I\u2019m curious as to why we're going to be in the sort of mid-to-high 70 basis point range when one month, three-month LIBOR has collapsed to the 8 basis point range today. I guess, what is underlying the assumption on the one-month, three-month LIBOR spread in the back half of the year?","Jack Remondi","So, inevitably, with the last dislocation we saw, we decided to take a proactive view around starting to hedge the portfolio more actively and put in place a more programmatic hedging program to really assuage that risk going forward or mitigate that risk going forward inevitably. So, what you have is, you have those hedges from the elevation of the one-three spreads over the last couple of quarters still in the portfolio. And, obviously, we're now hedging at a very attractive one, three spreads.","So, what we've looked to do is mitigate that volatility risk, so we don't have that dislocation that you saw last year. But inevitably, we don't see the immediate full impact as that spread contracts.","So, what we hope is when we have that portfolio more fully hedged, we'll be able to provide more certainty or guidance around what the NIM looks like or the impact from the one, three spread. But it is \u2013 is that hedged portfolio [indiscernible] amortization coming through with that results in where we are today.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. So, I guess, in the back half of this year, is that spread depressed for any reason or is that a decent run rate to think about as we think about 2018?","Jack Remondi","I will provide 2018 guidance at the end of the \u2013 in the early part of next year, but the guidance is good for 2017.","Michael Tarkan","Okay, thanks. And last quarter, I think you mentioned that the J.P. Morgan portfolio was going to add around $0.09 in EPS this year. so, if I back that off of the full year guidance, there's a fairly significant delta between your standalone business versus your original guidance. And I\u2019m just kind of curious if you can connect the dot there. Is it just NIMs being weaker given the rising rate environment to the higher operating expenses, just any kind of color there? Thank you.","Jack Remondi","Yeah. I think the two big things that result in that difference are, one, the portfolio is amortizing a little faster than we had thought at the beginning of the year, and I had mentioned that 15% annualized number earlier in my discussion.","And in addition, the rising rate environment caused a little more dislocation. Oddly enough, the dates of when Fed meetings and when they reset rates can have an \u2013 impact us on the short term. And for us, it's actually been off by a day on the last couple of raises. So, it really has just been the upward pressure and the amortization of the portfolio, which have had the biggest impacts on the difference.","Michael Tarkan","Okay. And then last question for me, any update on the USA Funds NELA collections business. I know [indiscernible]. Just wondering where we stand on that one.","Jack Remondi","We don't comment on ongoing contract negotiation type stuff.","Michael Tarkan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just following on to some of the questions that were asked earlier, when we think about the actual impact of the rate movements and the hedges that you mentioned, Chris, like how much do you get back as we go into the run rate next year, assuming things are more level set.","Christian Lown","So, it's two different discussions, right? The one, three is different than the private portfolio. So, putting the one, three to the side, obviously, as LIBOR rises and we wait for the rate increase, we see a decrease in the NIM. And then depending on the resets when rates increase, we gain some of that back.","The best case we can hope for is a stable or declining interest rate environment. We're clearly not in that environment today. I think your question is getting to is where are run rate NIMs in a stable environment. I think if you go back to a year-ago period, we actually have a chart that we put out that shows a little bit of the dislocation over time. And you can get a general sense of what you get back in that rate increase and where stability is. So, it really is a moving target. But you really need stability in rates and a view that rates aren't going up, are going to decline until we really maximize NIM in the portfolio.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And I want to clarify the comment you made about the hedges in the one-month\/three-month LIBOR spreads. Basically, these hedges are costing you money this year. And therefore, you're not going to get the full benefit of the compression we've seen thus far. I'm just trying to understand that because it's a pretty significant compression we've seen that should benefit you.","Christian Lown","So, the way we think about it, this is basis risk. And this is basis risk that we can remove from the volatility of the cash flows of the portfolio. And so, as you say, this may be costing us right now because hedges are rolling through that were maybe put in place when we saw an elevation in one, three spread.","We also clearly didn't enjoy the massive expansion in that spread which really dislocated last year. And so, what we want to be able to do is put in place a constant hedge position in that portfolio to give you much more certainty, so you aren\u2019t ever surprised when that spread widens. Or when it contracts, it doesn't have as much as impact either. The cost isn't really as much as you think from a portfolio perspective or from a NIM perspective or from a collateral perspective. So, it is a little bit of a change in how we manage the portfolio, but we do think it will create more certainty and less volatility for our investors and for our cash flows going forward.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And I guess one clarification, sorry. Does that then benefit you next year?","Christian Lown","Well, remember, what you're really doing is you're locking in rates. And so, you're just locking in the hedge. It clearly benefits you around volatility around that one, three spread, but it's not as if we're manufacturing earnings. We are just creating certainty around the financing costs in the portfolio, which again we think is beneficial to our cash flows and forecasting our revenue streams.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, great. And one last question for Jack. I mean, Jack, you seem to indicate that J.P. Morgan might have been the start of other banks considering a sale of their own loan portfolios. Have you had any progression in terms of discussions with other banks? Thanks.","Jack Remondi","So, we do see further opportunities to buy portfolios this year. And we would expect \u2013 we expect to be well-positioned in that space. So, that's probably the most I could say at this point.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies.","John Hecht","Thanks very much, guys. Actually, most of my questions have been asked. A couple of, I guess, idiosyncratic ones. I can't remember it was Chris or Jack. One of you mentioned the state tax amnesty program ending in the third quarter. Can you give us a sense of how that's attributed to the second quarter?","Jack Remondi","Periodically, we get hired to run amnesty programs for states and municipalities. And we ran one. And they have, by definition, short time frames. And this took place primarily in the \u2013 revenue from this took place primarily in the second quarter. We'll see a bit of it in the third as well. But we don't break out individual contracts by revenue or margin in that way. But these are not \u2013 these are things that show up periodically on a somewhat regular basis, just different states run them at different times in their cycles.","John Hecht","Do you have anything in the pipeline that would replace this or it just comes up so fast that you can't hike those rates\u2026?","Jack Remondi","Well, we ran one last year. We will run one this year. So, they are legislatively driven. So, the visibility of them is really watching kind of what the legislative cycles are in different states and municipalities.","John Hecht","Okay. Second question, you said it was a little bit \u2013 the pressure on margins from the elevated amortization of prepays, I\u2019m wondering can you give us the specific impact on the margin from changes in the pre-pay rate from Q1 to Q2?","Christian Lown","We don't have that specific guidance. But what we can tell you is we continue to see that higher amortization of portfolio. We saw it in the first quarter. We're seeing in the second quarter. It's been rising over the last couple of years. And so, you can see detail in our Q around loan activity and we get a deeper sense of how it's all playing out.","Jack Remondi","So, two things drive this. It's not a margin issue. It's a net interest income issue for us. But as the portfolio seasons and people are deeper into their repayment cycle, a larger percentage of their monthly payment goes to principal. And so, it's a natural kind of occurrence as the portfolio ages and seasons. That is a big driver here. And we're also, of course, benefiting by the fact that delinquency trends and needs for alternative payment programs are at all-time lows here.","One of the things we track as an example is new to repayment borrowers and how they're doing in managing their payments. And so, the class of 2016 \u2013 so graduated a year ago \u2013 is kind of now fully seasoned as they entered repayment in kind of the December\/January time frame. And the spot delinquency rates on that portfolio are the lowest we've ever seen in the 15-type-years that we've been tracking this statistic. And these are for federal loans, so non-credit underwritten loans.","And when you have that kind of environment, you have faster payment speeds, but all in line with what we would expect to see based on a combination of factors there.","John Hecht","Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","I know that you're not giving guidance for the margin in 2018 and you talked a little bit about the impact of the reduced volatility from the three, one spread, but what about the hedging of the floor income? Assuming that rates kind of continue to rise in a moderate way, would that be a benefit in 2018? Could you just talk about that?","Christian Lown","I think a few things. One, clearly, we've taken the opportunity to hedge a lot of our floor income into 2020, which is important to create some certainty and visibility, but clearly also floor income is an amortizing asset as well to the portfolio.","And so, we will be updating guidance next year, but there will be two countervailing factors that will be the benefit of the fact that we've locked it in. But also, the thing to keep in mind is also that this is an amortizing asset.","Moshe Orenbuch","On the single servicer contract, could you maybe talk a little bit just about how the structure of that. Obviously, whoever it is that wins is going to have a lot of kind of business kind of thrown at them. Will it be done with kind of sub-servicing and maybe just, in broad strokes, kind of what that means for the structure of the bid and kind of the profitability of the contract?","Jack Remondi","Sure. So, the objectives, as we read the objectives of the RFP, is a desire to help reduce the cost to the taxpayers of the program by picking a single system platform for which servicing would take place. So, instead of paying for four platforms, the department effectively is paying for one.","Branding it under the Department of Ed so that consumers understand the ownership of the loans and where the program terms and conditions are set and come from.","And then what the winner would do would be to utilize a multi-subcontractor type structure to provide the call center, back-office kinds of functionality.","The things that, we believe, stand out in terms of our proposal is our long and very, very successful track record of converting substantial numbers of accounts on to our platform in a very customer friendly way. We have a very detailed process that we follow there that involves how we communicate with the customer, educate them about the changes that are coming and then complete that conversion process.","We run today in our call centers a distributed call center function today. So, this would be exactly what we do. And then, the big value add that we bring to the equation is we've got this very extensive kind of data analytics or data-driven strategies that we build over time that allow us to deliver substantially better performance. Our customers have consistently defaulted at 30-plus percent lower rates than all other servicers combined and that\u2019s not \u2013 that\u2019s all driven by the fact that we are using our data and our analytics to help us identify high-risk customers, communicate with them in effective ways, and educate them about their options, so that they can make better decisions.","The new program that I described in my opening remarks about helping customers successfully enroll and reenroll in income-driven repayment plans is a huge change. The process is so complicated today that a significant number of customers who are prequalified for income-driven repayment plans don't actually complete the forms, and this is a process that is designed to substantially increase those rates and has substantially increased those rates.","So, that's really where the \u2013 those combination of things is really where we deliver and would deliver high value in a future contract.","Moshe Orenbuch"," And, Jack, as you think about the criteria that they've set out, like how important to them is the platform cost, as you mentioned at the beginning, versus the other cost that would, obviously, be falling on the taxpayer that you would able to save them?","Jack Remondi","So, the contract, the RFP specifies the weighting of the different criteria. And, though, cost is one of them, it's about 20% weighting in the process. These other factors are the items that \u2013 in terms of customer experience, systems integrity capabilities of the platform are really the other components that they will weight. But we will have to wait and see how that process evolves over the next couple of months and what types of questions and comments we get from the reviewers.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Just one quick other question. That is, you talked a lot about the changes in faster amortization of the portfolio, does that moderate, does that continue? How do we think about that as we go into 2018 and future years?","Jack Remondi","So, when you're acquiring or originating loans, as we have over the extensive period of time in the past, the amortization curves look fairly constant because your portfolio composition was relatively steady. But the portfolio seasons and you get customers who are in the fifth year of repayment versus the second year of repayment, the amortization rate is just faster because of how the payment \u2013 how the monthly payments get allocated between principal and interest. So, it's consistent with what we \u2013 it's certainly consistent with our cash flow expectations. We have a little bit of higher prepayments that has occurred as the refi marketplace has ramped up over the last couple of years, but it's not different so much this quarter than it was a year ago on that front. It's really more the aging and seasoning of the portfolio. And the lower delinquency rates, right? I mean, those are big factors as well.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Mark Hammond of Bank of America. ","Mark Hammond","Good morning, Jack and Chris. And thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on any details you can provide on the private OC repurchase facility that you executed during the quarter? Like, motivation. Why now effective advance [ph] rate and perhaps how much capacity is left to do more if you wanted?","Christian Lown","So, we don't provide specific details on those transactions. But what we can tell you is that, obviously, we do it from a cost-effective basis. We see it as a very attractive form of financing for us to be able to tap into or utilize that underutilized asset on our balance sheet.","We do have roughly $1.7 billion of OC that is available today to be utilized as well, and again at fairly attractive financing terms. And that clearly will continue to grow over the next couple of years. So, it is an asset that we continue to look to finance going forward.","Mark Hammond","Okay. So, in the past, you were able to provide the trusts that you used to provide the OC. Would you do that going forward and now?","Christian Lown","We can certainly provide that you offline here. We added an additional trust, but essentially the same trusts that were in the previous facility are in the current facilities.","Mark Hammond","Okay, great. I'll follow up with some more details offline. Thanks, though.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Fisher for closing remarks.","Okay. Thank you, Taihana. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us today. If you have any other follow-up questions, feel free to give me a call. And this concludes today's call.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","At this time, I would turn the conference to Mr. Joe Fisher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Fisher, you may begin.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Felicia. Good morning. And welcome to Navient's 2019 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO, and Chris Lown, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the company's Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the first quarter 2019 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted on the Investors page at navient.com.","Thank you. And now, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Remondi","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Navient. ","Our results this quarter were exceptional. We saw strong contributions across the board, leading to core earnings per share of $0.74. Results for the quarter include gains from debt repurchases and the sale of refi loans of $0.10 and $0.5 respectively.","In addition, net interest income and fee revenue was strong, and combined with credit costs and operating expenses that were better than plan.","Through the first half, we are firmly on track to meet or exceed the financial metrics we established at the beginning of the year and we are raising full-year EPS guidance again this quarter by 16% to between $2.43 and $2.48 for the year. ","This quarter's results highlight the effectiveness of our efforts to meet our customers' and clients' needs, maximize earnings and cash flows, achieve operating efficiency gains and leverage our capital to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns.","Highlights from the quarter include stronger net interest income as we continue to execute efficient financing strategies. These strategies include leveraging the over-collateralization in our securitization trusts and capitalizing on unique opportunities to repurchase unsecured debt.","Credit trends improved significantly in both our FFELP and private loan portfolios, reducing the provision for future credit losses. Our data driven strategies are delivering delinquency rates in both portfolios that are at or near historical lows, pointing to continued improvement in future defaults.","We originated $846 million in refi loans this quarter, a 34% increase year-over-year, and our data and digital driven approach continues to generate high quality loans at attractive margins. In fact, the highest quarterly margins to date. And our technology platform and digital marketing delivers an industry best cost of acquisition.","One of the things we're proud of is our human-centered design that has produced innovative features such as allowing customers to pick their monthly payment. This feature, along with others, allow customers to significantly reduce the interest cost of their student debt and achieve their financial goals faster.","We completed our first pass-through financing this quarter, consisting of $412 million in refi loans, generating a gain of $16 million or 3.9% net of capitalized origination costs. This opens a new financing channel for the product and clearly highlights the value created by the refi origination business.","In our federal segment, we produced a $24 million increase in asset recovery revenue this quarter, capitalizing on a large account placement. Our performance for this client was 45% better than our competitor.","And we generated $2 billion of cash flow, including $1.3 billion from financing activities, allowing us to return $163 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases this quarter. ","In addition to our goal of growing top line revenue from new loan originations and business processing revenue, we're very focused on continued improvements in operating efficiency. The result, adjusted operating expense for the quarter decreased $4 million versus the year ago quarter to $229 million even as we saw significant growth in fee revenue, refi originations and the launch of our in-school loan product this quarter.","Our efforts this year have been focused on interest on increased automation, driven by data analytics. These efforts have also boosted customer success and satisfaction.","In addition, this quarter includes $10 million in insurance reimbursement for our regulatory related legal expense and we will be submitting future claims against those policies going forward.","Earlier this year, we launched our in-school loan product with a goal of achieving mid to high teens return on equity. Our product design and technology platform are designed to simplify the application process and help students and families make informed financing decisions, features that distinguish our product from other similar products in the marketplace. Early reviews of our product and technology have been positive.","The mailing of tuition bills which began mid-July and will continue into August is the main catalyst for application demand. We're optimistic on this product and we recognize the time required to establish our Earnest brand in the marketplace.","In January, we outlined our key objectives for the year \u2013 maximize the amount and accelerate the timing of cash flows from our loan portfolios, continue to improve operating efficiency, leverage our skills and infrastructure to create value and lending in business processing, and return any excess capital to investors.","As this quarter's results and actions indicate, we are successfully delivering on these objectives. I'd like to thank my teammates for a great quarter and I look forward to continuing success in the second half of the year.","Thank you for listening in today and I'll now turn the call over to Chris for a deeper review of the quarter. Chris?","Christian Lown","Thank you, Jack. And thank you to everyone on today's call for your interest in Navient. During my prepared remarks, I will review the second quarter results for 2019. I will be referencing the earnings call presentation which can be found on the company's website, in the Investors section.","Starting on slide three, adjusted core EPS was $0.74 in the second quarter versus $0.52 from the year-ago quarter. Key highlights from the quarter include a 34% year-over-year increase in refinance loan originations at the most attractive refi spreads to date. Continued improvement in credit quality, further optimization of our capital and financing structure, nearly a $1 billion reduction of unsecured debt and the return of $163 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of 9.6 million shares.","Let's move to segment reporting beginning with the federal education loans on slide four. Core earnings were $131 million for the second quarter. The net interest margin was 81 basis points, in line with our guidance. Both the delinquency and charge-off rates have significantly declined from a year ago, with the charge-off rate at 5 basis points, Navient's lowest level in the last 10 years.","Contingency collections inventory increased by nearly $11 billion from the prior year. This increase in volume resulted in a stronger-than-expected 71% year-over-year increase in asset recovery revenue.","Now, let's turn to slide five and our consumer lending segment. Core earnings in this segment increased 29% year-over-year, from $66 million to $85 million this quarter. During the quarter, we originated $846 million of education refinance loans at attractive spreads.","The total private education portfolio declined less than 4% year-over-year, while the net interest margin increased slightly to 322 basis points as a result of more efficient financing initiatives.","As a result of these initiatives and a favorable interest rate environment forecasted for the second half of the year, we are raising our private education loan net interest margin guidance to the low to mid 320s for the full year.","Credit quality in the segment continued its strong performance as the total delinquency rate declined 15% and the forbearance rate declined 24% year-over-year.","Let's continue to slide six to review our business processing segment. Total revenues in the quarter were $65 million and we continued to expand our healthcare RCM services by adding new full service revenue cycle clients. We achieved EBITDA margins of 17%, in line with our guidance and driven by disciplined cost management.","Let's turn to slide seven which highlights our financing activity. As a result of our stronger profitability and capital position, Navient increased its share repurchase activity by 18% in the second quarter from the first quarter to $126 million. We expect this accelerated share repurchase activity to continue into the third quarter and still expect to end the year at the high-end of our targeted TNA range of 1.23 to 1.25 times.","As we continue our dialogues with the rating agencies and approach the implementation of CECL in 2020, we expect to be in a position to provide an estimated range of the impact of this accounting change during the third quarter's earnings call.","In the quarter, we issued $1.9 billion of term ABS and executed Navient's first pass-through transaction consisting of $412 million of securities backed entirely of high-quality, fixed rate private education refinance loans. This transaction resulted in a gain of $16 million, demonstrated the value of these assets and generated a new financing structure for the company.","In the quarter, we also reduced our unsecured debt outstanding by nearly $1 billion. This included the repurchase of 108 $30 million [ph] of yen-denominated bonds, which resulted in a pretax gain of $32 million net of terminated hedges. This transaction was attractively priced, reduced the complexity of our balance sheet, improved our future profitability and retired all of our outstanding in bonds.","Moving to slide eight, we remain focused on the 2019 targets outlined at the beginning of the year. Through the first half of the year, we are on track to meet or exceed these targets.","As a result of the exceptional performance in the first half of the year, we are raising our core earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.43 to $2.48 excluding regulatory and restructuring expense. This guidance represents a 24% increase from our original 2019 guidance.","Finally, let's turn to GAAP results on slide nine. We recorded second-quarter GAAP net income of $153 million or $0.64 per share compared with net income of $83 million or $0.31 per share in the second quarter of 2018.","The differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions and the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets.","With that, I'll now open the call to questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.","Steven Kwok","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. It's actually Steven Kwok filling in for Sanjay. Just first on the guidance. You raised guidance by about $0.33 to $0.35 relative to the prior. And this quarter, there was about a $0.20 beat. Just was wondering if you can help us think about where the rest of the upside from. Is it all coming from the better consumer lending NIM now or are there other factors we should consider?","Christian Lown","I'll highlight a couple of things. Obviously, the rate environment has changed dramatically over the last year. And so, there are benefits that we'll realize going into the second half of the year. We are projecting two rate cuts to happen in 2019, of which we continue to be a beneficiary. So, net interest income, we believe, will continue to perform. I think we continue to have strong expectations around our fee businesses. And as you saw in the quarter, it really was an across-the-board beat and we expect a lot of those trends to continue.","Steven Kwok","Got it. And then, just around the \u2013 are there further opportunities for loan sales or debt repurchases as we look into the rest of this year?","Christian Lown","The primary purpose for us for the loan sale opportunity was a few things. One, from a structure perspective, it was important for us to do a transaction because it will reduce the time to be able to do it the next time, and time is an important element into the actual results that you achieve in the loan sale process. And so, first and foremost is creating another form of financing for the company. Obviously, we have a lot of opportunities in the market today, but inevitably we wanted to have that opportunity as well. It also was very attractive to us from a return perspective. Obviously, the loan sale is just an acceleration of future cash flows to today, and so, for us, we saw that as a relatively attractive opportunity from a pricing perspective. We do not expect to continue to do loan sales as part of our business plan, but, obviously, if opportunities arose where we could achieve very attractive returns, we will take that opportunity. But we will not be putting that into our business plan going forward.","Jack Remondi","And on the debt repurchase, that was a pretty unique opportunity. We're about to see more of them, but they don't show up there very often.","Steven Kwok","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lee Cooperman of Omega Advisors.","Leon Cooperman","Yeah, hi. I'm going to ask you the same question I've been asking for five years. Clearly, the most aggressive use of our capital has been returning it to shareholders through repurchase. What do you think you're buying when you retire your shares? Like, in the last quarter, I guess you paid $13.23. Over the history of our buyback going over the last five or six year, you probably paid on average much more than $13.23. The stock has been relatively unresponsive. What is it that you \u2013 to me, buying back stock is justified under the one scenario. You're buying back something that is undervalued relative to what your expectations are. Can you share with us kind of what you're thinking about the value of the business?","Jack Remondi","Sure. Thanks for your question, Lee. We continue to believe that returning capital through share repurchases is an attractive transaction for our investors. In the last 18 months, we have repurchased almost a little over 36 million shares. The average price has been somewhere around $12.5 a share during that timeframe. Year-to-date, it's $12.24. So, when we look at the value that we can deliver from the legacy portfolio, the additions that we think we can add to value from loan originations in our business processing areas, we think we're buying the shares back at a substantial discount to the intrinsic value of the company. And that's been consistent with our approach. Obviously, the purchase prices in the last 18 months have been more attractive than in prior years and we accelerated the share repurchases in the second quarter reflecting that point of view.","Leon Cooperman","The $207 million that you have left, do you intend to use it this year? And if you had to make a preliminary guesstimate about what kind of capital you'd have available in 2020, what would you say?","Jack Remondi","So, we do plan on completing the repurchases with the remaining authority this year. And ultimately, the amount that we repurchase next year is a combination of our forecasts and a board discussion process that will be happening later this year.","Leon Cooperman","But I assume order of magnitude to be at least 10%?","Jack Remondi","I don't want to get ahead of \u2013 it's just a board process. You can look at what the cash flows are and the capital generation. You wouldn't see material changes year to year in that kind of activity.","Leon Cooperman","And, clearly, your preference would be to put the excess cash flow into repurchase rather than making a dividend at this point?","Jack Remondi","Yes.","Leon Cooperman","Okay, thank you. ","Jack Remondi","You're welcome. Thanks. Thanks for your participation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies.","John Hecht","Morning. Thanks very much. The first question, just on the quarter, the expenses \u2013 I know you had the \u2013 the $6 million from the proxy resolution, but there was also $5 million from a transition service agreement. I'm just wondering what is that.","Christian Lown","So, that is the agreement, you may remember, the first data outsourcing transaction we did where we have revenue and expenses offsetting each other. So, it really is a wash, but it's just part of our agreement as we transition services away from our platform that they are taking over. It really has zero impact on the bottom line.","John Hecht","Yep. Yep. I remember that now. And then, I wonder, can you give a sense for \u2013 given the kind of forward curve and what's going to change \u2013 I know you guys have done a lot of hedging in your margin, but what kind of opportunities the lower rate environment going forward might present for you?","Christian Lown","So, first, on the hedging point, the rate environment really isn't impacted to the hedges. Just remember, we're really hedging our ones, threes risk. And so, what we've done is really neutralize that risk and provided certainty. There are times it outperforms. There are times it underperforms. But it really does just provide certainty to our cash flows. So, the rising or declining rate environment \u2013 what we really try to do is lock in 12 months out, really what the portfolio needs to be hedged at. So, less of an impact there, but where we clearly can pick up some value in the rate environment we're in today which is a decline rate environment.","There's a few things. One, obviously, for income, it becomes a little more important as rates decline and then we pick up some margin there. It's also important to note that while we're fairly well match funded from an asset and liability perspective. In a stable or declining rate environment, there are short-term benefits as those rates move that enter to our net interest income. And we're experiencing those benefits currently. So, if the rate environment continues, we should see that flow through. So, on the third and fourth quarter, as we could see, improvements in net interest income and also for income benefits as well if we see the rate cuts expected.","John Hecht","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of J.P. Morgan.","Richard Shane","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Look, you guys have a steady sort of wall of maturities or a steady line of maturities coming forward and you've done a good job every year of sort of knocking them down in advance. 2020, you have $2.1 billion. 2021, you have $1.4 billion. I'm assuming, as we move into the second half of the year, you're going to start address those 2020 maturities. I'm curious, when you look at where rates are today, if there's opportunity to benefit from lower rates or how those maturities or addressing those maturities sort of impact margin over the next couple of years?","Jack Remondi","So, it's a great question. Obviously, 2020 represents the last maturity over $2 billion. When I take a look at the liquidity on our balance sheet, today we have over $1.7 billion of cash. We have unencumbered assets in meaningful scale. So, we feel very good about our ability to address 2020 and going forward. What we're really focused on is the continued optimization of our balance sheet, so looking for opportunities to finance assets at attractive rates versus where the unsecured market may be. Also, doing [indiscernible] potentially. So, we are continuing to review and analyze our position and optimize the outcome for shareholders, and that is the exercise we're engaging on. But the opportunities clearly are there and we will focus on them in the second half of the year.","Richard Shane","Okay, great. And, look, given the strength of the earnings, you guys have a variety of options \u2013 buying back shares, meeting maturities, acquisition. I am curious when you, as a management team, sit down and look at the profitability that you're enjoying today and think about redeploying some of that profitability into organic opportunities, where do you see the best place to deploy capital?","Jack Remondi","So, when we look at the business outlook here, in a combination of things that you mentioned, we actually think we have the ability to do multiple things simultaneously. That includes growing the business organically. You see that in the 34% increase in refi originations, the launch of our in-school loan product, our business processing area has less of a capital demand side of the equation to grow that business. But, nonetheless, we still see an opportunity to really leverage the infrastructure and the operating skills of the company there. ","As Chris mentioned, we have significant cash flow and cash resources on hand to meet our liabilities and our maturities there. You saw it this year to date, we've reduced our unsecured debt balance by $1 billion while adding to our cash position and returning excess capital to shareholders. All three of those things, organic growth, debt reduction \u2013 unsecured debt reduction and capital return are on the table. And we see the ability to kind of manage through those very effectively. ","Look, at the end of the day, if we had our \u2013 the best use of capital is that we can redeploy it for shareholders and investors at higher returns than they can get elsewhere, that's obviously what we would love to be able to do. And in our case, because our capital generation is so high, we're actually able to do all three things.","Richard Shane","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. I guess congratulations on being able to drive the TNA ratio to better than your expectations. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about, number one, what were the major factors in how you get there, how you're going to use through that excess? Kind of dovetailing perhaps Rick's question, as you look out into 2020, are there steps to actually improve value?","Christian Lown","That's a great question. Appreciate it. A couple of things. one, obviously, the TNA ratio guidance we gave was first end of year guidance. So, we do expect to end up in the higher end of that 1.23 to 1.25 times. We clearly are above that at 1.27 times. Some of that was driven by the benefits we saw from the debt buyback and the loan sale. But, inevitably, clearly, in a very strong position from a capital perspective. And what you saw us do is, once we realized that early in this quarter as we accelerated our share repurchase activity, to try to catch up a little bit on that. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we will continue at the same pace we saw in the second quarter for the third quarter. So, the dollar number should be relatively similar. That's what we will shoot for.","Inevitably, the big thing, as you're all aware, is the implementation of CECL coming. We're finalizing our views and the impact to capital and how we manage through that. We feel good about our position today. We've put ourselves in this capital position over the last year to be able to successfully manage through that. And so, we will be giving you some pretty clear update and guidance at the end of the third quarter to help you see through the impact and how we're managing capital. But we clearly feel good and we accelerated our share repurchase activity to be able to manage that capital position where we are today because, clearly, we did a little better than we were expecting.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. Thanks, Chris. And just on a second topic, you obviously have had strong success relative to peers with servicing it. But I'm just wondering if there's any thought from a longer-term perspective given the fact that the Department of Ed is still kind of thinking about how that contract is going to [indiscernible] look longer-term. Maybe kind of any big picture thoughts there as to how you could leverage that perhaps, but use it also in a way that allows you to manage your expenses?","Jack Remondi","One of the larger skills of this company is our operational expertise, particularly how we execute that in loan servicing. The benefits come to us in a variety of ways. We are very analytical and data-driven in our process that allows us to be very specific at how we assist individual customers. You see it in our delinquency and default rates. The federal cohort default rate, which is a uniform measure of federal loan performance across all schools, we consistently deliver 30-plus-percent better results than all the other services around. We don't have a different portfolio. These are measures that you could look at individual schools or across the entire platform. That's a skill set that we think is valuable to the Department of Ed. How they utilize that and execute that will be really dependent on how the RFP form gets issued and how it gets executed. So, those are things that have changed around quite a bit over the last couple of years. There's a RFP that we're in the process of responding to now for the back office and call center related functions and we hope to be able to demonstrate our expertise and the value that we generate versus just a commodity-type service.","The last piece I would just add to that is that the regulatory environment associated with that business is a challenge and it's something that needs to be addressed to make that contract and that kind of business attractive and profitable.","Joe Fisher","Moshe, are you still there?","Moshe Orenbuch","I am. I had to kind of think about \u2013 Jack, you kind of left that hanging a little bit at the end there. Anything to report with respect to your discussions with the regulator on that? ","Jack Remondi","So, on the regulatory side of the equation, there've been a number of unsubstantiated accusations that have been made about the work that we do. If you look at the CFPB claim when they filed their lawsuit more than two years ago was that we were steering hundreds of thousands of borrowers unnecessarily into forbearance. We've now been through two years of fact discovery and the CFPB has yet to find a single customer to support their claim. I think that fact pattern speaks volumes about the situation in the regulatory environment and where we stand.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich of Citigroup. ","Arren Cyganovich","Thanks. I was just wondering how the lower rate environment should impact your refi originations going forward? Does that make it more challenging or create an opportunity from the financing [indiscernible]?","Jack Remondi","So, the lower rate \u2013 the refi business is a product that helps customers who have higher coupon student loans, an established credit record and sufficient cash flow to be able to easily service those accounts to refinance those loans at a lower rate, save money and pay down their debt faster. So, a falling interest rate environment marginally improves demand for that product overall. Whereas a rising rate environment marginally reduces demand for the product, but it's really the absolute differences between the coupons on their original student loan debt versus the current market rates that are available to them.","Arren Cyganovich","Okay. I guess the new plus originations from this current academic year will be at lower rates because of where the 10-year was. So, I would imagine\u2026","Jack Remondi","They're lower, although they are still grad plus interest rates. In today's rate environment, we would be able to refinance those loans at a lower rate than what the borrower is paying on a new grad plus loan, obviously depending on their credit situation.","Arren Cyganovich","Okay. And on the in-school piece, I know it's quite early days for that, but is there anything that would indicate that you'll be able to do more or less than what your original expectations were?","Jack Remondi","Students and families begin to apply for loans once their tuition bills are received. The early schools start sending them in kind of mid \u2013 just in the last couple of weeks and then the volume of that process accelerates into August. So, we're just starting to see kind of application flows associated with that. The increases \u2013 the percentage increases are kind of what we would expect to see at this stage in the game, but it is still very early in the process. ","Arren Cyganovich","Okay. And then, just lastly, the federal segment collection and the asset recovery have been quite strong recently. Is that something that you expect to be to continue for a while with the tail on the ability to continue to generate those stronger collection rates?","Jack Remondi","So, that opportunity came from more or less a large one-time placement that we've been executing over the last year or so. You can see the inventory of accounts in that space continues to be quite large. We've executed that extremely well. And as I said, there were two of us who got large placements in that transaction. We have outperformed our competitor by 45% in that space. We'll certainly see continued revenue gains from that, but it does have a finite life. It was a single one-time placement, not an ongoing large placement.","Arren Cyganovich","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hammond of Bank of America.","Mark Hammond","Thanks. And good morning, Jack, Chris and Joe. The first question was on the Earnest refi product, how has pricing held up in a declining rate environment? Have you been able to keep pricing relatively higher than the general rate environment has declined?","Jack Remondi","As we said in the prepared remarks, this last quarter's origination volume was at the highest margins. So, we look at it in terms of not just what the absolute rate is, but what's the rate relative to our funding costs. And the portfolio of loans that we generated in the second quarter had the highest net margins of any quarter's originations to date. Now, that march has been steadily improving since we got into the refi origination business. And we continue to expect and see kind of \u2013 the competition in that marketplaces is high, but people \u2013 our competitors and ourselves are pricing the product relative to the general interest rate environment.","We think our advantages in that space come from the way our product is designed and featured for customers. It allows them to select and manage the monthly payment process to fit their budget, which allows them to save more funds over time and achieve their financial goals faster.","Our cost of acquisition is also significant advantage for us. We are principally a digital shop, meaning that we're originating this \u2013 generating leads through a digital process rather than a direct mail process. And as a result of that and the technology we deploy to underwrite the loans, our cost of acquiring a loan is, in our estimate, about half the industry average. So, when you combine those features together, we think we've got a very attractive product set.","Obviously, you saw it in the pass-through transaction that we did, generating a gain of 3.9% net of capitalized costs, given the credit quality of this portfolio, shows the value that we can generate from the refi origination business.","Mark Hammond","Thanks, Jack. And then, switching to credit ratings, I noticed your goal is to maintain your current credit ratings. And then, a few months ago, Fitch had moved to a negative outlook. Wondering if you guys have done anything over the past couple of months to mitigate or have any conversations about getting that outlook taken off negative.","Christian Lown","All I can say is we continue to execute on our plan and continue to achieve their concerns, in that when they \u2013 if you look about \u2013 their primary concern has been focused on the maturities and, clearly, we've been taking care of those without any issue and our liquidity position should give them a lot of comfort. They have had regulatory concerns. And I think as every day goes by, and as Jack mentioned, sort of the lack of evidence, they get a little more comfortable with that aspect, although it remains an unknown. And from a business plan perspective, our execution has been better than expectations, the Earnest build. So, I think all we do is execute and execute well. And as you said, we do want to maintain our ratings, and so we'll see where Fitch ends up. But we do seem to be addressing their issues. And so, now we'll just have to see what their ultimate goal is.","Jack Remondi","I would just add to that. We have consistently delivered on every aspect of the capital and debt financing forecast that we have presented to the rating agencies. And the way we have managed our liability structure through some very challenging environments in the recession, Great Recession, and some of the liquidity issues associated after that, the end of the day here is we have outperformed our rating in every single period.","Christian Lown","And our ratios show that. I think most people would admit that our rating do not reflect where our ratios are and where our capital structure is. And we continue to push on those points whenever we meet with them.","Mark Hammond","Got it. Thanks, Jack, Chris and Joe.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Henry Coffey of Wedbush.","Henry Coffey","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Great quarter if it's in there. But can you give me your end-of-period share count?","Christian Lown","We had ending CFCs of 233. ","Henry Coffey","Okay. And then, it's July. You've had six good months of credit metrics. You have a fairly deep insight into the specifics behind that. What are your thoughts really on two different fronts? When you look at your FFELP portfolio, what insights do you have into where today's student borrower probably is and what are your thoughts about credit metrics over the next 6 to 12 months?","Jack Remondi","Sure. So, there's really three different metrics that we look at in credit here. You have your legacy FFELP, your legacy private and your newly originated refi loans. When we look at \u2013 and all three of those segments of our portfolio are performing extremely well and delinquency rates, as I said in the call earlier, are at or near historical lows. That's a reflection of the strong economy. It's a reflection of the work we do to help customers who need assistance find the right payment plan and, ultimately, avoid default.","In the student loan space, the storyline is that generally students are having significant difficulty meeting or making their payments on student loans. Our delinquency statistics would tell you kind of the opposite. And that doesn't mean there are customers who are not experiencing difficulties. There are customers who are, but we work with them and try and find solutions to them. But the overwhelming majority of students who take on debt and graduate with a degree are successfully managing their payments, and you see it in the delinquency statistics here.","Henry Coffey","When you take everything you know about your slice of the business and apply it to what you, obviously, see in the entire direct portfolio, would you make that same observation?","Jack Remondi","Yes.","Henry Coffey","And then, finally on CECL, obviously, you will tell us about capital expectations, but will you be able to tell us \u2013 give us some insight into how we should factor CECL into our earnings estimates for 2020 or what are your thoughts there?","Christian Lown","I think we'll give you a complete roadmap in the third quarter CECL implications, capital, et cetera for 2020.","Henry Coffey","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yeah, thanks. It sounds like the biggest driver of kind of improved guidance on both the private NIM and earnings is those two expected Fed rate cuts presumably helping the prime LIBOR mismatch on the private side and also the floor income. Can you give us a sense if you see other upside to NIM if we get three cuts instead of two and\/or from any other kind of funding efficiencies that you might realize in the back half of the year? And if so, can you help us kind of think about kind of what 25 basis points of rate cut might mean to the private student loan NIM?","Jack Remondi","So, I think as we've tried to highlight this morning, the earnings momentum of this company and the results for the first half of the year and the forecast for the second are really coming from an across-the-board levels of contribution.","In the top line, we're seeing stronger loan originations in the refi space, better margins. Our fee revenue is better. And as you point out, the interest rate environment is helping us on our legacy portfolio, both in terms of floor income and the prime LIBOR related issues.","We're also benefiting from improving credit. We saw significant double-digit delinquencies declines in both our FFELP and private portfolios that's leading to lower provisions.","And on the operating expense side of the equation, we continue to deliver efficiency gains in how we run and operate the business. When you combine that with the lower share count, that is what's driving the earnings momentum of the company. So, I think it's important just to note that it's coming from across the board contributions versus just a single area.","And then, maybe, Chris, you want to add a little bit more about what a 25 basis point cut would mean?","Christian Lown","Yeah. So, as for more cuts, obviously, it really depends on timing. Dates of the Fed meetings are important. Where the market expects to be, what happens to LIBOR and financing costs. So, it's not as straightforward. As I've mentioned, we do have two rate cuts in our forecast, one for July and one for October. Another rate cut expectation clearly would be beneficial, but it depends on timing of when it happened, when the market would think it would happen. So, all I can say, it clearly would be beneficial. It's just difficult to quantify given our expectations for two. And if a third was coming, it will probably be at year-end. So, it's just a little more opaque from that perspective.","Mark DeVries","Okay. And as far as extracting additional funding efficiencies, how much more opportunity is there for you and how active should we expect you to be in the coming quarters?","Jack Remondi","I think that there is a lot of opportunity. And, obviously, we continually assess the costs of our financing, the term of our financing, the cash flow expectations that we expect to realize over the coming years and weight them against each other. We have still $8 billion of over-collateralization. There are other opportunities. We have unencumbered assets on the balance sheet. So, I think our perspective is we continue to push on those opportunities. I can tell you the financing markets are very healthy. We continue to get reverse inquiry into those opportunities. And so, you should expect us to continue to weigh those benefits and make optimal capital structure decisions. The only thing I'd highlight is 10-year is obviously important as well, and so we weigh all those factors.","Mark DeVries","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Travis Pascavis with PIMCO.","Travis Pascavis","Hello, everyone. Thanks for taking my call. Just wanted to see if you could comment \u2013 I noticed the legacy private loan book seems to have amortized a little bit more this quarter. Could you kind of comment on why that might be? Is it kind of just reflection of the economy and people refinancing them or is there something else going on that I should think about?","Christian Lown","From our model's perspective, our expectation and actually was relatively in line from what we were expecting. And so, again, I'm not sure what your expectations were. But we haven't seen outsize amortization versus our plan. In fact, I would say, year-to-date, we were actually probably a little better than we would've thought on where balances are ending up. So, again, I'm just unsure what your expectation was, but ours are relatively in line to even slightly better than expected.","Travis Pascavis","Just given the new loan generation, kind of how do you think about the timing of when the loan \u2013 at least on the private side, the loan book would stabilize? Is that something\u2026","Christian Lown","It's a great question. As I mentioned in my remarks, it's 4% year-over-year decline. That's continue to come in. We, obviously, have seen refi originations be better than our expectations at the best spreads we've seen. And we continue to see a lot of opportunity there. Obviously, on a risk-adjusted basis, we really like those loans. From a return perspective, against the capital we put against them. And so, I would say that we're getting closer to that position, but we don't have a forecast of when the private portfolio would stabilize and grow. But we clearly are \u2013 we like what we're seeing thus far. ","Travis Pascavis","Great. There's a lot of proposals out there by the new candidates that are coming out. A lot of is noise, a lot of it is headlines. But maybe if you could kind of \u2013 anything that stands out that you think is particularly interesting or has potential traction on your side that you think is important to maybe call out or highlight anything in general?","Jack Remondi","I think as you noted, there are a lot of proposals surrounding student debt, given the election cycle. At this stage in the game, they are proposals at this point. And how the government and taxpayers decide to assist students and families in paying for college is really a political decision. So, we'll have to wait and see how that all unfolds.","Travis Pascavis","Totally understand. And maybe just my final question. Just maybe \u2013 could you refresh, the Department of Education's servicing contract, there's been lot of stops and starts. Maybe what is the timeline for conclusion of that or anything in particular you could update us with?","Jack Remondi","So, the current state is that the contract has been kind of segmented into different components that are out for RFP. Their expectations have been that the decisions would've been made by now, but various components are still out for response to RFPs. And others that have been issued have not been concluded yet. It's really difficult to say exactly how this is going to go in part because every single action seems to be accompanied by some form of bid protest by somebody in the industry and we certainly would expect bid protests \u2013 that bid protest process to continue even as decisions are made and contracts awarded.","Christian Lown","And our current contract was extended through December, and so we'll see what happens when we get to December, but that was an [indiscernible] six-month extension if they wanted to choose to implement, which they did. And so, again, per Jack's comment, that could continue to be extended, but it's unclear. But we have been extended through December.","Travis Pascavis","Great. Well said. Thanks for the update.","Jack Remondi","Welcome.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. And I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Joe Fisher. ","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Felicia. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. Please contact me or my colleague, Nathan Rutledge, if you have any other follow-up questions. This concludes today's call.","Operator","And thank you for participating. You may now disconnect at this time."]}}
