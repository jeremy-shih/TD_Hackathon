There will be a question-and-answer period after the speakers have completed their prepared remarks.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Principal Financial Group's fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. As always, our earnings release, financial supplement and slides related to today's call are available on our website at www.principal.com\/investor.","I'd like to remind you that all the results follow the new format we outlined on our November 6 investor event. Following the reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO, Dan Houston; CFO, Terry Lillis will deliver some prepared remarks, then we will open up the call for questions.","Others available on the Q&A are Nora Everett, Retirement Income Solutions; Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors; Luis Vald\u00e9s, Principal International; Deanna Strable, U.S. Insurance Solutions and Tim Dunbar, our Chief Investment Officer.","The company does not revise or update them to reflect new information, subsequent events or changes in strategy. Risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed by the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","I'll now turn the call over to Dan.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John; and welcome to everyone on the call. Today I'll briefly comment on our financial results and certain accomplishments that position us for continued growth in 2016 and beyond. I'll turn the call over to Terry who will provide additional details on results.","As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are available on our website. The key themes are outlined on slide four. I'd characterize 2015 as a good year. We delivered after-tax operating earnings of nearly $1.3 billion despite challenging conditions, such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and underperformance of the U.S. equity markets. And we returned more than $700 million to shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases. This demonstrates the benefit of our broad diversification by business, by geography, by investment platforms and by asset class.","In 2015, Principal continued to build momentum through outstanding investment performance and expansion of distribution and our solutions based product set. Full year 2015 total company net cash flows of $23 billion were 4% of beginning of year assets under management. As we continue to attract and retain retail, retirement and institutional investors, this helped drive assets under management to $527 billion at year-end, despite a $28 billion drag from foreign exchange.","As other major growth highlights for 2015, I'd point to Principal International's 29th consecutive quarter of positive net cash flows with $9 billion of flows for the year, plus another $21 billion of positive flows from our joint venture with China Construction Bank. On a constant currency basis, Principal International grew reported assets under management by 20% in 2015; double-digit earnings growth for Principal Global Investors and nearly $16 billion in positive net cash flows; record earnings for Specialty Benefits on record sales and a 9% growth in premium and fees; continued traction delivering mutual funds, separately managed accounts and annuity-based income solutions; strong underlying growth in plans, participants and reoccurring deposits for our U.S. retirement businesses and strong Individual Life full-year results as claims returned to expected levels.","As I said, outstanding investment performance continues to be a differentiator and is a foundation for future growth. For example, 44 of our rated mutual funds, or 76%, have a four-star or five-star Morningstar rating. Additionally, as slide five shows, 88%, 89% and 93% of our investment options were in the top two Morningstar quartiles on a one-year, three-year and five-year basis, respectively. And 100% of our target date funds remain in the top two quartiles across all time periods and year-end, driving sales and retention in this key asset class and enabling us to help more individuals achieve financial success. From the strong competitive position, we remain confident in our ability to drive growth in 2016 and beyond.","Next I'll provide some examples of how we continue to execute on our strategy and further position ourselves for long-term growth. The U.S. remains the largest retirement market in the world and Principal has maintained its leadership position for decades through exceptional service, product innovation and strong multi-channel distribution.","With the retail mutual funds business now reporting through Principal Global Investors, Full Service Accumulation is now the majority of Retirement and Income Solutions Fee or RIS Fee. To be clear, the underlying fundamentals of this business remain strong. We continue to grow plan count across plan sizes, adding nearly 1,300 net new plans in 2015 and we continue to be a leader in start-up plans as we focus on expanding employee coverage. The Principal's core target market of small-sized and medium-sized businesses is underserved, creating an ongoing opportunity for us to uniquely serve this market through our network of local offices and drive consistent growth in this segment.","Full year reoccurring deposits grew $1.1 billion, up 7% versus 2014. These growth trends highlight the power of the payroll deduction component of this business. But, more importantly, the work we're doing to advocate best practice plan design with employers and advisers to increase participation in savings rates to better prepare their employees for retirement. Strong alliance firm relationships continue to be a key driver of sales for Retirement Income Solutions, Principal Global Investors, as well as U.S. Insurance Solutions.","In 2015, seven different advisory firms sold more than $1 billion across our offerings, with those firms averaging more than six products per platform. In 2015 we continue to do business with more advisers and get our investments added to recommended lists, platforms and model portfolios. In 2015, we had good traction of plan sponsors adopting our retirement readiness plan design. The primary features of these plans are automatic enrollment and automatic savings rate increases.","Additionally, we launched an innovative income option in the fourth quarter, which offers an in-plan guaranteed annuity to provide more income security for plan participants. While this business remains under pressure from volatile markets, we expect good growth in sales and flows in 2016 and getting meaningful growth in the pipeline.","Two other points I'd like to emphasize, our U.S. retirement business continues to be one of the highest performing businesses in the industry and continues to create tremendous value for the enterprise overall.","Slide six provides an update on fiduciary regulations. With the Department of Labor's fiduciary regulation advancing to the Office of Management and Budget last week, final regulations could be issued as early as March or April. The Principal remains fully engaged to help ensure the final regulations work in favor of individuals trying to save for retirement.","We also remain focused on scenario planning and potential changes to business models with a particular focus on education and guidance, compliance and oversight, provision of investment information, distribution and asset retention. Absent clarity around the final rule, we're not providing a cost estimate at this time. But, based on what we know today, we do not expect a significant increase in our run rate expenses. The Principal has a long history of successfully adapting to complex regulations, our track record reflects the benefit of scale, products and service breadth and top tier investments; all critical to meeting the needs of the market and diverse adviser business models. As with prior regulatory developments, we're well positioned and confident we'll emerge among the winners.","Despite volatility in emerging markets, Principal International continues to demonstrate that we're in the right target markets with marquee distribution partners. As an example, our long-term exclusive distribution partnership with Banco do Brasil, the largest bank in Latin America, provides our joint venture, Brasilprev, access to more than 61 million customers. Customers' confidence in Banco do Brasil and our tax-advantaged individual retirement products helped drive Brasilprev's full year net cash flows to $7 billion. This growth further strengthened Brasilprev's position as the number one private retirement provider in Brazil in terms of net cash flow and assets.","Additionally, we continue to gain traction in the voluntary savings market. For example, on a constant currency basis with Chile, volunteer assets under management increased 17% and voluntary fee income increased 25% in 2015. We remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities of our international operations.","Principal Global Investors, which now includes retail and institutional asset management, ended 2015 with $361 billion in assets under management. Institutional sales were strong in 2015 and the pipeline is robust. To counter the broader shift in demand to more passive or low-cost investment options, Principal Global Investors launched solutions in areas where demand for active strategies remained strong, including multiple new real estate offerings and fixed income strategies. We'll continue to add to our ETF suite in 2016 and beyond, as well as our portfolio of Income Solutions, which will include both funds and guaranteed income options.","In December, the Principal earned the top spot in the category in Pension & Investments' (sic) [Pensions & Investments'] annual survey of Best Places to Work in Money Management for the fourth consecutive year. This award highlights the Principal's strong investment management culture and teams that successfully work to meet client needs every day, and position us to attract and retain top investment talent.","Moving now to our insurance businesses, our focus on small and medium-sized business markets remain a key differentiator, and we continue to find ways to improve the customer experience. In 2015, we piloted our Easy Elect (11:06) group benefits enrollment tool in seven markets with meaningful improvement in voluntary participation, as we continue to help individuals understand the importance of protection to broader financial security.","In closing, I'm optimistic about 2016 and our long-term future despite the continued global macroeconomic volatility. Strong business fundamentals and our ability to focus on things we can control will continue to drive momentum and generate long-term profitable growth.","Terry?","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Dan. This morning I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year, net income, including performance of the investment portfolio, and I'll close with an update on capital deployment.","The fourth quarter was a solid end to a good year. On a reported basis, total company after-tax operating earnings were $303 million, a 6% decrease from the prior year period, reflecting macroeconomic volatility.","On slide seven you'll see that fourth quarter 2015 earnings per share were $1.02 compared to a normalized fourth quarter 2014 earnings per share of $1.07, down 5%. However, on a constant currency basis, earnings per share increased 1% quarter-over-quarter. For full year 2015, reported total company after-tax earnings were nearly $1.3 billion, a 4% decrease from a record 2014. The lower reported earnings in 2015 were primarily driven by lower variable investment income and the impact from currency translation.","Year-end 2015 return on equity, excluding AOCI other than the foreign currency translation adjustment, was 14.2%. The daily average change in equity markets is an important driver of the revenue for our fee businesses. In fourth quarter 2015, despite a 6.5% point-to-point increase in the S&P 500, the daily average change for the quarter was slightly higher than 1% compared to third quarter 2015. On a full-year basis, the S&P 500 daily average increased approximately 7% in 2015 compared to a 17.5% increase in 2014.","As we look ahead to 2016, if the macroeconomic volatility continues as it has in January, we anticipate a slowdown in revenues in our fee-based businesses. Therefore, we'll focus on things we can control and continue to manage expenses to ensure revenue and expense are aligned. With that said, we will continue to make the necessary investments to keep our competitive edge and drive long-term shareholder value. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and our teams remain focused on execution regardless of the macroeconomic environment.","Now I'll discuss business unit results, starting on slide eight with RIS Fee businesses. Fourth quarter pre-tax operating earnings of $125 million were down 10% from the year-ago quarter. Net revenue decreased 2% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to flat average account values and a decline in variable investment income. Full-year 2015 net revenue increased 1% over 2014. Net investment income decreased due to lower variable investment income in 2015 compared to the higher than expected levels in 2014. On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pre-tax return on net revenue was 31%. After normalizing for the third quarter actuarial assumption review, it was 34%.","RIS Fee had net outflows of $1.6 billion in fourth quarter 2015, despite strong sales of $3.1 billion. Fourth quarter net cash flows reflect exit of a few large cases, due to M&A activity and continued pricing discipline, as well as the timing of funding for new sales. As a result, we anticipate strong net cash flows in first quarter 2016 and full year 2016 net cash flows to be 1% to 3% of beginning of period account values as we maintain our focus on balancing growth and profitability.","Turning to slide nine, RIS Spread quarterly pre-tax operating earnings were $62 million, a 4% increase over the year-ago quarter, primarily due to growth in account values. On a trailing 12-month basis, pre-tax return on net revenue was 56%. The pension closeout business had record full-year sales of $1.8 billion, which are double 2014 sales. The pipeline remains strong and opportunities in 2016 look promising.","Slide 10 shows Principal Global Investors' fourth quarter pre-tax operating earnings were $102 million, a 2% increase over the prior year quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion and pre-tax operating earnings grew 11% compared to the prior year period. Pre-tax return on adjusted revenue increased to 34%.","Despite the industry's bias towards passive investment strategies, Principal Global Investors generated full-year net cash flows of nearly $16 billion, with $8 billion coming from institutional clients. This is a result of outstanding investment performance, and outcome-oriented solutions that are in demand. Additionally, full-year management fees increased 9% over 2014, above the 6% growth in average assets under management, demonstrating client preference for higher fee capabilities that, combined with increased scale, led to margin improvement.","Slide 11 shows quarterly pre-tax operating earnings for Principal International of $67 million. On a constant currency basis, Principal International continues to drive mid-teen earnings growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal International's pre-tax return on net revenue was 38% after normalizing for the third quarter 2015 impairment of intangible assets in Claritas.","Moving to slide 12, Specialty Benefits' quarterly pre-tax operating earnings were $57 million, a 29% increase over the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter premium and fees grew 8% compared to the prior year quarter, and the overall loss ratio remained favorable at 62%. These are very strong results, even in a seasonally high fourth quarter, due to our focus on the small-sized and medium-sized business market and disciplined profitable growth.","As shown in slide 13, Individual Life pre-tax operating earnings were $30 million for the quarter. Despite the claims experience that was in line with expectation, this is at the low end of our expected range for the quarter, partially due to lower variable revenue. However, full-year pre-tax operating earnings growth was strong year-over-year. For the quarter, total company net income was $254 million, which includes realized capital losses of $48 million. After-tax net credit related losses of $5 million were slightly better than expected. The losses related to the hedging activities were predominantly due to interest rate and equity market changes. Full-year credit-related losses were $20 million, a 65% improvement over 2014 results. Unrealized gains were $1.9 billion, and the portfolio ended the year with a net gain of $1.1 billion.","Our investment portfolio is high quality and diversified by industry, geography, property type and individual credit exposures. In addition, we have always had a disciplined approach to asset liability management, and therefore, we're not forced sellers during stressed times.","At year-end 2015 our energy portfolio carrying value was 95% of par value. Our overall exposure to the energy sector represents 5.7% of our total fixed maturity portfolio and 4.2% of our total U.S. invested assets as of December 31, 2015. Our market value exposure in high-yield energy companies as of year-end 2015 was $280 million, or less than one half of 1% of total U.S. invested assets.","Despite the continued market volatility in the beginning of 2016, we remain confident about the strength of our investment portfolio. As outlined on slide 14, our capital management strategy remains balanced and is focused on building long-term value for shareholders. Our fee-based businesses drove nearly 70% of 2015 normalized earnings, which generates higher levels of deployable capital and provides greater financial flexibility. In 2015, we deployed $1.1 billion of capital, which represented nearly 90% of net income.","Our balanced capital deployment includes $441 million in common stock dividends, $355 million in strategic acquisitions, and $275 million in share repurchases. The full year common stock dividend was $1.50 per share. This is a 17% increase over full-year 2014 as we continue to increase our payout ratio. Additionally, last night we announced a $0.38 per share common stock dividend payable in first quarter 2016.","While we continue to explore strategic acquisition opportunities, the current equity market volatility is also providing an opportunity to enhance shareholder value through execution of the remainder of our share buyback authorization. In 2016, we expect to deploy $800 million to $1 billion of capital in a strategic and balanced manner to enhance long-term value for shareholders.","In closing, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, we remain confident that our diversified business model positions us well for future growth.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question will come from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to follow up actually, Terry, on your last statement with regards to acquisitions. And maybe you can give us a sense of what the tone is out there. Obviously, your stock is cheaper. That's more attractive. On the other hand, public valuations are down, but then I wonder if private sellers look at those valuations and say, no way, and you're finding that they're pulling back.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Steven, this is Dan. Thanks for the question this morning. And, of course, this has a lot to do with how we're going to deploy our capital for the best interest of our long-term shareholders. And with that maybe I'll ask Terry speak specifically to valuations on potential acquisitions.","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steven. As we talked about this before, we always look at it as a balanced approach to our capital deployment strategy to enhance long-term shareholder value. As we've stated before, we have more fee-based businesses. Predominantly pretty close to 70% of our earnings are coming from fee-based businesses, which is less capital-intensive. As a result of that, we have an opportunity to deploy more capital. And if you look at what we talked about historically, only about 35% of our capital's needed on organic basis, that leaving close to 65% available for other deployment opportunities.","Now, that said, we think that we need to have a balanced approach. We are on track to increase our dividend as a percent of that total net income percentage, closer to 40% over the longer period here. But, as you look at share buybacks, and you look at M&A opportunities, the M&A opportunities are still very important to us. We want to have an active pipeline. We want to continue to look at that. But, as you say, with the valuations as low as they currently are, it makes sense for us to actually deploy capital in terms of buying back our shares, because we do believe that they're undervalued at this point in time. It's a very volatile market, so we have to have that disciplined approach. But, again, we're going to continue to look at capital deployment strategies, and we said $800 million to $1 billion this year. We expect to have a very balanced approach as we've done in the past. But, as you said, the opportunities right now are very enticing for the buyback program. We actually have $75 million of authorization that's outstanding at this point in time.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Steven, was that helpful?","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes, it was. Thank you, a little nuance there. And then just one more quick one, Terry, do you know what the unrealized losses on the energy BEIG (24:55) portfolio?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Maybe we'll have Tim Dunbar go ahead and take that, he's on the call as well, our Chief Investment Officer.","Timothy Mark Dunbar - Chief Investment Officer & Executive VP","Sure. So, Terry, I think mentioned that we had about $280 million of GAAP exposure in high-yield energy sector. And that's at about $0.70 on the dollar. So, our book carrying value would be around $400 million.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will come from Eric Berg with Royal Bank of Canada.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is Kenneth Lee on for Eric Berg. Just had a quick question in terms of the PGI institutional flows. It looks like there was a bit of a slowdown in the fourth quarter. Just want to get a better sense of what you're seeing in terms of the various boutique managers in terms of their flows, whether there's a risk (25:49) emerging market debt or whatnot. Thanks.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Kenneth. Thanks for the question. The one area that we look at that really had really strong results for the quarter clearly was around Principal Global Investors. I think about that in the context of Jim coalescing a mutual fund team along with the institutional team. When you look at the broader industry, we've seen actually a lot of declines, significant declines, negative net cash flow. So, frankly when we evaluate Principal Global Investors and Jim's leadership in this area, we think we've got a very strong result for the quarter and certainly for the year. But, Jim, uncertainly, you can add some color to that.","James Patrick McCaughan - President, Global Asset Management and Chief Executive Officer, Principal Global Investors","Yes, I'd add a couple of things to that. The first is that the decline in net flows in the second half of the year was really around some of the large cap equity strategies, particularly at Columbus Circle and Principal Global Equities, where our clients have been looking at the passive alternative and going for lower fee capabilities. Now, as you saw from our flows, though, we more than replaced that with the higher added-value strategies that we really specialize in, which range through high yield, real estate, small cap, areas that are less efficient markets. But, net-net, it was a slightly down but still positive fourth quarter. And I'd emphasize that because many of our peer group are seeing negative flows. One area where the peer group's seeing negative flows is sovereigns, particularly central banks and sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East, which are obviously under severe financial pressure. We have some business in those areas, and we have not seen those outflows yet, because we are seeing much stronger investment performance, and we've tended to be among the managers that got retained. We're hopeful that'll continue, but obviously, there are no guarantees.","If I look at the pipeline, which I think was partly where you were going, we have had a very active last two months, including over the holidays and in January. And that is unusual. Usually the institutional market globally quietens down during that period around the end and beginning of the year. But, we've seen quote activity and indeed funding looking really quite positive, and I have to say we're feeling pretty optimistic about the flow potential, and it's related to the investment performance that Dan and Terry both mentioned.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. And just a quick follow-up, just to clarify, it sounds as if, because of the outflows in relatively low fee rate products and inflows in high fee rate products, that means like on a revenue-adjusted basis, it sounds like it's a lot more positive than the flows would suggest. Would that be a fair statement?","James Patrick McCaughan - President, Global Asset Management and Chief Executive Officer, Principal Global Investors","Yeah. Yeah, I think that's right. And Terry identified some of the numbers that point to that. We're seeing \u2013 it's not universally so, but we're seeing moves towards some of our more high added-value strategies. And it is a very tough environment in terms of fee negotiation. We do not cut fees heavily because we are going to be eventually capacity-constrained a long way out and we need to get the business at attractive revenue rather than necessarily at all costs. We're much more driven by revenues than we are by AUM.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Kenneth, thanks for the question. Please give Eric our regards.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Will do.","Operator","The next question will come from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. I'm a little confused and was hoping to get some clarification. Terry, you had talked about the point-to-point increase in the S&P this quarter really averaging, I think, less than 1%. But, the way I thought I understood it last quarter was that you had compared the point-to-point decrease in the S&P as opposed to the daily average change relative to expectations. So, was I not thinking about this correctly last quarter, or how should I think about it going forward in terms of the impact of the S&P to normalized earnings?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Yaron. Thanks for the question. And clearly the daily average is what ultimately drives the revenue, but I'll have Terry go ahead and add to that.","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, you're absolutely right, Yaron. As you look at the impact on the fees that occur, it's really more the daily average asset (30:18). And we use that as a proxy for what the movements and the impact to our account values. So, you really look at the average account value from one period to the next period.","Now, actual performance of those assets also come into play versus the proxy that we use. Last quarter we talked about a significant drop point-to-point in the S&P 500, that was down 6.7% third quarter over third quarter. That has an impact on the deferred acquisition costs and that's what we're referencing last quarter.","Now, we have an expectation that you'll have anywhere from a 2% to 3% positive impact in that point-to-point time. So, if you look at that 2% to 3% versus, say, down nearly 7%, you're talking a 9% to 10% drop that impacts the deferred acquisition model. Now, you go forward to this quarter, now, the point-to-point was up 6.5%, as you pointed out. Now, that has an impact on the expenses, but the differential between what the expectation and what the actual point-to-point was, was much smaller this quarter and didn't have as significant of an impact.","Again, that S&P 500 is a proxy for the movement in our actual assets. The actual asset movement was also impacted by \u2013 the domestic markets were strong in the fourth quarter. However, international markets and maybe some of the fixed income investments weren't quite as strong. But, I hope that helps. It is really two different things: an average account value and the average S&P go hand-in-hand, and that typically ties to the fee base. Whereas, the expenses associated with the acquisition are more of a point-to-point. Now, if you look at the deferred acquisition costs for this quarter, they were right in line with what our expectations would be for every one of our businesses. Hope that helps.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very much so. Thank you. And then I had one follow-up, and I apologize if I missed it in your prepared comments, but the G&A expenses and RIS Fees were a bit high. Was that a timing issue or are you investing more significantly in the platform? Could you maybe give us a little more color on that?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think there is just a little bit of noise there. And again, we make ongoing investments in the platform to make sure that we're viable. You may have seen that we've introduced a new in-plan annuity, which we're excited about. That's just one example of that sort of investment. But with that as a backdrop, Nora, do you have anything specific to add as it relates to the spike in...","Nora Mary Everett - President of Retirement and Investor Services and Chairman of Principal Funds","No, if you look at quarter-over-quarter, comp and other, if you see that line item, actually up only $5 million, 2.5%. So, that's the line I'd focus on. And certainly to Dan's point, we're going to continue to make investments in technology, but that's going to be an ongoing investment, not a point in time.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. So there's just maybe a degree of seasonality there?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think that's correct. Yeah, nothing to call out, certainly. Yaron, thanks for the question.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, everybody. I've got one question on a data point and then a couple of bigger picture questions for you, if I could. The question that I have on the data point is variable investment income. On a consolidated basis, Terry, how much did that contribute to the fourth quarter results and how would that compare with a more typical quarter?","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","John, thanks for the question. As you talk about variable investment income, there is a lot of components that go into that. What I would talk about in terms of variable investment income is probably prepayment activity that occurs on our mortgages and fixed income investments, as well as some real estate sales that we have that also impact it.","And typically, I'd look at on a quarter-by-quarter basis that we benefit from this variable investment income activity by $0.03 to $0.07 a quarter. In 2014, it was well above average because as you're well aware, everybody was anticipating higher interest rates, and so the prepayment activity was really, really high. We try to call out the variable investment income when it distorts the run rate that is actually in any particular quarter.","Now, if you look at this particular quarter, the expectations were right in line with what we would have expected. We saw probably a benefit of variable investment income around $0.04, little over $0.04, so it's right in line with our expectations. So, there was no reason to call it out. Now, a year ago, it was slightly higher. And if you actually look out on a run rate basis, we called out probably close to $0.08 \u2013 probably $0.06 to $0.08 a year ago, which was well above our expectations for the year. Hopefully that helps, but I would expect it to be right in line with expectations this quarter.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. And then I have a question on Brazil. In Principal International net flows remain very strong. But, they have slowed quite a bit, if you look at it versus the last \u2013 maybe even just a year ago. Net flows are about half the level as they were a year ago. I'm just so curious about what's your view of the economy there is, what your outlook is for ongoing growth there and whether we should expect that that continues to grow but at a much slower pace.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. John, thanks for that question, because if you think about Brazil and India and China and Southeast Asia, those are really our big growth engines for Luis and his team. As you noted from the script and other conversations, we think we have a excellent partner in Banco do Brasil. Brasilprev, as you know, has some very favorable tax treatment of the savings vehicle, and there is this flight to quality right now and so that's playing to our benefit. Having said that, you're correct, some of those flows are lower than they have been historically. And with that, maybe I'll have Luis provide some additional color on the specificity around those flows in Brazil. Luis?","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks a lot.","Luis Vald\u00e9s - President-Principal International","John, good morning. This is Luis.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good morning.","Luis Vald\u00e9s - President-Principal International","Talking about total net customer cash flows for PI, during this year we put $9.3 billion in comparison with $13 billion last year. If you're putting this comparison in a constant currency basis, it's a minus 5%. And we're comparing with our record year in 2014. So I would say that the most important part of these differences at currency we had we were facing a 30% depreciation on average. Talking about Brazil, I mean, Brazil continues performing very well. We put a $6.9 billion in net customer cash flows. As Dan mentioned, our JV with Banco is going very well. We're going to continue facing some volatility and some headwinds, but all-in-all, all our companies and the fundamentals of our business out there continues very strong.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hopefully that helps. Maybe I'll ask Jim to opine a bit on the Brazilian economy, maybe more broadly in its recovery and maybe where we stand. I think that was the latter half of your question, John.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","And if I could, my last question was actually going to be for Jim, and that's just what probability are you putting at this point, Jim, on a broader turn in the credit cycle beyond just energy? I'm just curious in your outlook.","James Patrick McCaughan - President, Global Asset Management and Chief Executive Officer, Principal Global Investors","Very good. Thanks. Okay. Now, thank you. On the last point, I would say this is one of the very important questions on the U.S. and the global economy. And at the moment we're seeing the problems in credit really associated with the energy companies, the miners and to an extent companies with very large leverage businesses in emerging markets as it's quite a tight little part of the credit market. The way that that would become contagion would be if banks have been foolish enough to get over-committed in those markets. If that happens, you're going to see a broader credit contagion, and indeed a lower flow of credit in even the U.S. economy.","Your question really was what probability do I see attached to that. We've discussed this at some length within our organization. We have people with a lot of different skills on this. But, if I can distill it, I would say in the next 12 months, that's probably a 20% probability, it's still a negative tail risk. It is most likely that the U.S. and global economy continue growing albeit at a slower pace than it was before, but we need to be ready to defend if contagion happens and you end up with a worse economy.","In particular, on Brazil, I think what's gone wrong in Brazil apart from the obvious political process and commodity prices is, like China, they kept growth going for quite a long time by expansion of credit, particularly to state-owned enterprises for infrastructure investment and so on. That expansion of credit has probably got to about the limit. So, you're into a bit of a debt deflation situation.","The IMF, I think it was, just brought down their growth estimate or their recession estimate this year to in excess of 3% from 1%. I think that's quite possible. I think you're going to see another year of pretty severe recession in Brazil, come what may, but this is part of a deleveraging process. And we've seen this with economies that slow a lot, because people are not spending, there's quite a lot of cash available. And Principal International is taking maximum advantage of that right now. This will pass, it's a phase. It could take a while, but it's one where our business can do, frankly, okay.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Very good. Thanks, Jim. Hopefully that helps, John.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks, no that...","Operator","The next question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Can you give a little bit more underlying color on RIS Fee, both deposits and withdrawals? And specifically, recurring deposits, I guess, were down about 5% year-over-year. I'm sure part of that was impacted by lower asset values, so I'd appreciate any more color on kind of underlying activity.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","My take on that, Ryan, is that FSA is in really good shape. When I think about Full Service Accumulation and the underlying drivers of that business, and when I think about it in the context of sales and net cash flow and ability just to grow that block of business, so we really, really feel strongly that it is a strong contributor to success. But, having said that, Nora is our resident expert, can speak specifically on some of these drivers. Nora?","Nora Mary Everett - President of Retirement and Investor Services and Chairman of Principal Funds","Sure. Good morning, Ryan. So, again, total recurring deposits were up 7% year-over-year, that's $1 billion number that I think Dan mentioned in the script ahead of time. What you may be focused on is the quarter-over-quarter, which was up only about 3.2%. There's some noise there. We have some DB plan deposit noise there. If we strip that noise away and we don't expect that to recur, and we look at those core deferrals, so look at the core deferrals and match, that's actually up really strong quarter-over-quarter, closer to 11%, little bit north of 11%. So, both with regard to quarter-over-quarter and trailing 12 months, we're seeing very strong growth in those recurring deposits.","We're also seeing very strong growth with regard to the number of participants that are deferring. That percentage is up over 8%. So, when you look at the fundamentals of this business, whether you're looking at plan count, again, we saw that increase across all of the segments; whether you're looking at startup plans in the industry, we're now seeing startup plans 17% above pre-crisis levels. So a huge opportunity in that part of the market that is completely underserved because 50% or so of those smaller employers do not today have worksite access to retirement. We play in that space extremely well and one of the leaders in that startup plan market.","So the underlying fundamentals here are really, really strong. When you look at the fourth quarter lapses, handful of large cases, again, we're going to win and lose on an M&A basis, we happened to lose a couple where the plan went to the acquirer, but the good news there is the momentum we're seeing. I might add one other thing in Q4 that we saw is one plan that came in as a sale and a very large plan, north of $500 million, is not going to fund until 1Q. So, once in a while, as we've mentioned before, we're going to get those timing issues.","But if you strip out those timing issues and you look into Q1, we're seeing very significant momentum there both with regard to our sales pipeline, good momentum in the pipeline and we're also seeing good momentum with regard to retention. So, as we look into 2016, certainly we don't want to get into the prediction business, but we would anticipate a pretty strong, positive net cash flow in Q1. And we would look, as Terry said, to be back in that range of 1% to 3% of beginning of year account values with regard to net cash flow full year.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Ryan, just a couple of additional comments. When I think about just the America marching back, why do you look at group benefits or you look at our small-sized to medium-sized retirement businesses, low unemployment rates are causing \u2013 will start take an increase in wages, we start seeing an increase in matching contributions, we see employers competing for workers, which means they may strengthen, adding a dental benefit, adding a 401(k) match, all of those things contribute to growing long-term revenues for the organization. But, again, I'd highlight one of the statistics that Nora threw out. We are now seeing new plan formation at a higher level than we saw it in last \u2013 in that 2007\/2008 timeframe, so a really good time for small business in the U.S.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you. And then just a separate question. I think, Dan, you mentioned this at one point. I just wanted to get an update. Do you still see a potential opportunity to free up some capital in your Closed Block within Individual Life?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","We absolutely do see that as an opportunity. That's a lever that we could pull. And while I'll ask \u2013 Deanna Strable is here, and I'll ask her to tell opine on what the nature of that might look like.","Deanna D. Strable-Soethout - President-US Insurance Solutions","Yeah, just a couple of comments on Individual Life. Obviously, we've been very focused on making sure we're meeting our profitability targets both on a return basis and on earnings perspective. Even though earnings were a little bit soft in the fourth quarter, I think very strong growth when you look year-over-year.","Specific to capital, obviously, there's a number of things that we continue to look at to make sure that we're pulling those levers when and if they make sense. And the Closed Block is one that is currently does provide an opportunity, and we're just working together with Terry and Tim to determine when the right time might be to do that. Obviously, we want to have a place to deploy that. The rating agencies are more concerned on making sure we keep that within our life insurance company perspective. And so, again, I think it's probably more of a matter of when rather than if. But, we do think it's an opportunity that we could pull at some point in time.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Can you help us \u2013 any sort of metric to help us size how big that could be?","Deanna D. Strable-Soethout - President-US Insurance Solutions","A lot of it depends on the timing of it. But, I would say it's multiple hundreds of millions of dollars that are really trapped up in that perspective.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question, Ryan.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Kovac with Goldman Sachs.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks. As you discussed within the retirement fee-based business, because expenses were really only up 2% year-over-year, the topline brusher obviously drove margin pressure. Can you talk about some of the specific drivers that you see going forward in 2016 in order to sort of slow that margin compression, specifically thinking about the expense side?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's a good question. Frankly, I wouldn't limit that to just a conversation about full-service accumulation or RIS. That's a company-wide item for us. We're trying to constantly strive the right differential between our growth in revenues and our growth in expenses. We review that on a constant basis; a lot of company-wide initiatives to go right at that specific point. So, again, not limited to RIS, but I know that's where your question was. So I'll ask Nora to maybe fill in some of the blanks in your question. Nora?","Nora Mary Everett - President of Retirement and Investor Services and Chairman of Principal Funds","Sure. And this is not going to surprise you, but one of our priorities is to make sure that we actually do continue to invest for long-term growth. So, we're going to continue to balance the need for efficiencies, which we are gaining. We're going to continue to focus on operational efficiencies. But, we've got an equal focus on making sure that we're investing for that long-term growth. So, what you're going to see is, and we've given guidance on margin, and that guidance on margin gives us the ability to, what we believe, strike the right balance between those two things, because the last thing we want to do is shrink to greatness. We've got a very sharp focus on a lot of \u2013 when you think about digital, when you then about self-serve, when you think about the opportunities in the small to medium business market, that's our sweet spot. So, we're going to play there, and we're going to play there in a way that balances growth and profitability.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","It's a really good question. The other area I think about, the investment we're making in technology well beyond cyber security controls, but it gets into having a digital strategy that better enables our customers to do business with us, better support our adviser community, better support our participants, that's an investment we can't afford not to make. And the good news is we can take that same investment and leverage it throughout the organization. So something that works in retirement is something that we'll likely deploy internationally with Luis and his team. And we've also demonstrated we can leverage that across Deanna Strable's U.S. Insurance Solutions. So, a good question. We appreciate that, Michael. Did you have a follow-up?","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. If I could, a follow-up here, on the Department of Labor, I know you're not giving any sort of large updates to the compliance cost in terms of sizing. But, have you begun spending some of that today? And I'm wondering sort of further beyond compliance costs if you're preparing anything in terms of product shifts or conversations you're having with your distribution partners in terms of sort of preparing for it in the coming months.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's a question that I'm surprised it took this long today to get into this question. We know it's top of mind for investors, and we fully appreciate that. I guess where I start on this question is, we've been very active with the trades, we're active with DOL and Congress in better understanding the implications it has as it relates to this fiduciary definition. But, from our perspective, job one is to protect the interest of the American savers without taking away very valuable education and guidance, which frankly most workers are very dependent on. So, we've looked at it at basically three different inflection points.","One is that initial selection of the investments. We think that we've got that appropriately identified and the steps that we'll have to take in order to work with advisers. And so, again, we think that that's very manageable. The second is the routine inquiries that we have among our plan participants, they're inquiring about a hardship loan or a standard loan or trying to get some investor education and understand perhaps better the target date investment options. Again, we think that within the definition there's a way to work with that, we think there's viable solutions.","The third is around those job changers and retirees. Again, we all know they have three options. One is to leave it in the plan. Our reading of the understanding of the rule today would cause perhaps more people to leave it in the plan. There are some benefits from that to the participant, perhaps fewer investment options, but at the same time, they may very well find that the expenses are lower because it's been aggregated with a large pool of dollars. The second is the rollover IRA, either with Principal or another third-party. And then, lastly, is a cash-out, which we think is a bad idea for all the obvious reasons. Again, we come back to mapping what that scenario looks like as people are faced with those decisions. And we think there are going to be necessary disclosure and additional steps that will have to be taken. But, we've got that fairly well triangulated in terms of the impact.","So, we know there's more guidance, there's more education, there's more disclosure. We have a large team of people that are hammering away on this issue. We don't think it's a material change to our run rate related to expenses. And like you we're very anxious about the next 60 days to 90 days to see what OMB produces and back to the DOL and what that might start looking like. And I kept that at a fairly high strategic level. But, with that as a backdrop, I'll throw it over to Nora to see if she's got any additional color.","Nora Mary Everett - President of Retirement and Investor Services and Chairman of Principal Funds","Yeah, just a quick comment. You asked about third-party distribution, and as you well know, our model is hugely diverse. We go across all the channels, all the firms, so we're out there. We actually have a very large group, a team that's been working on this for a number of months doing scenario planning and engaging with our third-party distribution partners. And the one result of those discussions is it's pretty clear to us, and again, we're speculating on a preliminary reg here, but it's pretty clear to us that there's going to be an array of adviser business models coming out of this change if and when this reg becomes final.","Because between ERISA and this new reg what you see is a huge amount of optionality, many exceptions, many exemptions, and so various firms and various advisers and various broker dealers are going to take different routes from our perspective, whether they go the fiduciary route with a third-party advisory service or the non-fiduciary route with a third-party advisory service, whether they use the best interest contract, there's a lot of optionality. What we're doing is working with them and making sure that we're putting the systems in place to be able to service those diverse operating models across our various channels, firms and advisers. And we feel pretty optimistic that at the end of the day somebody like us who's got the scale and the expertise and the discipline to really work channel-by-channel, firm-by-firm, is going to have a really elegant solution to an unbelievably complex set of regulations.","James Patrick McCaughan - President, Global Asset Management and Chief Executive Officer, Principal Global Investors","And can I just add something? It's Jim here. Jim McCaughan. Can I add that with our investment performance and our multi-asset capabilities, if in the market generally platforms find it harder to offer in proprietary products, we have some very strong substitutes there that we can sell into other platforms. We would see this as an opportunity, depending on how it all develops, to expand our defined contribution investment only business.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Very good. Michael, hopefully that helps.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Very good.","Operator","The next question will come from Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks, and good morning. Just one housekeeping item. Terry, forgive me if you said this already, but did you say if you've bought any stock year-to-date; and if so, how much?","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sean, we did not state that. I just said that we had an authorization still outstanding of $75 million. But, I did also say that the valuations are pretty attractive at this point in time, unfortunately, but it does look like there's an outstanding authorization \u2013 we do have an outstanding authorization of $75 million and we'll also talk with the board of directors about any future authorizations that may occur.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then, going back to the DOL but away from fiduciary duty, there's a proposal, I believe it's from the DOL, to allow small employers to pool together to offer 401(k) plans to their employees. Is that a net benefit to PFG or is that a challenge for you guys, because the size of the plans would then be bigger than the SMB kind of niche that you have?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question, Sean. We're actually on the record. We would support that multiple-employer plan model. We have plans in order to support that. The other part that came out of the White House was to provide some additional tax credits and some additional incentives for small-sized to medium-sized employers to adopt a plan. So, I think clearly this is an example where the administration is recognizing that an employer-based retirement approach is the right approach, and delivered through the private sector. So, again, we like seeing those. Now, having said that, I'll have Nora add any additional comments.","Nora Mary Everett - President of Retirement and Investor Services and Chairman of Principal Funds","No, well said. We've been part of the movement to get those two very things on the agenda and we were really pleased to see that come out of the White House a couple of weeks ago.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","The next question will come from the Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. So, the first question's just on the operating environment in the 401(k) business and just your outlook for flows. Obviously, your commentary seemed pretty positive, but withdrawals picked up a lot in the fourth quarter, and you mentioned M&A, but how much of this was because of competition and just competitor behavior on fees and other things?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Jimmy. So, thanks for the question. Nora had commented on those earlier. I'll have her repeat her comments relative to the operating environment and flows and withdrawals and some of the color around that. The M&A environment is always there. But, equally as important to M&A, I think about half of those withdrawals actually were attributable to plan terminations, and that means they just no longer have a plan. And that's going to happen in the small-size to medium-size employer space and you can't be as vibrant as we are in that marketplace and not have a few plans terminate after year two, three, four or maybe five. But, with that, maybe I'll have Nora go ahead and add some additional color.","Nora Mary Everett - President of Retirement and Investor Services and Chairman of Principal Funds","Sure. No doubt, it's competitive. It's always been competitive. What we're seeing in that small to medium business space, the core SMB space for us is that if we actually peel that back on a net cash flow basis for 2015, we were actually well within our beginning of year 1% to 3% net cash flow. So within that space that we've been talking about, stripping out some of the larger plans from a net cash flow perspective, we are proving up that we're extremely competitive. And there are two things going on there. One is we've got tremendous investment performance in that target date suite, and we've got a huge lineup with regard to target date, whether you want primarily passive, whether you want primarily active, whether you want it in a funds form or a CIT form. So, between the choice in the investment performance, we are highly competitive in that space. And then you add to that the fact that we're price competitive, and that's why we're seeing those kind of positive net cash flows year-over-year in that core small to medium business segment of the industry.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Then on group benefits, the margins are pretty good. To what extent do you think that'll sustain? I think your margins, especially in group life and disability were just very strong this quarter.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, what did I tell you? It didn't happen by accident. Deanna and her team have just done a superb job managing that group benefits business. Deanna, some additional comments?","Deanna D. Strable-Soethout - President-US Insurance Solutions","Yeah. I think I'd make a comment. I think you can't just look at the fourth quarter. Obviously, we have some seasonality that makes the margin in the fourth quarter a little bit higher because of dental results. And you're right our Group life loss ratio was probably at an unsustainable level. So I'd say probably if you just look at the fourth quarter margins, probably not sustainable, but I think if you look at the full-year margins, we feel good about those results, and ultimately can see that there's fundamentals that can carry that into 2016.","I think as Dan says, I think the team's done a really, really good job with this business. We had record sales in both group benefits and individual disability record retention, record premium, record earnings. And I think when you look at that relative to some of our peers in this business, I think we really do have the fundamentals to drive not just growth but profitable growth, which is really important in this business. So, hopefully that helps give you a little bit of color on the margin, but I think full-year margin we feel good about that sustaining.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jimmy.","Operator","We have reached the end of the of our Q&A. Mr. Houston, your closing comments please.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, first I'd like to just thank everyone for joining the call today. As I said in the beginning, we felt like we had a very solid quarter. We think we had in overall a good year. We, frankly, are very optimistic about the future. We found 2015 to be challenging in a number of different areas including the headwinds created by the equity markets, sustaining low interest rates, and certainly FX was not playing to our strength in 2015.","2016, as we evaluate it, we think the fundamentals are very strong. We think the strategy is still spot-on. We'll continue to rigorously analyze our capital deployment in interest of long-term shareholders.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference call over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Principal Financial Group's third quarter conference call. As always, materials related to today's call are available on our website at principal.com\/investor. With the annual actuarial assumption review this quarter, we've included 2 additional slides in the earnings call presentation. We've entered a comparison of third quarter operating earnings, excluding significant variances as well as the income statement line item impacts of the 2018 actuarial assumption review and other significant variances.","Following a reading of the safe harbor provision, CEO, Dan Houston; and CFO, Deanna Strable, will deliver some prepared remarks. Then, we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A session include Nora Everett, Retirement and Income Solutions; Luis Vald\u00e9s, Principal International; Amy Friedrich, U.S. Insurance Solutions. While this is certainly not Tim Dunbar's first call, we want to welcome him in his new role as President of Global Asset Management.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The company does not revise or update them to reflect new information, subsequent events or changes in strategy. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed by the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","Additionally, some of the comments made during this conference call may refer to the non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures may be found in our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation.","Before I turn the call over to Dan, I want to extend an invitation to our 2018 Investor Day on the afternoon of Thursday, November 15 in New York City. Our leadership team will highlight future opportunities across our businesses and provide a deeper dive into our accelerated investment and digital strategies. Additionally, our 2019 outlook call will be held on December 3. Dan?","Daniel Houston","Thanks, John, and welcome. This morning, I'll share performance highlights and key accomplishments in helping clients and customers achieve financial security and success. Then, Deanna will provide additional details on financial results, including our significant variances during the quarter and capital deployment.","For the third quarter, we reported $481 million of non-GAAP operating earnings. Excluding the significant variances that Deanna will discuss, non-GAAP operating earnings were $422 million, a 1% increase compared to strong results in the year ago quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $1.6 billion increased 9% from a year ago, reflecting solid net revenue growth, including the accelerated performance fee in the current quarter, ongoing expense discipline and the benefit of U.S. tax reform.","I'd like to highlight the outstanding performance of the U.S. Insurance Solutions. Strong sales and retention and continued discipline drove a double-digit increase in pretax operating earnings over the trailing 12-month period. Beyond these strong results, this segment has a critical role in advancing our small- to medium-sized business strategy and growing our franchise. Though recent growth overall has been muted by our accelerated investment in digital strategies and unfavorable foreign currency translation, our fundamentals and industry opportunities remain intact.","While we're continuing to face increasing fee pressure, particularly in our asset management business in the U.S. retirement business, I'm confident we're taking appropriate steps to combat these pressures, to differentiate the marketplace and to position Principal to continue to deliver above-market growth over the long term.","With $668 billion at quarter end, we've increased assets under management by $12 billion or 2% compared to a year ago. Excluding the previously announced realignment of a real estate investment team within Principal Global Investors and the effect of the exchange rates, AUM would be up $40 billion or 6% compared to a year ago.","Total company net cash flow was modestly positive for the quarter and the trailing 12 months but down from the prior year periods. Retirement and Income Solutions generated $4.8 billion of positive net cash flow over the trailing 12 months. This reflects strong sales in our pension risk transfer and fixed annuity businesses and RIS-Spread and strong sales retention and reoccurring deposits within RIS-Fee.","Despite a soft third quarter, Principal international generated nearly $7 billion of positive net cash flows on a trailing 12-month basis, a 10% increase over the year ago period. We've gained meaningful traction in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong with $2.7 billion and $1 billion of positive net cash flow, respectively, over the trailing 12 months. Combined, these operations have generated net cash flows of 14% of beginning AUM over the trailing 12 months. China also improved over the trailing 12 months with nearly $38 billion of positive net cash flow compared to $12 billion of net outflows in the year ago period. Keep in mind, China is not included in reported net cash flow.","As discussed at our investor event in Tokyo last month, due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, we now anticipate a longer time line to receive approval to participate in the pension opportunity in China. The economic and political uncertainty in Brazil has had an impact on net cash flows as pension deposits across the industry have declined more than 40% through third quarter.","While we expect pressure to continue after the first round of presidential elections on October 7, there was improvement in the Brazilian equity market and strengthening over the Brazilian real. The runoff election 2 days from now should provide further clarity and stability to the political situation.","Over the long term, we remain optimistic about the Brazilian pension and savings market and we remain confident in our joint venture partner, Banco do Brasil and our ongoing ability to maintain our market-leading position.","Principal Global Investors, however, remains under pressure. With PGI source net outflows of $3.7 billion in the third quarter, this was PGI's fourth consecutive quarter of negative net cash flow. The good news, this isn't an investment performance issue. For our Morningstar-rated funds, 80% of the fund-level AUM had a 4- or 5-star rating as of September 30. And as shown on Slide 5, 74%, 68% and 89% of Principal's mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trust were above median for the 1-, 3- and 5-year performance periods, respectively.","Withdrawals as a percentage of beginning of period AUM have remained consistent with our historical averages and are comparable to industry results. The main issue has been deposits, both institutional and retail, and several factors have created some headwinds.","First, demand for lower-cost investment options has continued to become more pronounced. According to Morningstar, there were nearly $400 billion of positive net cash flow for funds and the lowest fee quintile in 2017. Outflows for all other funds have increased fourfold from 2014 to over $400 billion in 2017.","Second, higher interest rates have created headwinds for some of our yield-oriented products. While these continue to perform well, they've garnered less interest. Higher interest rates have also created headwinds for Japanese and European clients with currency hedging cost rising to 250 to 300 basis points.","Lastly, the higher interest rate environment has also led to increased volatility and uncertainty in the equity markets. As the macro environment continues to transition, we're seeing institutional retail clients investing in cash as they wait for some of the volatility to subside.","While there are clearly several contributing issues, we haven't achieved enough sales to offset withdrawals, and we haven't pivoted quickly enough to investments that resonate in a rising interest rate environment. While the context is important, what's more important is what we're doing to turn things around.","As announced last month, Tim Dunbar was promoted to President of Global Asset Management. This role encompasses oversight of all Principal's asset management capabilities, including Principal Global Investors, Principal International investment operations as allowed by regulation, the general account and RobustWealth, our recent digital investment advice acquisition. We've also promoted Pat Halter from Chief Operating Officer of PGI to President and CEO of this segment.","The new structure is designed to further integrate asset management capabilities across the enterprise, expand our investment solutions and make those solutions more accessible to clients around the world, with the ability to better serve retirement, individual and institutional investors.","We've also made key changes to leadership within PGI distribution to create a more focused approach to serving clients around the world, better position us by distribution, channel and client type and work closely with Principal International and its joint venture partners to achieve greater reach and market share.","In addition, we continued to intensify our focus on expanding our suite of lower-cost investment vehicles, including ETFs and CITs, and getting them placed on key third-party distribution platforms. At the same time, we remain committed to enhancing our active investment capabilities to help institutional and retail clients diversify, build wealth, generate income, protect against downside risk and address inflation. We're doing this, for example, through private real estate in Europe, LDI solutions and asset allocation models as well as refreshing a number of existing products.","Additionally, we're increasing our focus on data analytics and technology to advance our investment process and improve our alpha-generating capabilities. We're also realigning certain boutiques to create greater scale and efficiency. Under Tim and Pat's leadership, we're a taking a fresh look at everything to ensure we're appropriately addressing changes in client preferences and executing with a high sense of urgency.","As I'll share in some detail at our upcoming Investor Day, the global asset management opportunity remains exceptional. I'm extremely optimistic about our ability to make the necessary changes to further capitalize on it. That said, we've got a lot of work to do here, and we won't see results overnight.","I'll now share some key execution highlights, starting with our investment platform. In the third quarter, we launched a dozen new funds in Latin America and Asia. Through 9 months, we've launched more than 40 new investment options across our U.S. and international platforms, responding to increasing demand for multi-asset and income-oriented solutions.","I'll also share a couple of new launches for RIS and USIS. Our new Principal Milestones programs helps retirement plan participants access comprehensive financial education resources. In addition to investment and benefits planning, our new platform helps employees improve financial literacy, minimize financial stress and reach personal goals through an in-depth online assessment.","As an aside, I attended our institutional client conference 2 weeks ago and spoke directly with many of our largest U.S. retirement clients. They were excited about the ongoing advancements in our education resources and digital capabilities and pleased with our value proposition overall, including our retirement investment platform, Total Retirement Suite, My Virtual Coach enrollment platform and use of best practice plan design.","Within USIS, we've expanded our consumer engagement platform, My Principal Lifestyle. The program is focused on health and financial wellness through a mobile app that rewards insurance customers for setting and reaching physical and financial goals. In addition to encouraging healthy behaviors and providing value in people's daily lives, we're also strengthening our customer relationships.","Moving to distribution. We continue to get our investment options added to third-party platforms' recommended list and model portfolios with over 40 new placements during the third quarter. Over the trailing 12 months, we've earned nearly 100 total placements over 40 different offerings on more than 30 different platforms. We continue to have success across asset classes and we're gaining meaningful traction with our ETFs and CIT options. Ant Financial continues to stand out as an exceptional growth platform for CCB-Principal Asset Management, our joint venture with China Construction Bank.","In a single quarter, we increased both the number of our clients and AUM by more than 20%, reaching $3.7 million investors and $7.7 billion of AUM as of the quarter end. While revenues and earnings from the platform is currently modest, I'm confident it will continue to grow and continue to provide our joint venture exposure to millions of users.","In closing, I'd like to highlight 4 points: continued strong execution of our customer-focused, solutions-oriented strategy and an appropriate balance between investments in growth and expense discipline, the effect of our shareholder capital as well as meaningful advancement of our brand. We have our challenges, but we also go forward from a position of strength and with a willingness to drive change throughout the organization to position Principal for long-term success. Deanna?","Deanna Strable","Thanks, Dan. Good morning, and thanks for participating on our call. Today, I'll discuss our third quarter financial results and provide an update on capital deployment.","Net income attributable to Principal was $456 million for third quarter 2018, including net realized capital losses of $25 million with immaterial credit losses. Reported non-GAAP operating earnings were $481 million in third quarter or $1.67 per diluted share, an increase of 29% and 30%, respectively, over the prior year quarter.","Year-over-year earnings growth benefited from record earnings in PGI, driven by the accelerated real estate performance fee, strong underlying business fundamentals and a favorable equity market. These benefits were partially offset by volatile foreign currency exchange rates and our accelerated investment in digital strategies.","As shown on Slide 6, we had 3 significant variances during third quarter that had a $65 million net positive impact to reported non-GAAP pretax operating earnings. The significant variances included a negative $44 million impact as a result of the annual assumption review, primarily in Brazil; an $86 million benefit in PGI that includes the accelerated real estate performance fee, which is partially offset by elevated expenses and a $23 million benefit from higher-than-expected variable investment income. As a reminder, in the year ago quarter, the assumption review was the only significant variance, and it negatively impacted reported non-GAAP pretax operating earnings by $66 million.","The most significant drivers of this year's assumption review were due to experience\/assumption changes and model refinement, including experience adjustments in Brasilprev, primarily reflecting lower expected recurring deposits and fees as well as an update to our premium payment assumptions in Individual Life, and model refinements in Brasilprev and variable annuities in RIS-Fee. These items were partially offset by higher U.S. interest rates relative to what was assumed a year ago.","The assumption review negatively impacted total company non-GAAP operating earnings by $22 million after tax and positively impacted net income by $32 million. The positive net income impact was driven by a net realized capital gain from the variable annuity model refinement. Additionally, the assumption review had an immaterial impact on statutory results.","Looking forward, we expect the assumption review will negatively impact Principal International's pretax operating earnings by $5 million per quarter for the next several quarters with the diminishing impact thereafter. The run rate impacts for the other businesses are negligible.","During the quarter, we agreed to a realignment of a real estate investment team in PGI, resulting in an accelerated performance fee with a net $101 million benefit to pretax operating earnings. The team created an effective investment strategy and executed on behalf of the client for over 20 years.","In addition to the earnings impact, $9 billion of AUM transferred with the team. This transaction is not expected to have a material impact on management fees and pretax operating earnings going forward. $15 million of elevated expenses in PGI partially offset this performance fee in large part due to employee-related costs from several strategic staffing changes during the quarter. $23 million of higher-than-expected variable investment income was driven by real estate sales and higher income from alternative investments, partially offset by lower prepayment fees. ","As shown on Slide 6. Excluding significant variances in both periods, total company non-GAAP operating earnings increased 1% or 4% per diluted share over strong earnings in the year ago quarter. ROE, excluding AOCI, other than foreign currency translation adjustment was 14.3% on a reported basis for the third quarter. Excluding the impact from the assumption reviews, ROE was 14.5%.","The non-GAAP operating earnings effective tax rate, excluding significant variances, was 20.1% for the third quarter. Despite volatility on a quarterly basis, we continue to expect the full year to be within our previously guided range of 18% to 21%.","Macroeconomics were volatile during the quarter. Favorable U.S. equity market performance had a positive impact on our U.S. fee-based businesses. The S&P 500 daily average increased more than 5% during the quarter, relative to our assumed 2% total return per quarter.","A weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Brazil, Chile and China, negatively impacted Principal International's pretax operating earnings by about $6 million compared to second quarter 2018 and $10 million relative to third quarter of 2017. Actual encaje performance was in line with our expectations.","Mortality and morbidity were within our expectations and provided a slight benefit to both Individual Life and Specialty Benefits. In RIS-Spread, we did experience a mortality loss, as is typical in the third quarter, but a slight improvement from third quarter 2017.","Moving to segment results. The fundamentals of our businesses remained strong. In our U.S. segment, our small- to medium-sized business target market remains healthy. In RIS-Fee, deposits were up more than $3 billion over the trailing 12 months with 13% growth in transfer deposits and 7% growth in recurring deposits. And we've added more than 1,100 net new Defined Contribution plans and nearly 200,000 Defined Contribution participants with account values from a year ago.","RIS-Spread sales increased nearly 40% from the prior year quarter, including $1.2 billion of pension risk transfer sales and $1 billion of fixed annuity sales. Heading into the fourth quarter, the RIS-Spread pipeline remains strong.","Specialty Benefits sales increased 9% due to strong sales in our core SMB market. On a trailing 12-month basis, in-group growth or life covered in existing cases increased a record 2% with even stronger growth in our small case target market.","Individual Life sales increased 13% on strong business market sales. In addition to providing earnings diversification and with strategic importance of these businesses overall, in third quarter alone, our affiliated businesses generated $2 billion of positive net cash flow for PGI through the general account.","In my following comments on business unit results for the quarter, I'll exclude the significant variances we've called out in both periods. Slide 6 provides a comparison of business unit pretax operating earnings, excluding significant variances for third quarter 2018 and the prior year quarter.","Pretax operating earnings for RIS-Fee, PGI, Specialty Benefits and Individual Life were all in line with or exceeded our expectations for third quarter. Principal International's pretax operating earnings were also in line, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. RIS-Spread's pretax operating earnings of $83 million reflects slight mortality losses, typical in the third quarter, as well as higher non-deferrable sales-related expenses.","Corporate pretax operating losses of $32 million were lower than our expected run rate due to a positive outcome from negotiations with the IRS on prior years' income taxes. As a result, for the full year, we expect corporate losses to be slightly favorable compared to our guidance of $190 million to $210 million. It's important to note that on an after-tax basis, corporate losses were in line with our expectations as income taxes offset the pretax benefit.","Moving to capital deployment on Slide 14. We deployed $216 million of capital during the third quarter, including $151 million in common stock dividends and $65 million in share repurchases. This brings our year-to-date capital deployment to just over $1 billion. We expect full year deployments will be at the high end of our $900 million to $1.3 billion range.","Last night, we announced a $0.54 common stock dividend payable in the fourth quarter, the 11th consecutive increase in our dividends. This is a $0.01 increase from the third quarter 2018 dividend and a 10% increase from the prior year period. This translates into a dividend yield of approximately 4%. We continue to target a 40% dividend payout ratio, and going forward, our dividend will be more aligned with net income.","As highlighted on previous calls, M&A is an important part of our balanced capital deployment strategy and the pipeline remains active. Integration of our recent acquisitions is progressing well. The Mexico Afore transaction, Principal Real Estate Europe and our joint venture in Southeast Asia all contributed positively to results during the quarter.","Our accelerated digital investments remain on track and in line with the impact communicated at last year's outlook call. Excluding the impacts of the accelerated real estate performance fee in PGI, growth in total company operating expenses is in line with our expectations. Looking ahead to fourth quarter, I want to remind you that our fourth quarter operating expenses are typically higher than other quarters as we usually see more branding expenses, benefit costs and variable sales expenses.","Our estimated risk-based capital ratio remains above 450%, well above our target range of 415% to 425%. This puts us in a very strong position to absorb the NAIC's change to the risk-based capital formula to reflect tax reform. We continue to estimate a negative 40 to 50 percentage point impact to our ratio from this change.","Our capital and liquidity position remains very strong. We ended the third quarter with over $1 billion at the holding company, $500 million of capital in excess of a 420% RBC ratio and over $450 million of available cash in our subsidiaries. In addition, a low leverage ratio and no debt maturities until 2022 provides a significant financial flexibility.","We hope you can join us at our Investor Day in New York on November 15 and on our 2019 outlook call on December 3.","Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill.","John Barnidge","The fee rate was the highest level pro forma for the performance fee since 4Q '16. Clearly, the assets coming in are higher fee-generating than the assets leaving. Can you talk about what those higher fee-generating products are and what you can do to grow that?","Daniel Houston","Thanks for the question, and we'll throw that right over to Tim Dunbar to respond to.","Timothy Dunbar","Yes. I think what you're looking at is that our basis points for AUM is really up on the quarter, and I think that's a factor of 2 things. One is what we talked about before is that we're seeing our clients interested in our really higher-value products, our yield-oriented products and that continues to be the case. But I think another important impact is that the PE fee, performance fee and the $9.2 billion of assets under management that went out the door were actually very low management fees. Most of the value of that arrangement came from performance fees that was over 20-year relationships. Those performance fees were paid out every 10 years. And so you'll see a very large performance fee based on what the team was able to accomplish over that last 10 years and period of time. So probably want to take credit for the good work that the team did. The assets going out the door really have a low fee, and that's a large part of what brought those basis points up.","John Barnidge","And then a follow-up. On flows and PGI, it seems that's definitely more of a deposit than a withdrawal issue. The withdrawal rate is actually down from last year, which tells me it's about finding the next product that's really in demand. Do you have thoughts around that? And maybe can you talk about your ESG product offering, interest in M&A to drive that and then maybe more rational multiples given where asset management multiples have fallen in the public market this year?","Daniel Houston","Yes. Good question, John. Let me just maybe make a couple of quick comments. I was just fortunate enough to be with our sales organization, along with Pat and Tim, in Miami earlier this week, having this exact same conversation. They are eager to engage with management about these opportunities, and Tim will get into that in more detail. But I did want to make a comment as it related specifically to ESG. That's not new to Principal. We've been around this topic all way back to the early '90s. As a matter of fact, it was my first assignments from Ron Keller when joining the investment committee. We understand the importance of that. There's certainly been a lot of momentum that's been gaining in the last five years, and we've been participating in that. Obviously, Europe is probably a good five years ahead of where we're at here in the U.S. I think our culture here at Principal aligns well with it, and we are frankly, we think, in a very good position, both -- and I'll ask Tim to add some additional detail. Tim?","Timothy Dunbar","Okay. So I'll try to take your questions as you asked them. So John, one of the things that we're seeing in the macro environment is this move toward higher interest rates, and Dan mentioned that a little bit in his remarks. And so I'm not going into a lot of detail there. But also what we're seeing is a lot of geopolitical uncertainty. And those 2 issues together are creating quite a lot of volatility in the marketplace today. And so that's having an impact on our flows in a couple of different ways and I think really on the market. One of the things that we're seeing is that a lot of our clients and a lot of investors are actually sitting on the sideline today. So they're sitting in cash and waiting for a better time to enter in the market. A lot has been said about equity prices being particularly high. Hopefully, this pullback means that it's a better entry point for some of those who we start to see some of that move. We do have a really robust pipeline of mandates. But then when we have about $5.5 billion of mandates that are sitting in that bucket, and they are taking longer to fund as we work through the issues and I think they see the volatility in the market, they're not quite as eager to put their money to work. The other thing I'd say is that, and we've seen this in a PEC situation but a couple of other real estate clients, as there's more volatility in the marketplace, they see very robust pricing in private equity commercial real estate. And so a few of those players are taking some of the chips off the table. And really, we think that's the right thing to do for clients.","So those are all -- some of the things that have impacted our flows today and some of the things that we think will turn around. In terms of products, we actually have a broad suite of well-diversified products, and we have a lot of products that do work in today's environment. I think what Dan had said is actually quite correct. We need to make sure that the PGI organization moves quicker to pivot to those products when macro environment changes occur, and we're working with them to do that. So just to go through a few things that we've done so far, and you've seen some of this, October 2, we announced the realignment of the distribution organization. So Tim Hill will be leading U.S. -- all of U.S. distribution for us. Kirk West will be leading all non-U.S. distribution. And while I'm not going to go into their resumes, those are 2 very seasoned investment professionals. We have all the confidence in the world that they will have the focus and they will have the support they need to make sure that we turn this net cash flow situation around. Another thing you probably don't know is that we've made a couple of key hires to improve our talent, both on the marketing side and the institutional distribution side of things.","We've also realigned our global client service team. All of that to make sure that we're communicating well with clients, that we're building the relationships we need to, that we're understanding really what their needs and what their investment -- what investment options resonate with them. So in our product development efforts, we are building the products that they desire and that obviously meet their needs. That's our #1 focus as we move forward. I'm going to go on and talk just about a couple of other things we've done just to give you a sense for some of the things we accomplished in the first, what, 5 weeks that Pat and I have been at the helm. We've also taken a broad look at our investment capabilities. And what we deduced is that we have an incredibly talented group of investment professionals that offer diverse set of products, and they're actually producing some excellent investment results. And Dan talked about that as well in his comments.","Of course, there's always -- there are always areas where we can improve and some of our digital investments really goes to that. So our official intelligence, really making sure that we are simulating the data appropriately and disseminating that to our investment boutiques. As we look through that and we look where we're headed, we've taken the opportunity to realign talent in some of our boutiques, fixed income, Principal portfolio strategies and real estate, just to name a few, and we've also looked at the capabilities that we're offering. And we've made the decision to close down our active macro currency space. We just don't see the need for that with our clients going forward and that, that particular capability is resonating with them. So in fourth quarter, you're going to see about $1.8 billion show up on our operation dispose line, but I want to stress that, that will be OE neutral. That won't have a negative impact on our operating earnings. I will mention, we did retain our passive currency capabilities and we do see a lot of client interest in that. So as you can see, we've taken a lot of actions to really focus the organization. And your last question, I'm going to try to cover here quickly, is ESG. First of all, we have scored A+, which is the highest score for the UN Principles for Responsible Investing. And in ESG, as Dan said, we've been at this for quite some time. We really approached this from three perspectives. ","The first is to create actual funds that are ESG focused, and we've done an excellent job of that in the real estate area. We've developed two, what we call green real estate funds that have been very successful, both -- and then funds that have had very good returns and very good client response. And we also have 10 funds with very high Morningstar suitability ratings, and those resonates very well with clients. The second approach is really negative screening mandates. So think of these as socially responsible investing mandates where we screen out the issues that are particular to that investment client. And we have about $12.5 billion of assets under management in those efforts. And then really, the last is to integrate ESG issues into our investment process. And really, we've done that throughout most of our boutiques. All of them understand that companies that have good ESG ratings are likely to outperform, and that's definitely part of our security selection. So hopefully, I covered your points and those help answer the questions.","Daniel Houston","John, did you want some additional detail?","Operator","The next question comes from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Just to follow up on PGI a little more. So obviously, the past couple of quarters, there are some -- the overhang on some of the kind of foreign currency -- I mean, foreign institution investors kind of taking money off the table because of higher hedging costs. But I think more recently, there are some of the institutional investors that have been using that strategy, have talked about willing to go unhedged on some of the kind of U.S. bond investments. I was just wondering if Tim have seen anything kind of when talking to clients or a change of appetite despite the higher hedging cost for some of these products?","Daniel Houston","Yes, Humphrey. Thanks for the question. Ironically enough, Tim and I were just traveling together within the last 3 weeks in Japan, visiting with some of our largest clients and some of our largest investors, as you know, and we had our investor conference there. But Tim, you had an opportunity to sit down directly with some of our largest clients and speak specifically to this issue. Do you want to provide some insights there?","Timothy Dunbar","Sure, Humphrey. I think the answer to your question is it really depends on the clients and it depends on what they're investing for. I would tell you that we talked about a large mandate that we had for an investment grade of about $3 billion, that is still outstanding and I would say, is still at risk. What we've seen in that situation is that the hedging costs have gone up to -- from 250 basis points to almost 300 basis points. And so if you were an asset liability manager client, you probably don't want to go unhedged and that cost becomes very real and very dear to them for especially an investment-grade mandate. But it does depend on the client and it depends on the risks that they're willing to take. So one of the things, I would say, in meeting with that particular client, we have an excellent relationship with them. We are trying to understand exactly how we can help them more, and we actually have sold other mandates to them, which resonate very well, are more yield oriented and are meeting their needs appropriately. So hopefully, that answers your question.","Humphrey Lee","That's helpful. And then maybe shifting gears a little bit to Principal International. In your prepared remarks, you've talked about some of the headwinds you're seeing in Brazil. But like I was just wondering if you can kind of broadly talk about the rest of the countries that you have exposure to. Like what are you seeing from a macro perspective? And how do you think about the potential impact to your operations there?","Daniel Houston","Yes. Thanks, Humphrey. You know what, I reflect on that portfolio of businesses around the world. It's just interesting to me to see how uncorrelated they can be because as you know, we're enjoying a lot of success in Southeast Asia, generating very positive earnings and very nice cash flows. And then we can get them over to Latin America and see the pressure on our Brazilian operations. No one's better positioned to talk about Brazil than these other operations. And Luis felt this, so I'll ask him to provide some additional color.","Luis Vald\u00e9s","Okay. Thanks, Humphrey. Good question. We continue, as I said, in the last -- in our last earnings call, we continue -- very positive about Brazil, particularly now. I mean, from a macro perspective, what I said to you is that Brazil, from a macro perspective, is fixable. The problem that Brazil has is not like other sort of emerging countries. They do have a fiscal problem, which is fixable. Particularly, we are going to see what is going to happen with the elections that are coming this weekend. But we are under a cyclical rebound -- possible rebound now in Brazil. Probably, we're going to see some good news about growth quarter-over-quarter. Probably, we're going to see quarter-over-quarter about 1%, which is not that big but is a pretty interesting rebound and year-over-year, probably over 2% job creation. That's been positive in the last quarter for Brazil.","And again, if you're looking at their external accounts, very positive; their reserve, very positive. And if you're looking at their -- as I'm saying, their external position is also very positive. So we think that it's fixable. We are confident that whoever is going to be the next president in the next administration, they're going to do a good work in order to stabilize, elevate their fiscal deficit. And the only thing that -- or the major thing that they have to do in order to stabilize their macro is to go through a very sort of patient reform that's going to certainly benefit to companies like us and Brasilprev that were -- are long-term savings providers and certainly, pension providers in that country. So that's our particular view. It's been very difficult years for Brazil, probably the most difficult years from a macroeconomic standpoint of view and political point of view in many, many decades. But having said that, if you could see in the trailing 12 months, our franchise has been able to put $3.1 billion in positive net customer cash flows. So it's a very commendable 5% DOP over AUMs, and we certainly will remain very confident. So that's my answer. And again, we continue very positive about the macroeconomics and demographics and the never-ending need to save more for -- to really secure their financial security. So those are my views about Brazil, Humphrey.","Daniel Houston","I think Humphrey is maybe looking for a little more color, Luis, in some of the other countries as well. So maybe a couple of comments on some of the big ones quickly, something perhaps around Chile and some of what's happening in Asia quickly.","Luis Vald\u00e9s","Okay, Humphrey. Let me go with agile comments about our countries in Lat Am, particularly Chile. Chile has had a very interesting positive and very important positive -- and swing in terms of its execution. You could see in your supplement, and if you're looking, the net customer cash flow trailing 12 months, it's a $1.7 billion positive swing in net customer cash flows. And I will say that Chile is doing extremely much better. They have more sales. They're gaining more clients. They're investing in new technologies. They're investing in new CRMs. They're putting more money in digital. They're connecting better with their clients. You could see, even if you're going into your supplement, if you're going to Page 22, you will see that their revenue stream is a positive story. So they do have a positive story in their revenue stream, about 5% adjusted. But it seems to me that they're -- that is a very good story. You have to remember that Chile is a very interesting platform with de-accumulation, accumulation and payout products. So when you're looking -- the total net customer cash flows, the aggregation of all those business together and what we have been able to see, it is that swing dimension to you first, $1.7 billion, but also because probably, the overhang of a low cycle -- probably, we have been able to see more payout solutions.","So more money going into outcome solutions for our clients, but essentially, that's what we have been able to see. We have positive flows in terms of customers during this year. And I have said to you also, we have positive flows in terms of AUMs. That's my view about Chile. Asia, while Asia is a totally different story, very positive story for this year. You heard about our net customer cash flows in China, $4 billion and -- for the last quarter for Mainland China, and $1 billion trailing 12 months for Hong Kong and very positive net customer cash flows for Southeast Asia. So this is a franchise and this is a very interesting portfolio, which is working extremely well, very well diversified, and we're very pleased about how these different countries and different assets are working in our favor.","Daniel Houston","Thanks, Luis, and thank you for the question, Humphrey.","Operator","The next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore.","Thomas Gallagher","Just a quick question on, if we step back for a minute, the asset management business. So from what I've heard, it's a bit of you guys benefited from the low rate environment for a while. And now that we're moving into a different macro environment, you feel like you need to reposition things. Can you talk a bit about how you're thinking about restructuring and the -- how long you think the transition takes to kind of reposition yourself in terms of PGI?","Daniel Houston","Yes. Thanks, Tom, for the question. I suspect it's not as much about restructuring as refocusing and pivoting within a lot of the strategies, starting with our sales organizations and working closely with our portfolio managers and our strategists. But Tim, do you want to take that one?","Timothy Dunbar","Sure. You're right. I mean, we had seen a lot of sales coming from several specific products, not all from yield oriented, but preferred securities, global diversified income. We're in certainly two of those. And I think actually yield is not dead. And while it's taking a pause, as interest rates move higher, I think we have a lot of clients that are still interested in yield, and the desire and the demand for those products will come back. Having said that, in an environment where interest rates are increasing, even though there's volatility, that's usually a sign of a robust economy. And generally, I'd say that's supporting for -- supportive for earnings of companies and stocks. And so equity markets are a place that we'd say a lot of folks want to be. We have some very good equity products, mid-cap, small-cap, blue chip is very good, income-oriented products that we think resonate really well. I'd also say that we have a good suite of short-duration fixed income products. So as you're thinking about the volatility with interest rates moving up, short-duration fixed income is an obvious place that you might want to go. Absolute re-term products have been increasing in interest. We have Finisterre emerging market long-short group that's developed some nice products there and have some good performance. And that's another space that we think we can make progress in and actually have been making good progress in. And then we -- the one thing that I think we are really strong at, I know really we're strong at is when we think about our Principal portfolio of strategies. So a diversified group of asset allocation products that can resonate for 401(k) platforms and resonate actually with our Principal International operations around the world. And those are things that we're continuing to develop and build out and get out the door.","Thomas Gallagher","That does, yes. And then just one other question on asset management. I know -- my understanding is when certain -- in certain instances, when senior people within asset management organizations leave, there's going to be certain amount of customers that may have to reevaluate due -- further due diligence on that relationship. Is -- given Jim's departure, is there any way to think about whether there will be that kind of impact on PGI?","Daniel Houston","Yes. So thanks for the question. The first thing I want to say is thanks to Jim for his many years of contributions here at the Principal. He just did an extraordinary job for the organization. We're fortunate that he was here. Secondly, we have been out to visit the consulting firms, our largest clients, our distribution partners. And frankly, it did not raise the status of a need to do a search or to pause or to do anything differently than what they're doing. That's certainly, what you had described, Tom, very true when it gets down to portfolio managers and senior analysts. And as you very well know that our -- even our economics committee, which is made up of roughly a dozen professionals around the organization, Jim was one of those dozens, and we don't have a system or a star manager or a one-view top-down CIOs sort of macro view that says this is where interest rates are going or this is how we feel about currencies and so forth. So again, it's a testament, I think, to the structure that was built, which isn't overly dependent on any one person, but rather spread across a team of individuals. So hopefully, that helps answer that question for you, Tom.","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Deanna, you mentioned the higher seasonal expenses in the fourth quarter. Can you give us some more perspective on how to think about that because I think when we go back to last year, you had very favorable expenses for the first 3 quarters and a bit of a catch-up in the fourth quarter as I assume that would -- maybe more weighted to the fourth quarter than normal. So if you could help us think about some sizing of how much that could shift a bit here?","Daniel Houston","Yes, it seems to be a pattern there. You're breaking up just a little bit, but I think she got the full question. Thanks.","Deanna Strable","Yes. So on the prepaid amounts, I did mention a reminder around fourth quarter expenses being higher. I would say and agree with what you said that the pattern in 2017 was abnormal, so I wouldn't use that as the kind of trend to go off of. But if you went back to '14 and '15 and '16, what you would see is that if you look at total expenses, you would see that fourth quarter tends to come in about 5% to 8% higher. And I think that would be a good trending to look at when you look at 2018. I think the one thing you'd have to do is, as you know, the PGI, a lot of that significant variance in third quarter did run through the expenses, so you'd want to normalize for that and then ultimately kind of look at that 5% to 8% trend. The other thing, I would say, is unlike 2017, we have been seeing each quarter expenses to kind of be right at what we would've expected, so I don't think we'll have that timing impact that did help drive the fourth quarter '17 expenses to be outside that normal trend. Hopefully, that helps.","Ryan Krueger","Yes, very helpful. And then as a separate question, you had very strong retention in RIS-Fee this quarter. Could you provide some additional color on what you saw there?","Daniel Houston","Yes. I'd say first, thanks for noticing because it's a very concerted effort to regain our clients. And it's also worth noting that we had very strong recurring deposits. It's a reminder of just how strong of a franchise that is. But Nora, do you want to provide some additional color on retention?","Nora Everett","Sure. Yes, we had a -- thanks, Ryan. We had a very strong quarter on both ends, which pushed that net cash flow up, really strong deposits, transfer deposits, recurring deposits. Whether you look at it at a -- on a trailing 12-month basis or just 3Q, it's a really strong number and reflects both our work and obviously, the economy and in particular, the SMB market. With regard to lapse, it was a very strong quarter with regard to retention. And again, and we said this both when it's up and it's down, it's really important to take a 12-month view. Quarter-to-quarter, any of these stats can be a little bit noisy, so I would encourage you to continue to take that trailing 12-month view. But even when you do that, we have a very strong retention stat there. And that, you can put that against a lot of things.","Our service model, satisfaction with a strong performance in our target date suite. We have a service model that touches both at the plan sponsor level and also at the participant level. And I can tell you that more and more plan sponsors are really focused at the experience for their participant, and we're leading in a lot of places with regard to that experience. And it's nice to see that conversation really starting to pivot to looking at retirement readiness and understanding how the experience we can provide to their participant is a very personalized experience, can really help drive the end game for them. And so that's been an increasing piece of the conversation. I think all of those things wrap into this stat that says we're able to keep these clients and keep them for long periods of time. Dan mentioned the institutional client conference. I was down there with Dan as well, and we're sitting with clients who have been with literally 20, 30, in some cases, 40 years. So it really resonates, and we take a lot of pride in that.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Kligerman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman","First question is with regard to the digital investment. So as I looked at RIS and PGI, it looked like top line growth was low to mid-single digits, but the earnings were kind of flattish to down, and it looks like it was primarily or in large part, digital investment. So my question is, could you highlight 1 or 2 of the digital investments that you've made and the kind of impact? And then the second part is what can we expect next year in terms of the year-over-years on digital expenses?","Daniel Houston","Yes. And really appreciate the question, Andrew. And As you know, from the comments that John made to kick things off, we're very much looking forward to discussing this in a lot more detail with you on November 15 for our Investor Day when we can do specific case studies. But out of respect for everyone's time, I'm going to ask Deanna just to give a little bit of color and then really dig into that question on the 15th. Deanna?","Deanna Strable","Yes. So just one of the things I would remind is if you're just comparing expenses in third quarter of '17 to third quarter of '18, I want to remind you of something I just said, we had very low expenses in third quarter of '17. And so that plays into the comparison. And in addition, we do have the digital investment that's impacting our expenses in '18. That's spread across all of those businesses, but the 2 businesses that you did discuss does have some of that. And so want to -- so I would say that, really, it's a third quarter '17 issue as well as a third quarter '18. But if you kind of take out all the noise, even when you look at third quarter, our adjusted expense growth is tracking right with our adjusted revenue growth. So I think we're doing a good job of managing those expenses while still investing in the business. And just in total, I would say that our digital spend this year is right on track with what we would have expected and the impact that it's having to our operating earnings growth. And that those -- we'll still have those expenses in 2019, but we'll start to have some of the benefits to offset it. So with that, I'll hold you off until our Investor Day in November because I think we're going to give a lot more detail both on what we're actually doing, how that will impact us going forward as well as some of the expense expectations as well.","Daniel Houston","Andrew, can you wait and do you have another follow-up for us?","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Houston, your closing comments, please?","Daniel Houston","Well, the first thing I would say to everyone who called in, thanks for doing so and we apologize. We know there were number of individuals in the queue, which we did not have a chance to answer your questions. John will follow up accordingly and respond to those questions, so we apologize. We were probably a little long-winded in some of our responses but felt it was important we tell a very important story as we go through the transition.","Secondly, we're going to continue to stay focused on our customers, invest for growth. We're going to eliminate expense that's not additive, and that's something that all the divisional presidents and other leaders are pursuing. Also, again, we're very proud of the deployment of capital. We'll continue to be judicious in how we deploy capital on behalf of our long-term shareholders. And I said -- as I said earlier, we look forward to seeing many of you on November 15 for the Investor Day in New York City. So have a wonderful weekend. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

There will be a question and answer period after the speakers have completed their prepared remarks. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Principal Financial Group's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As always our earnings release, financial supplement and slides related to today's call are available on our website at www.principal.com\/investor.","Following a reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO, Larry Zimpleman; and CFO, Terry Lillis, will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A are Dan Houston, Retirement and Investor Services and U.S. Insurance Solutions; Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors; Luis Valdes, Principal International; and Tim Dunbar, our Chief Investment Officer.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The company does not revise them or update them to reflect new information, subsequent events or changes in strategy. Risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Before we get to the prepared remarks, I'd like to announce that on the afternoon of September 12, we will host an investor event to provide an update on our Retirement Investor Services business. That will be held in New York City. We will provide more details in the next few weeks. We are planning subsequent investor events including an update on our Asset Management Business in New York City, an update on Principal International that will be held in Santiago, Chile. We hope that many of you are able to attend these events. Now I will turn the call over to Larry.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Thanks, John, and welcome to everyone on the call. As usual, I'll comment on three areas. First, I'll discuss second quarter and year-to-date results. Second, I'll provide an update on the continued successful execution and long-term benefits of our strategy; and I'll close with some comments on capital management.","As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are on our website. As you can see on Slide 4, that Principal had another strong quarter resulting in record results and a great first half of the year.","Total company operating earnings were a record $323 million in second quarter 2014, a 19% increase over the year ago quarter. Year-to-date operating earnings of $640 million were up 27% over the same period last year. This continued earnings growth demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our diversified business model. Our businesses face continued macroeconomic volatility, we remained focus on executing our strategy and maintaining expense discipline in order to capitalize on the momentum that\u2019s been building for the last several years.","Principal achieved a major milestone during the second quarter as assets under management surpassed $0.5 trillion. Total company assets under management were a record at $518 billion at the end of the quarter as a result of total company net cash flows of $5.5 billion for the quarter and strong investment performance.","With multiple growth engines and an established track record as a global investment management leader, we look toward achieving $1 trillion in assets under management in five to seven years.","Following our additional key growth metrics from the quarter, Full Service Accumulation sales were $1.4 billion in the second quarter. Second quarter sales tend to be the lowest results for the year and we expect full year 2014 sales to be in line with 2013 levels.","Principal Fund\u2019s sales were $4.7 billion for the quarter. Net cash flows were strong at $1.8 billion, and as a percentage of our block continue to outpace the industry. This is Principal Fund\u2019s 18th straight quarter of positive net cash flows reflecting strong investment performance and our ability to offer solutions that financial advisors and retail investors seek.","Principal Global Investors ended the second quarter with record assets under management of $307 billion including record unaffiliated assets under management of $114 billion. Principal International had record assets under management of $119 billion at the end of the second quarter.","As a testament to the power of our emerging market strategy, assets under management in Latin America surpassed $100 billion in the quarter. Quarterly net cash flows for Principal International were a record $4.3 billion, driven primarily by improved investor sentiment and strong sales in Brazil.","Individual Life\u2019s business market focus continues to be a differentiator for us with 55% of second quarter sales coming from non-qualified deferred compensation and business owner and executive solutions.","Second quarter sales increased 11% over second quarter 2013 excluding the intentional slowdown of Universal Life with secondary guarantee sales. Specialty benefits premium and fees increased 6% over second quarter 2013 as a result of $62 million in sales and strong persistency.","Across the company, we continue to win and retain business as a result of our innovative products and services and through our diversified distribution platform. We remain confident about our competitive positioning across the globe and our ability to continue to grow our businesses into the future.","Next, I\u2019ll provide a few updates on the continued execution of our strategy. The need for our products and services is greater than ever with an aging worldwide population, a growing number of people in the middle-class in emerging markets and a shortfall of retirement savings among workers.","We remain committed to helping business owners, individuals and investors around the world, achieve financial security and success. In full service accumulation, our key differentiators like Principal Total Retirement Suite and innovative plan design features such as Principal Plan Works which focuses on retirement readiness for each participant, continue to position us as a retirement leader in the US.","We have the ability to impact more than 4 million participants, for their employers and advisors to help them take action to secure their financial futures. The work we do is meaningful and is making a difference. It\u2019s something we never lose sight of. World-class customer satisfaction continues to be a differentiator as indicated by our US retirement customers in a recent Chatham Partners\u2019 survey.","Overall satisfaction with the Principal continues to be strong with 97% of clients reporting satisfaction with their client service team and that they plan to maintain or increase their relationship with the Principal.","While a lot of focus is given to sales results, in our view, retention is just as or even more important. Retaining clients and account value where we have already incurred upfront installation expenses have an understanding of how much ongoing work is involved with the client and have built the relationship with key personnel is more beneficial to the bottom-line than new sales.","Just to put some numbers on this, our year-to-date client level retention in full-service accumulation is 98%, 100 basis points better than our average over the last five years. This translates to $1.6 billion of additional account value that we have retained this year. This improved retention has a meaningful impact on our ability to grow operating earnings.","As Slide 5 shows, investment performance remains very strong and is a leading indicator of growth for our retirement and investment management businesses. The percent of Principal Funds in the top half of Morningstar rankings on a 1, 3 and 5 year basis are 79%, 88% and 89% respectively which is one of our most competitive performances ever.","Principal Funds continues to gain market share as a result of strong investment performance in asset classes that are in demand. 60% of Principal Fund assets are in 4 and 5 stars Morningstar rated funds. This has helped Principal Funds become the 15th largest advisor sold fund family up four spots in the last 12 months.","In Principal International, our leading position in Latin America, not only allows us to reach millions of people needing our retirement expertise and product solutions, but also provides us an opportunity to have a seat at the table with policy makers.","Newly elected Chilean President, Michelle Bachelet recently visited the US and attended a Chamber of Commerce event in Washington DC. I was fortunate enough to be one of four CEOs to meet privately with Ms. Bachelet to discuss topics such as tax and pension reform in Chile.","In addition, Principal International\u2019s senior management recently presented their recommendations to the Bravo Commission, a group of global pension experts appointed by the Chilean government to evaluate the current Chilean pension system. We feel confident that any potential reform will help not hinder our efforts to further improve retirement security for the people of Chile.","In addition to growth in the mandatory pension fund market in Chile, voluntary sales continue to gain traction and voluntary net cash flows were up three folds in Cuprum over the prior year quarter.","The Principal\u2019s ability to offer both mandatory and voluntary solutions in Chile gives us a competitive advantage. Our partnership with Banco Brasil contributes to our leadership position in Latin America as well.","As Brasilprev continues to be a focal point or Banco\u2019s subsidiary public company BB Seguridade. BB Seguridade provides an excellent way to understand the performance of our joint venture in Brazil. Banco\u2019s powerful distribution channel combined with our retirement expertise will continue to drive our long-term leadership position in Latin America.","As an example, Brasilprev accounted for 65% of total net flows for the entire retirement industry over the past 12 months. We continue to gain traction and are in recognition in Asia as well. CIMB Principal in Malaysia and Principal Trust Company in Hong Kong were both recognized as Country Asset Manger of The Year Winners in the 2014 asset AAA Investor and Fund Management Awards.","As the retirement industry continues to mature in Asia, Principal is already a recognized leader and in the top position to capitalize on opportunities in these select markets. As I mentioned, Principal Global Investors ended the quarter with record total assets under management of $307 billion and record unaffiliated assets of $114 billion.","However, it was disappointing to experience unaffiliated net outflows of $500 million during the quarter. The outflows were at post advisory group or due to a portfolio manager change we had net outflows of $2.3 billion for the quarter. However investment performance at post remains strong and we expect the outflows to improve quickly.","Without the outflows at post, Principal Global Investors had unaffiliated net inflows of $1.8 billion, a good result in a highly competitive market. The strength and diversity of our multi-boutique investment platform combined with strong performance continues to position Principal Global Investors as a leading global asset manager.","I\u2019ll close with some comments on capital management. With record operating earnings and net income, we remain well positioned to increase shareholder value through a variety of capital deployment options. In the second quarter, we paid a $0.32 per share common stock dividend and bought back more than $60 million of shares.","Additionally, last night, we announced a $0.34 per share common stock dividend, payable in the third quarter 2014, a 6% increase over the prior dividend and the fourth increase in the last five quarters. We remained focused on increasing our dividend payout ratio over time to our target of 40% on a growing net income base.","The announced dividend brings our year-to-date capital deployment to $575 million and we expect to end the year at or above the top end of our $500 million to $700 million stated range.","Finally, the merger and acquisition pipeline remains active and includes opportunities to further enhance our global investment management platform. Our fee-based business model allows us to generate free cash flow and strategically deploy it to create long-term value for shareholders in addition to company growth.","Before I close, I want to mention one other important recognition. The Principal Financial Group was recently named to the Computer World 2014 List of 100 best places to work in information technology for the 13th straight time.","The Principal is one of only four companies in all industries to be ranked in the top 50 for the last 11 years. We are consistently recognizing the technology leader and offering innovative solutions to our customers as an important part of our strategy.","In closing, we are confident that our momentum will continue, our strong results are sustainable and we will continue to build shareholder value over the long-term.","Terry?","Terrance Lillis","Thanks, Larry. The second quarter results displayed a continuation of our proven ability to execute. Revenue growth is strong and margins continued to improve across our businesses. This morning I\u2019ll focus my comments on, operating earnings for the quarter, net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and an update on capital deployment.","Total company operating earnings of $323 million for the quarter were up 19% over second quarter 2013 results. Net revenue increased 6% over the year ago quarter while operating expenses increased only 1%. This led to strong earnings growth and margin expansion.","At quarter end, our return on equity excluding AOCI improved to 13.3%. This is a 290 basis point improvement from a year ago. Organic growth contributed 130 basis of that increase, above our expectations of 50 to 80 basis points of annual expansion. We achieved this result by both growing operating earnings to nearly $1.2 billion on a trailing 12 month basis and managing the growth of our equity.","This demonstrates our ability to increase return on equity to capital management and more importantly by increasing operating earnings. On a reported basis, second quarter 2014 operating earnings per share were $1.08, a 19% increase over the year ago quarter. This is a strong result considering our average weighted share count was up slightly.","Looking at Slide 6 we normalized second quarter 2014 earnings for three items. First, within retirement and investor services, full-service accumulation in investment-only results each benefited by $3 million after-tax from higher than expected prepayments. In addition, a legal fee reimbursement benefit of full-service accumulation earnings by $3 million.","Finally, the encaje return in Principal International was $5.5 million better than expected. This is consistent with the information on encaje returns available through the websites that we provided in the past. On a normalized basis, earnings per share of $1.03 were up 12% over the normalized year ago quarter.","Now I\u2019ll discuss business unit results starting with the accumulation businesses within the Retirement and Investor Services, operating earnings were $181 million, an increase of 26% over the year ago quarter.","This is the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth in this business. And as shown on Slide 7, revenue was up 10% over second quarter 2013 and up 12% on a trailing 12 month basis.","Trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue remains stable at 33% for. Quarterly operating earnings for full-service accumulation had a $117 million or up 29% from the year ago quarter. Earnings were helped by $6 million from the two non-recurring items I mentioned earlier.","Good revenue growth along with expense discipline resulted in an improvement in the trailing 12 month pre-tax return on net revenue to 34%, a 350 basis point improvement in the past 12 months.","Net cash flows for full-service accumulation were flat for the quarter due to seasonally lower second quarter sales of $1.4 billion and despite strong retention results, the dollars of withdrawals increasing with improved account values.","On a trailing 12 month basis, net cash flows of $3.1 billion are around the mid-point of the long-term range of 1% to 3% of account values that we previously discussed. We expect full year sales to be in line with last year\u2019s totals.","Principal Fund\u2019s operating earnings were $26 million for the quarter, a 49% increase from the year-ago quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenue was up 17% and operating margins continued to improve due to the scale-based nature of the business.","For the quarter, Principal Fund sales were $4.7 billion, contributing to $1.6 billion of net cash flows. We expect full year sales to be comparable to 2013 sales.","Individual Annuities second quarter operating earnings were $33 million, up 12% from the year ago quarter. The increased fee revenue on our variable annuity business due to market appreciation continues to offset spread compression in our fixed deferred block of business.","Slide 8 covers the guaranteed businesses within Retirement and Investor Services. Quarterly operating earnings of $31 million were up 10% over the year ago quarter aided by prepayments in the current quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis, net revenue was up 15% and pre-tax return on net revenue improved 82%.","Slide 9 Principal Global Investors operating earnings for the quarter were $27 million. This is down slightly from the year ago quarter on a reported basis due to a $4 million benefit from a once-every three year performance fee.","On an adjusted basis, operating earnings were up 10%. Trailing 12 months pretax margin was 25%. This was negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points from large performance fees in the fourth quarter 2013. Long-term, we still anticipate a trend to 30% pre-tax margin.","We expect 2014 revenue in this business to remain in line with 2013 levels. Management fees will grow year-over-year, but performance fees are unlikely to reach 2013 levels.","Total net cash flows for the segment were $500 million for the quarter with a strong investment performance leading to good affiliated flows. Assets under management increased 13% over the prior year quarter to a record $307 billion.","Unaffiliated assets under management ended the quarter at $114 billion a 13% increase over the year-ago quarter.","Slide 10 shows quarterly operating earnings for Principal International of a record $68 million, a 17% increase on a reported basis. Results in the current quarter were helped by encaje returns that were higher than expected.","The Principal International businesses in our select emerging markets continue to perform well on a local level. On a local currency basis, operating earnings were up 13% over prior year quarter after adjusting for normalizing items.","The outlook for Principal International remains strong with record assets under management driven by record net cash flows. The strong fundamentals of these businesses, the team\u2019s proven ability to execute and our relationship with premier partners allows us to weather short-term volatility including foreign currency movements to achieve long-term growth.","Slide 11 displays Individual Life\u2019s operating earnings of $20 million for the quarter. Results in the quarter were negatively impacted by elevated claim severity compared to the year-ago quarter. We have reviewed our block of business and believe that the claims are normal fluctuations and not a trend. Expectations are that claim severity will even out over time.","As shown on Slide 12, Specialty Benefits\u2019 operating earnings of $29 million were up 13% from the year ago quarter. Premium entities in the quarter were up 6% due to strong persistency in sales. The loss ratio for the quarter was favorable at 66% and at the low end of our targeted range.","For the quarter, total company net income was a record $306 million, a 38% increase over the prior year quarter. This quarter we had realized capital gains of $31 million as we benefited from gains on real estate sales. Net credit-related losses remained lower than our pricing assumptions at $14 million for the quarter, down 42% from the year ago quarter.","Net income was negatively impacted by $48 million as a result of the court ruling on some uncertain tax positions. We paid the taxes in the previous year; the adjustment made this quarter was to a receivable booked when we filed for a refund several years ago. This is a non-cash item that does not impact our capital deployment plans.","Turning now to capital deployment, as outlined on Slide 13, we\u2019ve announced plans to deploy more than $575 million of capital so far in 2014. This includes the $0.34 common stock dividend we announced last night. The fourth common stock dividend increase in the past five quarters.","The 2014 dividend through three quarters is 31% higher from the dividend over the same timeframe a year ago. As of this week, we spent a $155 million on share repurchases this year leaving approximately $100 million of our current Board authorization.","Our capital deployment strategy is flexible with multiple options including dividends, share repurchases, and acquisition opportunities, all aimed at increasing shareholder value. We believe that we will end the year at or above the top end of the $500 million to $700 million capital deployment range that we discussed on our outlook call.","In closing, we are extremely pleased with the continued momentum of our businesses and feel that our diversified business model is well positioned for future growth in various economic environments.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks for taking my questions. So, I have one and then a follow-up, if I could. First on - I am thinking of the normalized earnings rate, I think last quarter you had guided or talked about roughly a buck per share per quarter, and yet this quarter comes a little bit higher than that, that was $1.03. Can you help us think about what drove the differences and maybe how we should think about the remaining \u2013 the remainder of the year?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Good morning, Yaron, this is Larry. I\u2019ll make a few comments and then ask Terry to comment as well. I mean, we think \u2013 I think actually the quarter \u2013 the sequential quarters from Q1 to Q2 would have played out, I think about as you would have expected for us.","I mean, in normal times, again we think that we grow our businesses around, somewhere around 10% to 12% annually which if you convert that to quarterly, you sort of get down to that 2% to 3% level. So, the dollar sort of a earnings, normalized earnings in Q1 would normally have been say, $1.2 or maybe $1.3 if you take into account both, I would say the momentum of the businesses and sort of market performance during that time.","So, I think the key here is that, things are operating very, very consistently with what we would expect our business model to produce. So I\u2019ll see if Terry wants to add anything.","Terrance Lillis","Yes, Larry. I\u2019d agree, as you look at that last quarter, we called out three different items and then added back one item and there was true-ups from prior year dividend receipt deduction, large prepayments that we have had in the guarantee businesses and then we added back a bit for the life insurance.","But as Larry mentioned, if you look on a normalized growth basis, in terms of the increase in the net revenue continued expense management we saw margins increase as well quarter-over-quarter. So that\u2019s what\u2019s basically driving it. So, I\u2018d say on a normalized basis, moving from the dollar that we had in last quarter to a $1.3 this quarter was right in line with our long-term growth expectations.","","Yaron Kinar \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, and then, going back to a question I asked on the last call, with regards to recurring deposits in FSA. I think, back then, you had talked about kind of a 10-ish percent growth rate year-over-year and it seems like the last two quarters have been lower, last quarter you talked about some difficult year-over-year comps given in the M&A, I think for one of the accounts in 1Q 2013.","That\u2019s now behind us clearly not reflected in the year-over-year results. So what\u2019s leading those recurring deposits, it\u2019s still be lower relative to kind of at 10% number and do you still think that 10% is the correct way to think of it?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, Yaron, this is Larry. I would say, and again we\u2019ve done a lot of modeling. We also of course have a lot of history that you can look at around this in our financial supplement.","I think the way to kind of think about this in a normalized environment which is sort of where we are getting to now, and I\u2019ll comment on that in just a second. But, being that a mid to high single-digit range. So let\u2019s just say sort of 5% to 8% growth in recurring deposits.","The reason it has been a little bit higher than that over the last year or two is because of the financial crisis that that number was negative for a while as participants were getting laid off and matches were getting either reduced or completely eliminated, and so when that thing went negative in the 2008, 2009 period, it builds itself back. You are going to sort of come at the high end of that range.","I would say at this point, while we are not completely back, we are sort of 90% of the way back. So you are going to see that growth in recurring deposits kind of trend from that double-digit rate 10% sort of down to that 5% to 8%. Anything you want to add Dan?","","Daniel Houston","","Yes, just maybe one detail. If you look at that 5% growth in recurring deposits and dissect that, you will find out that actually the fine contribution of recurring deposits were up 6.5% because defined benefit deposits were down about 8.5%. Again, lot of that funding would have happened in the first quarter.","The other way to look at that Larry is to look at over the course of last trailing 12 months, it was up 7% and again, if you break out defined contribution from defined benefit, you will find out the DC growth over the trailing 12 months is up about 8.5%. So right on the \u2013 kind of that high single-digit space that we would talk about. So again I feel really good about the recurring deposits for FSA.","","Yaron Kinar \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great, thanks. That's very helpful. I'll re-queue.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Okay, thank you Yaron.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Kruger with KBW.","","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Hey, good morning.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Hi, Ryan.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","First, could you quantify what the net flows have been at Post Advisory thus far in July?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I\u2019ll ask Jim to comment on that.","James Patrick McCaughan","","Thus far in July the net flows are close to \u2013 slightly closer to but not really large. I think the number I was given when I was there earlier this week was about $200 million or $300 million. The outflow in the second quarter was $2.3 billion which against a post advisory in the order of $10 billion is obviously a big number. It\u2019s happened because of two things one after the other.","There was the retirement of the founder followed by the pension fee portfolio manager departure in March that was mentioned by Larry. And that was one of the two people who took over the founder\u2019s responsibilities. So that led to some clients saying, hey things have changed.","But the investment performance through the whole period has been very strong, one of the strongest in the high yield bond business. And so, we are definitely getting a good pipeline of enquiries both the clients come and back given the storm they have passed and new clients looking at them. I hope that answered this?","","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Yes, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just back to - maybe thinking about RAS accumulation margins. In the past, and you've talked about a 30% to 32% longer-term target. We have been pretty far above that for a couple quarters.","Obviously, the equity market has helped, but I think, perhaps other things that have changed or a kind of continued scale being built in the Principal Funds business and margin expansion there. So, can you comment on the 30% to 32%? Do you think it's reasonable to expect maybe that range could be higher longer-term at this point?","","Larry Donald Zimpleman","","Ryan, yes, this is Larry. I like the inherent optimism that\u2019s contained in your question. But I am also a little bit tempered by more than 40 years in this business. So, again what I would say is that, if you are able to achieve a 30% to 32% margin return in this business, you are really talking about a business that has an ROE in that sort of an equivalent number.","So you are talking about a business that\u2019s got a 30 plus percent ROE. And I guess the way I think about this is that, while there may be periods, as you said, because of some extra DRD in Q1 and because of some good market performance in Q2, we\u2019ve been a little bit above that range. I think as an investor and we are all investors just like all of you, we are pretty happy and excited about a growing business that\u2019s got a 30% ROE.","So, I think that, while there is going to be some periods where it maybe a little bit above that, there might be some periods where it\u2019s a little bit below that as we invest in the business or continue to build out the platform. And I think really over the long-term, if we can hang in that 30% to 32% area, I think, that\u2019s a really, really good return in that business.","","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Understood, I mean, it seems like the 30% to 32% is kind of like a cross-cycle target. So, we could be in a period\u2026","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Correct. Yes, that's correct. Yes, you want to think about that as kind of the long-term sort of return in that business. And again, that's incredibly attractive, which of course, is why many other, many other competitors are trying to get into that business. So we know the competitive environment is going to remain difficult, but I think our track record is really second to none in those businesses.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","All right, thanks. Appreciated.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","","You bet.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","Hi, thank you. A couple questions for retirement. I guess, first in FSA, you are guiding to sales that are about flat with 2013, which would imply a pickup in activity in the second half. Is this just based on the timing of closing transactions? Are you starting to see more activity in the marketplace?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I'll let Dan.","Daniel Houston","Yes, I think that's well said. Second quarter as was mentioned on Larry's earlier comments tends to be a soft quarter. We anticipate having a strong second half of the year large part, Erik; because of just strong pipeline close rates continue to improve. I would be remise if I didn't call out strong investment performance.","It was commented on earlier, but, whether it's one year, three year or five year, that's a strong indicator of how competitive we can be in a marketplace. So again, I feel very optimistic that we will not only on the full service accumulation business, but also in the mutual fund business, let that strong investment performance carry us through the rest of the year. So we feel good about it","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I maybe add one quick \u2013 if I could add one quick comment, Erik, I think it's important to understand and this is somewhat true in the Funds business, but also true in the Retirement business, there is less business moving and that's typical. When you have a year where the market is as generous as it was in 2013 and you go back and look at prior periods, inevitably, there is less business sort of out to bid.","And that's the reason that in my earlier comments, I said, net-net, really if you thought in terms of economics, the reality is, is that we are better off at mid-year 2014 than we were at midyear 2013 because we retained an additional $1.6 billion.","So, sales only happen if and when business is out to bid and there is actually less business moving. So I actually think that, if we end up equivalent to 2013 sales, that\u2019s going to be a strong year for us.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","That's helpful. And then if I could ask one other on - for FSA. At its recent Investor Day Agon commented that it\u2019s seeing an increasing number of requests for 401(k) pricing on a per-head basis rather than as a percentage of AUM, particularly at the larger end of the market. I am just wondering if this is something that you are seeing and could it become more prevalent in the mid-sized market?","And I guess if it does become a wider spread phenomenon, how should we think about the impact on profitability and growth of the 401(k) business if you take out the market leverage component?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Sure. Dan, do you want to comment?","Daniel Houston","Yes, it's a good question and that has always been the case, Erik, for the larger case market. And so I kind of think about plans north of say, $100 million to $200 million. There is generally a very healthy conversation around the per-head charge as opposed to something that might be more asset-based.","We've not really seen that come down below the $50 million mark. As I've mentioned in previous calls, if the plan has more than $5 million of planned assets, we'll do - actually do a profitability analysis on each one of those pieces of business.","Each one of them does differ a little bit in terms of resources that we use. Certainly, the use of Principal branded funds will drive that pricing. But on a net-net basis, whether it\u2019s on a per-head basis or a function of the assets under management, we think we can still hit our long-term margin targets by adjusting accordingly. So it's not a new phenomenon and certainly something that we can adjust our model to.","James Patrick McCaughan","Erik, it's Jim here. Remember also to supplement what Dan correctly said, that even if the per-head pricing for the 401(k) services, the people are still choosing investment options and we would be able to make investment management fees on those investment management options.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","Got it. So you retain, as long as you are managing the assets you retain the market leverage component, it\u2019s in a different piece of the business.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","We're well defended against that change.","Daniel Houston","And that's core, Erik, to our strategy, right, is to manage those assets. It's not our intention to be a standalone record keeper. We've got a world-class global asset management franchise with strong investment performance, bundled with all of those services, whether it's retire works or retire secure.","Those are what value is being placed on that. As a matter of fact, there was an interesting article earlier this week talking about a study that Bloomberg did focusing on the largest 250 plans and the emphasis was on outcomes. And that's something you've heard us talking about for nearly a decade now.","So again, I think that, momentum is moving towards what is it doing for my employees, is it preparing them for retirement in a satisfactory way and by managing the assets, providing the services, we think we've got a competitive advantage by packaging in that fashion.","Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Great. Thank you for the color.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Thanks, Erik.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Dargan with MacQuarie.","Shawn Dargan - MacQuarie","Thanks and good morning. I have a question about Brasilprev. I think there is a notion with a lot of investors that Brazil is if not in recession at least facing a pretty tough economic climate right now. I'm just wondering what you are seeing, what you think is driving your performance there?","","Larry Donald Zimpleman","This is Larry. I'll make a few comments and ask Luis if he like to add on to that. I mean, what is driving the performance there is, first of all, the very strong distribution platform of Banco Brasil. There is over 7000 Banco Brasil branches in all areas of that country and there is a very clear understanding on the part of the middle income and upper middle income group in Brazil that they need to take responsibility for their own financial future.","And while the economy itself may struggle from time-to-time, and frankly in some respects, maybe due to perhaps more intervention by the government into the economy than what would be ideal, it doesn't disrupt the sort of fundamental demographic premise that you have this emerging middle-class that is very motivated to save and invest for their own financial future.","So it's really a combination of catching the right demographic trend with an incredibly strong distribution partner, all backed up by the expertise of Principal, who is really managing, kind of under the surface, is really managing all of the critical elements of the business, so, investment portfolios, product development, product pricing, technology, et cetera. So you really have sort of that world class operation in a market that's growing very substantially. But any \u2013 okay? All right.","James Patrick McCaughan","Does that help, Shawn?","Shawn Dargan - MacQuarie","Yes and is there anything in the financial reporting of BB Seguridade \u2013 I pronounced it right, Seguridade that would give us some insight to the, I guess the underlying trends in the business?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, absolutely. There's pretty good transparent \u2013 there is very good transparency as to the various components of the business. Brasilprev is one of about - I think three different areas of the business there and you can certainly go to their website.","They do earnings calls in both Portuguese and English. I believe their earnings call is in about ten days or two weeks. But there is very, very good transparency and for those that are interested in kind of seeing how that company operates under the surface and how Brasilprev works, that's a great opportunity to better understand that.","Shawn Dargan - MacQuarie","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. I would actually like to follow-up on Shawn's question, just on the strong flows in Brazil. Do you have any visibility in terms of penetration into Banco de Brasil? I believe right now the retirement clients in Banco de Brasil fill a very small portion of the overall client base. Just wondering how you are seeing that progression in the last couple quarters?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Right, so again, this is Larry. I will just make a couple of comments. I think, you are exactly right, that the key here is the cross-sell percentage of the total retail client base of Banco Brasil, which is I think in that $60 million sort of range.","And so it's really a question of what percentage of that retail base is eligible if you will, or is a good candidate for some sort of a retirement savings program. And others can sort of put their own number on it, but let's just say I'll put a number of 5% to 10% of that $60 million.","So that's roughly 4 million, 5 million, 6 million retail clients that are potential. And I think in Brasilprev today, Luis, we're looking at \u2013 yes, 1.8, 1.8 million retail clients. So that's, that means, we could triple the opportunity in Brasilprev, if we just kept the retail client base of Banco at the same level.","Now, of course the retail base of Banco is growing at that kind of 8% to 10% sort of range as well. So, as we say, when we go down and visit the folks at Brasilprev and have ongoing discussions, we got a lot of work to do. But it does give you a sense of what the longer-term potential is of that business.","Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And just in flows in Chile, you mentioned that voluntary flows were up three-fold versus last year. Can you give us a sense of what that is in dollars?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I'll ask Luis to maybe comment on that.","Luis Valdez","Yes, in dollars, that is a \u2013 we put $30 million in net customer cash flows a year ago, second quarter. And right now, we put in more than $70 million in this quarter. And essentially, we have in place right now three different initiatives in order to continue selling our voluntary products with Cuprum. The first one is that we are open to independent financial advisors; they are being able right now to sell our voluntary products that are manufactured by Cuprum.","The second initiative is that, we already combined our sales forces with Principal Financial Group, prior one in then Cuprum in order to continue selling voluntary products and in a much \u2013 with a much more broader array of products. And the three initiatives is that we, - third, cross-selling, up-selling our current clients in Cuprum. So, these are the three initiatives are already in place in Cuprum.","James Patrick McCaughan","Does that help, Seth?","Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That does. So, just for me, that $70 million of the $1.4 billion in deposits, is that the right way to think about it from Chile?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, I mean, I guess the way I would think about it is that, what it demonstrates, I think, Seth, is that we're getting some pretty early traction with the initiatives that Luis discussed. I mean, we are sort of in the first inning, really of that opportunity. We just put these initiatives in place just in the last quarter or two.","And it's actually very encouraging from our perspective to kind of see the traction that we are already getting. So I think, it should continue to further improve from here as those initiatives that Luis described get traction.","Luis Valdez","Another way to see this, if today kind of 97% of our total fee incomes are coming from the compose rate business 3% 4% are coming from the bond. So you can see there what is that potential that we have in cuprum right now.","Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great, and just if I could ask one very quick one to Terry, on buybacks. What level of buybacks is required just to offset dilution?","Terrance Lillis","We look at probably about increase in dilution each quarter will vary based upon a few things. But, we are looking probably at, anywhere in the \u2013 on an annualized basis, anywhere in that $75 million to $100 million depending on the execution of the options in our share price. But I would say in that $75 million to $100 million is what we probably need for anti-dilution share buybacks.","Now as we I said, this year, we had a $200 million authorization for this year, plus a $55 million carryover from last year. And to-date, we have executed on - about $155 million of execution. So we still have $100 million outstanding. So, the goal or the intention is, first off get the anti-dilution out there and second, opportunistically continue to buy back shares. Okay?","Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay great. Thanks a lot.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Benner with FBR Capital Markets.","Randy Benner - FBR Capital Markets","Hi, good morning. Thanks. I wanted to touch on, I guess, mortality. It was weak kind of for two quarters in a row. Just wondering if there is any color you can give us on that or analysis you've done to understand the shortfall there?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, Randy, this is Larry, thanks for the question. Again, I'll have Dan make a few comments. We've obviously spent a fair bit of time, quite a bit of time around that and I guess, what I would say is that, it has been kind of at the low end of our expectations for the last two quarters. I think in Q1, our experience was reasonably consistent with what we are seeing across most of the industry.","Randy Benner - FBR Capital Markets","Right.","","Larry Donald Zimpleman","In Q2, it was more severity than it was incidence. But whether we are similar to the industry or a little different than the industry, I think we'll have to see as the next couple weeks play out and as other companies report.","But, again, what I would - I guess, try to emphasize is we think that our recent results, while slightly disappointing on mortality are still sort of at the low-end of the expected range and within what should be statistical fluctuation, so.","Daniel Houston","Yes, that's exactly right. So it's kind of plus or minus the $5 million off of expectation of around $25 million, a $20 million that\u2019s certainly lower than \u2013 that's on the low end of the range, tutoring right on the edge of whether or not get call it out or not. We did do some look back analysis, Randy. If we did experienced higher mortality in six of the last 14 quarters with only three outside, one standard deviation.","So, again, it's on our mind. We are looking at it very closely. As you know, we've got a lot of reinsurance treaties on a fair amount of this business and there is a little bit of accounting noise. But, it's still within the range of reasonableness from our advantage point. And to that end, we still view that life business as a very valuable part of the franchise.","We got good leadership overseeing it. We use it as our funding vehicle for non-qualified deferred comp and for our Business Owner Executive Solution. So it's good for the organization and like you would like to see, maybe a little less volatility, but it is expected as Larry pointed out, we had a couple relatively large claims that really drove the performance down for the quarter.","Randy Benner - FBR Capital Markets","Okay, got it, large claims. And then just a quick one and this is \u2013 I mean this is a little bit higher level or quite a bit. But, Larry, I guess, I\u2019d be interested if you have any commentary that's different in the past on DRD and that relates to kind of current efforts in Washington for corporate tax reform kind of around this inversion issue.","I mean, is anything different on DRD for you all, based on what's going on here now, because that is, it's a significant item in your financials?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, so I think, Randy, it's probably best for my comments to stay more related to just overall, overall tax reform. And I'm probably \u2013 over my years, I have been more of an optimist than a realist around that. And I think I am certainly to become more of a realist, trending towards a skeptic really around the ability of Congress to take on a larger issue like tax reform.","I think, because of the way political cycles work today with four-year Presidential election cycles and two year house cycles, I think the reality is that there is a very, very short window of time when a - such a significant piece of legislation like tax reform would get done.","And I think, about the only time it can get done, is if you've got alignment between sort of the White House, or Senate and the House, and even then it sort of has to go on within kind of the first year of a two year term. So I don't see any possibility, despite discussion. I don't see any possibility that much is going to change in 2014 or 2015.","Then we'll have a Presidential Election in 2016 and then depending on how that lines up, you could see, I think a kind of narrow window in there in the post-2016 period. But, I think before that, it's going to be most between that and the 2016 election, Randy, it's going to be mostly political posturing and discussion about what each party would do if they had sort of control of White House, Senate and House. But nothings are really going to really happen on that score.","Randy Benner - FBR Capital Markets","So status quo on DRD is good to plan on?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Well, I mean, we will adapt to whatever situation, we find ourselves in. We've done this for many, many years and again, I - specifically as it relates to DRD, I don't really have comments other than to say, I think we apply the tax laws as they are.","Randy Benner - FBR Capital Markets","All right. Understood, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks so much good morning. Larry, you mentioned you put forth PFG\u2019s proposal for reform to the Chilean pension system. So wanted to see if you could comment some on what your suggestions were? Maybe how they differ from what we currently know about the pension system there or maybe what some others are proposing?","","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Sure. Yes, thanks for that question, Chris. I'll make a few comments and then I'll let Luis, add to that, because actually, Luis was the one who did the testimony in front of the Bravo Commission. What I would say relative to the meeting with Chilean President, Bachelet that I referenced in my opening comments is that, we stressed the importance, if there is a decision around some sort of government run AFP.","First of all, why is there some interest in that? And the answer is that it's to try to improve coverage among the lower income segment. There is a group of workers often not in completely formal employment who are simply not saving enough for their retirement. And I think the Chilean government to their credit, is really focused on that problem. But one of the points that we made was that, that's actually more of a labor issue than it is a retirement issue.","It's, again, the fact that these people are in more informal employment arrangements and that's why they haven't been participating regularly in the AFP system. The other point that I would say I made relative to the President Bachelet is that, if there is a desire to have a government run AFP for the primary purpose of focusing on lower income workers, that it be critical that that AFP sort of operate with the kind of same governance structure that is required of private sector AFP companies.","And I would say we received immediate and total assurance and agreement that that would be the case, i.e., no sort of government subsidies, no sort of easier set of rules or fiduciary responsibilities around it, but it's got to operate at the very same level as the private sector. And then maybe I'll ask Luis if he wants to comment on the Bravo Commission component.","Luis Valdez","Yes, and kind of a short comments about what is our main proposal to that commission, Chris is, in three main areas. First, some proposal about the voluntary pillar and second proposal about the compulsory and then we put some proposal about the issues that related with the financial education that is needed. But essentially in a nutshell, Chileans and the compulsory mode they are saving 10% out of their pay check.","Our proposal is that 10% has to go up to 16%, up to 16%, 17%. So, in two tranches. First, we move the 10% compulsory up to 13% and then to cover the next 4% with a third pillar which is a voluntary pillar. In that sense, two things are behind that. Not just moving the 10% up to 13%, it's also moving the salary cap. Just to give you a reference.","You know the salary cap has to be updated, in the moment the salary cap was set in 1981, represent two times the \u2013 six times that total GDP per capita. Right now it represents two times. So it's very, very, very dated right now. So moving that salary cap, we have to at least to triple the salary cap in order to update the salary cap.","The other thing which is important, we presented all the - our proposal in order to enhance the APBC solution, which is a 401(k) type solution for Chile. They are almost there, so they need just a few tweaks in order to really take off the Group solutions and the APBC industry.","In the second issue, which is much more about the compulsory side, we certainly, we aim to move the fees and flows and fees over AUMs in order to align the whole industry in the right sense. And the second thing that we are talking about is to introduce and by default the concept of the lifetime funds instead of the risk kind of oriented funds that they already have.","These are mainly the two main kind of things that we propose for how to enhance the system and certainly we put other important initiatives related with, financial education.","But all in all, my personal view is that, in Chile, they have a pretty good understanding that the right solution is to increase their rate, the saving rate, increase a 10% up to a kind of 12%, 13% to move the salary cap right now very quickly and to certainly enhance the third pillar which is the voluntary pillar, particularly in the kind of 401(k) type solution.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","And all of those that Luis just mentioned would obviously be very beneficial to the activity there and to our businesses, so.","Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you, helpful. And then just my follow-up is, I guess, with the adoption of new mortality tables for retirement plans, wondering how you think about kind of the pressure that puts on DB plans and opportunities that presents to you guys?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, again, I would say that DB services are kind of becoming a lost art from a \u2013 it\u2019s a kind of broad industry perspective. And, I think we have found it very beneficial to sort of go against the grain and, over the last kind of 10 years or so, we've actually further built out our suite of services there, because it's very, very central to our total retirement suite, sort of concept.","So the point here I think, whether it's a mortality table or whatever else it may be, the point is that defined benefit sponsors need help and they need to kind of understand what some of these changes are going to do and that\u2019s always creates a great opportunity, so. Dan, you want to?","Daniel Houston","Those mortality tables perhaps change the funding levels in that 8% to 10% range. Remember that, we've got a lot of these small to medium-sized plans, more than 2500 of them.","So these are relatively small dollar amounts. They are generally leaning towards funding the retirement benefit for the principals of the organization. So again, in the grand scheme of things, as we've talk to our defined benefit customers, this is not a derailer. So, I don't see defined benefit plan termination is increasing because of a increase in the use of the mortality tables.","However, we do have to be very conscious so what the PBGC is doing relative to increasing fees. But it's still a very, very powerful way to go about funding for certain small to medium-size businesses, their long-term retirement benefits.","Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thanks so much.","Daniel Houston","All right, Chris.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our Q&A.

Welcome to the Principal Financial Group's Third Quarter Earnings Call. As always, our earnings release, financial supplement and additional investment portfolio detail and slides related to today's call are available on our website at www.principal.com\/investor.","Following a reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO, Larry Zimpleman; and CFO, Terry Lillis, will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A are Dan Houston, Retirement Investor Services and U.S. Insurance Solutions; Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors; Luis Valdez, Principal International; and Julia Lawler, our Chief Investment Officer.","Some of the comments made during the conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

We'll provide more details as the event gets closer. While we will not provide specific EPS guidance, we will discuss revenue growth rates and revenue margins for each of the businesses. This will provide greater clarity of earnings growth by business unit in 2013.","Larry?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Thanks, John, and welcome to everyone on the call. As usual, I'll comment on 3 areas. First, I will briefly discuss third quarter results. Next, I'll provide an update on the continued successful execution of our strategy, including comments about our recent announcement of the Cuprum acquisition in Chile, then I'll close with some comments on capital deployment.","As John mentioned, we provided slides related to today's call. Slide 4 outlines the themes for the quarter. As we reported yesterday and estimated at Investor Day, third quarter operating earnings were negatively impacted by $91 million from our actuarial assumption review. As a result of this review, we lowered our long-term interest rate assumption and updated other model assumptions. Terry will discuss these in more detail.","Normalizing for this, third quarter total company operating earnings per share are solid, up 10% compared to the year-ago quarter despite persistent headwinds created by pressure on fees and continued low interest rates.","Net income for the quarter was strong due to a net gain resulting from the merger of Catalyst Health and our sale of the shares we received as a result of the merger, as well as a continuation of improved credit losses. This contributes to continuing financial flexibility in this challenging economy.","Total company assets under management were a record $392 billion, driven by total company year-to-date net cash flows of $25 billion. We continue to see outstanding growth across our businesses, with strong sales and client retention. Our ability to win and retain business is driven by strong investment performance, best-in-class solutions, as well as a distribution model that is a key differentiator for us as we discussed at Investor Day.","Key growth metrics from the quarter include: full service accumulation sales were $2.7 billion, almost double third quarter 2011 sales; net cash flows of $1.6 billion are more than triple from the year-ago quarter; Principal funds had record sales of $4.5 billion and record net cash flows of $2.5 billion; Principal Global Investors had record unaffiliated assets under management of $98 billion and unaffiliated net cash flows were $2.2 billion, nearly double third quarter 2011 net cash flows; Principal International reported record assets under management of $66 billion, up 21% over the year-ago quarter and record net cash flows of $2.7 billion. All of our Principal International operating companies had positive net cash flows in the third quarter with increased momentum in Asia.","In U.S. Insurance Solutions, Individual Life sales of $48 million increased 17% over third quarter 2011, with 53% of sales from the business market. Specialty benefits premium and fees grew 5% to $361 million over the year-ago quarter. The continued strength in the fundamentals of our business is driving this growth, which leads to higher net revenues and ultimately, higher total company operating earnings. We remain confident about the continued momentum in our businesses despite the continuing challenges of the macro environment.","Now let me provide some comments on the ongoing implementation of our strategy. As we discussed at Investor Day, we've been executing our investment management leadership strategy for more than a decade. The company is positioned for long-term growth by capitalizing on opportunities created by global trends such as aging populations, growth of the middle class in emerging markets and financially constrained governments.","We've demonstrated an accelerated ability to execute our strategy since the financial crisis. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Cuprum, the premier mandatory pension provider in Chile, which perfectly complements our existing voluntary savings and payout business in Chile so that we can provide a truly integrated set of solutions to our expanded customer base from hire through retire.","Cuprum's customer base consists primarily of upper middle class consumers, making them more likely to add voluntary solutions to their current mandatory retirement plan. With the mandatory and voluntary markets expected to continue double-digit growth, this strategic acquisition strongly positions us in Chile and, combined with our business in Brazil and Mexico, makes us one of the largest retirement providers in Latin America.","On a pro forma basis, the acquisition will result in Principal International contributing 23% of operating earnings, and 63% of company earnings will be fee-based. Our strong capital position and financial flexibility of our fee-based businesses allowed us to do this immediately accretive strategic acquisition and strengthens our position in emerging markets.","Additionally, the low interest rate environment and the strength of our balance sheet provide us an attractive opportunity to finance this acquisition. As we note on Slide 5, this acquisition is the sixth such transaction since 2010, all done to improve our competitive position in the faster-growing emerging markets and in global investment management.","Additionally, it's important to note that for all of these transactions, we either source the deal ourselves or we were involved in a process with a very small set of possible acquirers. What these transactions signify is that the Principal has become an acquirer of choice within our businesses because of our recognized expertise and our ability to execute. We truly believe this is an effective way to create strategically compelling and accretive opportunities, and we plan to execute similar deals over time.","I'll quickly comment on other examples of execution. In full service accumulation, we continue to focus on key distribution relationships, especially with Allianz partners and third-party administrators. Our combination of proprietary and third-party distribution gives us premier access to the small- to medium-size business market, which has higher net revenue.","We can extend these relationships to employees of these businesses to provide additional products they need through retirement. Investment performance, which is the best leading indicator for growth of our retirement and investment management businesses, remains strong as noted on Slide 6. Demand continues to grow for our full suite of investment solutions that help clients solve for needs.","As further demonstration of our expanding global footprint and position as a global investment management leader, Principal Global Investors was awarded $150 million of QFII capacity in China in the third quarter. Additionally, Principal International announced last week the launch of a wholly-owned subsidiary in India named Principal Retirement Advisors. This launch positions us as the retirement expert in this emerging market.","Our strategy is to develop relationships with financial advisors to help the growing middle class establish their own retirement and long-term savings solutions. As these examples show, we are in the right markets at the right time with the right solutions and the right distribution model.","Now I'll close with some comments on capital management. Following the announcement of the Cuprum acquisition, so far, in 2012, we have committed more than $2.1 billion of capital on common stock dividends, strategic acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchase. The increasing amounts of deployable capital provided by our fee-based business model allows us to return greater amounts of capital to shareholders by increasing our dividend payout ratio over time.","In the third quarter, we announced and paid a $0.21 common stock dividend, up from $0.18 in the second quarter. Additionally, as we announced last night, we will pay a $0.21 common stock dividend in the fourth quarter. This brings our full year common stock dividend to $0.78, up 11% over 2011, demonstrating our commitment to providing long-term value to shareholders and our confidence in the strength of our businesses going forward.","We'll also continue to invest in business growth through strategic acquisitions. While we don't anticipate a near-term deal similar in size to Cuprum, there is an active pipeline of strategic opportunities that we'll continue to explore.","Of the $300-million total share repurchase authorizations announced in 2012, we have $42 million remaining at the end of the third quarter. Year-to-date, we reduced our share count 6%. This will provide a nice tailwind to our ability to grow earnings per share heading into 2013. We will continue to consider opportunistic share repurchase as one part of our capital deployment plan going forward.","In closing, I believe we have the most strategically aligned set of businesses of anyone in the financial services industry. And our investment management plus model with strong ongoing execution continues to position us as a global investment manager focused on building long-term value for shareholders.","Terry?","Terrance J. Lillis","Thanks, Larry. As Larry mentioned, normalized third quarter earnings were solid. This morning, I'll focus my comments on: operating earnings and the impact of our actuarial assumption review; net income, including continued solid performance in the investment portfolio; and the strength of our capital position and balance sheet.","Looking at Slide 7, you'll see the impact of our actuarial assumption review had on our third quarter operating earnings. In addition to lowering our long-term interest rate assumption by 50 basis points, we updated assumptions around lapses and deposits and made other model enhancements. Combined, these changes reduced total company operating earnings by $91 million or approximately $0.30 per share. This was slightly higher than our estimated range communicated at Investor Day, primarily due to finalization of our Individual Life and Principal International reviews. On an adjusted basis, third quarter 2012 earnings per share were up 10% over the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong execution.","Additionally, adjusted return on equity excluding other comprehensive income was 10.2%. Looking forward, we expect 50 to 80 basis points of annual return on equity accretion. In addition, we should benefit from Cuprum once it is fully integrated.","Now I'll discuss business unit results. Slide 8 is the same shown in Investor Days. It summarizes the revenue metrics we use for each of our businesses. And as John mentioned, these will provide greater clarity for earnings growth by business unit going forward.","Turning to Slide 9 on Retirement and Investor Services, our accumulation businesses had net revenue growth of 9%. On an adjusted basis, operating earnings grew 11% in third quarter 2012 compared to the year-ago quarter.","Strong growth in account values was driven by positive net cash flows and asset appreciation. This helped grow net revenues but was partially offset by continued pressure on fees.","For full year 2012, we expect Retirement Investor Service accumulation businesses' net revenue to grow between 4% and 6%. Full service accumulation adjusted operating earnings of $75 million were up 8% over the year-ago quarter on 6% growth in net revenue.","Pretax return on net revenue is 29% on a trailing 12-month basis. The underlying fundamentals within full service accumulation continue to be strong. The sales pipeline continues to build, and close ratios continue to improve. In addition, recurring deposits are up 9% year-to-date, reflecting growth in eligible participants due to strong sales and retention, as well as success of our worksite counselors in increasing participation and deferral rates.","Year-to-date 2012 full service accumulation sales at $8.2 billion were up 58% over 2011. Because 2011 sales were more back-end loaded, we now expect full year 2012 sales to be up more than 30% over 2011.","Given the robust sales growth in 2012, we expect future sales growth to be less than our historical averages. However, we expect to drive higher net revenue growth as we put greater focus on the small- to medium-size business market, which drives a higher percentage of proprietary asset management.","Operating earnings for Principal Funds at $13 million were up 7% from the year-ago quarter on 13% increase in revenue, reflecting current-period sales expenses. Results included record sales of $4.5 billion and record net cash flows of $2.5 billion, reflecting strong investment performance and high demand across multiple strategies, including global diversified income fund, preferred securities, MidCap Blend Funds, high yield and our target-risk funds.","Slide 10 covers the guaranteed businesses within Retirement and Investor Services. Guaranteed net revenue and operating earnings were flat in the third quarter as we continue to approach this business opportunistically.","For example, in the third quarter, the $500-million pension closeout sale announced on the second quarter earnings call, funded. Our financial strength and reputation as a proven provider has enabled us to compete for this business, which generates attractive returns.","Turning to Principal Global Investors, Slide 11 shows earnings and revenues grew 8% over the year-ago quarter, reflecting our investment for growth. Investment performance remains competitive. This drove strong unaffiliated net cash flows of $2.2 billion into a variety of asset classes including preferred, high yield, currency, stable value and equities, leading to a record unaffiliated assets under management of $98 billion.","Looking at Principal International on Slide 12, third quarter 2012 operating earnings of $29.5 million were dampened by $11.5 million due to the actuarial assumption review this quarter. In our Mexican AFORE product, lapse rates are down noticeably from recent history, but we expect near-term lapse rates to be higher than previously assumed. More importantly, we continue to gain market share, particularly in the more desirable high-amount and high-contributing accounts.","Combined net revenue growth was flat compared to the year-ago quarter, though it's up 18% on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency headwinds are masking double-digit growth in the member companies on a local level. We continue to expect long-term operating earnings growth of 15% to 20% in Principal International.","Turning to Individual Life, Slide 13 illustrates third quarter 2012 adjusted premium and fees are down 2% compared to 2011 due to a targeted decrease in single premium sales. Third quarter 2012 operating earnings were down $66 million, of which $63 million was due to lowering our long-term interest rate assumption by 50 basis points and model enhancements.","Additionally, operating earnings were down $3 million from the year-ago quarter, reflecting continued impact of the low interest rate environment. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted pretax operating margin at 18% is in our targeted long-term range of 16% to 21%. We expect to be at the low end of this range as long as the low interest rate environment persists.","Slide 14 highlights Specialty Benefits' premium and fee growth of 5%, a solid result given continued pressure on employment levels. Third quarter 2012 adjusted operating earnings at $18 million were down $3 million from the third quarter 2011. This was primarily driven by the higher group disability claims in the quarter, which we consider to be normal quarterly volatility. Overall loss ratios for the year continued to be in our targeted range. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax operating margins of 9% is in line with our long-term expectations of 8% to 12%.","The corporate segment reported an operating loss of $31 million, right in line with our expected quarterly results of $30 million to $35 million.","For the quarter, total company net income was $180 million. Third quarter benefited from a net gain resulting from the merger of Catalyst Health and our sale of the shares we received as a result of the merger. After tax credit-related losses remain steady at $38 million.","Our investment-related losses continue to be in line or better than our loss projections and better than market expectations, reflecting sustainable recovery in commercial real estate.","Slide 15 explains near-term impacts we experienced on our earnings growth. As long as pressure on fees and the low interest rate environment persists, we expect normalized total company operating earnings to grow 6% to 8%. With a lower share count in 2012, we expect normalized earnings per share growth to remain in our expected 11% to 13% range.","Looking now at capital adequacy, we estimate our third quarter risk-based capital ratio to be 440%. Relative to a 350 RBC ratio, we have approximately $2.2 billion of total excess capital, up from $1.5 billion in second quarter, primarily due to our September $600-million debt issuance. The $1.5-billion purchase price for Cuprum will be met by using $1 billion of current excess capital in addition to approximately $500 million of assumed and yet-to-be-issued debt. Cuprum is expected to close in first quarter 2013.","As Larry noted, the evolution of our business model means that we now have 60% to 65% of earnings coming from less capital intensive fee-based businesses that have limited or no guarantees associated with them. This will allow us to continue a pattern of increasing our dividend payout ratio year-over-year.","As outlined on Slide 16, so far in 2012 we've allocated $2.1 billion of capital for common stock dividends, strategic acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchase. We announced our fourth quarter common stock dividend of $0.21 payable on December 28.","Additionally, year-to-date, we have repurchased 9.9 million shares worth approximately $260 million.  Looking ahead to 2013, we again expect to deploy capital with a commitment to increasing long-term value for shareholders.","In closing, we're very pleased with the continued growth and momentum of our businesses. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Chris Giovanni from Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first question for you, just in terms of the guidance and I guess the decision to kind of poll the EPS guidance, and I'm just curious why the decision. Because I think, historically, you guys had a pretty strong track record of kind of landing almost right in the middle of kind of the guidance range that you guys have provided.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Chris, this is Larry. I appreciate your comment. Actually, a couple of things about that. First of all, of course we've continued -- as we did on Investor Day, we continue to reiterate, if you will, our guidance, but our view that our EPS growth over the long term should remain at 11% to 13% range. So I would sort of start with that. Second thing I would say is that we actually believe that what we are planning to do and sort of have been doing but plan to do in our call on November 27 with providing you better insight on revenue growth and margin expectations, is actually going to allow you to do a better job of sort of forecasting what the earnings and growth rate in earnings is going to be for each of the businesses. So I'd argue it's actually more valuable to sort of get slightly more granular and get down to the business level, rather than just having us throw sort of one macro number out there that would be an overall company EPS, because I think it's really more important and helpful to understand the trends within each business. And so that's why we've gone to this approach.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And then Terry, you had mentioned the pension closeout transaction and talked about targeted returns there being attractive. Could you maybe quantify what the return target is there? And then we've seen a number of big pension kind of risk transfer deals out there. I'm curious on your capacity to do those and how big of a player you're willing to be in that space.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes. Christ, this is Larry. I'll turn it over to Terry for the return comment. I just want to make a quick comment on sort of how we think about that from an overall capacity and capital usage, et cetera. First of all, we've been in this business for 70 years. So this is a business that we know extremely well. Of course it's a business that has been fairly dormant up until lately because it tends to be inversely correlated to interest rates. So when interest rates are low, there tends to be not a lot of that business written. We may be in a period of that starting to change a little bit. Our focus for the business is, for the most part, going to be on smaller placements where we can get the kind of returns that Terry is going to talk about in a second. I would say the third quarter sale, $525 million, was a little bit unusual for us, and you probably wouldn't see us write much more than about $1 billion a year of that kind of business. So I hope that kind of helps frame it, and I'll let Terry talk about returns.","Terrance J. Lillis","Thanks, Chris. This is Terry. As you look at that business, it's -- not only will it be reported on our full service payout line, but it will also get some benefit in our global asset management as well. So we have to look at the return on both basis. However, what you'll see in the earnings will show up in full service payout predominantly. Long term, we're not expecting this to be dilutive to our long-term ROE. This business will probably put on in that -- mid-teen range is what we're looking at. It will vary by the size of the business, and we don't think that it's a drag on the business. We do see that this is a very good diversifier of earnings for us as well. So we're real pleased with this type of business.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joanne Smith from Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","I was wondering if maybe Dan could talk a little bit about the various segments of the market for the full service accumulation business and just talk about -- because I've noticed that recurring deposits were up nicely in the quarter, and I'm just wondering where are you seeing the best recovery there and what you think you're going to see going forward.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Okay. Dan, go ahead.","Daniel J. Houston","So a couple of comments. The good news about the third quarter is the sales were actually split very nicely across what we think of is the emerging market, which is less than $5 million. And then we have what we call dynamic, which is kind of that $5 million to $50 million. And then what we call institutional is greater than $50 million. We really have had and enjoyed good traction and growth in all 3 of those segments, which is a very deliberate strategy for a variety of different reasons. It certainly helps us improve some of the return on asset metrics. It also helps drive our net revenue, growth rates, which you saw expressed in the third quarter results. On the smaller-sized plans, we generally can get a larger percentage of the assets and proprietary investment options. And with Jim's investment performance as of late, we've been able to drive more of those assets into our proprietary options. And the good news there is it's not just the fixed income options, it's equities, it's asset allocation. So it's across the board. TRS continues to be the best solution that we have out there. It still captures about 60% of the business. The TPA strategy, and we've talked about it on this call on many occasions, continues to grow, administering a lot of those smaller plans. And again, we've reiterated, I've reiterated again today, we think the TPA business is just as profitable as the others. So hopefully that helps give you a flavor for the market today.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Dan, I was really looking to see where you're seeing the best recovery in recurring deposits. Because that has been weak off -- pretty much since the financial crisis, and that's kind of key to the overall assets under management growth going forward. So where are we seeing it? Are you seeing it in the smallest plans? The largest plans?","Daniel J. Houston","It's across the board. So that 9% increase that was thrown out during the prepared comments is across all of those segments, small, medium as well as large. There's still plenty of growth for improving on deferral percentages and improving in participation and certainly, contributions through increased salary deferrals and bonuses. And frankly, if you're trying to calibrate it, we're probably half way back from the high-water mark of '07 in terms of those recurring deposits.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I would just add a couple of comments, Joanne. I think this was now the 10th straight quarter we've seen an increase in the salary deferral rate. So we're now seeing salary deferrals that are getting into the very, very high 6%, almost 7% range. So that's going to be key. One of the real opportunities, I think, for us going forward is sort of the activity that we call retirement readiness, where I really think that the American workers now recognize, if they didn't understand it before, they recognize that it's on their shoulders to make sure that they're doing the right things to save for retirement. So for somebody that's as big a player as we are on 401(k) and has the local footprint to actually be in the worksite driving higher deferrals, driving higher participation, this is going to be a big advantage for us. So hopefully, what you're going to see is you're going to see that recurring deposit number continue to build. And a lot of that again is going to be based on the reality that I think people now understand they've got to secure their own retirement.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","And Larry or Dan, whoever wants to take this follow-up question, with respect to that, if you're getting an improvement in the recurring deposits and deferral rates, then should we not see over time some counterbalance to the pressure on fees? Because obviously, those assets are kind of -- come with no cost, so to speak.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes. So just breaking down cost for just a second. Think about it being in 3 buckets. And again, some of those are account value-based. So commissions are based on account value, and so commission costs generally rise at the same rate as your account values. The asset management fees also follow that similar pattern, and so you have some higher cost there. The third bucket, which is comp and other, and that's where we've been quite careful in managing those expenses. And that's where we're going to get some of that additional margin expansion hopefully as we grow these assets. But you're right, Joanne, in the assumption that whether it's a profit [ph] contribution, increase in deferrals, increase in participation, a lot of that does fall to the bottom line. And we look forward to having that return.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","In regards to capital management, kind of a 2-part question there. One, your commitment to capital as you covered on the call is $2.1 billion in 2012. That's well ahead of kind of the initial target. And so kind of looking for the updated thought on that, maybe ahead of this November 27 call, you seem comfortable managing capital. And then the other angle I'd like you to cover, if you could, was savings and loan holding company status. It seems like you've been pretty comfortable there. It's been kind of a \"getting to know you\" period so far with the fed, but some other insurers have kind of exited that status. And so wondering how you're thinking about that and if that's going to have a relation with what you're going to plan for next year.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Okay, Randy, this is Larry. I'll make a few comments on that. Obviously, the $2.1 billion that we've deployed or we've [ph] spoken for in 2012, we of course hadn't planned necessarily on having Cuprum, which is essentially $1.5 billion of that. And as you know, we plan to use about $400 million of excess capital in order to help finance that acquisition. So I think that our capital budget, if you will, is pretty well sort of spent when you take account of the announcement we made last night around the $0.21 share dividend. And I think it's important to sort of reiterate that $0.21 share because again, I believe that board decisions and management decisions around common stock dividends is the best single indicator you have about the strength of the businesses going forward. So going into 2013, again, I think that we need to slightly rebuild our excess capital levels, given that we'll use about $400 million for Cuprum. So we'll need to sort of build that back, which again we're roughly thinking is going to take us probably 2 quarters. So that's why we're sort of thinking, and we'll provide more insight at the November 27 call, we're probably thinking about being an opportunity to have greater amounts of capital to deploy to shareholders, probably in the back half in the continuation of the common stock dividend, and maybe a little bit of share repurchase to offset dilution. On savings and loan holding company, again, I would reiterate that -- as we have said before, I think our conversations continue to be constructive. If you think about the stress test that we all hear about and read about, if you think about the new supposed requirements, which are still very much in proposed stage, those are really things, Randy, that are going to be 2014 and 2015 events. So it's not going to have -- none of that should have a significant impact on our capital management strategy for 2013. Obviously, moving into 2013, one of the most important priorities we're going to have is to ultimately figure out a reconciliation for the savings on holding company and the fed and what impact, if any, it's going to have on our capital deployment strategy. So you'll hear us say more about that I think as we get into 2013. But again, at this point, it's really had no impact on us. And so we're actually very pleased with the relationship, and we're going to continue on work on that going forward.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I appreciate all that. One quick follow-up on the stress test. Is your expectation that it can be an RBC-based approach rather than a more bank-centric Tier 1 approach?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Well, as it was in the proposed stage, Randy, and again I know you're very familiar with this, but as it was in the proposed stage, I would say there were 2 things in there that were, I would say, question marks. I wouldn't say they were problematic. I just say they're question marks. One had to do with how they treat AOCI, accumulated other comprehensive income, and how they look at that from a standpoint of capital as AOCI goes up and down. The other one, which I think again reflects sort of bank-centric versus insurance-centric, has to do with separate accounts and the extent to which there are requirements for capital in separate accounts. In the insurance world, for the most part, separate accounts or fee-based businesses wouldn't require much, if any, capital against them. And that's certainly true for essentially all, not 100%, but for most of our separate accounts. So assuming we can get some reasonable resolution in those 2 areas, then I think they will have a set of requirements that could work for more insurance-centric organizations like Principal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz from Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First, I want to concentrate on the disability issue in the quarter, maybe a deeper dive there. Maybe you could offer -- I realize we're only 3 weeks into the year, but maybe -- or into the quarter, excuse me, but maybe what's going on there so far through October?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Okay. We'll have Dan talk to that, Steve.","Daniel J. Houston","Overall is -- again, kind of just focused on the group disability line for just a second, we do think it's a bit of an anomaly and not a trend here. We did see an elevation in both incidents as well as severity. Loss ratio, roughly 80% -- 85.5%. Trailing 12 months would be closer to the 75%. And ideally, we'd like to see this number closer to 70%. So we did do a deep dive on this business and looked hard at occupation, diagnosis, plan types. And what we think we have here is just a situation of just normal volatility and would anticipate it straightens out. Also, remember that disability represents only about 20% of our overall SBD line of business as measured by operating earnings. And that when we kind of look at what's happened so far in the fourth quarter, we're maybe trending back towards a more normal run rate for loss ratios. Does that help?","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, it does, thank you. And then just -- that's really what I wanted to ask. But just one off, Larry, obviously you've felt it important to mention the new operation in India. Obviously a very, very big market. What does it do for you that your current operation in India will not?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, Steve. What I would say is that the mutual fund industry in India -- with all due respect to Indian regulators, the mutual fund industry in India has been upside down for about 2 years now because the regulators, roughly 2 years ago, said that there would -- they would not allow any sort of front-end commissions in the mutual fund industry. And so the mutual fund sales, surprise, went down by about 90% overnight. So I think that the industry has been sort of searching for, if you will, an alternate strategy for how to drive mutual fund sales. And so we've done a lot of research, actual field research, that would seem to indicate that there is a subsegment of employers in India who sort of get it, that their employees are not going to be adequately prepared for retirement. There really is no particular system over there. There's no private system. There's really no public system. And so this is going to be an emerging area of concern, I think, for employers in India and employees in India. So our approach is to use the branding that we have as a global retirement leader to dialogue both with advisors as well as with some of the more global employers in India to try to educate them and ultimately convince them that by putting in place a sort of payroll deduction mutual fund platform, they can provide a valuable service to their employees and sort of help them begin to accumulate assets for retirement. So we're not sitting around anymore, kind of waiting for the regulators to ultimately put in place a more rational system. We think that the demand is already there, as evidenced through our research, and so we're going to go after it. And actually, we're pretty optimistic. It's going to take a while. It's not going to contribute a lot in the next year or 1.5 years, but it could make us a leader in a very big market over time.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Oh, that's very interesting. Is there a -- just as a follow-up, is there some type of tax advantage or tax deferral for retirement savings in India?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Well, it's just whatever the normal tax advantages would be relative to mutual funds. So mutual funds do enjoy some tax advantages, but there's nothing special, Steven, related to this particular platform. Again, think about it more like payroll deduct mutual funds.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, I had a question just on the pipeline for the FSA business. I think in -- Larry, in your remarks you said that the comps are difficult and the sales will grow. But I was wondering what you -- like, would you still grow off of this base? Or is there a chance that the deposits will actually shrink next year? And then given how strong the market has been, I'm assuming that in the PGI business, you'll have performance fees in the fourth quarter. If you could talk about that as well?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Okay, I'll have Dan comment on the first one. Jim can take the second one.","Daniel J. Houston","So pipeline still remains quite strong for the fourth quarter and for 2013. In the prepared comments, we mentioned a 30% growth for -- a projection for all of 2012, which I think you would agree is very strong. As we look at 2013, we would probably see something more in the lines of a single-digit growth rate, mid-single digit and a mix of that business being different. We're going to put more time and energy and resources across the small- to medium-sized market segment and again, manage that accordingly. But we feel very good about the pipeline, feel very good about 2013.","James Patrick McCaughan","On the incentive fees likely in the fourth quarter, Jimmy, it's true that the equity markets have been quite strong. But our incentive fees are on a number of areas, including currency funds, including some long\/short emerging market debt funds. So we have a diversified portfolio of business that has performance-related fees. If we -- it's obviously very difficult to say what this will be at the year end since we're more than 2 months away from the year end. But if you were to draw the line around now, you'd have an increment to earnings somewhere north of $5 million in the fourth quarter, in the range of $5 million to $10 million incremental earnings from the performance fees. And that would place the operating earnings on the Principal Global Investors line in the upper half of the twenties for the fourth quarter, meaning that the whole year would have a significant increment over last year. Now I would caution though that, that really does depend on how we do in the fourth quarter and that nothing is baked yet. But the seasonality of PGI's earnings towards the fourth quarter continues to be quite marked.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just one last one for Larry, just thinking about your long-term earnings growth guidance of 10% to 12%. In the near term, you're expecting growth to be about 4 percentage points below that, 6% to 8%, and I think the 2 main things you've mentioned are low interest rates and pressure on fees. And obviously, rates could go in either direction. But the fee pressure, I'd assume, is probably -- it's been compounding over the last few years, so it's not going to reverse. Maybe it stabilizes. So what gives you the comfort that, over the next 1, 2, 3 years, you can get to 10% to 12% rate? Is it growth in the International? Is it something else? Or what do you really need? Rates to be a lot higher? And are you assuming that the fee pressure completely goes away before you return to that rate?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, those are -- there's a lot baked into there, Jimmy, so I'll try to do my best. But the first thing I would say, of course, is that that 6% to 8% doesn't really -- which again is an OE growth rate, not an EPS growth rate. Again, I know -- I think you were clear on that. So the 6% to 8% OE growth rate doesn't really take account of the Cuprum acquisition. Okay? So that was -- we mentioned the 6% to 8% at Investor Day, which was prior to when we had announced the Cuprum acquisition. So what's actually going to happen, assuming again we get a close sometime in the first quarter, is that we are going to get a bump. We're going to get a bump in OE, we're going to get a bump in ROE, and we're going to get a bump in EPS from Cuprum. So I think what the reality is, is that we'll have to kind of reset everything for all of you once we get sort of -- we get that deal closed, we get that deal integrated. We'll kind of have to reset all of it. I do think that your comments, generally speaking, about where is the delta for the 4%, the difference between 6% to 8% and 10% to 12%, where is that delta coming from, it is coming more from interest rates than it is coming from fee pressure. And we're not necessarily assuming the fee pressure goes away. I think, as you indicated, it's probably more reasonable to assume that it stays at about the level it is today. But as Dan commented earlier, really, our focus is going to be to try to drive -- change kind of the mix of business. So volume of sales will be the same. It'll grow. But the mix of business will be a little bit more towards the smaller and medium size. Or quite frankly, we can drive more proprietary assets. So again, interest rates are going to continue to be a headwind. Cuprum is going to help us. And I think by the time we get done -- we remain very confident in that 11% to 13% EPS as a growth rate over time. And maybe in the near term, it's going to come a little bit more from OE growth, a little less from share repurchase. And then when we get into the back half of '13 and '14, it'll be more normal -- a combination of OE growth and share repurchase. That's probably more than you wanted, but I hope that helps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Following up on Jimmy's question about the interest rate pressure, what segments should we expect to see that? I assume Individual Life. But should we look at where the charges were taken in the third quarter as kind of a blueprint for where the interest rate pressure will show up the most?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, I'll have Terry make some comments, Sean. This is Larry. First, good to hear from you. I think this might be the first time that you've gotten in the queue. So thanks for that, I appreciate your work. Yes, the short answer is that Individual Life and fixed deferred annuity are going to be the primary areas. If you look at fixed deferred annuities, for example, we write -- we have been writing business since '09 with a 1% guaranteed minimum interest rate. But there is still old business at a 3% rate, and that's about half the block today. The other half, which is at the 1% rate, still has about 40 basis points of cushion left in it. So that would also be an area where there will be an impact of lower interest rates beyond Individual Life. But Terry, anything you want to add?","Terrance J. Lillis","Yes, I do. Thank, Sean. Sean, you referenced the display that we've provided. For the rest of you on the call, on the website, we have a breakdown of the unlocking that we did this quarter on a line-by-line basis, as well as by line of business basis, which may be helpful to see as well. But as you say, though, the Individual Life line will be the one affected most by the low interest rate environment. Now the fixed annuity -- fixed deferred annuity portion of the individual annuities will also be impacted as well. But other than that, the impact of the low interest rate environment somewhat has an impact on the economy and the size of our clients as much as anything else. So it does affect all of our businesses. But predominantly, those 2.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","And one follow up. The Principal International segment has seen some pretty steady deposit and flow growth. Is that coming primarily from BrazilPrev? Or can you talk about what you're seeing in other markets?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, the good news -- I'll have Luis make some comments, Sean. The good news was, as we said in the comments at the start of the call, we actually had positive net cash flow in every Principal International operating company. So as a general comment, we've actually seen better sales and flows out of the Asian companies, along with continued strong flows in LatAm. But I'll let Luis give you a little more insight.","Luis Valdez","Sean, yes, you're right. And it used to be essentially BrazilPrev and Brazil a year ago. Right now, we have a much more diversified source of net customer cash flows, as Larry said. The main contributor and the main change that we can see this year is particularly Asia. Asia has been much more dynamic, particularly Southeast Asia. So the $2.7 billion that you could see in our last quarter in net customary cash flows, half of that is coming from Brazil, essentially. And the rest is a combination between Asia and our -- and the other operations in Latin America. But in particular, what Larry said, all our operations are having positive net customer cash flows in the third quarter of 2012.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Does that help, Sean?","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question, I wanted to follow-up on Randy's line questioning on the whole thrift regulation. Larry, you mentioned 2 question marks, AOCI and guaranteed separate accounts, and I get those. But I think the bigger issue in my mind was how they were treating some of the regulatory capital, specifically the authorized control level capital and sort of subtracting that from Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. And I know that this featured in the presentation that your company gave to, I think, the Chicago fed earlier this summer. So can we read from the fact that you didn't mention that as a question mark that you've received some sort of clarity on how they're going to approach that?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","This is Larry, Suneet. I'm not aware of -- well, first of all, we haven't received any feedback on that. And the fact that I commented on AOCI and that I commented on guaranteed separate accounts is because I do think those are the 2 biggest levels. I don't remember exactly, I think that letter, Suneet, was like a 20-some page letter. So obviously, there's other stuff in there besides those 2. But I think those are really the 2 that I wanted to focus on.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I was actually referring to a presentation that you gave, but I can follow up later. My second question is, I kind of look at the quarter and I struggle here because if I go through the key highlights that you have in your press release, I think you used the word record 4 or 5 times. And I think there's very few companies in financials that are using that word in their releases. And then I look at, yes, the stock being down 3.5% today, and I look at companies like Ameriprise where they're not anywhere near records but they traded a much higher multiple on a price-to-book basis anyway. And so I guess what I struggle with, is should there be more of a balance between kind of near-term ROE and long-term ROE? I get a lot of what you're doing is for the long term, but I wonder if there should be maybe more of a focus on the short term? So I don't know if you have any comments on that.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Sure. Sure, Suneet. This is Larry. So I mean, again, let's think about, if we just look sort of quarter-over-quarter and again stripping out the impact of the DAC, as you can see from our slides, our view is that our EPS is up 10% sort of quarter-over-quarter. Our view of the year, again setting aside for a moment the DAC noise, is that we'll be very much in the range of that 11% to 13% growth in EPS, 2012 over 2011. I would argue, in a year that continues to have all the sort of economic challenges and all the market challenges that we all know are out there, for us to be able to grow our EPS at 11% to 13% over 2011. And 2011 was a very good year for us and would indicate that we do have momentum, we do have strength and we do have growth both in earnings and in EPS for our businesses. There again remain this number of headwinds around FX, around low interest rates and other things and, in the absence of that, of course you would see even stronger performance, both on an OE and EPS basis. Beyond that, what I'd say is we want to balance out -- we're taking a very long term strategic approach here, Suneet. And so what we want to do is we want to balance out, we want to make sure we're meeting our long-term EPS goals. We do not want to disappoint investors. And I would argue, with our 11% to 13% EPS growth rate, we're right on track with everything that we've said to investors. And in addition to that, I think we're making some very important, very significant long term strategic investments that are going to have dividends -- that are going to pay dividends and create value for shareholders over the longer term. I've been -- this is now my 41st year in the organization. I've never seen us do the kind of strategic acquisitions, 6 of them in total, that we've been able to do since the financial crisis. And so as I said earlier, we're definitely going to take advantage of that. And if that means that we come off of OE growth rate a little bit or we come off a share repurchase, because we'd rather invest to buy premium properties like Cuprum or we'd rather buy great, emerging market managers like Origin and Finisterre, this management team and this board believes that's the right thing to do. And we'll see what happens over the next 2, 3, 4 years. But I'm absolutely convinced that companies that create the long-term value are companies that both focus on OE growth but also invest for the future. And so that's what we're going to continue to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Following the Cuprum announcement, Moody's put out a release where they put you on a negative outlook. And within the text, they've suggested they may downgrade your ratings, depending on the amount of debt that you used to fund the deal. So I wanted to know if you still feel comfortable at this point with the original financing plan which includes $500 million of additional debt?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Ryan, this is Larry. I think the short answer to that is yes. But just to be sort of clear -- I was having actually a little bit of trouble hearing you, and so just to see if -- make sure that I'm clear here, what -- first of all, I'd say the rating agencies all responded in exactly the fashion that we would have expected as it relates to the Cuprum transaction. And so you would expect that they would go to a negative outlook pending the -- being able to see in 4 or 6 or 8 quarters kind of how the  integration and the earnings flow from the Cuprum business. So I think they reacted in an absolutely proper way. We had great conversations with them. I think they get it strategically. And now it's a question of we'll have to demonstrate the earnings growth coming out of that. So again, I would expect that, that negative outlook will get reversed. In terms of the financing plan, the market remains very open, certainly open for companies like Principal that are perceived as very solid companies with a good balance sheet. And when we did our $600-million debt offering, we had -- that was oversubscribed by a significant amount, let's say 8X to 10X. So there is a lot of interest and appetite in our name. And so I don't think -- we don't expect at this point, we don't expect any issues in completing the financing here in the very near future.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. So there's really no pushback from the rating agencies on the actual financing plan itself?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","No. They're well aware of our plan, and we're proceeding right down the path and having -- continuing good conversations. Don't expect any issues there.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. And a follow-up on your comment on 2013 capital management. You said -- I think what you said was that there may be a little bit of share repurchase in the back half of 2013 to offset dilution? What dilution are you referring to? Just the issuance of employee stock?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes. The issuance of employee stock, which typically happens for us in March of each year, Ryan.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My question is for Dan. And I continue to be -- it has to do with the profitability issue that to me, at least, continues to loom large over your business. My question is this: Principal -- it's my sense that Principal moved away from the smaller and mid-sized market in the last 2 years precisely because it was -- sort of the secret was out, it was getting more competitive, there were more players in the business. So I have a 2-part question. By going back to the -- by refocusing on the smaller market now, what has happened? Is it that profitability has been restored in that market? And secondly, what other things do you plan? What are the other elements of your plan to try to improve or stop this margin squeeze in what is still Principal's largest business, representing 30% of earnings, 401(k)?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Eric, good to hear from you. I'll let Dan take those questions.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes, good to hear from you, Eric. I think we would have to be careful and frank with the words I choose from time to time, because I've tried to stress that we balance it across the board, small, medium and large. And if you looked at large year-to-date, those over $50 million, it's about half those flows. And maybe it ought to be 60%, 40%. 60% on small to mid and 40% on large. So it's not in anyway trying to pull back but to effectively make a bigger investment, especially now that we have our TPA solution in place. It's working for us well. We have good, solid proprietary investment options. So I would say it's reinvigorating our focus on small- to mid-sized plans, also recognizing we added that ESOP capability. And it works really well. But as you know, it's very dilutive to the ROE measures. So we think the best way to go about rewarding shareholders is to see if we can't grow the return on net revenue and grow those net revenue fees for the small- to medium-size business. In terms of how -- what else are we doing here, Eric, it's around deploying our technology. We've got some pretty exciting stuff. We're using our presentations to advisors on the iPad. We are doing a lot online with our -- both our planned sponsors as well as our planned participants, and we'll look for continued efficiencies. But we've never abandoned that market. We think it's a great market. The one that you probably are -- the one I get concerned about is the, say, under 20 employees. Lots of turnover in that group. And again, that's very expensive business to have on the books for a short period of time and have it lapse. Hopefully that helps.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It does. Here is my one and only follow-up. You indicated a couple of times in this call that one of the reasons you like the smaller market is that you're able to use more principal funds in it, at least that's what I think I heard. I'm surprised. I would think that given the fact that mutual funds and mutual fund investing have become so much a part of life today in our country -- I mean, everybody in it seems to know about mutual funds. I mean, the paper everyday -- just given the public's broad knowledge of mutual funds and personal finance and all that, I would think that the demand for open architecture would be just as great in smaller companies as it is in larger companies. So how is it that you're able to get more principal funds into these smaller plans than in the larger ones?","Daniel J. Houston","So a good question to end on, Eric. In large part, it's because we've built that retirement investment services capability that allows us to go out and hire complementary managers to what we're doing at PGI, something we refer to as the foundation option. Small- to medium-size businesses advisors in many instances have the resources to do a good evaluation of the performance of managers. So our ability to combine that management capability among multi-manager, multi-style, multi-asset class yields a higher benefit to small- to medium-size employers than it might to the very largest employers where they could very well outsource that to a third party.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Zimpleman, your closing comments, please.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Well, thanks again to everybody for joining us for the call. Let me just close by reminding you of what John mentioned in the opening, which is our November 27 call where we'll discuss our outlook for our main business drivers going into 2013. Despite the headwinds, we continue to see strong momentum across our businesses, and our fundamentals remain solid. And our focus will be to stay with our investment management strategy and grow those fee-based businesses that gives us greater financial flexibility and the ability to create long-term value for shareholders through capital deployment.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Principal Financial Group's second quarter conference call. As always, our earnings release, financial supplement and slides related to today's call are available on our website at Principal.com\/investor. Following a reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO, Dan Houston and CFO, Terry Lillis, will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A are Nora Everett, Retirement and Income Solutions, Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors, Luis Valdes, Principal International, Deanna Strable, U.S. Insurance Solutions, and Tim Dunbar, our Chief Investment Officer.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the Company's most recent annual report on form 10-K and quarterly report on form 10-Q filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ","Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to announce two upcoming investor events. The first is on September 13th in Tokyo. Senior leaders from our Asian operations in Principal Global Investors and Principal International will present on the opportunities in Asia. Additional information is available on our website. Second, we're hosting an Investor Day in New York City on November 16th. Our executive team will provide an update on each of our businesses with a particular focus on some of the key topics in our industry.","We'll be e-mailing invitations for this event in the coming weeks. We hope you can join us for one or both of these events. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Houston","Thank you, John. I want to start by expressing my continued confidence in our strategy and our diversified integrated set of businesses that work well together through the lens of our client. I'd characterize our results through six months as strong, particularly so given the context of four macroeconomic headwinds impacting our businesses, volatile equity markets, volatile emerging markets and foreign exchange rates, low interest rates and growing demand for lower-cost investment options. Despite these pressures, over the trailing 12 months we've delivered more than $1.2 billion in operating earnings, $17 billion of net cash flows and a $33 billion increase in assets under management.","As shown on slide 5, strong investment performance remains a key contributor with 90%-plus of our Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trust above median for three- and five-year performance at the end of the second quarter. These results reflect several other strengths as well. I'll briefly share some thoughts on each of them, starting with our success managing the right active strategies.","While many other active managers are struggling, Principal Global Investors delivered $6.4 billion in positive net cash flows through the first half of 2016. The success reflects our focus on asset allocation, multi-asset, multi-manager strategies and our outcomes-based solutions. While volatile conditions remain, our strong net cash flows reflect strong underlying growth. We benefit again from a diversified business model, but more importantly, from how our businesses are integrated. Retirement and income solutions is central to that integration and our ability to meet customer needs throughout the spectrum of accumulation and retirement income stages. When full-service accumulation grows, it drives enterprise growth.","Increasing the pool of retirement assets for Principal Global Investors to manage as well as growth for our retail funds and annuity businesses and, of course, Principal Bank. The U.S. retirement industry is a competitive market. That said, we remain highly competitive and the fundamentals remain strong. We added 1,100 net new defined contribution plans over the trailing 12 months and nearly 100,000 new participants with account values. I'd also point to our exceptional joint venture partners. Despite the severe recession in Brazil we have nearly $4 billion of positive net cash flows through mid-year. Much can be attributed to the relationship with our partner, Banco do Brasil.","Another example is our joint venture with China Construction Bank. Over the trailing 12 months our pretax operating earnings in China have nearly tripled to $34 million. While the vast majority of China's assets under management growth and net cash flows this quarter were institutional and short term in nature, we're building momentum with retail investors. A couple additional points on our opportunity in China. First, an update on last quarter's announcement about the memorandum of understanding we signed with China Construction Bank to develop a new pension joint venture. Again, this is a longer term initiative but we're already dedicating resources. We're also doing a lot of work behind the scenes to share Principal's pension and asset management expertise with China Construction Bank and build relationships with leadership at their pension company.","Lastly, as the result of our long term commitment to China and strong relationship, I had the privilege of participating in the U.S.\/China Strategic Economic Dialogue in Beijing in June. This gave me an opportunity to further discuss our commitment to improving retirement readiness in China and to that end, the importance of Principal obtaining a pension license. The last area I will cover is our continued strong track record of execution. Specialty benefits is a great example. The level and consistency of growth and profitability in this business continues to be industry leading, reflecting our focus on small- to medium-size businesses, strong pricing discipline and strong claims management. Strong execution also applies to three other areas I've been highlighting with investors, our solution set, distribution and customer experience. ","Here are a few examples that reflect our ongoing effort to evolve the organization in these areas and position Principal for sustainable, profitable growth. I'll start with PlanWorks, our retirement readiness plan design. Through the first six months of 2016, we've increased the number of PlanWorks contracts by 25% compared to the same period a year ago and more than doubled the number of additional participants covered. While this is resource intensive and is accomplished one plan at a time, this work is moving the needle in two important ways. First, higher participation rates and the use of automatic deferral increases is contributing to growth in recurring deposits which are up approximately $500 million for the first six months of 2016.","Second, better participant outcomes contribute to continued strong contract level retention which is more than 97% through mid-year 2016. From a distribution standpoint, we continue to make meaningful progress getting our funds on third-party platforms, model portfolios and recommended lists. Through mid-year 2016 we put more than 20 different funds on nearly 20 different platforms, with success across equities, fixed income, as well as alternatives.","Moving to our solutions set, in addition to multiple fund launches in first half of the year we've positioned multiple offerings for the second half launch. Our global product strategy contemplates opportunities such as accelerating demand for income solutions due to the aging global populations, potential disruption from regulatory changes, as well as the trend toward lower-cost product structures. As one final example, I'll highlight our recent launch of online individual life and individual disability insurance purchasing portal. We're already seeing strong interest in the site that is producing leads and conversion to sales of nearly 10%. This demonstrates the need individuals have for these products and their desire to engage with us to further protect their financial future. ","Before I hand off to Terry, I want to provide a brief update on work we're doing to prepare for the implementation of the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. We're making significant progress working with multiple distribution partners to design an array of best-interest solutions and address changing business models. As we said last quarter, we believe we'll continue to lead the industry by creating sustainable solutions that meet the needs of the market, by managing assets appropriate for retirement and other of long term strategies and providing a diversified portfolio of in-plan offerings and systematic withdrawal solutions. ","Since the release of the final rule, our cross-business unit teams have gained a clearer understanding of the cost to cover training and system and product modifications to ensure we can continue to serve advisors and customers post implementation. We anticipate the increased cost will be approximately $1 million per month over the next 18 to 24 months. Once fully implemented we estimate the annual operational cost associated with the new rule to increase annual expenses by $5 million to $10 million.","In closing, again, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and we continue to position Principal for long term growth through strong execution and ongoing investments to enhance our competitive position. Terry?","Terry Lillis","Thanks, Dan. This morning I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter, net income, including performance of the investment portfolio and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. Our teams delivered strong results in the second quarter, proving once again that our diversified and integrated business model drives results despite some ongoing macroeconomic volatility. Second quarter total Company after-tax operating earnings were $337 million, the second highest on record. This was a 3% increase compared to the normalized year-ago quarter and an 18% increase over first quarter 2016.","As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to manage the long term growth rate of expenses in line with revenues and we'll continue to see a positive impact from that in the second half of 2016. Compared to second quarter 2015, the S&P daily average was more than 1% lower in second quarter 2016, resulting in lower fee income and impacting earnings on our fee-based businesses. However, compared to the first quarter, the daily average was up 6%.","Additionally, persistent low interest rates pressure our spread and risk-based businesses. Although the majority of our earnings come from our fee-based businesses, we're impacted by the low interest rate environment and as I'll discuss later in the call, we'll continue to work to mitigate that risk. As shown on slide 6, reported earnings per share were $1.15 for second quarter 2016, a 5% increase over the normalized year-ago quarter. We did not normalize any items in the second quarter as performance fees, claims and encaje performance were all within normal volatility.","I'll cover those items in more detail in the business unit sections. At the end of the second quarter, trailing 12-months return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.3%. This was down 140 basis points from the year-ago quarter, reflecting flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and lower prepayment activity.","Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on slide 7 with the RIS-fee businesses. Second quarter pretax operating earnings were $125 million, down 13% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues were negatively impacted by lower fee revenue and lower variable investment income, partially offset by diligent expense management. However, we've seen a strong 9% increase from the first quarter, reflecting growth in the business, improved market performance and continued expense management.","On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 29%. After normalizing for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 32% in second quarter 2016. Despite the ongoing competitiveness of the U.S. retirement market, we remain confident about our opportunities in this business. RIS-fee quarterly net cash flows were flat, reflecting the loss of one large client. The pipeline remains strong and we expect net cash flows to be at the upper end of our stated range of 1% to 3% of beginning-of-year account values.","Turning to slide 8, RIS-spread quarterly pretax operating earnings were $70 million, a 2% increase over the normalized prior-year quarter. Growth in the business was partially offset by a decline in variable investment income. On a sequential basis, growth in the business and higher variable investment income generated a 4% increase on pretax operating earnings. While full service payout sales were lower in the second quarter compared to record sales in the prior-year quarter, we still have a strong pipeline in our target market. On a trailing 12-month basis, second quarter pretax return on net revenue after adjusting for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review was 55%.","Turning to slide 9, Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $118 million, a 19% increase over the year-ago quarter and a 47% increase over the first quarter. Performance and transaction fees rebounded from the lower levels in the first quarter. Second quarter's fees are slightly above our long term quarterly expectations. However, on a year-to-date basis, these fees are in line with our expectations and are a good proxy going forward. Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to record assets under management, record operating earnings and positive net cash flows of nearly $6 billion, a contrast from recent trends in the active management space. On a trailing 12-month basis, the pretax return on adjusted revenues was 34% in the second quarter and within our targeted range.","Slide 10 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International were $70 million. Second quarter 2016 encaje performance was $5 million lower than expected on a pretax basis within expected volatility. Compared to the first quarter, operating earnings were up 3% due to the underlying growth of the business. Foreign currency tailwinds during the quarter were partially offset by headwinds from Latin American inflation. On a constant currency basis and adjusting for expected encaje performance, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in operating earnings and revenues.","Net cash flows for the second quarter were $3.2 billion, primarily driven by strong net cash flows within our two companies in Brazil, BrasilPrev and Claritas. BrasilPrev captured 59% of the open pension industry net deposits during the second quarter and Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil, generated $200 million of net cash flows in the quarter, demonstrating its strategic importance in this market. Although not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows of $3.2 billion for the quarter, our joint venture in China generated a record $45 billion of net cash flows in the second quarter but nearly all of the flows were short term in nature and with low basis-point fees. These institutional mandates carry no investment guarantees.","Turning to U.S. Insurance Solutions, it was a strong quarter with pretax operating earnings of $104 million, up 18% over the prior-year quarter. We also had nice top-line growth, with overall sales up 12% and premium and fees up 7%.","On slide 11, specialty benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were a strong $67 million, an increase of 29% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a favorable loss ratio. The loss ratio was driven by positive claims volatility within our expected range, continued investments in our claims process and technology and strong underwriting and renewal practices. We expect the specialty benefits loss ratio to trend back over the next few quarters towards recent trailing 12-month levels with normal quarterly volatility. Specialty benefit continues to deliver above-market growth with a 7% increase in premium and fees on a normalized trailing 12-month basis. Normalized pretax return on premium and fees and specialty benefits was very strong, at the top-end of our targeted range.","As shown on slide 12, individual life pretax operating earnings were $37 million for the quarter, a slight increase over the prior-year period, as growth was partially offset by slightly higher mortality. Normalized trailing 12-month premium and fee growth of 4% is within the targeted range. We continue to execute on our business market strategy, with sales in this market comprising more than half of the total individual life sales in the quarter. After removing the impact of the 2014 and 2015 third quarter actuarial reviews, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15%, reflecting favorable mortality results.","Corporate pretax operating losses were $55 million, reflecting the timing of some funded initiatives. We expect to be at the low end of our full-year range. For the quarter, total Company net income was $322 million, including net realized capital losses of $15 million. Credit-related losses continued to be lower than our long term expectations at $6 million. One risk the market has been focused on recently is the potential for an interest rate environment that stays low for a long period of time. With only 4% of our $573 billion of assets under management with a minimum guaranteed interest rate, we believe our exposures are manageable, given a business mix that's predominantly fee based, driving 70% of total Company operating earnings, a portfolio of guaranteed businesses that have varying levels of impact from interest rate risk, ongoing derisking activities in the design and distribution of guaranteed products and disciplined pricing as part of our asset liability management strategy.","I'll close with some comments on our capital management strategy. As outlined on slide 13, through the second quarter we've deployed $453 million of capital with a commitment of approximately $118 million for our third quarter common stock dividend. We continue to target $800 million to $1 billion for the full year. Our deployment strategy remains balanced as we look at multiple ways to add long term value for shareholders.","In second quarter 2016, we paid a $0.39 per share common stock dividend. Last night we announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $0.41 per share, payable in the third quarter, a 7% increase over third quarter 2015 on a trailing 12-month basis. In addition, we repurchased $104 million worth of common stock in the second quarter. We continue to execute on our Board authorized $400 million share repurchase program and as of today we have $250 million remaining in that program. We also deployed an additional $38 million in the second quarter as we increased our ownership in existing Principal Global Investor boutiques.","As I started out saying, we continue to benefit from our diversified and integrated business model in volatile macroeconomic environments. Second quarter was another great example of the strong fundamentals of our business as a result of focused execution and disciplined expense management. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","I think first one probably for Jim McCaughan. Was just hoping you could comment on the impact of Brexit that you're seeing so far on PGI clients, client activity, as well as if there's any structural implications for your business.","Dan Houston","I'll have Jim handle that from a boutique perspective. Then I'd like to also have Terry take a shot at answering as relates to our UK holding company. Jim?","Jim McCaughan","First thing I'd say on Brexit is we have a very substantial operation in London so that could be a factor longer term depending on how over the next two to three years the Brexit negotiations go. Our main international fund product is domiciled in Dublin which will remain part of the Europe Union. We have our investment advisor and mutual finds domiciled in Dublin. That will allow us access throughout Europe almost regardless of how the negotiations go. We also in the European Union, just for completeness, have offices in Munich, Amsterdam and Malta, all of which give us some flexibility about how we will domicile and manage different businesses depending on how the negotiations go, so we feel pretty well protected here. Our first concern is we have many nationalities in London.","It looks as if the ability of our various people in London to continue to be based there will be unimpaired, but that's something we're watching very carefully. That's probably our number one near term concern. As regards the clients, Ryan, we have actually seen if anything a boost to our business from the tensions within the European Union, if anything. Because largely what we're selling is global and dollar-based products which are extremely attractive in the very low interest rate environment you have in Europe. Europe has been a pretty good market for us.","Even if economies are somewhat negatively impacted by Brexit, both in Eurozone and in Britain, even if that happens, we would expect to continue to be in a pretty strong position as a fundamentally global and cross-border player.","Terry Lillis","Ryan, this is Terry. I'd just like to add a couple comments onto Jim's comments. We're obviously monitoring what's happening there. We do think it's going to take a while for it to actually unfold. We're looking at it, watching it, the opportunities that we have obviously there, they could be positive, they could be negative. But at the same time, we think this is a very efficient model for the UK holding company to help us to move capital efficiently and effectively around our operation, our international operation, both for international investment boutiques as well as our Principal International businesses. That said, we still will continue to monitor and look for additional options that we can do to take advantage if it does actually turn negative. At this point in time we're not anticipating any changes.","Dan Houston","Ryan, this is going to obviously play out over a long period of time. They've not even given their formal withdrawal notification at this point which could be sometime this fall, then they've got two years after that. We expect there to be a lot of negotiating and a lot of haggling between now and that point in time. Is that helpful?","Ryan Krueger","Different follow or separate question. In terms of Brazil, can you talk a little bit more about what you saw that led to such a big pick-up in the flows this quarter?","Dan Houston","Yes, I'll make kind of a broad comment and throw it over to Luis. Brazil gets in the headlines a lot. Obviously when your President's impeached, it's going to do that. Just as a reminder, when you think about Brazil, we know that there's relatively high inflation, there's high unemployment. We also know that in Brazil right now that we've got a rebound in the currency. The currency's up on a year-to-date basis about 22% and we know the stock market's up about 31%. So in spite of the Zika and the Olympics challenges, Brazil and in particular our partner, Banco do Brasil, has been very strong through this, for this first six months. Luis, you want to talk more about our business there?","Luis Valdes","Yes, Ryan. Certainly the new administration, the Temer administration, is having a profound impact about the moods in Brazil and certainly we're very much more confident that the recession is not going to be that tough as it was predicted for 2016. Even analysts are saying that probably in 2017 you're going to have probably a flat economy, if not a little bit positive. That is impacting a lot of moods for our clients and particularly we have been able to see a very important rebound in our activity in Banco do Brasil, particularly Brazilians continue saving money for their long term saving needs and retirement needs. It's very clear as well that for a long time the Brazilian government is going to be unable to put together some kind of strong pillar one for pensions so voluntary pensions and open pension companies are going to continue playing a very important role in that country. We remain very optimistic about our business in Brazil.","Operator","The next question will come from Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss","Want to ask a question on revenue growth, specifically within the retirement fee business. On a quarter basis year over year is down 5%. If we look trailing 12-months it's down 4% despite what appears to me flat asset levels over both those periods. I understand that flat markets, lower variable investment income, make it difficult to hit the growth targets but the decline there a little bit greater than what I would have expected. Just curious if this is indicative of fee pressure, asset mix shift or some other factor I'm not accounting for.","Dan Houston","You're certainly touching on some of the key drivers there. This business is a real flagship for the organization, has been for a long time, strong margins, strong growth. It's certainly a feeder to what Jim does within asset management. It supports the bank, [indiscernible] line, the mutual fund line for rollovers. We had a very difficult comparison to a year-ago quarter but with that said, I'm going to ask Nora Everett to weigh in and talk specifically about some of the challenges on the revenue line. My last comment of before throwing it over, a lot of credit to Nora and Greg Burrows and the team for really doing a nice job managing expenses to ensure that we're aligning our expenses with our revenues. Nora? ","Nora Everett","You've identified underperforming equity markets. You've identified the fact that we quarter-over quarter had the variable investment income down. What you're asking about is really the gap between account value growth and revenue growth. This is a gap that's been part of our business for many, many years. This isn't a new phenomenon. If you look quarter-over quarter sometimes can be a bit -- it can bounce back and forth, but if you look at a trailing 12-month period over the last many years, you're going to generally see that gap and remember, this is a growth gap. You're going to generally see that between 4% and 5%. Sometimes it's going to be more.","Sometimes it's going to be less. In a down market you might see that gap close a bit, but the fact there are many, many factors that are contributing to that. They're industry factors. There's product mix changes that you get in your block. There's business mix changes that you get in your block. Obviously there's investment mix changes that are going on, on a constant basis and then there's competitive pricing. I could go on and on. There are other factors, but you get the point. There are a number of different factors that are going to impact that delta between the account value growth and the revenue growth. We're seeing the impact of that as is everybody in the industry.","Dan Houston","Seth, was that helpful?","Seth Weiss","That's helpful. Thank you. I suppose I understand the delta when you have growing markets, given some of the fixed portion of the fees that come in. In flat markets, though, seeing that delta at that same 4% to 5%, you start to question in terms of sort of the structural pressures.","I guess, Nora, you're touching on that on sort of the fees and asset mix shifts. What I wanted to shift to and Dan you alluded to it on the expense management side and the quarter beat particularly within our RIS-fee and PGI really seemed to be on the expense side. I was encouraged to see those expenses really flat to down. Was curious if you could speak about that maybe on a global level in terms of what you're doing on expenses and how sustainable that is going forward.","Dan Houston","Good question. The first thing I'd say is there's not an across-the-board mandate to reduce expenses. What we've tried to always do, Larry did it, Barry did it, Terry's certainly been at the forefront of this as we've migrated the Company, is to really look at the revenues that we're generating and what expenses are necessary in order to get a delta between the two. That's where our focus is on. Again, not anything across the board but by business unit within Jim's operations and Nora's and Deanna's and Luis', as well as across corporate, we're looking at how do we line those expenses for the revenues we're able to create. It doesn't happen overnight. I would tell you, we've been at this now for -- it's an ongoing effort and we're going to continue to focus on that.","At the same time, what I would tell you is we're making the investments where we need to make investments. We have to make an investment in DOL. We have to make an investment in technology. We have to make sure our products are relevant. Part of the of diminution of the revenue stream that Nora mentioned was around investment mix. If someone chooses a collective investment trust that has a similar investment strategy but the underlying revenue associated with it is less, that's good for the customer, good for the participant, good for the advisor and we need to recognize we have a little bit less revenue coming in.","This won't go away at the end of this quarter or the next quarter. It's something we're going to continue to keep top of mind. At the same time, never put the mission and the strategy of the organization at risk. Is that helpful?","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Kovac with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kovac","If I could follow up on some comments that I believe Dan made in the opening remarks on the DOL and appreciate the increased disclosure there. First one is related to the new solutions that you mentioned, could you provide us more context of what that is and how that compares to the current business mix in terms of both product and then potentially margin?","Dan Houston","I'd be happy to do that. I'm actually going to have a number of us take a shot at this because it's a good opportunity to really speak to some of the underlying details of DOL. I think about it impacting in three different areas. One area which Deanna will cover, is around Principal Advisor Network, our 1200 advisors that are out there every day supporting small- to medium-size businesses and their business owners. Nora, on the retirement space, of course we have impact on our ability to attract and retail rollovers at benefit event for job changers and retirees. Of course, within Jim's organization we have the mutual fund company and certainly could impact DCIO as well. With that, Deanna, do you want to make comments on PAN?","Deanna Strable","Just a couple of comments. Some of this will add onto some of the comments I made in last quarter's results. I think the first thing to keep in mind, as Dan mentioned, we have 1,200 kind of proprietary advisors across the United States and I think the first thing to remember is they sell across the broad range of products that we offer here in the U.S.. Actually if you look underneath that, the majority of that system's revenue are actually coming from products that are not impacted by the DOL regulation. That could be obviously our life insurance business, disability insurance business, group benefits as well as non-qualified transactions across retirement and PGI.","I think that's the first thing that is great to understand. And then I think underneath that, obviously the final regs do have a path forward for proprietary products and even today our affiliated advisors already have choice between different types of products as well as different proprietary and nonproprietary offerings. We think that puts us in a good stead to continue to offer them a competitive set of products and solutions but also put us in a good stead going forward. I spend a lot of time with these advisors and I continue to have confidence that they already properly evaluate their customers' needs and make recommendations that are in the best interest of the customer.","I think even though this is going to put some additional compliance and monitoring relative to that, as we leverage the [indiscernible] for both our retail and retirement plan business, I do feel that both the current business model of those advisors as well as the processes and training we'll be putting in place, really do provide a path forward for this part of the business and how it interacts with all of our product solutions.","Nora Everett","Sure. Mike, you asked about solutions and I'll look at it you through the retirement plan lens. We're actually really, really confident in our ability to work with our alliance partners because we're out there working with them right now. They're going to make decisions about their business model and we're ready to execute on that. We've already got a couple things that are in place. We actually have services and products that are in place that already address the DOL rule, levelized commission structure for the broker dealers. Most of our dealers already use this levelized comp solution that we have.","We've already got a zero-revenue share investment platform for both of our fee-based and commissioned advisors. That's where we collect administrative fees from participants directly, another solution under the DOL rule. We already have an integrated third-party investment fiduciary service, so that's an example of a product and service that we've had in place for many years. That's going to directly address the DOL, one of the models that many of our advisors may choose to outsource that third-party investment fiduciary piece. We have a number of in-plan solutions. The new option, obviously, for all of us in the industry is what we call the BIC, the best interest contract.","As we're out there talking to our distribution partners, we're finding that many of them are going to look and probably execute under the BIC. We're working with them to help design our end of that equation that then hooks into their end of that equation. The platform exception is one other example, prepackaged investments. We're having discussions around that. Bottom line is we've got a lot that's already in place and actually we've been executing on it for a number of years and we're out there with our alliance partners. Many, many of them may be leaning to the BIC and we'll be ready to go on that front.","Jim McCaughan","Thanks, Dan. In the mutual fund business the adverse impact for the business generally will be around moves towards lower-cost share classes. For us, a move to lower-cost share classes basically means share classes without a 12b-1 fee or a front-end load. But that move has been going on anyway for several years. For example, 70% of our A shares in our mutual fund business is already load waved, so it's a pretty small minority of our mutual funds where we have a front-end load. That will eventually go away, perhaps accelerated by the implications of the DOL rule, but it's a pretty small amount for us and currently we're collecting around $5 million annually from the entire front-end loads. That is a pretty modest impact and it will go away gradually.","On the 12b-1s, those are basically a pass-through for our business. They're a way that advisors get paid and then it's passed through by the fund company, so the effect of 12b-1s going away should in the end be negligible over the period it happens. We don't see that as having a big implication. It's all part of the general fee erosion which is happening in mutual funds which just means we have to get more efficient. I think also I'd be remiss if I didn't point out a couple of opportunities.","One is if you look around at retirement platforms in the industry generally, there may be a move away from poorer performing or less well designed proprietary products. That will be an opportunity for us to offer our products in a defined contribution investment only basis and we're increasing our resources devoted to finding those clients.","Secondly, on the efficiency point, I'd remind you we did a business integration announced early last year of our fund company with Principal he Global Investors. That is enabling us to grow the business without adding cost. It wasn't done as a cost take-out. We haven't had any reduction in forces consequent on that operation, but it's an opportunity for us to gradually redeploy people, become more efficient and actually do more business with our existing team.","Dan Houston","Thanks, Jim. Mike, just maybe three closing comments on this topic and it's probably more than you asked for as relates to DOL specificity. When you look at the cost, the underlying cost, there's a lot of training and a lot of education and a lot of development within our own staff, within our own call centers, within Principal Advisor Network, within our partners. That contributes certainly to the cost. ","The second is, as you heard from Deanna and Nora and Jim, a lot of this has to do with adapting current product to retrofit it to work with the marketplace. It's not going to require refiling. A lot of what we have is going to be able to be modified to work. Lastly, I would tell you we're on our front foot in working with our distribution partners. They embrace the conversation. They want to have the conversation. And we're feeling pretty optimistic about how we can work our way through the DOL reg. Any additional comments?","Michael Kovac","Just a numbers question. You gave us some increased disclosure in terms of what the compliance costs would be. Can you sort of break down what you're putting into that $5 million to $10 million go forward and maybe $18 million to $24 million upfront? Is that sort of all retraining or some of these product sort of shifts that you've mentioned also in those numbers?","Dan Houston","That's D, all of the above. It was our attempt to try to capture as much as we could. We're not going to go into the nitty-gritty detail of breaking each one of those down. Each one of our service support areas, each one of our BUs, distribution areas, did the best job they could to quantify what they thought they would have invested and making the modifications around training, around development, around modifying the products themselves. We think it's our best guess and as Terry always reminds me, it will be wrong. Just a matter of degree of being wrong. But we feel pretty good about the number in total. Thank you for the question.","Operator","The next question will come from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","The question related to the China business over there. You mentioned a lot of the inflows in the quarter were institutional money. Were they predominantly related to a single party or was it a more broad base of clients?","Dan Houston","Humphrey, good question and one that Luis is all too familiar with. Luis?","Luis Valdes","As you know, let me try to provide some background in China. The Chinese government has been very focused on deleveraging that economy. In line with that, CCB Bank, our partner, has been very focused in order to work and increase the quality of their loan portfolio in their bank. Having said that, in the of last quarter instead of to loan money which is going into bank deposits, they decided to invest that money in short term fixed income and they moved that money essentially into our JV, our asset management company.","The source of that money is, that is the source of that money. Having said that, that is why we got $45 billion in net customary cash flows. This is China. But none of that money that I mentioned to you coming from CCB bank. Out of that, $2 billion or $3 billion are part of our underlying long term saving mutual fund retail business. That is essentially from where that money's coming from.","Humphrey Lee","Staying on the topic of China, so recently there's some discussion about the Chinese government is curbing the wealth management product and kind of maybe limiting the options available to retail clients. My understanding is for fixed income funds would probably be less affected. My understanding is your JV's [indiscernible] offering very strong in the fixed income component. Maybe you can talk about some of the regulatory changes there and maybe opportunities there going forward.","Luis Valdes","That is a good question. The Chinese government has been very eager and keen to try to, I would say, reduce the activity related with the wealth management products, also trying to manage in some way all the shadow banking and also other type of activities and lending activities that you might have there. We're not reporting and we never have reported any kind of wealth management productivity and in our JV, we don't have almost nothing in a very small part of our asset management in the JV that we're not reporting that money, is that kind of wealth management product. But we have a very marginal activity in that part of the business in China in our JV.","Humphrey Lee","But then if there's a greater demand for kind of fixed income type mutual funds, maybe talk about your product offering of the asset management platform of the JV and how you can maybe capitalize the opportunities there.","Luis Valdes","What we're doing even -- you have to consider the China mutual fund industry is a very short term oriented by nature. What we're doing, we're moving and shifting our strategy in order to be a long term saving provider in China. It looks difficult but we're going to do it and it's going to be a long march in China.","As an example, we just launched a final fund presently in the month of July and that's allowing us to really, really offer different kind of solutions, balanced funds and asset location products to our clients. The idea is to expand that offering into the bank platform in order to start moving and continue moving and shifting our strategy towards more long term oriented funds in China. We do think that we do have a very good opportunity in order to do that and we're going to continue moving our JV in that direction.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].The next question will come from Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet Kamath","I wanted to start with Terry on capital deployment. If I think about the $800 million to $1 billion guidance for the year and I think about what you've done and sort of what you've committed to, I think I'm getting pretty close to the high end of that range. What are the chances of perhaps an upsize to that $800 million to $1 billion target for 2016?","Terry Lillis","This is Terry. $800 million to $1 billion is what you mentioned. We look at this as a balanced approach of capital deployment to our long term shareholders' strategy and value. Most of our businesses like we talked about in the past are fee-based businesses which generates a lot more of that capital earnings that are available. As you look at that $800 million to $1 billion, we've already made a pretty good dent in it already in terms of capital that we've deployed in the first half of the year as well as we've committed to.","We announced our increase in the third quarter dividend up to $0.41. We're pleased with that. We're progressing towards that 40% payout ratio. We're continuing to move towards that. Acquisitions, we put more into the boutique strategy which is part of our long term strategy, buying part of additional shares of Finisterre origin, CCI as well as Claritas. That's a good, consistent process that we've been having in place for a long time. The share buyback program, you're aware that we had a $400 million authorization in February. We're executing on that, as I stated in the comments that we've executed. We still have $250 million of authorization going forward.","So far what we've deployed and committed is over $600 million so far. Now, we have options for the rest of the year. Hopefully we'll pay out a dividend in the fourth quarter which we assume will happen and M&A activity, we're always looking for options and opportunities there. Share buybacks, as I mentioned just a few moments ago, $250 million of that authorization. With the low interest rate environment right now, Suneet, there's some opportunities. There's some opportunities to actually execute on some of our debt maturities that we have coming up. We have, in 2017, we have $300 million and that's at a 1.8% coupon. 2019 we have a $350 million which is at a high 8 7\/8% coupon.","We have an opportunity to actually execute on that, enhance the overall return to the organization and reduce our leverage ratio. Right now we're under 24%. We're marching towards 20%, so we have options. Now, are we going to exceed that $1 billion? I can't say at this point in time, because as I mentioned, share buybacks and some of those upper opportunities will continue to unfold as the year goes on. But if you look back to last year, if you look back to 2015, we said that $800 million to $1 billion and we were a little bit over that, $1.07 billion which was about 90% of our net income. We're continuing to deploy capital in what we believe is a balanced approach to enhance the long term shareholder value. So stay tuned.","Suneet Kamath","I had one other one for Dan if I could. On the DOL, on prior calls we've talked about maybe one of the benefits of the DOL is that you'd retain more assets perhaps in the FSA accounts, just on lower rollover activity. As I've been thinking about that, given the high level of retention that you have on rollovers and into Principal product and my view that maybe the margins in those products that the assets are rolled into are higher than FSA, I'm trying to figure out, when we net it all together, if that ends up being a positive thing from a margin perspective or if it actually kind of works against you a little bit.","Dan Houston","No, I actually think it's a plus. I mean, at the end of the day we're here to serve the needs of the customers. These participants have long term needs, in large part how to convert these lump sums into lifetime income. It's frankly one of the reasons why I like this diversified model that we have. Whether it's purchasing an income annuity, whether it's having some sort of drawdown strategy, whether it's investing in an asset allocation strategy that allows for income and retirement or whether or not they want to purchase CDs from the bank, there's so many different -- so much optionality for a retiree and benefit event. Will there be a longer disclosure process at benefit event? ","Yes. Will we be able to operate very much like we have in the past? I think so, with the appropriate amount of disclosure and we have really competitive products. Whether the money stays in the plan or goes into one of the rollover products, I feel very optimistic about our ability to maintain and perhaps enhance margins in the post DOL regulatory environment. Appreciate your question. Thank you.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A session. Mr. Houston, your closing comments, please.","Dan Houston","Again, thanks for joining us this morning. We feel good about the quarter. It was a very strong quarter. We think that the diversified and integrated business model is the right model for Principal against fee and spread and the risk businesses. We're going to continue to enforce a disciplined approach to expense management. It served us well in the past. It will continue to do in the future. As Terry was talking there, we're going to take this very long term, balanced approach to capital deployment. Whether it's through acquisition, investing in our organic growth, paying down debt, dividends, et cetera, but again, those are heavily vetted. They're thought through. We discuss them with the Board at length. Again, we're doing the best job we can to support the interest of the long term shareholder.","With that, have a great day. Hopefully we'll see you in Tokyo, New York or somewhere else on the road. Have a great day. Bye.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

There will be a question-and-answer period after the speakers\u2019 have completed their prepared remarks. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference call over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Principal Financial Group's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As always our earnings release, financial supplement and slides related to today's call are available on our website at www.principal.com\/investor.","Following a reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO, Larry Zimpleman; and CFO, Terry Lillis, will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A are Dan Houston, Retirement and Investor Services and U.S. Insurance Solutions; Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors; Luis Valdes, Principal International; and Dennis Menken, Vice President of our Investment Team.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The company does not revise them or update them to reflect new information, subsequent events or changes in strategy. Risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Before we get to the prepared remarks I'd like to announce some upcoming investor events. First, on the afternoon of November 21st we will host an event in New York City to provide an update on Principal Global Investors; our asset management business. Details are available on our website. We are also planning an update in the spring on Principal International\u2019s Latin American businesses. That event will be held Santiago, Chile on March 11. We hope that many of you are able to attend these events. Finally our 2015 outlook call will be held on morning of December 8th. We will provide call-in information closer to that date. ","Now I would like to turn the call over to Larry.","Larry D. Zimpleman ","Thanks, John, and welcome to everyone on the call. As usual, I'll comment on three areas. First, I'll discuss third quarter and year-to-date results. Second, I'll provide an update on the continued successful execution and long-term benefits of our strategy; and I'll close with some comments on capital management.","As John mentioned slides related to today\u2019s call are on our website. As you can see on slide four total company quarterly operating earnings of $354 million made this our third straight quarter of record earnings. As Terry will discuss the results included a $39 million benefit from our annual review of actuarial assumptions and methodology. However even adjusting for this we consider third quarter to be another strong quarter. ","Third quarter results combined with a strong first half resulted in year-to-date 2014 operating earnings of $994 million. This is a 28% improvement over year-to-date 2013 results on a reported basis and a 23% improvement when adjusting for the actuarial assumption review. This is an outstanding result despite continued macroeconomic volatility and reflects the strength of our diversified business model and the ongoing momentum in our businesses. ","Assets under management were $514 billion at quarter end, down 1% from mid-year. The strengthening of the US dollar reduced assets under management by $9 billion for the quarter. Solid sales and retention contributed to $2.7 billion of total company net cash flows for the quarter and $18 billion over the trailing 12 months. This demonstrates the competitiveness of our businesses, the outstanding investment performance we are generating and the strength of our distribution partnerships across the organization.","Following our additional key growth metrics from the quarter, full service accumulation quarterly sales were $1.8 billion. We continue to strike the right balance between growth and profitability. Third quarter recurring deposits increased 9% over the prior year period reflecting the recovering economy and improving deferral rates as our retirement readiness initiatives started to take hold. Principal Funds had strong sales of $5.2 billion for the quarter. Net cash flows were $1.4 billion. This is Principal Funds\u2019 19th straight quarter of positive net cash flows. At 8% of account value Principal Funds net cash flows were almost three times the industry. ","Principal Global Investors had $500 million of unaffiliated net cash flows which contributed to unaffiliated assets under management of $114 billion at the end of the third quarter. Total assets under management in Principal Global Investors were $307 billion. ","Principal International\u2019s assets under management increased 13% over the prior year quarter to $116 billion despite the strengthening of the dollar. Coming off record net cash flows in the second quarter Principal International delivered strong third quarter net cash flows of $2.5 billion driven by continued strength in Brazil. ","Specialty benefits premium and fees increased 9% over third quarter 2013 as a result of record third quarter sales and strong persistency. In plan growth over the past 12 months was 1.5%, the highest level since 2006 signaling more sustainable job growth. We continue to deliver products and solutions that are in demand with a focus on providing financial security to business owners, individuals and investors around the globe. We remain confident about our competitive positioning and our ability to continue to grow our businesses into the future. ","Next I will provide a few updates on the continued execution of our strategy. Many of you had the opportunity to attend our investor event in September with members of our US Retirement Leadership team as they discussed the Principal remains competitive and is a retirement leader with key differentiators like Principal Total Retirement Suite and Retire Secure. These innovative approaches build stronger relationships with advisors, client sponsors and participants driving better persistency. ","We are also focused on addressing retirement income gaps through our retirement readiness program called Principal Plan Works. Plan Works encourages plan level features such as auto enrollment and auto escalation to drive improved participation in deferral rates. Additionally we recently rolled out a new participant website designed to provide participants a quick view of their retirement savings and drive them to take action to improve their retirement readiness. ","As slide five shows investment performance continues to be very strong and is a leading indicator of growth for our retirement and investment management businesses. At least 85% of Principal Funds investment options were in the top half of Morningstar rankings on a one, three and five year basis at quarter end. Principal Funds continues to perform very well. Funds had record operating earnings in the third quarter demonstrating our ability to turn the strong growth in recent years into bottom line results. Principal Funds continues to have great success executing on a strategy focused on asset allocation, multi-manager funds that address risk and income needs. 65% of Principal Funds assets under management are in Morningstar rank four and five star funds. We continue to expand on our outcome based funds lineup and enhance our investment platform. Through the third quarter we have launched four new fund products this year and anticipate launching three more in December and up to five more in 2015. ","Principal Global Investors made two strategic announcements in the third quarter that enhanced our successful multi-boutique strategy; first, we announced the Principal Real Estate Investors, a dedicated real estate group of Principal Global Investors partnered with Macquarie Group to create a nationwide commercial lending platform known as Principal Commercial Capital. Principal Real Estate Investors will provide its underwriting and loan origination expertise but will not take on the balance sheet risk. ","In addition we announced that Principal Global Investors has increased its ownership stake in Columbus Circle Investors from 70% to 95% with plans to acquire the remaining 5% over the next two years. Columbus Circle has performed exceptionally well since we first acquired a majority ownership in 2005 with assets under management quadrupling over that time. Investment performance was strong and we retained all of the key investment staff. This boutique remains an important part of our overall investment management strategy as it invests on behalf of all of our platforms. ","Principal International had another quarter of record operating earnings despite continued macroeconomic headwinds. On a local currency basis operating earnings once again grew at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year quarter. A combination of our investment management expertise, our ability to effectively manage the business at a local level and our relationships with marquee distribution partners positions Principal International for continued long-term growth and success. An example of our strong distribution partnerships is the success of our joint venture in Brazil, BrasilPrev. ","On the trailing 12 months basis BrasilPrev garnered 58% of net deposits in the Brazilian open pension market moving them into the number two spot for pension providers based on assets under management. This underscores the strength of Banco Brasil\u2019s distribution reach and demonstrates the powerful long-term opportunities for BrasilPrev. Additionally we continue to focus on maximizing the voluntary savings opportunities in Chile. Cuprum voluntary sales increased 29% and net cash flows for voluntary products were five times higher than the year ago quarter\u2019s results. ","I also want to mention the continued strong performance from our Specialty Benefits Division. Our team continues to do an excellent job of maintaining above market growth with sound pricing discipline resulting in better than expected loss ratios. Providing leading employee benefit solutions to small and medium size businesses continues to be an important part of our strategy in the United States. ","Next I will comment on capital management. Our fee based business model allows us to generate free cash flow and strategically deploy it to create long-term value for shareholders. We remain well positioned to deploy capital through a variety of options in addition to supporting organic growth. Last night we announced a $0.34 per share common stock dividend payable in the fourth quarter. This brings the annual 2014 common stock dividend to $1.28 up 31% over full year 2013. The merger and acquisition pipeline remains active with opportunities to further enhance our global investment management platform. ","In closing I want to point out two third-party recognitions we received. I am especially pleased because both of these recognize our commitment across the entire company on corporate responsibility and sustainability. First, Principal Real Estate Investors recently received a Green Star designation for three funds from the 2014 global real estate sustainability benchmark survey including achieving the number one ranking out of 64 opportunistic investment strategy funds. Green Star is the highest ranking this organization provides.","In addition the Principal was recently recognized as a leader among S&P 500 companies by the environmental non-profit organization, CDP for its actions to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the business risk of climate change. We take being a socially responsible company very seriously and are proud of our recent recognitions of our efforts. ","Before I turn it over to Terry I just want to take a minute to note that yesterday was the 13th anniversary of our initial public offering. At that time we had approximately $100 billion in assets under management and a solid position in the U.S. insurance and retirement markets. Our aspiration was to become recognized as a global leader in the mutual funds and asset management areas. ","Since going public we\u2019ve generated nearly $150 billion in net cash flows and assets under management have grown to over $500 billion. That\u2019s our compounded annual growth rate of over 12% which is 2.5 times the growth of the S&P 500. But as pleased as we are about our results to date we are even more excited for the growth opportunities that lie ahead of us. Terry?","Terrance J. Lillis","Thanks Larry. This morning I will focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter, net income including performance on the investment portfolio and an update on capital deployment. Third quarter continued to build on our strong first half of 2014. Total company operating earnings of $354 million were up 31% over the prior year quarter. On a reported basis operating earnings per share were a record $1.19, a 32% increase over third quarter 2013 results. ","Total company operating earnings for 2013 were a record $1.1 billion. Year-to-date 2014 operating earnings of $994 million are already 94% of that amount. We continue to successfully execute on our strategy and momentum continues to build across our businesses. With our continued shift towards a fee-based business model we\u2019re increasingly well positioned for long-term growth. During the quarter we completed our annual actuarial assumption and model review. The impact from the review was predominantly recognized in the Individual Life division. ","Individual Life had a net operating earnings benefit of $39 million or $0.13 per share. In third quarter 2012 we made a significant change in our long-term interest rate assumption and guide path. Thus the current year impact from the continued low interest rate environment was minimal. The benefit this quarter in Individual Life was driven by several updated assumptions and model enhancements including refined coverage periods and policy specific premiums. ","On slide six we normalized third quarter 2014 earnings for two additional items. First, the encaje return in Principal International was $12 million or $0.04 per share better than expected. The higher than expected encaje returns are reflected in Street earnings expectations for the quarter and are consistent with the encaje return information available on the website we provided in the past. ","Next, Individual Life claim adversely impacted earnings by $10 million or $0.03 on a per share basis. Analysis of claims points to random volatility which is inherent in risk-based businesses. Given what we have seen in the last few quarters we continue to analyze the results and we\u2019ll communicate any changes to our expectations if deemed necessary. On a normalized basis, earnings per share were a $1.05 up 13% over normalized prior year quarter. ","At quarter end return on equity excluding AOCI was 14.1%. This is a 220 basis points improvement from a year ago. Organic growth contributed a 145 basis points of the increase as operating earnings improved 26% while mean equity increased only 6%. ","Operating earnings during this time period benefited from favorable equity markets and high variable investment income which were partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and higher than expected mortality. We\u2019re still targeting 50 to 80 basis points of annual return on equity expansion as the strength of our diversified business model continues to provide many growth opportunities both domestically and internationally. ","Now I\u2019ll discuss business unit results. Retirement and investor services delivered its eight straight quarter of double-digit operating earnings growth. For the accumulation businesses operating earnings were a $180 million, an increase of 19% over the year ago quarter. ","Slide seven shows that the net revenue was up 11% over third quarter 2013 and up 12% on a trailing 12 month basis.","Trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue improved to 34%. All-service accumulation operating earnings were $113 million, a 24% increase over the year-ago quarter. Net revenue growth of 9% combined with expense discipline resulted in an improvement in the trailing 12 month pretax return on net revenue to 35%. This margin has been held by the strong equity market returns over the past year and some positive one-time items that we have discussed in previous calls.","Net cash flows for full-service accumulation were slightly negative for the quarter. In light of our shift in focus on asset sales to new business revenue we have become more selective on new sales, particularly at the large end of the market. We are increasingly focused on two measures, first on planned retention which was very strong at 97% year-to-date, up 100 basis points from a year ago and second, on capturing more assets to principle branded funds which is up 5 percentage points to 73% year-to-date on new sales reflecting strong investment performance. ","Principal Fund\u2019s third quarter operating earnings were up 25% from a year ago quarter to a record $28 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenue was up 14% and operating margins continued to improve due to the scale-based nature of the business. For the quarter, Principal Fund sales were $5.2 billion, contributing $1.4 billion in net cash flows. Strong investment performance and are focused on outcome oriented products have led strong sales across multiple asset types. ","Individual Annuities operating earnings was $31 million for the quarter. The increased fee revenue on our variable annuity business due to market appreciation continues to offset spread compression on our fixed deferred block of business.","Looking at slide eight, the guaranteed businesses within Retirement and Investor Services continue to perform as expected. We continue to approach these businesses opportunistically. ","Turning to slide nine, Principal Global Investors quarterly operating earnings were $25 million, a 10% improvement over the year-ago quarter. Trailing 12 months pretax margin was 25%, slightly below our expectation of 26% to 28% for the year. Fourth quarter 2013 benefited from large performance fees which lowered the trailing 12 month pretax margin by approximately 100 basis points. We still anticipate increasing to a 30% pretax margin. We expect 2014 revenue in this business to be similar to 2013 levels. While management fee should grow in line with assets under management performance fees are less likely to reach 2013 levels. ","Third quarter net cash flows from our fee base products were nearly $750 million which is partially offset by our opportunistic approach to the guaranteed business. Net cash flows at post advisory groups improved dramatically with only modest outflows during the quarter reflecting some rebalancing occurring in high yield. Quarterly performance remained in the top quartile. ","Assets under management for Principal Global Investors increased 9% over the prior year quarter to $307 billion. Unaffiliated asset under management ended the quarter at $114 billion, a 7% increase over the year-ago quarter.","Slide 10 shows record quarterly operating earnings for Principal International of $74 million, up 46% increase on a reported basis. As pointed out earlier results in the current quarter were helped by higher than expected encaje returns in Chile. While the strengthening of U.S. dollar dampens growth from comparing prior period results Principal International continues to perform well on a local currency basis. Operating earnings were up 12% over the prior year quarter after adjusting for normalizing items. On a trailing 12 month basis combined net revenue was up 20%, above our 16% to 18% expectation due to the strong encaje returns. Combined pretax return on net revenue was 52% on a trailing 12 month basis at the top end of our range. ","As show on slide 11 Individual Life\u2019s operating earnings were $52 million for the quarter, impacted by the items previously discussed. ","Moving to slide 12, Specialty Benefits\u2019 operating earnings of $31 million were roughly flat with the year ago quarter while the quarterly premiums and fees were up 9% over the year ago quarter. The loss ratio for the quarter remained strong at 64.5% relative to our 65% to 71% targeted range. The more favorable claims and strong growth in the current quarter were offset by lower expenses in the prior year quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis premium and fees were up 6%. This is above our expectation of 3% to 5% growth for the year. Trailing 12 months pretax operating margin of 11% is inline with our expectations. ","For the quarter total company net income was $241 million, including realized capital losses of $55 million. Net credit related losses continue to be in line with expectations. We saw improvement in the commercial mortgage backed securities asset class with impairments of only $15 million in the quarter. Net income was negatively impacted by $58 million to the Chilean tax Reform Bill that was signed into law during the quarter. ","The tax rate will increase overtime so the impact to operating earnings will be gradual. However, we adjusted our deferred tax liability for the ultimate tax rate in the third quarter. Unrealized gains were $2.8 billion at quarter end. As a reminder because of our strong asset liability management changes in net unrealized gains or losses due to interest rate movements do not result in an economic impact. ","Our asset liability management expertise combined with strong liquidity allows us to avoid forced asset sales in periods of stress. In addition our predominantly fee-based business model limits our sensitivity to interest rate movements. As outlined on slide 13, our approach to capital deployment is balanced and focused on increasing long-term value for shareholders. ","We\u2019ve now announced plans to deploy more than $855 million of capital in 2014, well above our $500 million to $700 million stated range for the year. In addition, to the third quarter common stock dividend and increased ownership in Columbus Circle Investors we repurchased $72 million of common stock during the quarter. We still have $50 million remaining from the previously announced share repurchase program. ","In closing there are some macro-economic factors providing significant headwinds as we start the fourth quarter. However, we feel that our diversified business model positions us well for future growth in various economic environments. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator please open the call for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","(Operator Instructions). The first question will come from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. ","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","","Good morning. First question is just on -- can you help us think through, I guess it would either be for Jim or Terry, can you help us think through the valuation on the Columbus Circle buyout? Was that just a contractual obligation, was that negotiated, because when I look at the implied valuation of $720 million it looks pretty high relative to what I would expect that to be earnings with AUM. That\u2019s my first question. ","Larry D. Zimpleman ","Okay Tom good morning, this is Larry. I\u2019ll have Jim take that one for you. ","James P. McCaughan","Tom I think you have to see that final payments in the context of the incentive structure at Columbus Circle. And to take you through the whole story as quickly as I can, so the first 70% at the end of 2004 we paid $60 million. Obviously the company was way smaller then and management has done a fine job growing it, and we\u2019ve obviously supported that. We paid a further $180 million, $179 million for the next 25% share. What that means is we\u2019ve effectively for $240 million bought a company that\u2019s current value must be around $500 million if you mark it to market. ","Now as you remarked the price we paid for the 25% looks to be pretty clearly above market. That was a contractual formula we settled on five or six years ago, very deliberately to incent management to go strongly for growth and to build a very sound business. Management has delivered on that, so that\u2019s why they got a good price for the further 25%. And from a Principal point of view we\u2019ve ended up with a very valuable asset. We\u2019ve also by the way in the ten years we owned it received almost a $180 million of dividends from Columbus Circle. So if you add this all up this has been a really tremendous acquisition. The return on the capital invested so far has been in the high teens. So I think we\u2019re poised to make this very successful.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse"," ","Okay. That's pretty clear Jim. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the mortality and individual life this quarter. Now I know the actuarial review had gains and I presume those were non-mortality related. Can you just address the issue of what has been, I guess different quarters of weak mortality over the last two or three years and whether or not that was factored into the actuarial review and how would you think about that in the context of the balance sheet? Thanks.","Larry D. Zimpleman ","Yeah, Tom. This is Larry; I'll make a few comments and maybe ask Dan or Terry to comment as well. I think if you look back over about the last three or four years I think the last sort of 15 quarters we've had a little higher mortality in about seven of those quarters. So in the current quarter Tom, the higher mortality really was more a matter of severity than it was of frequency. So we are going to take a further look into that. I think it's something that we do need to pay a little bit of attention to. ","Having said that the mortality was not really an issue in the actuarial assumption review. We took our appropriate steps a couple of years ago, relative to interest rates and other economic factors. The adjustments this time were more related to lapse rates and the reinsurance cost and what I would call sort of maybe some secondary factors, rather than basic mortality or interest rate. So let me see if Dan wants to add anything.","Daniel J. Houston ","Yeah, maybe just a couple of data point. So Larry the first is which on a year-to-date basis we look at large claims it\u2019s actually been about one less that we would have been expected for that period of time. But to the comment that made in the earlier comments the severity of those large claims has been more significant. We would have been expected maybe $384,000 versus $800,000. So this is severity issue. We are taking a very hard look at this. We got a group of senior executives drilling down to take a very, very hard look at the business and make adjustments as necessary. But at this point in time we do not think that we get a systemic problem. This is all in the course of the volatility associated with a life block like this.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","So Dan nothing, because I remember several years ago you all had mentioned the IOE issue is, you are not tracing it back to that per se right now?","Daniel J. Houston","We're not. We can identify through four very large claims had they not occurred we wouldn't have had the mortality expense that we have. As you know our business is bifurcated, some has more reinsurance than others and unfortunately in these instances they were just almost freakish sort of claims. So again more validation and we don't think this is a systemic issue, it\u2019s more of a situational one but again that won\u2019t keep us from really digging into the details.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks.","Daniel J. Houston","Thanks Tom.","Operator","The next question will come from Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. If I could just follow up on the actuarial review and I believe you mentioned that the impact from interest rates was minimal for the quarter. Could you comment on how you reset the glide path of interest rate improvements in the future in your [substance]?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yeah, Seth this is Larry. I'll have Terry make a few comments. To go back again I think you really understand this year you have to sort of go back and look at what was done in the past. I know some comments have been written as to whether does this indicate other companies are going to have comparable sort of positive numbers or rather negative numbers and of course there\u2019s no way to ever really make any conclusion on that unless you have a sense of what each company has done up to this point in time. ","So sort of the trough at this point and again it's up till now the trough really was in 2012, where at that time the ten year treasury was sort of give or take in the range of 175. Today it's sort of give or take to 220. So from the time we actually took the hit in 2012, which I think is around $90 million, interest rates are now actually up about 45 basis points. At that time, we not only lowered the loan term interest rate but we also changed the so called glidepath that you referenced in your question. ","So we expected the portfolio rate was going to continue actually go down from that point for another three or four years and that's kind of exactly what's happened. ","So what I'd say is again we took the adjustment in 2012. It has sort of trended or followed that path that we expected it to follow in 2012. So there is very little need to do any particular updating. So Terry, do you want to add anything?","Terrance J. Lillis","Yeah, it\u2019s Terry, just have a few additional comments on it. Each quarter we take a look at any significant items that may have changed but in the third quarter of each year we do an annual actuarial review of our models as well as our assumptions. We look at interest rates, we look at mortality, we look at lapses, expenses, premiums, reinsurance all the different drivers of those long-term actual models and as Dan said we look at mortality this quarter decided that it was a more of a few random isolated cases so we did not adjust for the mortality at this point in time but we will continue to look at it.","As Larry said, in 2012 we looked at the low interest rate environment has turned the ultimate rate and lower ultimate rate down by 50 basis points at that point in time. But probably equally as important and maybe more so important is the glide path with which to get there. Each company will have their own opinion as to this but I think one of ours is probably a little bit more conservative as to how long it takes us to get to that glide path. A year ago we looked at the raising interest rate environment, the environment at that point in time and decided, we are not seeing a significant change in the glide path that we would warrant a positive unlocking a year ago and it served us well again this year. ","We did again look at the trajectory out to that longer term rate we feel very comfortable with our ultimate rates for each of our businesses. We feel very comfortable in terms of the glide path but as we have mentioned before these are just a couple of the components that impact the actuarial unlocking. The last point I\u2019d make on this actuarial unlocking for the $39 million that we called out impacting the life area was -- that was really a conservative assumptions that we have had over the last six or seven years and so in a lot of cases you will see an unlocking will bring in profitability or losses from future years. This is all with respect to the last six or seven years of understating some profitability. So we are very comfortable with the actuarial review at this quarter and unlocking that we called out.","Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s very helpful. And if I could just, I suppose follow-up on that and I know you haven\u2019t given specific quantitative landmarks in terms of where rates need to get to but I believe that general commentary at least back in the third quarter of 2012 when you and some others changed the interest rate assumptions, was following the forward curve in the near term which rates have actually followed pretty closely what the forward curve suggested, if you go back two years ago. But then I believe that it implied a faster improvement in interest rates if you look forward three to five years, going back to 2012 or coming up upon that. ","So the question is if we just follow today\u2019s forward curve going forward is that not going to be fast enough rate of improvement in order to avoid balance sheet charges in future years?","Terrance J. Lillis","","No, Seth this is Terry again. No, I think what we are looking at right now is an ultimate rate that is probably -- and varies based upon the product under duration obviously but if you are looking out 30 years, 25-30 years into the future the forward rates are probably pretty closely where we would expect them to be at that point in time.","Larry D. Zimpleman","","Seth, this Larry. I am going to add one higher level comment. You know Individual Life\u2019s business remains very important to us strategically but I also think it\u2019s important that investors not lose sight of the fact of the substantial growth that\u2019s happened over the last few years is going to continue to happen with our fee base businesses so, what you are talking about there again is roughly give or take somewhere between 5% and 8% of our total company earnings attributable to Individual Life\u2019s. So we could talk about sort of the unlocking and there is going to be some noise from time to time but I don\u2019t want to let that obscure the real trend which is happening which is really the growth in the fee base businesses. So just wanted to add that comment as background.","Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch"," ","Understood, thanks a lot for the comments.","Operator","","The next question will come from Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup","","Hi, thank you. Can you talk about what drove the decline in the pretax margin in PGI this quarter? And it sounds like from your comments in the script you still are comfortable getting to the 30% plus range for pre-tax margins over the next two years. So if you can just talk about kind of what are the key drivers there?","Larry D. Zimpleman ","Yeah, you bet. I\u2019ll have Jim cover that for you. ","James P. McCaughan","Yeah, thanks Erik. Firstly there\u2019s always a lot of fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. So really better to look at the trailing 12 months to move that out, to get the trend. First thing to say as a broad context is the industry is suffering and has been suffering in the last two years as assets have moved to passive and to liability driven investing. We are in those businesses but we are not big players. ","So in terms of flows, the main point is flows are very loopy businesses and that\u2019s put some pressure on industry margins. What that pressure is meaning is that we are going to take longer to get to that 30% we have talked about. If I look to the current quarter however it was a pretty low quarter for both transaction fees on real estate and for performance fees generally. So that actually means that it was if anything a pretty low quarter if you look at the fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. ","Secondly in conjunction with the general churn in the industry, the net flow consists of some pretty big inflows and outflow and the inflows of course are not cost free. There\u2019s cost including commissions of putting that business on the books. So that\u2019s actually one of the factors that brought the margins down a bit for this particular quarter. Now of course being able to take in assets in contrast to many in the industry because of our performance and our distribution reach is long-term good for the business but short-term it does cause a bit of a margin impact.","If you look at the trailing 12 months, which I encourage you to think of as the glidepath towards that 30%, firstly the fourth quarter 2013 will fall off. That was a low margin quarter because of the particular set of incentive fees we had in that quarter. We are pretty confident the trailing 12 months will again show some progress and be in albeit lower level of that 26% to 28% range we previously talked about. But we are on course to continue improving margins. The real reason I am confident of that is that the business we are putting on the books at the moment is both very well priced and should be quite profitable looking forward. The margin of new business is very profitable. That\u2019s really the root of our confidence that we are headed for 30%. ","Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. Any sense of, I mean at this point how quickly you would assume that pace of expansion from kind of getting that 26% to 28% to the 30%.","James P. McCaughan","Yeah, we will get more formal about that in the guidance call, but I think it\u2019s fair to say the industry background makes it fair that it will take a year or two more than we perhaps thought when we first started.","Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, thanks. And then if I could ask just one other margin question this time on [RIS] accumulation. At Investor Day you talked about continuing to target to 28% to 32% return on net revenue overtime and outlined a couple of factors that could pressure margins other than just the market decline. I think you also suggested the margins could remain above that target near-term if the markets hold up. So can you just help us think about how long it would take for margins to decline from the current level to that, and at 28% to 32% range if the market performs inline with your expectations?","Larry D. Zimpleman ","Okay, Erik I\u2019ll have Dan cover that.","Daniel J. Houston ","Hi, Erik, this is Dan. I would say over the course of next couple of years again we have had really nice tailwinds here in the last two years driving equity markets and it\u2019s been really nice obviously. But again when we validate those long-term earnings rates we feel very confident that we can hold up into those ranges, in fact they are up slightly and a lot more to do with just how positive the markets are right now as opposed to anything else.","Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","","The next question will come from Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Gentlemen PGI typically in the fourth quarter of a good year you will receive some performance fees that will flow through the income statement. I am wondering if you could give us a directional sense of where they may shake out this year.","Larry D. Zimpleman ","That\u2019s a terribly hard thing to do given volatile markets and even a well-managed hedge fund which is where the big numbers tend to come from can have individual months drawdowns in the low single-digits and that can affect the amount we make. As of the end of September we were confident of a decent fourth quarter but not as big as a performance fee as last year. And I think that\u2019s probably about the best I can say right now because there is a high degree of uncertainty until you really get into the closing stretch. ","But the other thing I\u2019d point out though is we were little unfortunate last year in that the big performance fee came through on a petro hedge funds where we have a very historical agreement, a very legacy agreement with the team that we will pay them a large proportionate incentive comp of the carry on the fund. So the funds we set up and developed more recently we have a more market deal. So there won\u2019t be the adverse impact on margins if it flows through as expected. ","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, thank you, that\u2019s helpful. And then just going back to the change in the tax law in Chile so the effective rate overtime will creep up to 27%, is that correct?","Larry D. Zimpleman ","That\u2019s correct. ","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And then how long will that take?","Larry D. Zimpleman ","Five years, four to five years. ","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay and the charges related to deferred tax liability, which is why you put a plug on?","Larry D. Zimpleman ","That\u2019s right. I mean we sort of believe -- this is Larry, Sean, we sort of believe that the operating earnings metric is best suited to sort of help to predict how the businesses themselves are doing, not some of the other balance sheet impact. So to put the -- at least in our thinking the way we construct operating earnings to put a one-time item like a reset of the deferred tax asset into an operating earnings number would make it more difficult for you to try to understand and to get a reasonable estimate of what the run rate earnings of the business are. So that\u2019s why to us it made sense to put it in the other after tax adjustment. ","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay thank you very much. ","Operator","The next question will come from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. ","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","Hi, first question for Dan just on FSA flows and deposits. They seemed a little weak this quarter I think you were optimistic at the last call that things were going to improve in the second half. So maybe you could talk about how you\u2019re balancing margins and flows in that business and how the competitive environment is and maybe talk about the pipeline as well? And then secondly for Larry or Terry, you\u2019ve spent more on buybacks and deals and dividends this year than you had indicated previously. So should we assume that you\u2019re going to be active on buybacks through the remainder of the year as well or not?","Larry D. Zimpleman ","Okay I\u2019ll have Dan take the FSA one first, Jimmy. ","Daniel J. Houston ","Yeah, Jimmy, good morning. Good strong margins, good recurring deposits, good strong revenue growth, a little light in sales at 1.8 billion versus prior quarter $2.7 million, we have one sale just this last, year ago quarter that was nearly a $1 billion. So again if you wanted to kind of compare the two numbers we\u2019re closer to be on top of one another than perhaps you realize. The large case market is more lumpy, that\u2019s a reality. ","When we validate the value proposition of TRS working with our alliance partners, executing our planned works, that\u2019s all still very much resonating with our customers. There\u2019s been a pick up here recently in terms of the size of the pipeline and say the first half of the year the pipeline is pretty light. Again strong investment performance, probably contributes to some of that. In terms of value proposition again when I look at investment performance, as I mentioned in the earlier comments we\u2019ve got very, very strong performance coming from Jim and his team for our Principal branded funds. We had 88% of our funds, five year level that are in the top two quartiles which makes our existing customers happy and prospective clients pleased. ","We got record retention during that period of time. And the other item I\u2019ve brought this up on previous calls, but when I look at our DCIO business which again is taking advantage of our investment management capabilities without necessarily buying our record keeping, that\u2019s up double from where it was in 2011 and $3.3 billion in terms of the shift and net cash flow a little bit light, it\u2019s negative a couple of $100 million. Again we\u2019re still coming in on top of that net cash flow, which would be somewhere net of 1.5 billion on a year-to-date basis which would put us at the low end of our range of 1% to 3% of beginning year account balance. So it\u2019s not performing that unlike what we would have expected. And the difference is probably a few larger cases. ","But again we\u2019re going to stick to our focus on being disciplined, on profitable growth and write businesses that are going to allow us to execute on all of business, all the values that we bring as an asset manager in addition to being a provider of services to participants and plan sponsors. So hopefully that helps Jimmy. ","Larry D. Zimpleman ","So on your other question, well, maybe just a quick comment Jimmy on your first one, which is if you had, if you as an analyst or you as an investor had a choice between two different paths, one path would have higher sales and less retention. The other path would have lower sales and higher retention, 2014 represents that second path and that second path is actually a better economic outcome to have somewhat lower sales and better retention, because your most profitable business in the dollars that you have on the book. So actually of the two paths, we like this path better. ","Now on your question on buybacks, again I think we have been more consistent on this issue, certainly than many of our insurance peers but even more I think than many other public companies. We have said now for some period of time we are less oriented towards share buyback. We think we are among a very small set of companies that can organically grow our earnings and use that to grow EPS. And so we think about share buyback as simply a tool to offset dilution, and that's essentially what's happened over the last couple of years as we use share buyback offset dilution. We have allowed the businesses to grow organically and that provides EPS. ","I think as I sit here today Jimmy and I look forward I think that's going to continue to sort of be the formula. We have a lot of opportunities, as we said before in the script, we have a lot of opportunities around M&A. I think for those who are long term shareholders, the best thing we can do is to use our capital to deploy it to grow our businesses and grow shareholder value over the long term. And so that's what we're going to continue to do. We will continue to move the dividend up. I think a 31% increase in our common stock dividend this year should be viewed very positively by investors but share buyback, while it is a real stat it's not something that we have to go to in order to grow EPS which is what most companies end up having to do. ","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","And the deal focus primarily I am assuming is asset management and international?","Larry D. Zimpleman","That is correct.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Larry D. Zimpleman","You bet.","Operator","The next question will come from Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Thanks and good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. First on the asset management business, and specifically the buy ins of -- any future buy ins of boutiques, are there any more deals that were sort of structured like the Columbus Circle that we should be thinking about over the next couple of years in terms of good options and the like. ","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yeah, I\u2019ll have Jim cover that, Suneet, good morning. ","James P. McCaughan","Thanks, Suneet. The only one that's on a similar formulaic pattern is actually the further 5% of Columbus Circle which there is no guarantee that we expect to be able to buy that in from management over the next two or three years. So that would be on the same sort of structures I described. Since about six or seven years ago, really the rules around put and call options have made it much more advantageous to go with pure market value assessments and so the exact structure I described in Columbus Circle is not replicated on the other puts and calls. ","Where management have equity in the boutique we generally do have put rights for them particularly if they want to retire and call rights for us some years out in the future. But really the further 5% of Columbus Circle is the only one that imminent in the next year or two.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Okay. Got it. And then I guess for Dan on FSA just a follow up on Jimmy's question. I guess at the beginning of the year you had talked about flat sales. It looks like fourth quarter would have to be a pretty huge quarter for that to happen. So any sense on what your full year outlook is now for sales and given some of the market dynamics that you mentioned, how should we be thinking about 2015 sales growth?","Larry D. Zimpleman ","Yeah. So this is Larry I'll just make a couple of high level comments. You know we're now little bit focused Suneet on sort of the revenue generated by the sales, rather than the AUM generated by the sales. And so we had a certain target sort of thinking that 2014 was going to represent an FSA sales volume and net revenue new volume that would be comparable to 2013. And I think while we may fall little bit short on the asset component we do expect to be pretty close in terms of the revenue generated off of that sales volume being very comparable in 2013. So again all-in-all in an era where there is less money in motion, I think that\u2019s actually a pretty good result and as I said we are seeing retention at an all-time high, which again adds to the margin and to the profitability of the business. ","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Okay and then just one last one, just on that same topic. So I think Dan you had said earlier or somebody had said earlier that about 73% of new FSA sales are going into Principal Fund how high do you think that number could go? I would imagine at some point you\u2019ll hit a ceiling but I just don\u2019t know if you have a sense of how high that number could go?","Daniel J. Houston ","Yeah, I think the ceiling\u2019s a 100%. ","Suneet Kamath - UBS","You could actually do a 100% you think?","Daniel J. Houston ","Well, I like think we could because investment performed just good. In all seriousness the reality is it really differs by the size of the plan. The smaller the plan the higher profitability you\u2019re going to have a higher percentage allocated to Principal funds and if I look at that emerging market which is under $5 million that\u2019s north of 80%, 85%. If I look at that dynamic on a 5 to 50 those numbers kind of settle in the 70s. It\u2019s when you get to the really large cases where you get this volatility if you wanted to you can write a lot of plans where you didn\u2019t manage any of the assets and you did 100% of the record keeping. The economics on that are not very good. ","The reality is that space is going to probably end up settling into that 50% to 60% of Principal managed accounts. The good news is we\u2019ve got really good value proposition with the service package and investment performance is good which leads to being more selective, more disciplined and we just finished a institutional client conference in September with some of our largest clients, had the opportunity to showcase what we\u2019re doing, some of the new plan -- some of the new investment options, some of the new services, in particular about helping their future retirees do a better job planning for retirements called Plan Works. ","The feedback could not have been more positive. So again it reinforces that we feel that our strategy is very much on point. We may see sales, as Larry pointed out, measured by assets down say 5% or 10% on a full year basis relative to a year ago. And at some point we may have a more sedate conversation about the difference in our model that values assets under management versus assets under administration because those are two very different models and I suspect the industry will start bifurcating to some extent along those lines. ","James P. McCaughan","Yeah if I can add to reinforce Dan points, Dan made some excellent points but I would emphasize that his team and mine, in other words the retirement services people and the product people within Principal Global Investors work very, very closely together designing capabilities that provide outcomes that are attractive to the plan participant. And that\u2019s why ultimately we\u2019re doing better in terms of the allocations that are coming both from the fund sponsor level and funds participant level. It\u2019s not as well as something I would argue the strongest suite of investment products in the industry that makes us so confident we can keep in on in this direction. ","Suneet Kamath - UBS","And those large cases that you\u2019re talking about where maybe you get a smaller than average percentage of the asset management mandate, is that forming about a third of your new business?","Larry D. Zimpleman ","Yeah, that\u2019s probably a good number. I think in years past it could have been as much as 50% but if we settle down on a third, small third medium and a third large and those large plans are ones that really value the entire suite of services products and investment line up that\u2019s probably not a bad place for our stand up. ","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Terrific, thank you. ","Larry D. Zimpleman ","Thanks Suneet. ","Operator","The final question will come from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. ","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Hey good morning everybody. Mostly asked and answered but I am interested in any update you might be willing to give on expansion in Asia and of course particularly in China anything happened in the quarter?","Larry D. Zimpleman ","Okay this is Larry, Steven. So as you know we\u2019ve had a very successful -- I\u2019ll talk about China first and then make few comments on Asia and see if Luis wants to add anything. We\u2019ve had a successful mutual fund company in China since 2006 and again for those not as familiar with our businesses or partner, there is China Construction Bank which is a very large state-owned bank, today probably the third or fourth largest bank in the world. And that\u2019s been a very successful effort in the mutual fund and asset management space. But the desire is to hopefully someday get into the retirement business in China. That business exists today it\u2019s called Enterprise Annuity but it\u2019s been limited to local companies. ","And so we continue to travel over there, to visit with regulators, recognizing their need to deal with aging which in China is one of the most aged populations on the earth because of the one child policy. So we remain hopeful, although I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have anything to announce in the near term on that particular project but we do remain hopeful that overtime we think if and when they expand that industry we\u2019ll be one of the first ones allowed in. ","More broadly across Asia, Steven, it\u2019s a great question and what I would say is, and I mentioned this in the opening comments, there is more activity and some of that is in Asia and most of that is coming out of banks, primarily European banks, but some U.S. banks who are in the process, as I think everyone knows of having to get out of geographic markets that are not meaningful and having to get out of tangential businesses that are not meaningful. ","So the regulatory pressure on the larger banks continues to be pretty severe and that gives companies like Principal I think a great opportunity and we\u2019ve done a number of acquisitions in Asia although they\u2019ve been pretty small. You may remember last quarter we announced an acquisition in Thailand, that\u2019s kind of small on one hand but it actually doubled the size of that Thailand business. So again it\u2019s a matter trying to sort of get to scale within each of the seven countries in Asia where we operate. So anything you want to add Luis?","No, okay I hope that helps Steven.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Principal Financial Group's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.","As always, our earnings release, financial supplement and slides related to today's call are available on our website at www.principal.com\/investor.","I'd like to point out that we made several enhancements to our financial supplement this quarter to better reflect the drivers of our earnings and to add clarity in comparing quarterly results.","Following a reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO, Larry Zimpleman; and CFO, Terry Lillis, will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A are: Dan Houston, Retirement Investor Services and U.S. Insurance Solutions; Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors; Luis Valdes, Principal International; and Tim Dunbar, our Chief Investment Officer.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The company does not revise or update them to reflect new information, subsequent events or changes in strategy. Risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Before we begin, I'd like to announce that our 2014 outlook call will be on December 9. We'll provide additional details as we get closer to the date. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Larry.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Thanks, John, and welcome to everyone on the call. As usual, I'll comment on 3 areas. First, I'll discuss third quarter and year-to-date results. Second, I'll provide an update on the continued successful execution of our strategy, and I'll close with some comments on capital management.","As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are on our website. Slide 4 outlines the themes for the quarter.","The total company operating earnings for the quarter were $269 million, a 22% increase over an adjusted third quarter 2012. As a reminder, third quarter 2012 was negatively impacted by $79 million due to an actuarial assumption review.","The strong results this quarter, combined with the first half of the year, resulted in total company year-to-date operating earnings of $774 million, a 19% increase over the adjusted 2012 year-to-date results.","Return on equity, at 12%, is up from the year-ago quarter, as well as sequentially. As we said on our Investor Day last month, this is an important metric, and we continue to believe that we'll achieve an annual increase of 50 to 80 basis points, resulting in a 15% return on equity within the next few years. These remarkable results demonstrate the benefit of our diversified and durable business model.","Though macroeconomic challenges remain, such as continued low interest rates, the strengthening U.S. dollar and uncertainty in emerging markets, our unique business mix allows us to achieve consistent performance and a balance of profitability and growth.","In addition, results this quarter reflect strong underlying fundamentals as momentum continues across our businesses. Total company net cash flows of $4.2 billion helped drive assets under management to a record $466 billion at quarter end.","As I have said many times, assets under management is the best single indicator of future revenue and operating earnings.","Business level growth metrics include: solid net cash flows of $1.2 billion in Full Service Accumulation, reflecting double-digit growth in both recurring and transferred deposits.","While assets sales were flat compared to the year-ago quarter, margins in this business continue to improve as we focus on a better balance across plan sizes.","Principal Funds' account value increased 25% to a record $61 billion, reflecting continued demand for our outcome-oriented products and solid investment performance.","Sales of $4.7 billion contributed to net cash flows of $550 million. Record unaffiliated assets under management of $106 billion for Principal Global Investors, up 8% from the year-ago quarter.","Net cash flows were $1.5 billion for the quarter. Assets under management of $103 billion in Principal International, with positive net cash flows of $1.1 billion despite a quarter in which the macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets were as difficult as they've been in years. Those conditions have improved in October.","U.S. Insurance Solutions year-to-date sales up 11% over the prior year period, with nearly $100 million of sales in the current quarter as we continue to balance growth and profitability. Our business model is extremely well-suited for the world's aging challenges and emerging market middle-class growth.","In this era of personal responsibility, we have the right solutions to meet the financial needs of our customers around the world, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our businesses at above-market rates.","Next, I'll comment on our success in further implementing our strategy in the third quarter.","At our recent Investor Day, we had the opportunity to present an update on our Investment Management Plus strategy. It's a strategy we've had in place for more than a decade, and has created a unique business model with diverse revenue sources, yet with a highly integrated set of businesses.","This approach sets us apart for a couple of reasons. First, as I mentioned earlier, our diversified set of businesses allows us to weather challenging economic environments, as we demonstrated during the financial crisis. Our durable model enabled us to emerge from the recent crisis in a position of strength, allowing us to complete 7 strategic acquisitions since 2010.","Additionally, what makes our business model really powerful is the synergy and collaboration between the businesses, which results in a valuation that's greater than the sum of the parts. This leads to higher margins, continued long-term growth opportunities and a higher return on equity over time.","In Principal International, the on-boarding of Cuprum is complete. We are now focused on maximizing the value of this acquisition by creating the only fully integrated platform in Chile.","The acquisition made us the #2 retirement provider in Latin America, and created a retirement franchise to meet the savings and investing needs of people in the 3 key countries of Brazil, Chile and Mexico, that will be difficult for competitors to replicate.","The need for long-term savings by individuals in emerging markets continues to grow, and Principal is capitalizing on these opportunities.","In Full Service Accumulation, we will continue to focus our resources on advisors, plan sponsors and plan participants to deliver work site solutions with strong investment capabilities and performance. The fundamentals of this business remains strong. Recurring deposits were $3.7 billion for the quarter, a 13% increase over the prior year quarter.","This was driven by an 8% increase in both the number of people making a deferral and the number of people receiving a match. We'll see additional upside to recurring deposits as the job market recovers, and as our greater focus on engaging plan participants to save at appropriate levels begins to gather momentum.","At our recent Investor Day, we focused on the growth and success of Principal Funds which, along with Principal Global Investors and Principal International, was an aspirational business when we became a public company in 2001.","At the end of the third quarter, total Principal Funds complex account value was $103 billion. This is remarkable growth, and reflects our ability to offer outcome-oriented products focused on meeting the long-term needs of investors.","Turning now to Principal Global Investors. We continue to benefit from our well diversified multi-boutique strategy. Our strategy is distinctive because the successful boutiques that we've built and acquired are able to remain focused yet nimble to meet changing client demands, while having access to shared resources, such as a world-class distribution and operational platform.","This allows our investment teams to focus on what they do best while realizing the benefits of scale in areas like distribution, technology and compliance.","As shown on Slide 5, investment performance remains competitive. Solid investment performance is a good leading indicator of future sales and net cash flows. The pipeline in Principal Global Investors remains strong, and as investor appetite swings to equities and alternative investments, we remain in an excellent position to retain and attract clients because of our investment expertise across multiple boutiques.","Next, a quick update on Principal Bank. As of September 30, we've liquidated or transferred all required noncustodial deposits, including those that were part of our strategic agreement with Bank of the Internet. We have retained all individual retirement account deposit products which complement our U.S. Retirement and asset accumulation businesses and help us retain assets from job changers and retirees.","As part of the deregistration process, Principal Bank also sold its $390 million of commercial mortgage loans, predominantly to Principal Life Insurance Company.","These actions had minimal financial impact to the company and further our process to deregister as a savings and loan holding company. We still expect to complete the process by year end.","I'll close with some comments on capital management. As announced last night, we'll pay a $0.26 per share common stock dividend in the fourth quarter, bringing our 2013 total to a record $0.98 per share. This reinforces our commitment to return capital to shareholders by increasing the dividend payout ratio over time.","So far, in 2013, we've allocated more than $480 million of capital for common stock dividends, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. We continue to look for the best and most accretive ways to deploy capital and increase long-term value for shareholders. We'll provide more detail on our 2014 capital management plans at our outlook call in December.","In closing, we're pleased with our team's ability to grow our businesses while maintaining expense discipline, which resulted in another strong quarter. Despite volatility that will likely continue, I'm confident that our business model and proven ability to execute will continue our momentum into next year and beyond. Terry?","Terrance J. Lillis","Thanks, Larry. Third quarter was another strong quarter on top of an already strong first half of 2013, as our businesses continued to grow.","This morning, I'll focus my comments on 3 items: operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance in the investment portfolio; and the strength of the capital position and the balance sheet.","Total company operating earnings of $269 million were up 89% over a reported third quarter 2012, but up 22% after adjusting for last year's actuarial assumption review. Excluding Cuprum, third quarter 2013 earnings were up 15% over the adjusted prior year quarter.","Earnings from our fee-based businesses remained in the 60% to 65% range of the total operating earnings, excluding the Corporate segment. The composition of our earnings continues to shift away from products that put pressure on our balance sheet. Our current business profile is more aligned with asset managers, and should warrant a higher-than-historical multiple over time.","Third quarter 2013 earnings per share were $0.90, a 22% increase compared to the adjusted year-ago quarter. This reflects strong organic growth, the addition of Cuprum, favorable equity markets and disciplined expense management.","Our annual actuarial assumption review in third quarter 2013 had an immaterial impact on total company operating earnings.","Looking at Slide 6, you'll see that third quarter 2013 earnings were impacted by one normalizing item. As we introduced last quarter, Principal International earnings are impacted by returns on the encaje investment in Chile and Mexico.","Adjusted results this quarter were negatively impacted by $10 million due to lower-than-expected returns in Chile. Results will vary quarter-to-quarter. In fact, the encaje returns in Chile is positively impacting the fourth quarter results at this point. There's more background information on the encaje investment on Slide 7, along with publicly available information on how to track the encaje performance throughout the quarter.","Now I'll discuss business unit results. Starting with the Accumulation businesses within the Retirement and Investor Services. Operating earnings were $151 million, an increase of 15% over the adjusted third quarter 2012.","As shown on Slide 8, net revenue was up 13% over the year-ago quarter. Trailing 12-month, pretax return on net revenue improved to 31%.","Quarterly operating earnings for Full Service Accumulation at $91 million were up 21% over the adjusted year-ago quarter. This reflects a 15% increase in net revenue due to strong growth in the business and positive equity market performance.","Operating expenses have grown slower than net revenue, resulting in improved margins. The pretax return on net revenue for the quarter was 32%.","Sales, at $2.7 billion for the quarter, were in line with the year-ago quarter. Net cash flow for Full Service Accumulation were $1.2 billion for the quarter. We will continue to be disciplined in attracting and retaining clients that value our comprehensive products and services as we strike the appropriate balance of growth and profitability.","Principal Funds' operating earnings were $22 million for the quarter, a very strong 66% increase from the year-ago quarter.","On a trailing 12-month basis, revenue was up 24% and operating margins continue to improve due to the scale-based nature of the business.","For the quarter, sales were $4.7 billion, leading to $550 million of net cash flow. While down sequentially, these results were solid relative to the industry. Sales continued to come in across multiple asset types as we focus on outcome-oriented products.","The individual annuity operating earnings were $30 million, reflecting flat net revenues in the quarter and a continued expense management. This is a good result in this low interest rate environment.","Our retirement income strategy continues to resonate in the marketplace, and we saw a nice momentum in payout annuity sales.","On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax return on net revenue improved to 44%, driven by strong growth in fee revenues.","Slide 9 covers the guaranteed businesses within Retirement and Investor Services. Third quarter operating earnings of $22 million were up 6% over the year-ago quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax return on net revenue was 80%, at the upper end of our expected range. Investment-only earnings improved 24% from the prior year quarter to $15 million due to increasing spreads on a lower asset base.","During the quarter, we sold a $350 million, 5-year medium-term note. We continue to approach this business opportunistically, and we'll write business when market conditions generate attractive returns.","Full Service payout earnings of $8 million were negatively impacted by a mortality fluctuation of approximately $3 million, after tax. This was the first negative fluctuation we've seen in this business in more than 2 years. We believe that the rising interest rate environment will allow us to add small- to mid-sized pension closeout business at attractive returns.","Slide 10 shows Principal Global Investors' operating earnings were $23 million, up 12% from the year-ago quarter. Third quarter revenues grew 12% over the prior year quarter, driven largely by higher average assets under management. Earnings were down on a sequential basis due to performance fees and front-end loaded real estate borrower fees.","On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax margin improved to 26% as Principal Global Investors continues to build scale.","Unaffiliated assets under management ended the quarter at a record $106 billion. The unaffiliated net cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion. We have a robust pipeline which, when paired with strong investment performance, bodes well for future growth.","Slide 11 shows third quarter 2013 operating earnings for Principal International of $51 million. Adjusting for the lower-than-expected return on the encaje, operating earnings were up 64% from the year-ago quarter.","After adjusting for Cuprum and the foreign exchange headwinds, Principal International is up 2% over the year-ago quarter.","As Larry mentioned, this was a challenging quarter for our Latin American operation. On a trailing 12-month basis, combined pretax return on net revenue for Principal International was 55%, slightly below our range reflecting the macroeconomic pressures.","In light of these pressures, we're pleased with the results of our Principal International businesses in the quarter and continue to invest for growth.","Quarterly net cash flows for the segment were $1.1 billion. Principal International ended the quarter with $103 billion of assets under management despite the strengthening U.S. dollar and volatility, particularly in Brazil.","As a sign of our leading position in Brazil, BrazilPrev was the only meaningful provider with positive net cash flows in the quarter.","U.S. Insurance Solutions' earnings were $54 million for the quarter, an increase of 25% from the adjusted year-ago quarter.","And as shown on Slide 12, Individual Life operating earnings were $22 million. This was a decrease of $3 million from an adjusted year-ago quarter, driven by adverse mortality due to a higher severity in the quarter, as well as the low interest rate environment.","On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax operating margin was 13%, below the range of 15% to 17% communicated for 2013. Higher-than-expected mortality, thus far this year negatively impacted our results. We continue to believe this is normal quarterly volatility.","As shown on Slide 13, Specialty Benefits operating earnings of $32 million, were up 74% from the adjusted year-ago quarter. The current period loss ratio of 65% compared favorably to the 72% result in the year-ago quarter, and was a large contributor to the earnings gain. We continue to expect our quarterly loss ratios to be in that 65% to 71% range.","Trailing 12-month pretax operating margins of 11% is slightly above our expectations due to the favorable claims experienced this year.","Specialty Benefits premium and fees grew 3% over a year-ago quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, premium and fees were up 4%, relative to our 6% to 8% target, reflecting our focus on profitable growth.","The Corporate segment reported an operating loss for the quarter of $32 million, better than our forecasted range of $35 million to $40 million operating losses. This is primarily due to favorable debt-related expenses in 2013.","For the quarter, total company net income was $246 million. Realized capital losses for the quarter were $23 million, with improving credit-related losses making up $16 million of the total, which were at the lowest point since before the financial crisis.","Looking now at capital adequacy. We estimate our third quarter risk-based capital ratio to be in the 400% to 405% range. We expect to end the year in the 415% to 425% range, relative to a 350% RBC ratio at the Life company, and including cash at the holding company, we have approximately $800 million of excess capital.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI at $29.79, increased 5% over the prior year quarter. Our return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 11.9%, a strong improvement even taking into account rolling off the prior year quarter.","Trailing 12 months earnings grew 20% over an adjusted prior year, while the average equity, excluding AOCI, only increased 3%.","And as I mentioned at Investor Day, growing earnings 10% to 12%, while managing the equity growth to a lower rate, will deliver a 50- to 80-basis-point annual increase in return on equity.","Regarding capital management, in the quarter, we repurchased $62 million of company stock. We still have $55 million remaining from the $150 million previously announced share repurchase program.","As outlined on Slide 14, we allocated more than $480 million of our expected $400 million to $600 million of capital to be deployed for the year.","Last night, we announced our fourth quarter 2013 common stock dividend of $0.26, bringing our full-year dividend to a record $0.98. We continue to focus on increasing our dividend payout ratio on a growing net income base.","We're extremely pleased with the continued momentum of our businesses and feel that we are well positioned for future growth.","Before we close, I want to take a moment to recognize our CEO, Larry Zimpleman, on recently receiving a prestigious industry Award. Larry was named the winner of the 2013 Lillywhite Award. The Employee Benefit Research Institute sponsors the award, which recognizes outstanding lifetime contributions to Americans' economic security. Congratulations to Larry for this recognition of his contributions to the financial services industry.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just wanted to start on International on the earnings. Even after kind of adding back to the callout for the encaje business in Chile, it seems like we were a little bit light there. And I guess, I'd ask kind of a 2-part question. One, was it light relative to initial expectations from your perspective it would be in the Cuprum business? And two, could you just elaborate a little bit on kind of the comments about kind of FX environment being challenging? Obviously, that's currency, but just wondering if there's interest rates and other pieces of those comments that might have affected International earnings this quarter.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Okay. This is Larry, Randy. I appreciate the question. I'll start, and I'm sure, Terry and Luis might want to add. First of all, as I said in my earlier comments, the conditions in emerging markets started to deteriorate in June, and I would say that deterioration sort of continued through most of the third quarter. But as I also noted in my comments, the situation has begun to reverse a little bit in October. So it feels -- in general, it feels like the macroeconomic environment is settling down a little bit. In your question about were PI earnings light, I would say, it was actually a very good quarter for PI from a local market perspective. So what you saw in the local markets was positive flows, generally good performance, but when you translate those back to the U.S., we took a hit on that because of currency. So the $51 million, in my view, represents sort of almost like a worst-case scenario which, from my perspective, really, if that represents the worst-case scenario, I can live with that all day long. So I think the normalized number for that segment is probably more in that $63 million to $65 million a quarter range, with $51 million kind of representing this worst-case scenario this quarter. So Luis, anything you like to add to that?","Luis E. Vald\u00e9s","Yes. I mean, and again, the $51 million for this quarter, we consider that as a good number for PI, considering the macroeconomic conditions and certainly, normalized by our encaje, $10 million -- that's $61 million for the quarter. And concerning the headwinds, FX and market behavior and total AUMs -- and concerning even our total margin, it's a good number, it's a good number. We consider that as a good number.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Does that help, Randy?","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes, it's perfect. I mean, I'm trying to get to your run rate and I just want to amplify one thing. It sounds like -- if I'm just thinking about my P&L here, it sounds like most of it's FX and not necessarily kind of interest rates or other growth issues in those markets. It's mostly just the FX impact that's kind of clearly laid out and something we can track in the market.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes, that's right, Randy. The final comment I would make is I think inflation was a little bit lower in Latin America in the quarter, which has also got a very modest effect. But you've got the main factors with what you've mentioned there a minute ago.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then, finally, I mean -- and this is something we talked about at the Investor Day, but there's no -- given the diversity of your, kind of, your business base and variety of countries and your continued growth plans there. I mean, you're going to continue to kind of let this FX come through unhedged just because it will be too expensive and kind of complicated to hedge it. There should be kind of natural offsets in it going forward. Is that right? We accept this FX risk in these earnings?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes, that's exactly right. And again, we've looked at this any number of times. Even if we were to try to do some economic hedge, Randy, it wouldn't necessarily work for accounting purposes. But we believe that the best thing is just to let the natural diversification of the businesses carry us quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the level of activity in the 401(k) market in the U.S. in terms of both RFPs for existing cases, as well as new case formation? And is health care reform still a distraction or are you seeing the disruption from that starting to ease?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes, again, I'll take -- make a few high-level comments on that Erik, and have Dan comment. I would describe the 401(k) environment as sort of \"steady she goes,\" I would say, not a lot of change going on either positively or negatively. I think that the competitive pressures, which have always been a factor in this market, continue to be there. There may be slightly less competitive factors, say, than right after the financial crisis when, I think, a lot of retirement providers, a lot of 401(k) providers were all sort scrambling around, trying to find ways to at least continue -- if not absorb too much of a hit, at least try to continue the revenue in the AUM number. So those things seem like they've settled down. And our pipeline, it's pretty consistent with what it's been the last several quarters. So I'll let Dan make comments on that in health care.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes, that's right, Larry. Just a couple more comments. Within the last couple of weeks, I was down with some of our very largest clients. We have a client council. So that's 15 clients around a room with management discussing some of the issues relative to challenges they're facing within their benefits package. And as you might expect, health care reform compliance is top of mind for them. But I'd say, the shift in the conversation quickly goes to the issue of retirement readiness and income solutions. There's less emphasis around plan expenses, more time and attention now being focused on what can we do to better prepare our future retirees for retirement. So I would say, our product package with TRS and our product packaging around Retire Secure supports that in the marketplace today. And we're winning a lot of business because of that.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, if I could just ask one on Specialty Benefits, where your results have been -- it's a very strong year-to-date with favorable claims experience. You've also seen some modest sales growth. Just could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the group market in terms of both claims trends, as well as the competitive environment?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes, this is Larry, Erik. I mean I think you actually summarized it pretty well. I would just want to -- before I ask Dan to comment, I would just -- want to give our team that manages that business a lot of credit. For many companies, the story, historically, around this kind of business has been cycles of sort of boom and bust. And I think that when you look at our performance in this area of the business, I think our performance is really superior and far more consistent, kind of, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year than many of our competitors. So I think we have a very experienced team with a strong track record, and I'm very proud of the trends they have going.","Daniel J. Houston","A lot of discipline on the part of the team to achieve nice growth and, at the same time, be profitable. Remember that our average size plan for Specialty Benefits is approximately 40 employees. It's diversified by industry and, frankly, by geography. And we have -- we've done a good job kind of balancing growth and profitability. In terms of health care reform and how it might impact Specialty Benefits, there's a pediatric benefit that comes out of the dental component that has to be included in health care reform on the medical plans. So Principal continues to monitor that. In most states, what most carriers are doing is, even though they have the pediatric benefit within the health insurance program, they're still purchasing dental insurance. It is a comprehensive solution. It's a best practice on the part of the advisor. So we don't see health care reform derailing our model of distribution today for Specialty Benefits. Having said that, we'll continue to evaluate the -- both the public and the private platforms for our products being on those products -- on those platforms.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And any comments on just the pricing environment? Or it seems to have been -- you've had a tailwind in the past couple of years as most people in the market have been raising prices. Are you still seeing that? Are you seeing any signs of increased competition?","Daniel J. Houston","Yes. It's a competitive marketplace, and our rates tend to always be -- we're top 5 provider in Specialty Benefits. And so there are new entrants from time to time that can be disruptive to the industry, but I would say that it's no more or any less competitive than it's been in the last few years. So it's game as usual, I suspect.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","I had a question about your legal entity structure. Principal Global Investors is owned by Principal Life Insurance Company. I was wondering if you've ever considered moving PGI out from under the insurance subs. I'm not sure if that would be a positive, negative or neutral event for your capital structure or if it would maybe have any impact on the way rating agencies evaluate your access to subsidiary dividends. So was just interested in your perspective on that.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes. This is Larry, Ryan. That's a very interesting and sort of timely question. I think I'll make a couple of high-level comments, and Terry is going to want to add a little more specificity to it. But very high-level, if you go back a little bit in history, even back before we became a public company, it's true that when some of the legal structures were set up, of course, you have a holding company, but then you had the life company. And at that point in our strategy implementation, sort of in our history, the life company was kind of the center of the business units. I mean, that was just kind of the way it was done because the life insurance was the legacy business going back 134 years. And so as we began to develop these other businesses, including Principal Global Investors, many of them just sort of naturally ended up under that life company. As we've evolved and as we become a more multifaceted and global organization, your question is really spot-on because I think we continue to evaluate both for capital efficiency, tax efficiency, et cetera, whether that sort of structure makes sense. And we are beginning to evolve that structure. We talked about that, I think, at different investor days as we are a more global company and we need to move capital around to various companies around the globe. As we have expanded into other areas like International and mutual funds, we put those companies outside the life company and the legacy, really, is PGI is still under the life company. So that's a real set-up for Terry to sort of take it from there. But that's kind of the background and the history of it.","Terrance J. Lillis","Yes, Ryan, this is Terry. The strategic focus of our execution on our strategy is really evolving towards more of that Investment Management Plus-type company. And part of that is the breakdown of those businesses, as Larry said, between the life insurance companies and those legacy businesses there, as well as the sister companies, the mutual fund, as well as Principal International. And it makes sense as we grow the business from PGI being the aspirational business to a very meaningful part of our organization, there is a limitation as to the size of any nonlife subsidiaries within the life company. So because of that, there was eventually going to be a need to move that out. So we are exploring that at this point in time. We're looking to move the earnings of Principal Global Investors outside of the life company as part of our long-term strategy. And as Larry mentioned, we've looked at more of a global holding company structure, whereas, we can move a capital efficiently and effectively around the globe. So yes, that is one of our near-term views as well.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Does that help, Ryan?","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Yes, very helpful. I just have a follow-up. Do you think that if you do move PGI out from under the insurance subs, that it would have any -- would it have any impact on your RBC ratio, either positive or negative?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Well, I guess, what I would say to that, Ryan, is that we would manage that and do that in a way that will not have a substantial impact to the RBC ratios of the life company.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. And then just -- actually, one more follow-up on the same thing. I think from a rating agency standpoint, could doing -- could making this change -- do you think that would positively impact their view of access to capital and, perhaps, help your ratings?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes. I'm not sure I got all that question, but I think, essentially, you were asking about how the rating agencies would view that. And I guess, again, my general comment there would be that, of course, the rating agencies don't all have a unified or single view around these types of things. So we've begun that discussion with the rating agencies. I think, so far, I would certainly describe all of our conversations as very constructive. And we don't -- again, we don't see significant hurdles that we have to overcome, but we want to continue to work very proactively with them as we do it, and we want to take account of whatever concerns they have. But I don't think it will be an impediment at the end of the day. We'll just have to have those individual discussions to get their point of view.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Overall, I thought the results were pretty strong, but the one that's sort of negative was that your flows in many of the businesses were weak. And you mentioned the environment in Latin America being challenging, but even PGI and mutual funds loans seemed a little weak. So maybe, if you could address that? And then, one for Luis on -- there's been a lot of talk about pension reform in Chile with the upcoming election. And just wondering what you see or is there anything that might seem like a threat to the Cuprum business, given the proposals that the various candidates have made?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Jimmy, this is Larry. Thanks for the questions. I would frankly take a little bit of exception to the comment on flows. I think that sometimes, your toughest competitor is yourself, and that's kind of a nice problem to have. And I think that your comment or your observation is really in relationship to Principal's flows. But I think the better measuring stick is, really, to sort of look at our flows as compared to competitors'. And I'm highly confident that if you look at -- within any of those businesses, particularly, the mutual fund business and the institutional business, you would find that our flows are really as strong as anyone's. So for example, yesterday, T. Rowe, Franklin, Janus and Federated reported, and they all reported pretty significant negative flows. This morning or last night, Legg Mason reported. They reported significant negative flows. That's as compared to $1.5 billion positive flows for PGI. So ours is a very strong story, and I would encourage you to look at kind of the industry flows and not necessarily make the comparison singularly or directly against what we might have done in the prior quarter. Because, once again, we would have been among the leading performers in those prior quarters. So with that, let me ask Jim to comment on institutional. And I'll have Luis comment on International.","James P. McCaughan","Yes, Jimmy. Thanks for the question. I think to comment on institutional -- and this actually has some impact on mutual funds and Full Service as well. I would point out that we at Principal have a product platform that is extremely strong relative to where client demand is going. If you want to understand the negative flows from competitors that Larry has described, you just need to look at the diminishing appetite that investors have for active core strategies. And that's something we do, but more importantly for us, there is increasing demand for specialty strategies, highly focused, high added value. So if you take the institutional flows during the quarter, $1.5 billion net inflow, that included losing a single account of more than $1.5 billion, which was in active core global equities. So in other words, the $1.5 billion plus making up for those losses of core mandates were in specialty strategies, which includes real estate, includes high-yield of various sorts, particularly, limited duration high yield, includes specialty equity strategies, including yield biased and regional strategies. So we are strong in those areas where client demand is moving, and that more than makes up for the losses we have in active core strategies. And that general theme -- I illustrated it with reference to Principal Global Investors, but that is one of the explanations as to why the Principal Financial Group platform is seeing pretty strong positive flows compared with our investment management competitors.","Luis E. Vald\u00e9s","Jimmy, this is Luis. Let me comment briefly before going to -- into the pension reforms in Chile. About our net customer cash flows in PI, certainly, we reported $1.1 billion. Our normal run rate was about $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion per quarter. If you look at your supplement in the Page 31, 32, you're going to realize 2 things. First, we didn't have any country with negative net customer cash flows. All our countries are showing positive net customer cash flows. And then we have India, which is even. But the most important thing here is to realize that the country where we had serious problems was in Brazil. Brazil was showing $400 million in net customer cash flows, positive. And our normal run rate in Brazil was about $2 billion per quarter. So that is where we have the main shortfall, it's in one country, which is Brazil. The second quarter, particularly, the second quarter -- I'm talking about the market in Brazil, was very challenging in Brazil. Almost, we had that stock market down 20%. Almost, we had bad FX rate down to 20%, so that market was, in USD, almost 40% down at some given moment. So we had a very difficult entry into the third quarter. If you're looking those number, you will figure that the main part of that shortfall is coming because we have low deposit but we didn't have a very important amount of withdrawals. So we circled the wagons around our customers and our assets, and we were able to retain all those assets. And you could see that we didn't have any important fluctuation about our withdrawals. It's very important fluctuations about new deposit. This situation is changing during the third quarter. The third quarter has been much more, much better than the second quarter, so we think that the moods in Brazil are much better and moods around emerging markets are much better starting in the third quarter. So we think that we have had a much better entry in the fourth quarter of 2013. Going into the pension reforms in Chile. It's almost a fact, Jimmy, that Mrs. Michelle Bachelet is going to be the next president in Chile. And we were able to review when she released her program, and the only thing that has been said in her program -- and this was kind of -- we were talking about the -- about the AFPs and the pension reform. It's about the creation of a state-owned AFP in Chile in order to address 2 things: first, to extend the coverage under the low-income segment; and second, to extend and have a much more extended geographical reach, in particular, in some places that you don't have enough market or enough size in order to really cover those particular places in Chile. So it's pretty much more in the same way that we anticipated in the last earnings call, which is a kind of state-owned. If that AFP is going to exist as a state-owned AFP, that is going to go after the low -- going after the low-income segment and in those places that you don't have a very meaningful presence of other private AFPs. In particular, in Cuprum, we continue saying that Cuprum is not going to be affected because Cuprum is the premier pension provider pretty much more focused on the middle- and high-income segment in Chile. That is very well-attended, and we don't see any particular reason in order to make any meaningful change, rather than to continue increasing the incentives in order to add more long-term savings into our AFP and pension system in Chile.","Larry D. Zimpleman","This is Larry, Jimmy. I just want to make just 2 quick points. One is that the discussion in Chile is more around how to get the replacement ratios up. And so the discussion is more on how to generate additional contributions. So I actually think this discussion around pension reform in Chile is going to be a positive, not a negative. So that would be Point 1. Point 2 is just to make -- just to illustrate, I would say, the influence that we have -- \"we\" is a collective we. So for example, if you look at the independent chair of Cuprum's board, he happens to have been the Minister of Economy when Michelle Bachelet was the President previously. So that shows, I think, the sort of influence that we will have if and when any of these proposals get to a legislative state. You can bet that we'll be providing our views and commenting on the strengths of the AFP system over the 30-year period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","I have a question about the FSA pipeline. Last quarter, I think it was said that things were looking better over the second half of the year. Now I'm sure this is tied to the margins that you're targeting, but should we assume that FSA sales will be down full year 2013 over 2012?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes, I'll let Dan handle that. But Sean, thanks.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes. Yes, Sean, this is Dan. I think that's right. I mean, I would fully anticipate, at this point in time, we could see our sales, as measured by assets under management, down by, say, 10%. And I'd say, at the same time, that our new case revenues will stay about flat with last year. So again, nicer revenue on roughly 10% fewer asset sales. We are getting good sales, though, across all the segments: small, medium and large. And I would just call your attention to the fact that we've got 2,200 new plans this year that we didn't have 12 months ago. And then if I were to look closely at the thousand plus life market, we've increased that by roughly 10%. The difference is, those aren't jumbo cases, they're smaller cases. So that pipeline that we historically talk about has all those large jumbo cases in there as well. So I think we have a higher quality pipeline today and we've maintained roughly the same sorts of close ratios, albeit on a smaller overall assets under management, but stronger revenue. So we feel very good about the mix of business going into 2014.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Sean, this is Larry, I just want to add one quick point. Having been around this business for a very, very long time, I certainly have to make the observation that from 2011 to 2012, we grew the sales by 1\/3. So we went from roughly $8.4 billion to $11.2 billion. So when we say that we don't know whether 2013 sales are going to hit the level of 2012, we really need to sort of remember that we had a 30% increase the prior year. And so the notion that you're going to have a 30% increase and then, put another increase on top of that, becomes a little bit challenging. So this is the normal pattern that you sort of see in this business, is you'll see jumps along the way, and then you'll see it sort of plateau off and then -- for a year or so, then you'll see it jump again. And that's been the trend, really, over the longer term.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Great. And it seems that part of the -- or a big part of the margin expansion story in your accumulation businesses has been expense reduction. When I look at over the last few years, the fourth quarter tends to have elevated comp expenses. I mean, should we expect the fourth quarter to continue the trend that we've seen in the second and third quarters?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes. I think the story is really around expense control, not necessarily expense reductions because, in fact, we think it's really important to invest in the businesses. And we've made that comment many, many different times. Dan was just commenting earlier in response to a question. Employers today expect us to be very visible and active with our participants, and that's what our Retire Secure and Worksite platform is. So we've actually been investing in the business but we've been doing it wisely and in relationship to revenue growth. So that's really the strategy that we'll continue to pursue. And I don't know, Dan, any comments on Q4?","Daniel J. Houston","Yes. It's just -- to kind of boil it down into 3 buckets for Q4. The first is, we're going to continue to be disciplined about operational costs and holding those tight as we possibly can. The second bucket is around investing in the business, so that's expanding on TRS and the TPA business and also deploying some investment resources out into the marketplace. And then the third one is just a reminder that when we look at commissions and we look at asset management fees, those do stay current. They on the same pace as account value growth. And so some of the fourth quarter compensation increases are because of bonuses towards the end of the year. So hopefully, that helps explain the answer, Sean.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. Just one more. Typically, PGI benefits in the fourth quarter from performance fees. How are they tracking year-to-date?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Jim, go ahead. Yes.","James P. McCaughan","Yes. Thanks, Sean. It's dangerous to say how they're tracking because things can change in the last 2 months of the year. We know the market can move and we know our relative performance can move. But if we were to draw the line right now, we're looking at a slightly better yield than last year. The 2 key boutiques in this and -- or 2 that have substantial hedge funds, and that includes Columbus Circle. It's maybe not surprising that they're having a good year because of the opportunities in the equity market, particularly, tech and health care, which are 2 of their specialties. So they're having a good year, better than last year. The one that's maybe more counterintuitive is Finisterre, with substantial hedge funds. They're in emerging debt, which as in another context, we described that as macroeconomic headwinds. However, Finisterre, being long\/short in emerging debt, have been very thoughtful and very adroit at managing it and are seeing some good returns, actually better than last year. So I don't want to talk it up too much, but maybe if their line was drawn at the moment, we might be $1 million or $2 million better than last year. But it's all still there to play for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Question on FSA, and maybe this is a question for Dan. If I look at the AUM per plan, it's up about 13% year-over-year, which makes sense, given kind of how equity markets have performed, offset by some debt. And then, if I look at fees to AUM, it's actually held very steady over the trailing several quarters, which is obviously a good thing. And I guess what I'm curious about is, as AUM has gone up with markets higher, how do we think about the reaction of the plan sponsor in that scenario? I mean, are they going to let you kind of keep those increased revenue dollars? Do you put them back into service? Will they want to negotiate down? How do we see this playing out?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes. This is Larry, that's a very good question and I will have Dan provide some detail. But to your point -- and again, I think our team has done a really nice job on this in -- generally speaking, it was a little bit more difficult post the financial crisis. And as I said earlier, things are settling down a little bit. So if you look at FSA, trailing 12 months, account value is up 17%, revenue is up 15%, expense is up 10%, and that's why you grow pretax earnings. So that 2% differential, I would tell you, might be a little narrower than what we can sustain over the long term because, to your point, plan sponsors -- and I would say also advisors, because that's an important constituent in this whole equation, typically, you are resetting expenses every year on these plans. And so as AUM grows, there is some ability to lower the per AUM fee and frankly, plan sponsors and advisors expect you to do that. So we've talked about the differential between account value and revenue growth that's in that sort of 2% to 4% range. But that's broad and general, and I'll have Dan give you a little color on the current environment.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes, that's right. And to answer your question, it's true on all of those cases. We'll have to take a portion, invest in the business. On any plan of over $5 million, there is a detailed discussion that's occurring each year on the value of that piece of business. And we know what our margins are on that piece of business, and if there's room, then, we'll work with the client on that. Sometimes, clients want additional services, which can be reflected in the pricing. But for the most part, like Larry said, this is an annual review. A lot of these are 3-year guarantees, and so our relationship managers and service reps are doing a very nice job, striking the right balance on the service that we're going to deliver and at what price those are going to be. Hopefully, that helps.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, maybe just one last question, going back to international a little bit. Maybe going back to a prior question but specific to Brazil. If you look at currency-adjusted earnings in Brazil over the last 4 quarters, they haven't really moved that much, up a tad bit. AUM, on a currency-adjusted basis, obviously, is up a lot. And I'm just curious, why aren't you seeing a little bit stronger earnings? Has there been any structural changes in terms of how you collect fees, what is the impact of the volatility and how does that emanate in earnings?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes, this is Larry. I'll have Luis comment. It is, for the most part, it is. As Luis mentioned earlier, it is the FX impact. So again, you are typically seeing, at the local market level -- at the local market level, Mark, your are typically seeing growth in that -- for Brazil. You're seeing growth in that sort of 20% to 25% annual range, and it just so happens that FX -- over the 12-month period, FX evaporates much of that away. But the long trend on a local market, local currency basis would show you that BrazilPrev has again been among the leaders in terms of growth, both AUM and earnings and profitability. There's been no real structural change in that market relative to fees being collected in a different way or different sorts of investment options being offered or things like that. It's really been the impact of the macroeconomic conditions. So Luis, your comment?","Luis E. Vald\u00e9s","Yes. In light of Larry's comments, we -- at some given point, we had the real kind of 20% down during this year. Right now it's between 8% to 9% down, so it's coming back. And it's running about -- BRL 2.18. And putting this in perspective, nothing is being changed. We have had this kind of a headwind in Brazil, which is a little softer right now. But putting this in perspective, the current spot grade that we have today is exactly the same spot grade that we had in Brazil in 2006. So flying around BRL 2.2, BRL 2 per dollar is pretty much more above the average for the last 15 years for Brazil. So we have had, in the last year, kind of a strong headwind. But again, around BRL 2 per $1 is -- BRL 2.2 per dollar should be the average for the last 10 years for that particular market.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes. I was kind of adjusting for the foreign exchange impact and what we see -- so I was just trying to normalize for that, but I can follow up, if that's better.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes, that's fine. Okay. Thanks, Mark.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Zimpleman, your closing comments, please.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Well, thanks to everybody for joining us for our call today. Despite the macroeconomic challenges, as I said earlier, we're pleased with the momentum of our businesses, and our 2013 results. As John mentioned in the opening commentary, our 2014 outlook call will be on December 9.","At Investor Day in September, we noted that we expect 2014 revenue growth rates and pretax returns to be similar to the 2013 outlook, but we will start from a much higher asset base as a result of our strong results this year.","So while we do expect the global macroeconomic picture to remain challenging, we think our unique business mix and our very experienced management team will allow us to achieve an ongoing balance of profitability and growth.","So thanks, again.

This morning I'll share some performance highlights and accomplishments that positions for continued growth. The Deanna will follow with details on our financial results and enough data on capital deployment and our investment portfolio.","First quarter was a good start to the year for Principal. We continue to deliver strong growth execute on a customer focused solutions oriented strategy, balance investments and growth in expense discipline, and be good stewards of shareholder capital. At $371 million of after tax operating earnings we delivered 29% growth compared to first quarter 2016, this reflects good underlying growth across our fee, spread and risk businesses. It also reflects some softness in prior quarter driven by equity market and foreign currency headwinds.","Over the trailing 12 months we increased assets under management or AUM by $72 billion or 13% to a record $620 billion. This reflects strong asset appreciation and nearly $20 billion of positive net cash flow and it provides a solid foundation for revenue and earnings growth for the year.","During the quarter we again receive some notable third party recognition including Best Mix Fund in Mexico for Morningstar, Benchmark Fund of the Year in Hong Kong, and multiple best fund Awards in Malaysia from Thomson Reuters Lipper. Additionally our global high yield and preferred securities Dublin funds received multiple Lipper Best Fund Awards in New York.","Our longer term Morningstar investment performance remains among the best in the industry and actually improved from year end as shown on Slide 5 at quarter end 80% of principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trusts were above median for three year performance, and 89% were above median for five year performance. Clearly the three and five year rankings are critical given our focus on managing assets for retirement another long term strategies.","Our one year performance with 46% above median is down from year end and compared to a year ago. We continue to watch this closely, but view this as part of the normal ebb and flow of investment performance. After a somewhat disappointing 2016 our investment performance rebounded in the first quarter was 67% of our active funds above median. Over the past 20 quarters on average 75% of our investments were above median for one year performance with more than 80% above median for the three and five year periods.","First quarter 2017 was our 24th consecutive quarter of positive total company net cash flow. This reflects strong consistent investment performance, solutions that resonate with retirement retail and institutional investors, the diversification and non-correlation of our global multi asset, multi manager, multi boutique model and the integration of our businesses enabling us to meet investor needs across life stages.","Before moving on, I'll share a couple of additional thoughts on first quarter net cash flow, I was particularly pleased with the net inflows for Principal International. For RIS-Fee and RIS-Spread and from the U.S. retail funds business, despite the undeniable success of ETS across the industry and with the ETF garnering record net cash flows in the first quarter we continue to have great success selling our value added active strategies and solutions.","I'll also comment on PGI\u2019s institutional net cash flow. As a general point institutional flows tend to be uneven in any given quarter. We'll see investors harvest gains and rebalance portfolios. And as we saw again this quarter, we can also experience withdrawals as we reach the end of fixed term mandates, while institutional flows for the quarter were at net negative $900 million in total, eight boutiques generated at least to $100 million of net inflows. Just four boutiques had net outflows an excess of $100 million. While Columbus Circle experienced negative net cash flows of $1.3 billion in the first quarter. We are pleased to see a recovery in investment performance at this boutique during the quarter.","Despite flat net cash flows for PGI in the first quarter, operating revenues less pass through commissions were up nearly 14% over the year ago quarter. As expected and previously signaled we also had net outflows in China during the quarter due to withdrawals of short term funds. Despite recent outflows we've increased AUM in China by $40 billion or 70% compared to a year ago.","Growth in China is helping to further diversify our revenue and earnings strings overall, in fact China is the third largest contributor to PI's pretax operating earnings. In Chile, retention improved significantly from year end, but we still have negative net cash flows reflecting continued turmoil in the Chilean Pension System importantly the business remains resilient with record AUM in first quarter we're managing more customer money today than anytime in Cuprum\u2019s history.","We continue to be recognized as the top service provider and a top tier investment manager. Recent pension reform proposals have identified the real issue the need for a higher savings rate will continue to be actively involved in the dialogue on creating a sustainable retirement system in Chile, one that creates adequate income in retirement for its citizens through both mandatory and voluntary solutions.","I'll now share some key execution highlights in the first quarter. We continue to expand and enhanced our solution set with a focus on really four key areas. Outcome based funds with a particular focus on income solutions, alternative investments to enhance diversification and manage downside risk, our international retail platform to capitalize on opportunities in Latin America, Asia and Europe our ETF and CIT platforms to provide lower cost investment options to complement our more traditional active strategies.","Fund launches during the quarter included two new asset allocation strategies on our U.S. platform designed to control volatility and the global multi-asset income fund on our usage platform. We also submitted three risk focused fund to fund products designed for individual savers for regulatory approval in China. These products will help fill in that country in long term allocation driven solutions.","We continue to advance our multichannel multiproduct approach to distribution as well. As key developments we opened a new office in Zurich to strengthen and develop customer relationships and enhance our ability to deliver long term investment capabilities to investors and institutions throughout Europe.","We continue to get our funds added to recommended list and model portfolios. We earned more than 20 total placements during the quarter, getting 17 different funds on a dozen different third party platforms with success across asset classes. We expand our partnership with Zenefits beyond specialty benefits adding our new digital 401(k) solution to their benefits exchange platform. We added new bank products to our online IRA self-serve rollover capability. And we launched a new Individual Disability Income solution partnering with Life Preserve the self-short term Individual Disability Income insurance online.","In addition, we continue to make progress on our digital advice and sales platforms not only in the U.S., but also in Latin America and Asia. Responding to demand for technology driven services, improving the customer experience overall enabling us to cost effectively serve customers with account balances of all sizes.","Clearly digital is influencing our product set and our distribution reach as we drive toward solutions that are simpler and faster, address our future generations will buy financial services, as well as reduce barriers to action and eliminate pain points for customers and advisors. There'll be more to come throughout the year on these new developments, and on enhancements to existing capabilities including digital enrollment, online purchasing, as well as accelerated underwriting.","Before closing a quick update on the DOL Fiduciary Rule, the delay in the applicability date to June 9, 2017 doesn't change much for Principal. We continue to work closely with our distribution partners, and to actively engage in discussions around the implementation of the final rule. This work has only strengthened our relationship with these key partners. We remain confident in our ability to comply and remain focused on helping advisors deliver retirement, protection and income solutions to their customers.","I'll close with some additional third party recognition that speaks volumes about who we are as a company. We received multiple Best Places to Work awards during the quarter, and for the seventh time Principal was named by Ethisphere Institute as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies. We still operate in world where most people are under saved, under insured and under advised. Our strategy remains intact as is our commitment to do more to be part of the solution. We go forward from a position of strength with excellent fundamentals and the benefit of broad diversification.","I look for us to continue to build momentum in 2017 and for that momentum to translate into long term value for our shareholders. Deana?","Deanna Strable","Thanks, Dan. First I'd like to start out by saying; I'm honored to have the opportunity to be the CFO at Principal. Well, I may be a new face and voice in the CFO role, I've been at Principal for a long time 27 years, in that time I have gained invaluable experience, running in our U.S. insurance businesses, and I am excited to leverage that experience as I transition into this role.","On the call this morning, I'm going to keep my comments focused on the key contributors to our financial performance during the quarter. I'll finish with an update on our capital deployment strategy and additional details around our investment portfolio.","The first quarter of 2017 was a strong start to the year for Principal, and a continuation of our strong results in 2016. I'm pleased with our integrated and diversified business model and how our businesses are performing.","Total company operating earnings of $371 million increased nearly 30% and operating earnings per share of $1.27 increased 31% over the prior year quarter. We had a few significant variances during first quarter that resulted in a net benefit to operating earnings.","Pretax impacts of these items included a $16 million benefit from higher than expected variable investment income that benefited RIS-Fee, RIS-Spread and Specialty Benefits about equally. A $12 million benefit from higher than expected in encaje returns and Principal International. These items were partially offset by a $6 million assessment in Specialty Benefits associated with the Penn Treaty liquidation.","Net income available to common stock holders was $349 million for first quarter 2017 including net realized capital losses of $17 million. Credit losses continue to be below our pricing assumptions. First quarter 2017 ROE excluding in ALCI other than foreign currency translation adjustment was 14.6% on a reported basis.","Excluding the impact from the 2015 and 2016 actuarial reviews ROE of 15.1% improved more than 200 basis points compared to a year ago, reflecting strong earnings growth and discipline capital management. Keep in mind that over the long term we expect to improve ROE by 30 basis points to 60 basis points per year with fluctuations in any given period. These results were fueled by strong business fundamentals, underline sales growth and disciplined expense management. Macroeconomic conditions have been and will continue to be volatile.","First quarter 2017 benefited from changes in macroeconomic condition including strong equity market performance as the daily average S&P 500 index increased more than 6% from fourth quarter and 19% from the prior year quarter and a weaker U.S. dollar and strengthening international economies particularly in Brazil and Chile.","The first quarter 2016 results were dampened by headwinds from these same factors. As a reminder there is seasonality in some of our businesses. First quarter earnings are seasonally lower in Principal global investors from higher payroll taxes, and specialty benefits due to seasonally hired total claims and sales related expenses. Also mortality can be volatile quarter-to-quarter and its impact varies by business unit. In first quarter 2017, mortality experience was favorable for the pension risk transfer business in RIS-Spread slightly favorable and individual life and slightly unfavorable in Specialty Benefits.","As Dan indicated total company AUM increased 13% from a year ago to a record $620 billion in first quarter 2017. This strong growth in AUM was driven by positive investment performance, favorable foreign currency translation, and importantly positive total company net cash flows nearly $20 billion over the trailing 12 months including $3.7 billion during the first quarter.","As expected total company net cash flows rebounded from fourth quarter 2016 levels of $900 million and exceeded our first quarter 2016 cash flows of $3.3 billion. Once strategy that has proven successful for our U.S. retirement business has been our multi-manager investment platform that offers our customers best-in-class solutions, including affiliated and non-affiliated managers, as well as a suite of target date investments with both active and hybrid solutions.","Our target date suite flows in the first quarter remain positive with strong sales and contribution from our retirement plan participants. Digging deeper into the business unit results, it's important to reiterate our focus on balancing growth and profitability. This means finding the appropriate balance between managing expenses and maintaining pricing discipline while continuing to invest in product and service solutions that meet our customer's needs.","On a trailing 12 month basis and excluding the impact of the 2016 actuarial assumption reviews, first quarter 2017 revenue growth and margins were within or above the 2017 guidance ranges for all of our businesses. All of my comments today on business unit earnings will exclude the impact of the significant variances I mentioned earlier.","I\u2019ll also focus my comments on the business units with notable differences from expectations, as always reported business unit results and key drivers can be found in the Slides and the press release. Principal global investors and individual life pretax operating earnings and key metrics were in line with expectations in the first quarter. Each continues to produce growth and margins that look very attractive relative to industry results.","As shown on Slide 6, RIS-Fee pretax operating earnings of $139 million increased 22% over the year ago quarter. The strong increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue stemming from higher account values as a result of favorable investment performance and positive net cash flows.","Turning to RIS-Spread on Slide 7, pretax operating earnings were $95 million or 40% higher than the prior year quarter. RIS-Spread account values grew 11% over the year ago quarter driven by strong sales in the pension risk transfer business, and fixed annuities as well as opportunistic issuance and investment only.","Additionally mortality gains in our pension risk transfer business contributed to earnings. We remain disciplined when deploying capital to our spread and risk businesses, we continue to see attractive opportunities in our pension risk transfer business, especially in our target market of small to medium size businesses.","As shown on Slide 9, pretax operating earnings for Principal International were $89 million compared to the year ago quarter on a constant currency basis, Principal International\u2019s pretax operating earnings growth rate continues to be in the mid-teens. This reflects our strong execution in both Latin America and Asia. In fact Brazil, China, and Hong Kong all had record pretax operating earnings in the first quarter. In line with our diversification strategy in the emerging markets we operate in on a trailing 12 month basis, Asia represents nearly 20% of PI\u2019s pretax operating earnings increasing revenue and earnings diversification for PI and Principal in total.","We continue to focus on deepening our existing relationships in PI, in particular collaborating with one of our existing joint venture partners China Construction Bank to become a partner in its pension company in China.","Moving to Slide 10, Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were $46 million and 18% increase from the year ago quarter driven by growth in the business and benefits of scale. Despite higher group life claims compared to the prior period, which can be volatile in any one quarter the overall loss ratio was within the targeted range for the quarter.","Corporate pretax operating losses of $59 million were slightly higher than our expected run rate. Keep in mind that corporate losses can be volatile in any given quarter. We anticipate full year 2017 corporate pretax operating losses to be at the favorable and of the previously announced range of $200 million to $225 million. This range reflects the $19 million annual interest expense saving from the 2016 debt refinancing and deleveraging transaction.","Turning to our investment portfolio, it continues to be high quality, well diversified, actively managed and constructed according to our liabilities. During the quarter there has been some additional scrutiny on brick and mortar retailers, and the financial stress they are facing.","A couple of things I'd like to highlight. Our real estate portfolio is well positioned for the risk and opportunities of this evolving economy. As a leading real estate manager, we closely monitor geographic and property space trends and adjusts our portfolio strategies accordingly. Over the years retail space trends have shifted with e-commerce taking market share from brick and mortar stores in particular large department stores.","While we've seen several store closure announcements e-commerce has provided us attractive investment opportunities in industrial and other property types, and we have anticipated these trends in our portfolio construction. It's also worth noting that our retail exposure in the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is predominantly grocery and home improvement anchored centers. Direct exposure to regional malls represents a $150 million or less than 25 basis points of our total U.S. invested assets. None of these properties were impacted by recent anchor store closure announcements.","Further our exposure to risk of loss in the CMBS portfolio is modest. We underwrite and monitor our CMBS portfolio to the underlying property level and stress tests our exposure within the CMBS structure, which gives us confidence in our estimate. We remain very comfortable with our overall portfolio including the retail exposure within our commercial real estate and commercial mortgage backed securities portfolios.","Moving to Slide 12, in first quarter 2017, we strategically deployed $248 million of capital including $130 million in common stock dividends, and $118 million in share repurchases. We'll continue to be strategic and disciplined in deploying capital. This balanced approach to capital deployment supports our diversified and integrated businesses, the needs of our customers and creates long term shareholder value.","As earnings continue to grow, we remain confident in our ability to deploy $800 million to $1.1 billion of capital in 2017 as we previously announced. Last night we announced a $0.46 common stock dividend payable in the second quarter and 18% increase from the prior year period at 38% we are well on our way to our targeted 40% dividend payout ratio.","In closing I see great opportunity in our future, and I'm excited to grow in my new role as CFO. I look forward to meeting with each of you as I get out on the road in the coming months.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for listening to our call today. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore ISI.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning, Dan, I\u2019d like to start with a question on strategy in M&A. Can you comment just broadly on things you\u2019d be interested in the M&A front, I know you've done certainly more in the way of action management deals international pension, how about the good benefit space, is that an area that you'd be interested in pursuing M&A or is it more likely to remain with what you've been doing in the last several years?","Daniel Houston","Yeah, thanks Tom for the question, and good morning. To answer the question, M&A is in your goal part of our strategy, we're look for the right combinations and that usually starts with making it in an accretive transaction. There's really two reasons why we go out there, one is to add additional capabilities, and we've done that over the years as you point out, whether it's around a different investment asset class or whether or not it's a capability within our core businesses so capabilities is a big part of it.","The second one is around scale, the scale in the retirement business, scale in the asset management business, you asked a specific question around group benefits. We would be curious of course, if there is a good match out there that overlays our existing commitment to small to medium size employers, where we think additional scale could be helpful to our long term shareholders. Having said that, I would tell you that we feel very good about the current portfolio of businesses and our current capabilities, and so for there to be a transaction for Principal it would have to be a very financially favorable.","My last comment I want to make and I think I touched on this the last quarter as well. We've got very favorable relationships with our joint venture partners in China and Brazil and Southeast Asia, sometimes they\u2019re going to different countries, we want to make sure that we're able to support that, but oftentimes just to look at their overall strategy, and if we can complement their strategy by adding additional capabilities from Principal across our range of products, we want to be good partners to do that. Does that helpful Tom?","Tom Gallagher","That is Dan. And then just shifting gears to Deanna just on the RIS margins were above target. Can you comment at all, I think there was some lower deck amortization and expenses were pretty favorable? Could you comment on where you see that trending was - would you viewed 1Q as somewhat of an anomaly and expect them to be more in line with what you've guided to or do you think you can sustain something a bit above the range here?","Deanna Strable","Yeah thanks Tom. I'll make a few comments on that and see if Nora wants to add some comments as well. I think as you listen to the script and look at our material, you are correct that even with the things that we called out the RIS earnings both Fee and Spread as well as our margins were slightly above what we would normally expect and I would expect some of that to trend down as we go through the year, but still to be at a very strong level.","Obviously in RIS-Fee line our expenses in our deck were a little bit more favorable than what we would anticipate, and in the RIS-Spread we had some benefits this quarter from mortality gains, but that will normalize overtime, I think the other thing I'd say relative to that is as you know first quarter it does have some seasonality that depresses our earnings in a few of our lines and honestly I'd say those were two pretty offsetting factors in the first quarter, so if you take out our total company normalizing items, I would say that that's a good run rate to run-off service we go through future quarters.","Daniel Houston","Nora something to add?","Nora Everett","Well just confirming that we would give what we see today and assuming equity markets cooperate with us to the balance of the year. We would expect both in RIS-Fee and in RIS-Spread to be at the high end of the margin guidance that we gave back at the outlook call.","Daniel Houston","Tom thanks for the question.","Tom Gallagher","All right that's helpful, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from John Barnidge of Sandler O'Neill.","John Barnidge","Thank you. On Principal International flows were much improved from the year ago, but down from 4Q 2016. Can you talk about this is there some seasonality of play between 1Q and the rest of the quarters of the year, and then I\u2019ll have a follow-up question.","Daniel Houston","Okay, John, yeah appreciate that. And I'll have Luis Vald\u00e9s on that, I mean just as a broad comment as it relates to Principal International\u2019s net cash flows you have countries like China that could be quite disruptive large flows in and out. We try to call these out and recognize that there is going to be some level of volatility given the size and scope of these operations. Luis, some additional comments?","Luis Vald\u00e9s","Yeah, thanks John for your question. And let\u2019s stay focus on little bit on the longer term and if you're looking at PI trailing 12 months we put together $9.5 billion in the last trailing 12 months as of March 2017. If you're looking at the supplement, same period March 2016 it's about $7.9 billion, so it\u2019s a 20% increase you know among peers. So we continue with the very strong Brazilian and solid franchise out of U.S.","We do have some seasonality particularly in the first quarter, summertime in Latin America probably a longer good carnival that is needed in breakeven February, but anyway all in all we continue putting solid net consummate cash flows. And this quarter in particular was a 34th consecutive quarter with positive net cash flow as well Latham. We continue to working on and we believe that we're going to continue put in proceed in that consumer cuts going forward.","Daniel Houston","John I think you said, you had a follow-up.","John Barnidge","Yeah, thank you very much. PGI definitely saw investment performance rankings improved for three and five year, can you talk about how much of a lag you believe there is between improved investment performance on the long term rankings and resulting improved flows?","Daniel Houston","Yeah sure and I'll have Jim respond to you. Jim?","James McCaughan","We\u2019ve got something interesting one, I mean I think as was commented by Dan in the script nearly all of our boutiques have performance was good enough to be able to be pitching seriously for new business. So we're not worried about the pipeline, I think the three and five year are actually making us competitive, there is maybe a question mark that one year is not as pretty close to average. And if I can go back to our more normal rating then I think the flows would pick up, but I wouldn't want to make that a big growth story. I think the growth story is more around our ability to continue growing revenues and earnings, as we did in the first quarter.","Daniel Houston","That helped you John?","John Barnidge","It is indeed. Thanks a lot.","Daniel Houston","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Seth Weiss of Bank of America.","Seth Weiss","Hi good morning, thanks for taking the question. I want to return to RIS-Spread and I understand some of the seasonal benefits that come in the first quarter, but from speaking to the team last night it sounded like mortality was maybe just a marginal improvement versus last year the year ago quarter 1Q 2016, so I'm just struggling to get a run rate down here because the growth in earnings far outpaced the growth in assets when looking over the previous year\u2019s quarter. So if you could comment on what you think is in appropriate margin level or ROA level for this business that would be really helpful?","Daniel Houston","Okay, I'll have Nora do that, but before I do, I just want to remind all the investors out there, but the RIS-Spread business is really an integral and important part of our overall franchise and serving the needs of our customers. We think there's a natural growth that's going to be coming, because people are going to demand income in retirement, and not only income in retirement guaranteed income or in retirement. Principal\u2019s fortunate that we do that one of two ways either through the payout business, which is more lumpy and the other of course is by providing individual retail annuities to our customers.","So again I think this is an important conversation to be having, because we typically get caught up on the RIS-Fee talking about the defined contribution plan, so we see this is a real growth driver for Principal in the future. We've been in it for a very long time, and feel as if we have a lot of skill and knowledge with that I'll have Nora speak specifically to the earnings here in the most recent quarter.","Nora Everett","Sure. Obviously we had a really, really strong quarter, but if you look back and that was and that's being driven by that by the growth in the business, no doubt. But if you look back at our outlook call and look at what we talked about then with regard to net revenue growth at 5% to 10% and then pretax margins at 55% to 60% as we talked about a moment ago, we expect sitting here today looking through full year to be at the high end of that margin based on what we're seeing here in 1Q equally important with regard to net revenue growth again sitting here today looking out at 1Q and projecting forward.","We would expect to be at the high end of that net revenue growth as well. What was driving some of the high 1Q over and above the strong growth in the underlying business were things like the variable investment income that we called out, we called out a piece of that a $5 million piece of that, but there we also are looking forward it at variable investment income and that and that's what's moderating some of that view. The mortality gains in 1Q were about $9 million, so on an absolute basis its certainly helped drive 1Q. And again as we look at all those things and project forward, we would expect to be at the high end of that that net revenue growth outlook.","Seth Weiss","Okay, thank you. If I could just press on just the profitability there, because even if I take out the mortality games end of the PI above trend, I saw get to a quarterly ROA of about 90 basis points, which is a full 10 basis points to 12 basis points better than what you did in 2016 on an adjusted basis, so just seems that the earnings run rate had a dramatic improvement there, and I'm just having a hard time reconciling it as I think about a run rate.","Daniel Houston","Let me have Deanna dive down into that one little bit more detail.","Deanna Strable","Yeah, I think as we pointed to really focus on the return on net revenue versus the return on assets. And I think Nora is correct that the current quarter would be above that range some of that's going to normalize as we go throughout the year we wouldn't expect mortality gains in every single quarter. And so again, I think the more appropriate way to look at that is the return on net revenue and as Nora mentioned we do as we look through the remainder of the year and consider our first quarter results, we expect to be at the favorable and of our guidance range relative to that return.","Seth Weiss","Great thank you.","Daniel Houston","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Suneet Kamath of Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Hi good morning. Just question for Luis we were just noticing during the quarter I think Provida cut its compensation pretty sizably in some asset classes are some products in the quarter. So just wondering if there is some additional competitive pressure that's going on in Chilean market?","Daniel Houston","Yeah, Suneet thanks for that question. And of course, we monitor every one of these markets very closely, and they all have their own kind of unique aspects and what we would tell you is very consistent, I have Luis comment here in just a minute, from the very beginning when we were identifying the right target in the Chilean marketplace we're looking where we felt like we could have the most long term success, and that had a lot to do with the makeup of Cuprum and relationship to the other potential acquisition we could have made and that's proving out to be the case, and Luis maybe we can delve into that a little bit closer and talk about some the details.","Luis Vald\u00e9s","Yeah, sure. Suneet it\u2019s important to keep in mind first that Provida and Cuprum are two important patients companies, but focus on different market segments. So we don't see Provida as a direct competitor that\u2019s number one. And number two, we follow very closely what all those pensions companies are doing in the market, how they position themselves. And I do really understand whether doing and why they're doing. But having that in our case, Suneet and due to our consumer segment that we're focused on, but in fact is the one that has the highest average balance for costumer in that market, we continue with a more differentiated value proposition to them.","So to our customer, our valuable solution to our customers based on superior long term investment performance, financial advice and excessive customer service, in fact, we have received the number one customer service ranking in the last five periods and we competing ranking number two in the long term investment performance. So we do position Cuprum in a very unique way in order to be very much more focused on the segment that we serve in Santiago, Chile.","Daniel Houston","That helps Suneet?","Suneet Kamath","Yeah does, and then just a follow-up for Luis on the joint market it seems like on these calls we've talked about uncertainty in the pension market for quite a few quarters now. So I guess what is the outlook there at what point do we think we'll have some stability in that market?","Luis Vald\u00e9s","Yeah you know the whole discussions the pension reform is making that markedly you know kind of an easy bet. First of all let me try to go back and try to put all my comments under into perspective about the Chile and then our to Chile performance in particular. Our trailing 12 months operating earnings in Chile they believe were $148 million of pretax, this is number one. So it\u2019s a 7% increase over same periods in 2016, same thing for our revenues also growing at 7%. So with all these discussion what I'm trying to say to you Suneet that this is a very resilient you know operation and an asset.","Also we're reporting in this quarter our AUMs are record high $44 billion for our franchise in Chile, and also record high for our AUMs and Cuprum $37 billion that we manage for our costumer, that\u2019s a record point in the whole history of Cuprum. In that sense we're well aware and we understand that we have been experienced some outflows over the past three quarters, although it's still negative, our first quarter 2017 we have shown meaningful improvements in our retain customers and clients.","And our management team is Cuprum is going to continue to be in laser focus on improving our net customer cash flows within our company. And again in order to do that, we do rely on our track record as I mentioned to you to serve our customer needs and expectations particularly in the areas like a superior loans investment performance and customer service, so this where we\u2019re and we're going to continue working for. So this is essentially where we are.","Daniel Houston","Thank you Suneet for the question","Operator","Your next question is from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just a question on the China earnings contribution, looking at a local currency basis is actually improved by more than 20% year-over-year, I was just wondering how much of that was benefit from you have a make shift in your AUM based shipping to the mutual fund as opposed to the money market fund? And then also in terms of the flows in this quarter from a growth sales perspective, can you share in terms of the mix between the mutual funds versus the money market funds product?","Daniel Houston","Yeah, so good question. And your question was a little hard to hear on this in for some reason Humphrey, but I think we've got it generally. And the reality is this we've worked very closely with China Construction Bank on focusing in emphasizing these long term assets more long term in nature and to discourage really loading up on money market or short term assets, and so that's been a very deliberate strategy, and with that I'll ask if Luis would like to add some additional detail on what it looks like going forward?","Luis Vald\u00e9s","Yes, thanks for your question. Uncertainly if you're looking our numbers and supplement and growing up of facts regular earnings $13.4 million for China, and but if you're looking our net revenues and if you\u2019re looking the growth of our net rose in China quarter-over-quarter 18% and in consecutive quarter 4%, so we continue online and in trying to put a double digit growth for this year.","The main ship that we are experience it is as any other country, is a very motivated because China is very government policy driven market. And today and this year 2017 in particular is a year of political transition, so you know a power She is going to renew is the second term so this is the year that the Chinese government they are looking for no surprises to lower the risk to deleverage and the risk that the financial markets.","So in that sense we continue to focus on our strategy those money that flow into our company money market is usual mandate very small fees in that were incidental, but we continue focus on our target market which is to put long term saving products or the middle class in China and these are much more higher fees based and based on mutual funds. So this is the numbers and we continue transition in that sense.","Daniel Houston","Humphrey if that accurately answer your question?","Humphrey Lee","Yeah, I think want I\u2019m trying to get in terms of the gross deposits in the quarter the $46 billion what portion of that would be going into those lower cost in money market funds versus those going to the higher long term - higher fee long term assets.","Daniel Houston","Probably less than 20% that\u2019s my - but we can go back to you to provide that information very precisely.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, thank you. And then just one more question if I can, on the life insurance side with the proposal from the White House that potentially be a repeal of a state tax, and then looking at Principal\u2019s life insurance business account, looking at the average policy count, tends to be a little bit on the higher side, so I was just wondering if you have any high level thoughts right now in terms of what a repeal of the state tax would affect your life insurance business in general?","Daniel Houston","A good question, and you're right, it will be at a high level, and it will be speculative, because we really don't have much detail out of the White House except to say broadly, they're looking for an across the board reduction in corporate tax rates, to try to stimulate the economy, and I would call your attention in fact that a lot of the discussion has to do with growing and helping small to medium size businesses, so a revised tax policy that stimulates small to medium sized growth for small business, is good for PFG.","I look at it really in two buckets, the first bucket is really around retirement savings, and implications either at the corporate level or the individual level, and I come to this conclusion, employees generally benefit significantly by employer matches, regardless of what the impacts on the tax deferral might be in a 401(k) plan and again it's not a tax deduction and simply a tax deferral they benefit from employer matches, they benefit from payroll deduction and they benefit from institutionally priced products. So that's a big part of our franchise, as you know Humphrey.","The second around is state planning whether they're using life insurance or mutual fund as a funding device for non-qualified deferred compensation, which is another important part of our franchise is key. And then lastly for key man insurance, I don't see that that goes away, if you have a individual there are two key partners, and it's they're trying to drive the success of the business, life insurance proceeds are what ensure that that business can continue to go on, and a lot of a state planning will see what happens in the ultimate bill whether or not there\u2019s a tax bill or not. But I just don\u2019t think that Principal has a disproportionate percentage of its business that\u2019s a directly tied to a state planning that there wouldn\u2019t be that additional in needed life insurance protection. So I would say we think we\u2019re sitting actually in a very favorable position related to the tax reform, again at the core of that is growing small to medium sized businesses. Is that helpful?","Humphrey Lee","Yes. Thank you.","Daniel Houston","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Jimmy Bhullar of J.P. Morgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. First just on the fee retirement business, you had pretty strong flows this quarter. And just wondering to what extent that gives you confidence for the rest of the year and are you do you feel that you could exceed your 1% to 3% target on from net flows for the year as a whole?","Daniel Houston","Sure. Thank you for that. I\u2019ll ask Nora to fill the blanks in for you.","Nora Everett","Yeah. Thanks Jimmy for the question, obviously a really strong 1Q on net cash flow at $2.2 billion and it really reflects two things those strong sales at $3.8 billion and then this continued outstanding retention. Across all of our planned sizes, we talked about quarterly results being lumpy income, they can be impacted by one or two larger cases decisions we\u2019ve had that discussion before.","As you look at that 1% to 3% that we\u2019ve talked about with regard to positive net cash flow as a percentage of the beginning of the year comp value. It\u2019s important to remember that when we\u2019re in this rising when we were in rising equity markets that can put pressure on that percentage in other words those withdrawal amounts are driven by these higher equity markets, but the payroll base contributions are unchanged by that market growth.","So just from a percentage basis something to keep in mind, but certainly based on what we see today based on the sales pipeline. The expectation that this outstanding retention will continue to see that we\u2019re comfortable in that 1% to 3% range with that caveat around these raising equity markets.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then I have a question for Jim on PGI, your flows were flat this quarter, and I think you had some fixed income mandates the matured that happened last quarter as well. So can you just give us an idea on how much more of this you have as you\u2019re looking at the rest of 2017?","James McCaughan","Yeah. Thanks, Jimmy. On the fixed income mandates there are - there is a steady kind of drip of those because we did quite a few three and five years mandates, three and five years ago. It\u2019s the way particularly Japanese funds tend to be drawn up. And the challenge we have actually for flows isn\u2019t so much just the drop off at the end of those mandates which is a kind of mission accomplished thing. It\u2019s the challenge of finding further products for them to roll into typically five years after the rolled into this one first time and that\u2019s what we are aggressively working on.","But in terms of quantifying it it\u2019s a study growth group it won\u2019t change much from the position in the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter of this year. The bigger number has really been the outflows of Columbus Circle and since we\u2019re on flows maybe I\u2019ll mention Columbus Circle had a very, very strong start to this year in terms of investment performance. The other thing that has been done at Columbus Circle and I have to credit the management there to develop the next group of people and the work for promotions to portfolio manager among the group there.","We believe the combination of the revise performance and the management clear signs of succession planning. I think that\u2019s going to help us get back clients confidence. So that\u2019s the piece that I think will ride the ship by later little bit year. So I\u2019m not pessimistic about the flow outlook.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thank you.","Daniel Houston","Thank you, Jimmy.","Operator","Your next question is from John Nadel of Credit Suisse.","John Nadel","Hi, hey, good morning. Sort of going to apologize in advance, because I want to dive a little bit deeper into first RIS-Fee and second RIS-Spread. On RIS-Fee I guess the question is this recurring deposits have just been terrific sort of a steady increasing pace of year-over-year growth in recurring deposits, but transfer deposits sort of inflected this quarter. And I\u2019m wondering if you could sort of help us understand why and what to expect from that particular line item moving forward?","Nora Everett","So this is Nora, John. When you talk about transfer deposits inflecting transfer deposits were $3.9 billion. Strong on the transfer deposit side, so I mean we maybe are using that term of art in a different way than I typically used that. But certainly we\u2019re always going to see when we talk about sales there sometimes can be some timing differences between the sale and then the actual transfer deposit when that when those funds come in. But if you take a look, again I would encourage you to take a long term view because quarter-over-quarter you can have a sequential quarters. You can have timing issues, but as you look at it if you take a long term view of both sales and transfer deposits they have been strong.","Recurring deposits that in plan cash flow you talk about those being strong they absolutely a strong that 8% quarter-over-quarter is a very significant growth driver for us. So the transfer deposits related to sales and then the in-plan cash flow which we call recurring deposits those two things have both done very well over the last several quarters. So I may be missing your question.","John Nadel","No. I think, I understand what they\u2019re both related to I\u2019m just, and I\u2019m not really looking at sequential because I know there can be some impact relative to the timing on the transfer deposit line. I\u2019m looking at year-over-year 1Q versus 1Q and this past bunch of quarters on a year-over-year basis you\u2019ve had really good growth in transfer deposits this quarter down on the year-over-year basis. But I just wondering if there was anything to point to there that you know we might need to be thinking about.","Nora Everett","Yeah. There were a few cases a year ago that timing issue that I discussed where there was a difference in quarter between the sales when we reported sales and when the transfers came in, so that\u2019s that noise that I would identifying and that actually did happen a year ago. So that\u2019s probably what you\u2019re picking up.","Daniel Houston","John, one of the last comment on our RIS-Fee before we go to Spread in that has to do with where we\u2019re at in the economic cycle and that has to do with new plan formation and we are finding ourselves in that sweet spot right now where we\u2019ve far exceeded the pre-2008 period where there is a lot of new plant formation, which is exciting to us because this is interesting and fun is it is to get a transfer set of an established plan. Seeing small to medium size businesses grow add new plans and add new participants that\u2019s what\u2019s good for all of America and that\u2019s those are the kind of proof points that we\u2019re on Capitol Hill talking about the effectiveness of the 401(k) model and how it\u2019s working needs to be told. And I think you had a follow-up question on RIS-Spread.","John Nadel","Yeah. I was just going to comment I think I see where your second quarter is going to go. The question on Spread is, and I don\u2019t mean to beat this horse too deeply, I understand you haven\u2019t really good results there. But if I look at the relationship of net revenue growth which you pointed us to these last nine months on a year-over-year basis you\u2019ve had exceptional 23%, 24% growth on a year-over-year basis in net revenues. Against that the non-benefit related expenses are down on a year-over-year basis sort of low single digits. And I guess my question is this, how long can you maintain that kind of differential I mean, I know you don\u2019t expect to grow net revenues a 20% something I know your targets 5% to 10%. But can you continue to grow net revenues at a pace that so significantly exceeds the pace of expense growth.","Nora Everett","So the first thing I would say is this is a highly scalable business and certainly we\u2019re getting the benefit reaping some of that scale as we grow this business. And again it\u2019s an interesting dilemma to be in exceeding expectations so significantly, which we\u2019ve done in RIS-Spread over and over again the last couple quarters. But we\u2019ve looked forward and revisited that outlook call and really are confident that yes, we\u2019re in the ballpark we\u2019re going to be at the high end of the range with regard to net revenue growth.","Now, will we exceed on margins, will we exceed on that revenue growth certainly possibly that can happen. But as we look at that business going forward and look at the benefit that the operating leverage that we know we\u2019re going to continue to be able to read that that\u2019s where we guide you back to. If we exceed that grade, but what sitting here today as we balance both the top line and the bottom line and look at our look at that scale issue that that\u2019s where we come out today.","John Nadel","Nora, can I follow-up on that just real quick as one of the things you did so well as a company at your Investor Day was you talked to us about an outlook for 2017 and also margin outlook longer term and if this is a highly scalable business I\u2019m surprised that the shorter term 2017 margin range of 55 to 60. Isn\u2019t something higher looking out at that longer term outlook, which is also 55 to 60? So I mean is that longer term outlook really pretty conservative now as you think about what you\u2019re seeing in the dynamics of this business?","Daniel Houston","I won\u2019t say it\u2019s conservative. The way I would describe that John is that we continue to have a very strong pricing discipline right now the market is in demand for this type of product we are very disciplined in how we go about setting that price. We have no reason to believe that the margin is going to expand in the future, we in likewise that there may have been some pent up demand because we have seen interest rates rise in the relatively short term here in the last year or so.","John Nadel","Okay, Dan.","Nora Everett","The other thing I would add there is a reminder that we are quite opportunistic in this space both with the full service the pension risk transfer business and our investment only business. So I think you have to add that piece to the equation as well as we are seeing some very attractive opportunities but don\u2019t forget that these are still opportunistic businesses for us so that that\u2019s another piece of the equation that we keep in mind.","Daniel Houston","Thanks for the questions, we look for some follow-up conversations, John.","John Nadel","Appreciate. Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Your next question is from Ryan Krueger of KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Hi. Thanks, good morning. I just had a quick follow-up on the M&A discussion and just curious on how would you characterize the M&A environment at this point following the election in generally higher valuations in the market?","Daniel Houston","In one word expensive. I think is the answer there\u2019s a lot of inflated values associated with most of the businesses that we\u2019re in whether it\u2019s the group benefits business and you see some of these transactions on annuity blocks and life blocks we\u2019ve seen it certainly on the asset management reality there hasn\u2019t been a lot of transactions, I would tell you that we\u2019ve got a good set of eyes work very closely with the industry investment bankers to understand what\u2019s going on across all the continents and again we put in place with Tim Dunbar\u2019s leadership a very strong and disciplined approach to reviewing these opportunities and we doable proactively as well as those things that maybe we didn\u2019t display would come to market. But the values are inflated and we\u2019re going to grow the company either through organic acquisition or through M&A. And right now, the best way to deploy our capital seemingly is around more organic growth. Is that help?","Ryan Krueger","Yeah. It\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot.","Daniel Houston","Okay.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Houston, your closing comments, please.","Daniel Houston","It just a couple of quick comments, we just finished up with a series of visits with a lot of our distribution partners and advisors and there\u2019s something they kept reminded me - reminding me about as a related to the deal well change in general we do now have a new secretary of labor appointed and we\u2019re excited about that. But they make the point that they really are about financial planning, helping with life and disability protection, wealth distribution strategies, asset management strategies, education funding and securing the customers, financial future.","That\u2019s the business we\u2019re in. We manufacture of those products and solutions for our advisors. So regardless of the Reg tax regulatory changes the demand for these products that we\u2019re engaged in is not diminished and of course our target market of small to medium sized business and individuals fits that very well. So we look forward to coming out chatting with you over the course of the next quarter about our strategy again very pleased with the transition between Terry and Deanna, and again we\u2019ll see out on the road. Thank you for taking the times when you listen story.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Principal Financial Group's third quarter conference call. As always, materials related to today's call are available on our website at principal.com\\investor. As a reminder, the acquisition of the Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement & Trust business or IRT closed at the beginning of the third quarter, and the financials are reported in RIS-Fee. We are continuing to evaluate options for the best long-term financial reporting structure once the business is fully integrated.","Following a reading of the safe harbor provision, CEO Dan Houston and CFO Deanna Strable will deliver some prepared remarks, then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A session include Renee Schaaf, Retirement and Income Solutions; Tim Dunbar, Global Asset Management; Luis Vald\u00e9s, Principal International; and Amy Friedrich, U.S. Insurance Solutions.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The company does not revise or update them to reflect new information, subsequent events or changes in strategy. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed by the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","Additionally, some of the comments made during this conference call may refer to non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure may be found in our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation.","And one other item. Please plan to join us for 2020 outlook call on Wednesday, December 11. We'll discuss business unit expectations for 2020 and provide any needed updates to long-term guidance. Dan?","Daniel Houston","Thanks, John, and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning, I'll share performance highlights and accomplishments that position us for continued growth. Deanna will follow with details on our financial results and capital deployment. In the third quarter, we reported $345 million of non-GAAP operating earnings. Excluding significant variances, which Deanna will discuss, non-GAAP operating earnings decreased 10% compared to a strong year ago quarter. For the trailing 12 months, also excluding significant variances, non-GAAP operating earnings of $1.5 billion were 5% lower than the year ago period. The decline reflects macroeconomic headwinds, ongoing fee pressure in PGI and RIS-Fee and increased investments in the business. As I reflect on our performance and progress over the first 9 months of the year, we continued to demonstrate strong business fundamentals, balanced investments in our business with expense discipline and being good stewards of shareholder capital.","We also continued to execute our customer-focused solutions-oriented strategy as we expanded our global distribution network and array of retirement, investment and protection solutions and advanced our digital business strategies to create a better customer experience and drive revenue growth while gaining operational efficiencies.","Compared to a year ago and excluding the acquired assets under administration or AUA, total company reported assets under management or AUM increased $36 billion or 5% to a record $703 billion. Year-to-date AUM is up $77 billion or 12%. As a reminder, AUM in our China joint venture of $146 billion at quarter-end isn't included in our reported AUM. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, China AUM is up 2% compared to a year ago.","On a total company basis, we generated $6.9 billion of net cash flow in the third quarter, our strongest result in 3 years. This includes positive net cash flow in all of our businesses.","RIS delivered $2.8 billion of net cash flow, its seventh consecutive positive quarter. This was driven by strong sales, retention and recurring deposit growth in RIS-Fee and record pension risk transfer sales in RIS-Spread. Over the trailing 12 months, RIS has delivered over $9 billion of positive net cash flow, almost double the net cash flow in the same period a year ago. Principal International generated $1.6 billion of net cash flow, its 44th consecutive positive quarter. This primarily reflects strong flows in Brazil, where we're leading the industry in net deposits captured year-to-date. It also reflects record net cash flow in Hong Kong as increased collaboration between Principal International and Principal Global Investors drove a large platform win during the quarter. This collaboration is increasingly beneficial as private pension reform discussions advance around the world and governments recognize not only the importance of voluntary savings but also the benefit of using asset managers to improve long-term returns.","Moving to PGI. Third quarter PGI managed net cash flow was a positive $2.9 billion. The strength in this measure was broad-based, with institutional, our fund platforms and the general account all delivering positive net cash flow. PGI sourced net cash flow was a positive $1.3 billion compared to a negative $3.7 billion in the prior year quarter. This was PGI's best quarter of sourced net cash flow in 2 years. On a trailing 12-month basis, sourced deposits are up more than $3 billion or 9%, while withdrawals have stabilized as a percentage of the average AUM.","Slide 5 highlights the ongoing strength of our investment performance. At the end of the third quarter, for our Morningstar-rated funds, 81% of the fund-level AUM had a 4- or 5-star rating. 75% and 78% of our principal actively managed mutual funds, ETFs, separate accounts and collective investment trusts were above median for the 3- and 5-year performance, respectively. And 91% were above median for 10-year performance, with 63% in the top quartile. For 1-year performance, 49% were above median. This was primarily due to the underperformance in the fourth quarter 2018 of certain international equity strategies, which also impacts our target date series. These strategies have improved year-to-date. We continue to make good progress to drive sales growth and improve retention, particularly in the areas of distribution and product development.","In the third quarter, we launched more than a dozen new investment strategies across our U.S. and international platforms. Of particular note, we continued to expand our suite of multifactor ETFs in PGI. While these investments are available to the general marketplace, they were designed to give financial advisors more flexibility to allocate assets through a robust wealth of digital platform.","We had several key launches internationally as well, including the U.S. blue-chip equity fund on our UCITS platform; the first Chilean mutual fund investing in the real estate sector; and lastly, the Principal Philanthropy Social Impact Bond Fund, the first of its type in Indonesia.","Additionally, we continue to refine our investment capability structure in PGI. As client demand for emerging market fixed-income strategies continue to grow, we are bringing together a cohesive emerging market debt team by combining the Finisterre leadership with other PGI talent. This will enable us to provide a full suite of emerging market debt solutions to meet client needs. While we closed a hedge fund in Finisterre during the quarter and took an impairment, we expect the strong growth we've seen in other Finisterre solutions to continue. Our solutions and capabilities continue to resonate in the marketplace, as shown by our ongoing success adding our investment options to third-party distribution platforms, recommended list and model portfolios. Over the trailing 12 months, we've earned more than 100 total placements, with more than 50 different investment strategies on more than 3 dozen different platforms.","Now I'll provide more highlights on our business execution, starting with the IRT acquisition that closed on July 1. Some details are provided on Slide 6. It's early in the process, but the integration is on track. Revenue lapses were in line with expectations. Prior to close, we announced plans to unify the RIS leadership team by bringing on board top talent from IRT. These leaders bring a significant amount of acquisition integration experience with them as they have integrated a dozen acquisitions over the past 20 years. Together, we have the expertise and the resources needed to ensure a smooth transition while continuing to deliver organic growth in the business. ","We're extremely pleased with the large number of positive interactions we've already had with clients, advisors and consultants. As expected, we are already seeing a few benefits. The acquisition adds significant scale and capabilities to our mid- and large plan presence. It strengthens our presence in key industries, including health care, manufacturing and financial services, and it amplifies our leadership position across defined contribution, defined benefit, nonqualified deferred compensation and trust and custody. In terms of technology platform, we determined we would best serve retirement customers by incorporating capabilities from the IRT platform into Principal's proprietary record-keeping platform. Similarly, we best serve the trust and custody customers by retaining SEI, IRT's existing trust accounting platform. Work is on track to integrate and enhance the infrastructure to ensure a smooth transition.","In combination with our top-tier service model and our accelerated investment in digital capabilities, we're delivering better outcomes and better experience for plan participants and plan sponsors as well as for consultants and advisors. One example is our new digital mobile participant on-boarding platform, Principal Real Start. Since the fourth quarter of 2018 launch, we've seen 250,000 participants complete the experience. Their average deferral rate is just under 8%, nearly 50% higher than traditional.","Additionally, 28% of these participants are saving at least 10% of their income, and 23% are auto-escalating to 10%, both are more than 6x the rate of other enrollment methods. This helps drive reoccurring deposit growth, but more importantly, it puts participants on the path to having enough income in retirement.","Another highlight we're proud of in U.S. Insurance Solutions, we're one of the first in the industry to debut a fully digital experience for purchasing term life insurance. More than 95% of the users now apply online with no assistance and approximately 25% completed on a mobile device. This new end-to-end digital process delivers a policy 2\/3 faster on average. In many cases, we can have a policy in the client's hands in a few days, and in some cases, just a few hours after issue.","We've also updated the Principal Benefit Design Tool, which captures the knowledge we've gained from working with over 140,000 U.S. business owners on building competitive benefits packages, including retirement, dental, disability income and life insurance. Advisors and business owners can create personalized reports on how benefits compare based on size, industry and region.","Finally, I'll share some development outside the U.S. that also demonstrates our focus on delivering a better customer experience. In Mexico, we launched a partnership with Club Premier, the most recognized coalition program in the country to offer loyalty rewards to promote savings. And in Hong Kong, we launched a digital on-boarding tool for MPF members. ","Deanna will cover capital in more detail, but I'll again emphasize our balanced approach to deployment. In addition to ongoing investment in organic growth through 9 months, we've deployed more than $1.8 billion of capital in total, with $1.2 billion for the IRT acquisition and $627 million returned to shareholders through common stock dividends and share buybacks. This includes resuming share buybacks in the third quarter with $44 million of repurchases.","We enjoyed some noteworthy third-party recognition during the third quarter. In our global asset management franchise, we won multiple Best Fund awards in Chile, Malaysia and Thailand. Principal Asset Management Berhad was named Investors' Choice -- Fund House of the Year 2019 by FSMOne Malaysia. And Principal Real Estate Investors earned industry recognition for leadership in sustainability and responsible property investing.","Additionally, U.S. News & World Report named Principal to the list of Best Life Insurance Companies of 2019. And Ivas & Associates ranked Principal the #1 provider of life insurance in the small-case business market based on case count and premium.","The Investment Management Education Alliance recognized Principal with 5 education awards more than any other firm, including awards for digital education and retirement communications. Lastly, Principal Chile and Cuprum both were recognized by Diario Financiero for their commitment to ethical business and integrity. Along with recognition in the first half of the year for our commitment to diversity, inclusion and ethical behavior, the recognition speaks volumes about our culture. ","During the third quarter, we made clear progress in helping customers and clients achieve financial security and success. We continue to take the appropriate steps to combat competitive pressures to differentiate Principal in the marketplace and to position the company to deliver above-market growth in shareholder value over the long term.","Before turning the call over to Deanna, I want to let you know that we're closely following events in certain locations in Latin America and Asia where Principal does business. We're taking the necessary steps to help ensure the safety of our employees while continuing to meet the needs of our customers. Deanna?","Deanna Strable","Thanks, Dan. Good morning, and thank you for participating on our call. Today, I'll discuss the key contributors to our third quarter financial results, including impacts of the actuarial assumption review, and provide an update on capital deployment as well as our strong financial position. Net income attributable to Principal was $277 million for the third quarter, including minimal credit losses and a $74 million impairment of an equity method investment. The impairment was driven by the closure of a hedge fund in Finisterre, as Dan discussed earlier. Additionally, Finisterre will be fully consolidated in our financials starting in the fourth quarter. Reported non-GAAP operating earnings were $345 million or $1.23 per diluted share.","As shown on Slide 7, we had pretty significant variances during third quarter, with a net negative $41 million impact to reported non-GAAP pretax operating earnings. The significant variances included a negative $40 million impact as a result of the annual assumption review partially due to lowering our interest rate assumptions; $11 million of elevated compensation and other expenses stemming from the IRT acquisition, including $7 million of transaction costs in corporate and $4 million of integration costs in RIS-Fee; and a $9 million net benefit in Principal International, with $13 million of higher-than-expected encaje performance partially offset by $4 million of lower-than-expected inflation, both in Latin America. As a reminder, in the year ago quarter, we had 3 significant variances with a net positive $65 million impact to reported non-GAAP pretax operating earnings. This included the annual assumption review, an accelerated PGI real estate performance fee and higher-than-expected variable investment income. This year's assumption review was impacted by economic and experience assumption changes as well as model refinements.","For economic adjustments, the most significant impact was in Individual Life from lowering our interest rate assumptions. This included a 50 basis point decrease to the assumed long-term 10-year treasury rate, lowering at 2.4%. In addition, the starting point has dropped significantly from this time last year, and we extended the length of time until we get to the ultimate rate. The 10-year treasury is one of many assumptions for investment income over the life of the business. Experience assumption changes included updates in RIS-Fee and Individual Life. RIS-Fee had the biggest impact as we updated withdrawal assumptions in variable annuities. These items were partially offset by a benefit for model refinements in Specialty Benefits and Principal International. The most significant was in Specialty Benefits, where we updated our models to capitalize acquisition costs in our group benefits business. This will not have a significant impact to annual pretax operating earnings but will slightly impact the quarterly pattern of earnings. Looking forward, we expect these changes will decrease pretax operating earnings in Individual Life by $2 million to $3 million per quarter and have an immaterial impact in the other business units.","While not a significant variances quarter, variable investment income was slightly below our expectations on a total company basis. Slightly higher prepayment fees and in-line real estate returns were offset by lower-than-expected alternative income. Variable investment income was $9 million lower in RIS-Spread as it has a greater allocation of investment income from alternatives. This was primarily offset by a slight positive in Individual Life and Specialty Benefits, which benefited from higher prepayment fees.","ROE excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustment was 12.4% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact from the assumption review, ROE was 12.7%.","The non-GAAP operating earnings effective tax rate was 17.7% for the third quarter, slightly higher than what we experienced in the first half of the year. We continue to expect the full year to be within our guided range of 16% to 20%.","Looking at macroeconomic factors. The S&P 500 Index increased over 1% during the quarter, and the daily average increased nearly 3% compared to second quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, the daily average increased 3%, significantly less than the 16% increase in the prior period and our assumed equity market performance, impacting revenue growth in RIS-Fee and PGI. Foreign currency exchange rates were a headwind for Principal International in third quarter. Pretax operating earnings impacts were a negative $4 million versus the prior year quarter, a negative $2 million compared to second quarter 2019 and a negative $29 million on a trailing 12-month basis.","Mortality and morbidity were within our expectations in Individual Life and Specialty Benefits for third quarter. RIS-Spread mortality losses were $12 million worse than expected. Third quarter typically has a mortality loss but not to this magnitude. We are comfortable with our experience over the long term.","Turning back to Slide 6. I'll expand on Dan's comments on the IRT acquisition. As a reminder, we are operating under a transition service agreement for up to 24 months to give us time to build out additional infrastructure to ensure a seamless transition. As the acquisition closed on July 1, this is the first time we are reporting the financials, which are included in RIS-Fee. The results are largely in line with what we communicated at the acquisition announcement, but we did want to highlight a couple of items. ","At the end of the third quarter, the acquired business had $876 billion of AUA. Growth in AUA since the acquisition announcement has been driven by positive equity market performance. Keep in mind that AUA is not a direct driver of revenue or earnings.","Fees and other revenues in the trust and custody business are correlated with movements in the interest on excess reserves rate or IOER. This rate has been lowered 3x since the announcement of the acquisition, and additional Federal Reserve rate cuts are being considered in fourth quarter. This has negatively impacted revenue in this portion of the business.","At close, we recorded $546 million of intangible assets from the acquisition, resulting in $7 million of additional amortization expense in RIS-Fee each quarter. This negatively impacts the operating margin but does not impact free cash flow. Excluding transaction and integration costs, the acquisition had an immaterial impact on third quarter non-GAAP operating earnings per diluted share, as we expected. Going forward, it is anticipated to have an immaterial impact for full year 2019. We'll provide updated expectations for 2020 on our outlook call. The integration is on track, as Dan said, and I'm confident that we have the right team in place to ensure a successful transition. ","The following comments on business unit results exclude significant variances from both periods, including the assumption reviews. Starting with RIS-Fee on Slide 9. Pretax operating earnings of $124 million were in line with expectations and includes the immaterial impact of the IRT acquisition. Trailing 12-month net revenue growth of 3% is above our guided range as the acquisition brought on additional net revenue in third quarter. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, RIS-Fee's quarterly margin was just over 30% and slightly above the guided range. Including the acquisition, the quarterly margin declined from 33% in second quarter to 25% in the third quarter. Longer term, we expect quarterly margins to expand once the acquisition is fully integrated and the expense synergies are realized.","Importantly, the underlying fundamentals in the legacy business continue to be strong. Compared to a year ago, sales of $3.7 billion in the third quarter increased nearly 30%. Defined contribution plan count was 2% higher, and net cash flow of $1.1 billion was driven by strong sales, 10% growth in recurring deposits and low contract lapses. We expect full year net cash flow to be at the high end of the 1% to 3% of beginning-of-year account values.","Turning to Slide 10. RIS-Spread's pretax operating earnings of $83 million were lower than expected due to $12 million of worse-than-expected mortality losses and $9 million of lower-than-expected variable investment income, as I mentioned earlier. RIS-Spread's trailing 12-month net revenue growth and margin were within our guided ranges. RIS-Spread sales of $3.1 billion in the third quarter included a record $1.3 billion of pension risk transfer sales. This brings pension risk transfer sales to $2.8 billion year-to-date, more than all of 2018 sales.","As shown on Slide 11, PGI's pretax operating earnings of $123 million were in line with expectations. On a trailing 12-month basis, PGI's margin of 35% was within our guided range, but revenue growth remained below our guided range primarily due to unfavorable equity market performance in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Moving to Slide 12. Principal International's pretax operating earnings of $92 million was slightly higher than expected due to timing of prepayment fees in Chile. PI's trailing 12-month margin of 38% was within our guided range, but net revenue growth was lower than our guided range due to foreign currency headwinds. Excluding these headwinds, net revenue increased 6% over the prior year period.","Turning to Slide 13. Specialty Benefits' pretax operating earnings of $81 million were strong due to favorable claims experience and growth in the business. Strong performance continued in Specialty Benefits, with 7% growth in premium and fees on a trailing 12-month basis. This was driven by strong sales, retention and in-group growth and was within our guided range. The trailing 12-month margin of 13% was also within our guided range.","As shown on Slide 14, Individual Life's pretax operating earnings of $52 million were in line with expectations but lower than the prior year quarter as claims experience returned to expected levels. On a trailing 12-month basis, Individual Life's premium and fee growth and margin were within our guided ranges. Individual Life sales increased nearly 30% from a year ago, with over 60% from the business market.","At $95 million, corporate pretax operating losses were higher than expected. As discussed on previous calls, higher security benefit expenses as well as increased debt expense and lower net investment income related to the IRT acquisition are impacting corporate losses. We continue to expect corporate losses to be above the guided range of $300 million to $320 million for the full year.","With the recent drop in interest rates, I want to provide some details on impacts to our businesses outside of the assumption review. During the third quarter, at 3.2%, our new money yield was about 60 basis points lower than the overall portfolio yield, excluding variable investment income. However, it will take some time for the new money yield to have a meaningful impact on the overall portfolio yield. And while low rates aren't ideal for some of our businesses, the level of spread compression won't be as pronounced as in previous periods when the portfolio yield was much higher than the new money yield. As I mentioned earlier, the IRT business will impact our sensitivity to interest rates, and we plan to provide an update on our 2020 outlook call.","We remain disciplined in updating our pricing for interest rate movements. We're conservative in the products and liabilities we have exposure to, and we remain diligent around asset liability management. While higher rates are incrementally positive, our diverse business mix positions us well in the slow interest rate environment.","As shown on Slide 15, we committed and deployed over $200 million of capital during the quarter, including $153 million deployed for common stock dividends, $44 million in share repurchases and $5 million to a minority investment. With capital deployment of $1.8 billion through the third quarter of '19, we've already exceeded our $1 billion to $1.4 billion guided range for 2019.","Last night, we announced a $0.55 common stock dividend payable in the fourth quarter, a 2% increase from a year ago. Our dividend yield is approximately 4%, and on a trailing 12-month basis, we're slightly above our targeted 40% net income payout ratio.","Our capital and liquidity position remain very strong. We ended the third quarter with nearly $1 billion at the holding company, $100 million of capital in excess of a 400% RBC ratio and over $400 million of available cash in our subsidiaries. In addition, a low leverage ratio and no debt maturities until 2022 provides us significant financial flexibility. Looking ahead, I want to remind you that fourth quarter operating expenses are typically higher than other quarters as we usually see elevated branding expenses, benefit costs and variable sales expenses.","We look forward to talking with you on our 2020 outlook call on December 11. We'll provide updated expectations for each business unit for 2020 as well as any updates to long-term guidance. These will reflect the impacts of the IRT acquisition.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","I know you said you plan to update this on the 2020 outlook call, but is there any additional info you can give us to help understand better the potential sensitivity of the wealth business to short-term rates, maybe the balance of trust and custody assets or something of that nature that could help us frame it?","Daniel Houston","Yes. Thanks, Ryan. This is Dan. It's a good question. And as we all know, this trust and custody business is quite different than what I'll consider is the traditional full-service model. And the reality is that these short-term interest rates do matter, and it's not insignificant. But with that, I'll have Renee provide you with any short thought she might have on sensitivities going forward, if there's another downtick in short-term interest rates.","Renee Schaaf","Yes. Thank you for your question, Ryan. And as Dan pointed out, the mix of business that we are getting from IRT is a little bit different from what you might think about in terms of our traditional fee business. And there is a spread component to the trust and custody business. Generally speaking, if you were to isolate the IRT revenues, we see about 10% to 15% of the revenues as having an impact on the Fed rate that is established for the interest on excess reserves. And as we go into the earnings -- or the outlook call in December, we can give you greater detail about how you might think about that for the future. But hopefully, that gives you somewhat of a frame for this call today.","Ryan Krueger","And then a follow-up that's somewhat related. The $7 million of quarterly intangible amortization, will that continue for the foreseeable future? Or does it drop off over time?","Renee Schaaf","It will continue for the foreseeable future. That is something that you can expect to see quarter-over-quarter. The actual amount may vary according to the way that the assets are amortized, but it is a figure that you can expect to see there quarter after quarter.","Deanna Strable","Ryan, just to add on that, the large portion of the intangibles are amortized over a 23-year period, with the smaller portion amortized over 6 years. So again, over the next six years, that amortization amount will stay the same.","Operator","The next question is from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.","Thomas Gallagher","The TSA that you have with Wells, Deanna, that you said is a 24-month contract, what are those expenses? Can you quantify how much that is? And should we expect to get kind of a cliff pop in earnings when that's done? Or are there pieces to that, so it's going to be more gradual?","Daniel Houston","Yes. It's a big question, and I appreciate it. Renee, do you want to go and cover those details?","Renee Schaaf","Yes, absolutely. So Tom, when we think about the transition service agreement and the expenses that are attached to that, that represents the direct costs that we are being assessed from Wells Fargo IRT to service this business. And so as the business and employees transition from IRT onto The Principal, we can expect that the TSA will decline in amount. But then commensurately, you'll see an increase in the amount of the expenses that we take on with The Principal block. So it's somewhat of just a transition of expenses over time.","Daniel Houston","But I think that it's also true to say that over a longer period of time, as we wean ourself off this system, we will see a material reduction in cost because of many of the synergies that we've discussed in getting to this point. But those will not materialize, I think the word you used, Tom, was like a cliff, in 24 months. It will take some period of time to have that materialize.","Thomas Gallagher","Got you. And then just a question about the retention of the Wells business so far. I looked at the year-end AUM disclosure 2018 and then the updated 3Q. I was sort of backing into about outflows of 10% of the book. So I guess my question is just ask directionally about what's happened thus far. And can you comment on how the retention has compared to your expectations?","Daniel Houston","So let me hit that first, and I'll toss it to Renee. The first and foremost is we're 100 days into this transition, and we frankly couldn't be more excited about the feedback we're getting from a number of different constituents, starting with employees that were previously with Wells Fargo. They're excited about joining our retirement asset management organization. The second is we have hosted many, many clients of all sizes, and the feedback has been quite positive. The third constituency is obviously the advisors, consultants, the gatekeepers, investment advisors to these plans. And again, many of those are individuals and organizations we haven't previously worked with closely. And I think they have been pleasantly surprised not only by the strategy that we're using to transition the business but, equally important, some of the capabilities that they currently don't enjoy today that they will enjoy once we transition the plans over. So with that, I'll ask Renee to speak maybe specifically to the 10% number.","Renee Schaaf","Yes, absolutely. So I think maybe what you're doing is looking at the assets under administration number and maybe trying to use that as a proxy for how to think about the lapses that we're seeing in revenue or the decline that we would anticipate seeing in revenue due to lapses. The one thing I would caution you about there is that assets under administration figure has a lot of different kind of a mix represented in there, so it's not a very good proxy for revenue. So for example, that asset under administration figure has a very large portion of it attributable to the non-retirement trust and custody business. And it will not perform similarly to what we might expect to see for defined contribution, defined benefit and nonqualified business underneath the block. So I think that's the first thing I'd want you to know.","With respect to the lapse rates, as Dan said, this is running as we had anticipated. We are not seeing anything that is surprising or concerning at this point. We have been really well received in the marketplace. We are going above and beyond to make sure that we continue to communicate fully with clients, with financial advisors and with consultants. And to that, we approach this transition process thoughtfully and with a great deal of detail so that we can ensure a very smooth transition and that we can add value to the long-term business.","Operator","The next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder Bhullar","Just a question on PGI. You had pretty strong flows this quarter, but they've been sort of inconsistent. So what really drove that? Or was it a few large cases that you won? Or was it more broad-based than what your expectations are for flows at PGI over the next few quarters?","Daniel Houston","Yes. We're really excited about the net cash flow improving. And Pat and Tim have just done a great job getting out. And there's a lot of variables and a lot of exciting news there, but I'll throw it to Tim to provide some of those details.","Timothy Dunbar","Yes. Jimmy, thanks a lot for the question. No, what we're seeing is really a broad-based interest in a lot of our capabilities. And I would say, in part, the low interest rate environment has seen a lot of our clients and a lot of our platforms win on the fixed income side. So that would be core fixed income but also preferred securities. And emerging market debt that we have, a new total return fund with Finisterre. So we've seen a good pickup there, but as well, we've seen really good pickup in a lot of the platforms and many of our equity capabilities, like blue chip and some of our small cap, both domestic and international capabilities. And then really, systematic strategies is doing well and a lot of our asset allocation capabilities. So it's really quite broad-based. I would say, just like Dan said, Pat Halter and the team, the distribution team, have done an excellent job of creating an organizational structure that is really cohesively going after the marketplace. And so we're seeing a lot of momentum build. So we feel good about fourth quarter. Nobody knows what the macro environment is, but I think we feel good about the organizational structure we have and moving into 2020.","Jamminder Bhullar","And just fees on the assets that you've put on recently. Are those commensurate with, like, overall fees or -- because in the past, there have been instances when you've had pretty good flows, and then a few years later, we find out that a lot of these cases that came on had lower fees, especially the Japanese mandates. So any comments on, like, how the recent improvement in flows relates to fees on those assets?","Timothy Dunbar","No. I would say we haven't had any of the very large investment-grade fixed-income mandates coming the door this quarter like what maybe you'd seen in the past. And so no, the fee levels that we're seeing are really pretty good and pretty consistent. I'd also mention that our real estate capabilities have done really well, and those fees, obviously, on the alternative side are quite good. I mean many of our specialty fixed-income capabilities also have nice fees associated with them. So no, we're not seeing those really big mandates that sort of flip side us from an AUM and a fee-level perspective come in right now.","Daniel Houston","Good questions, Jimmy. Really appreciate it. The only other thing I would add to that is the strong collaboration that's occurring between PGI and PI, just a lot of good work there to partner together to build out this global asset management entity. So thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Just a follow-up question on the IRT earnings comments for 2019. When you talk about kind of immaterial for '19, should we think about that as before integration costs and before the amortization? Or is it inclusive of those 2? I just want to get a sense of how to think about that particular earnings impact from the IRT block.","Daniel Houston","Yes.","Deanna Strable","Yes, great question, Humphrey. When we say immaterial, it excludes the onetime costs but does include the amortization. And that immaterial applies to both the RIS-Fee earnings impact as well as the total company, slightly positive from an RIS-Fee perspective once you take out those onetime fees and then, again, immaterial at a total company level. So that's what it includes and how we're encompassing that going forward.","Humphrey Lee","And then is there any reason why, like, for '19, you would incur a little bit higher expenses with respect to the block? Or is it just simply the earnings emergence is largely coming from the expected expense savings to emerge over time?","Deanna Strable","Yes. I think you're right there. I think, again, a large part of that will come once we take on the business and can experience the synergies. And so that is leading, in addition to that amortization of the intangible, leading to that immaterial impact at this point.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. Got it. And then shifting gear. So on the PGI flows, you've talked about -- I think Dan talked about you're still feeling pretty good about the fourth quarter. I think in the past, you talked about second half would definitely be in positive net flows. But how should we think about the -- I guess on a full year basis, given the new Mexico mandate will come in the fourth quarter and some of the traction that you're getting, do you anticipate -- barring a market downturn, do you expect full year will be positive for PGI?","Timothy Dunbar","Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, we do anticipate that full year net cash flow will be positive for 2019.","Operator","The next question is from Suneet Kamath with Citi.","Suneet Kamath","I just want to ask a question related to the UBS fee change on separately managed accounts. I don't know if that has a -- if you're big in that business. But I just wanted to get a sense if something like that, if that becomes a trend, could that impact PGI in terms of fee rates or economics?","Daniel Houston","Can you elaborate a little bit further on that, Suneet?","Suneet Kamath","Yes. So UBS announced a change to how they're paying asset managers in separately managed accounts, particularly their own asset manager. So just wondering if you guys have a lot in there. What percentage of your assets under management are in such separately managed account products, if any?","Daniel Houston","Yes. We'd have to get back to you on that, and we are happy to do it. But we sub-advise to a number of different platforms, including UBS and a lot of other organizations. I'm unaware of any material change to any of our partnerships, except to say that's an ongoing discussion. It never goes away. And one advantage that we do enjoy, frankly, is the fact that we're not a one-trick pony in that we have a lot of business with a lot of different organizations across retirement, across life, specialty benefits, annuities. And so those are firm-wide negotiations and discussions. But if something material changes, we'll certainly bring that to your attention. Appreciate the question.","Suneet Kamath","Yes. I just had a follow-up, if I could, just for Deanna on the assumption reviews. Should we expect any impact on your year-end statutory financials? And do you have any thoughts on AAT reserves given where we are in the interest rate environment?","Deanna Strable","What was the last part of that question?","Suneet Kamath","Just on asset adequacy testing reserves or cash flow testing reserves given current interest rate levels.","Deanna Strable","Yes. So both there, I don't expect anything from a cash flow perspective. And specific to the AR, it could have a slight negative impact but very manageable within our capital deployment plan.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. This is John Barnidge [ph]. How should we be thinking about what's happening in Hong Kong right now impact on PI? There was a story JPMorgan recently set up a trust business in Singapore. Just trying to dimension maybe how the protest and continued friction with China maybe changing or altering where you're focusing geographically in Asia.","Daniel Houston","Yes, yes. Appreciate the question. And before I throw it over to Luis, no question around the world there. In some of these emerging markets, it's not uncommon that we'd see some of this dislocation. These still, when we think about it strategically, are very important markets. There's a lot of volatility, but frankly, with that volatility comes a lot of potential growth. And as you can see specifically in Hong Kong, we've actually seen flows remain quite strong. And that's, frankly, one of the advantages of these mandatory systems, that you're going to continue to see those flows. But Luis, you want to add some additional color on, perhaps, both Hong Kong and Chile?","Luis Vald\u00e9s","Okay. Hi, John. In particular, I was in Santiago at the beginning of this week. Also, Thomas Cheong, our President for Asia, was down there as well. So we spent fair amount of time reviewing our operations and plans and contingency plans, in particular. So first of all, I'm going to repeat something that already was said by Dan. As a reminder, our Hong Kong and Chile operation are both heavily weighted towards the mandatory pension system. So as such, unlike retailers and other industries, our business is relatively well insulated from short term and medium term for this kind of -- type of market disruptions. And second, I would say that you're looking both markets. We haven't seen any major macroeconomic distress for -- neither for Hong Kong nor for Chile, Santiago, even in the very last week for Santiago. For Chile, it's a country risk, FX, interest rates and equity markets are -- I would say, they have had some minimal changes but nothing really important.","The third element, which is pretty interesting and probably very interesting for you, is that you have a well-designed and robust infrastructure contingency plan, digital platforms, investments, highly secured data centers and redundancy where it's needed. We haven't had any major distress, and our -- all our operations have been up and running 24x7 in Hong Kong and in Santiago and in Chile, and we have been able to serve our clients all the time as needed. We have some minor disruptions in some branches but nothing really important. So I would say that more to come, but I'm proud of the quality of our professionals and people and the quality of our operations in both places. So more to come, John.","In particular, in finishing your question, we have a very important operation in Hong Kong, but also, we have a very important footprint in Mainland China. So it's a highly well-diversified operation in China and certainly is very well connected, so more to come.","Unidentified Analyst","And then a follow-up question. You had strong sales in the quarter in Specialty Benefits and Individual Life. Can you kind of talk about where you're seeing that demand coming from maybe by sector or by segment within that market?","Daniel Houston","Just before I throw that over to Amy, what's also encouraging is just to see that in-plan growth just continue to materialize. It's true in our group benefits business. It's true in our retirement business, where people are hiring. And as you know, a lot of our business is small to medium-size business. And so the economy just continues to be favorable to those providers like Principal to serve the needs of small to medium-size employers. Amy?","Amy Friedrich","Yes. Thanks, Dan. Your comments are exactly right on. I think one of the things -- we talk a lot about being in the small market, but I think one of the things we don't talk about quite as much is how much that means -- our new business, our sales are driven by business owners who are making the decision to put a benefit or put some sort of a protection product in place for the first time. So a good portion of those benefits truly represent kind of new market for us, people who just haven't historically been purchasers becoming purchasers. So when you look at somewhere between 25%, 30% of our block being produced from that new market, that's exciting for us. ","And I always want to come back and make sure to give our life insurance business the credit that it's due. We do some amazing things for business owners and the business market for life insurance. And so I think one of the biggest compliments I can get when I leave Principal is for our intermediaries and other partners to tell us, when we see business, market business, we come to Principal. And so that's driving a lot of our volume. That's driving a lot of our recognition, and I want to give a lot of credit to the team for building out that business market so well.","Operator","The next question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","You've talked quite a bit about the investments being made in the business. I'm just wondering how are these tracking relative to your expectations and if you've identified any places where either you need to do more or you see more opportunity, particularly with the Wells block coming on board.","Daniel Houston","Yes, that's a really big question. In my prepared comments, you heard me talk about the Principal Real Start initiative, and that's having a profound impact on participants in terms of what they're setting aside for retirement. I mean it's really meaningful. The other one, in Amy's areas, that end-to-end digital life insurance solution. Again, good traction. For those people who may not have an advisor, it works very nicely. The Principal Benefit Design Tool, again, there's an absence of sort of understanding sometimes on sorting out and benchmarking against your peers by location and by industry. That's helpful. Luis, the comments down there around Mexico and the partnership with Club Premier and, again, that sense of partnering. And again, we've identified that before. And then lastly, it's Hong Kong and the digital on-boarding for the mandatory provident fund. So as we came to you a couple of years ago and talked about making investments in our digital platform, it does come with a price. We know that. We've realized that and see that in the higher expense structures. ","But I'd also mention that these five items I just mentioned are about half the portfolio. There's a lot of other really exciting things happening within PGI and PI and USIS and RIS. So we think very strongly, Erik, that these investments are starting to pay off, and I look forward to talking about each one of those in more detail as we come out and visit with you.","Erik Bass","And then for RIS-Spread, can you provide a bit more color on the adverse mortality experienced this quarter and put it into context with the historical results for the business? And I guess should we expect more seasonality in the business going forward as the PRT business continues to grow?","Daniel Houston","Well, yes, I would say that the standout here is the mortality in the third quarter, which is not uncommon. But I'll have Renee add some additional color.","Renee Schaaf","And that's exactly right. We did have an unusual level of mortality this quarter, and we would expect to see some variability from quarter to quarter. But when we step back and we look at what our expectations are for mortality versus how the block of business is performing, we feel very confident and very comfortable with what we're seeing. So we're not concerned with the underlying fundamentals of the business. This was an unusual quarter, perhaps, but perhaps within a normal range of variability as we look forward.","Erik Bass","Got it. And I would think third quarter would typically be a seasonally worse quarter and first quarter, better. Is that the right way to think about it?","Renee Schaaf","That is the right way to think about it.","Daniel Houston","That's exactly right. It was just that this third quarter was slightly out of the -- what we would have thought would be the normal range.","Operator","The next question is from Josh Shanker with Deutsche.","Joshua Shanker","I don't look at your businesses as affected by the type of derivatives that people are taking your assumption reviews for, but obviously, you have one. Can you talk in rank order about the various macro factors that affected the assumption review going forward? Obviously, interests probably are #1. But did you approach the assumption review any differently this time around than you had in past years?","Daniel Houston","I think every time we go through the actuarial assumption review, the chief actuary and the rest of the financial team, everything gets interrogated because things do change. They're not static. But frankly, we did not see anything relative to an outlier in the derivatives portfolio that would cause us to think about that any differently than we have in the past. We're certainly looking at the interest rates, and Deanna had framed that accordingly for you. We think it's prudent that it would go out over the next 10 years as opposed to 7 years, and we think that a 4% number versus a 4.5% is appropriate. So again, it gets a lot of scrutiny across each one of those. And Deanna, I'll throw it to you, see if you have any additional comments.","Deanna Strable","No. I think Dan is right on. Specifically to the economic assumptions, which I think is what you are referring to, we obviously look at all of those factors. Probably equity returns and interest rates are the most significant, and all the businesses have different sensitivity to each of those. In the absence of the interest rate change, all of the other economic assumptions that were embedded within all of our actuarial models were performing in line with what we had assumed in past assumption reviews. So the only one that was really impactful this quarter was the interest rates where, again, we lowered the underlying 10-year treasury assumption 50 basis points. The starting point declined over 100 basis points from where it was last year, and we extended the duration of when we would get to that long-term rate. It did have most significant impact within Individual Life. It had a slight impact in our other businesses, but that was the one that was the most meaningful.","Joshua Shanker","And sometimes, insurance companies say, certainly, in both silos, we're quick to acknowledge bad news but slow to acknowledge good news. If things rebound more quickly, do you think that your internal controls would be less likely to credit assumptions going forward with favorable terms than they would be to reduce assumptions when things go unfavorably your way?","Deanna Strable","Yes. My comment to that is if you look under the assumption reviews every single year, we have a number of positives and a number of negatives. Actually, interest rates, the last couple of years, had been positive to our annual assumption review as we updated the starting point and the path to get there. So no, I mean I think we are very prudent, both on the plus side and the minus side, to make sure we're determining the most appropriate assumption at that period of time. And ultimately, we'll reflect those, whether they be positive or negative.","Daniel Houston","Couldn't have said it better. That's exactly right.","Operator","The final question is from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.","Taylor Scott","First question I had was on RIS-Fee. And I guess I noticed the pressure was referenced in the release, and no secret that there's fee pressure in this business. But it was a little harder to sort of identify in the results because of the integration of Wells Fargo and so forth. So I'd just be interested to hear your commentary on how much fees are feeling that pressure, if there's any kind of change to how you're thinking about how that will progress over the next couple of years.","Daniel Houston","Yes, I'll take a shot at it and throw it over to Renee. But I would say absent -- if you just took out the Wells Fargo IRT acquisition and just said, was there anything substantively different in the most recent quarter than what we've experienced the last 3 or 4 years, I'd say no. I think it's very much the same drivers. And what we're committed to is ensuring that we're aligning our expenses with the revenues that we can derive. And remember, this is where you get into that lengthy conversation about the mix of business. You get into the various asset classes if someone chooses a more passive strategy, lower interest rate environment. So all of those variables come into it. But you have to look at those reoccurring deposits coming in at 10%. You look at the growth in the number of plans. All the sort of key drivers on the health of the business and our ability to get market share are intact. Now having said that, and you pointed out very well, Alex, we're still seeing pressure in that business. But I'll ask Renee to jump in here and clean that up as well.","Renee Schaaf","Yes, absolutely. So as Dan said, I think it's really important to remember and to recognize that the Principal block of business is performing very, very well. We do see strong sales. We're seeing strong recurring deposits. Our client retention is running very, very strong. All of that which, of course, leads to very strong and good fundamentals for the business, which results in a very strong net cash flow and a robust sales pipeline. But stepping back and thinking more at a more macro level, you've heard us talk about fee pressures in the fee line of business. And that fee pressure comes from several sources. ","First is just the intense competitive nature of record keeping and the downward pressure you would anticipate seeing these with fees there. And the other comes from a move towards open architecture and a move towards investment asset management strategies that are lower cost in nature. And that all puts pressure onto fees. That's been a long-term trend. If we were to quantify that, we would anticipate seeing a gap between fee growth and the average account value growth of about 6% to 8%. And then there is an additional 1% to 2% fee compression that we see that comes from moving from commission basis to pay financial advisors to fee-based. And so what we see in third quarter is very much in keeping with our expectations. We're very pleased with how that quarter performed. And again, it's very strong underlying growth in the business and strong sentimentals and capped with an integration that is absolutely on track for IRT.","Taylor Scott","Got it. May I ask one follow-up quickly on...","Daniel Houston","Wait. Yes, yes.","Taylor Scott","On your actuarial review, are there any ongoing impacts to earnings I should think about, whether it's the more modestly sized block of variable annuities or the life insurance or the Specialty Benefits and some of the DAC adjustments you made? Anything that we'll kind of notice on a go-forward basis?","Daniel Houston","Deanna?","Deanna Strable","Yes. I think in my prepared remarks, we said that the only -- and I wouldn't say it's material, but the only notable run rate impact would be that you'd see about a $2 million to $3 million pretax run rate decline in the Individual Life business. Most of that will run through the DAC line, and we're really expecting immaterial impacts in any of the other lines of business.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Houston, your closing comments, please.","Daniel Houston","Yes. Just a couple of very quick comments, the first of which is we recognize these emerging markets are volatile, but its high reward and margin growth, we think, over the long term still -- is very positive. The second is these acquisitions, we look at them through strategic lens. They're long-term in nature. And our view is that there is great scale and capabilities that is derived from acquisitions like the IRT business. Organic growth, as I pointed out, is important to us. It's fundamental to a long-term successful franchise. We'll continue to be disciplined around pricing and making sure our differentiators are known. Capital deployment, very balanced. And as Deanna had commented in her prepared comments, we feel very good about the capital deployment this year. For those of you wondering, at the end of 9\/30, there was $250 million of Board authorization for share buyback. It still remains in place. And then lastly, I would say that we very much have a process improvement initiative going on to help drive revenue and take out expense, make sure that we continue to operate in the most effective and efficient manner for our shareholders. ","So we look forward to December 11, when we can provide you with more outlook for 2020 and tell you where the businesses are at. But we certainly appreciate your time today.

There will be a question-and-answer period after the speakers have completed their prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference call over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Principal Financial Group's fourth quarter and full year 2019 conference call. As always, materials related to today's call are available on our website at principal.com\/investor. Following a reading of the safe harbor provision, CEO, Dan Houston; and CFO, Deanna Strable will deliver some prepared remarks. Then, we will open-up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A session include, Renee Schaaf, Retirement and Income Solutions; Tim Dunbar, Global Asset Management; Luis Vald\u00e9s, Principal International; and Amy Friedrich, U.S. Insurance Solutions.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The company does not revise or update them to reflect new information, subsequent events or changes in strategy. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","Additionally, some of the comments made during this conference call may refer to non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures may be found in our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation. Dan?","Dan Houston","Thanks, John, and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning, I'll share performance highlights for the fourth quarter and full year and accomplishments that position us for continued growth. Deanna will follow with details on our financial results and capital deployment.","2019 marked Principal's 140th anniversary and a year in which we closed one of the largest acquisitions in our company's history. We are proud to serve more than 33 million individuals, including China and nearly 200,000 businesses in more than 80 markets around the world, and I'd like to thank both our customers and our employees for being a part of Principal's journey.","2019 was another good year for Principal. We delivered non-GAAP operating earnings of $1.6 billion, a 2% decrease compared to a strong 2018 that benefited from a large PGI performance fee. This result reflects ongoing fee pressure, continued investments in the business and the impact from the Institutional Retirement and Trust or IRT acquisition.","Throughout 2019, we continued to demonstrate strong business fundamentals, balanced investments in our businesses with expense discipline and be good stewards of shareholder capital deploying nearly $2.1 billion, including $1.2 billion for the IRT acquisition. This acquisition doubled the size of our U.S. retirement business and positions us as a top three retirement player. The integration remains on track and we'll be hard at work throughout 2020 to make sure the transition is as seamless as possible.","While working to integrate the acquisition, we continued to grow our existing U.S. retirement business in 2019. Compared to 2018 RIS-Fee sales increased 30%, reoccurring deposits grew 10% and we saw a double-digit growth in employer matches.","I also want to highlight, strong results in U.S. Insurance Solutions, including record pre-tax operating earnings for the segment in 2019. Both Specialty Benefits and Individual Life had record sales in 2019. In particular, Individual Life increased sales by 17% compared to 2018. Additionally, group benefits had very strong in-group growth as our customers expanded their businesses and hired more employees.","Our 2019 Principal Financial Well being Index our proprietary survey of small to medium-sized business owners and leaders shows that business owners are expecting continued growth in 2020, while investing in their own employees. We are well positioned to help these business owners grow with our retirement and protection offerings.","Over the course of 2019, AUM increased $109 billion to a record $735 billion. This was a 17% increase over 2018 and provides a strong foundation for 2020. Additionally, we ended 2019 with $146 billion of AUM in our China joint venture and $898 billion of assets under administration in the IRT business. After going negative in 2018, total company net cash flow returned to positive for the full year at $17 billion. This included positive net cash flow from every business unit.","2019 capped a strong decade. Principal delivered positive total company net cash flow in nine of the last 10 years, despite a very competitive environment. RIS-Fee had its strongest year for net cash flow since 2012, with $7 billion in 2019. This was higher than our target range of 1% to 3% of beginning of year account value. When the IRT retirement plans migrate to the Principal platform in 2020 and 2021, the assets will be reported in operations acquired.","RIS-Spread had $4 billion of net cash flow in 2019, driven by strong sales in pension risk transfer, income annuities and investment only. Principal International also generated $4 billion of net cash flow in 2019 and marked its 45th consecutive positive quarter. This result primarily reflects a rebound in Brazil throughout the year, as well as the strong flows in Hong Kong.","Principal Global Investor's net cash flow improved in 2019 to a positive $1.1 billion, including $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter. The New Mexico Scholar's Edge 529 plan funded during the quarter with $1.4 billion now managed by PGI with the majority of these assets invested in our retail mutual funds.","This contributed to the best quarter for net cash flow in our retail mutual fund platform since the first quarter of 2015. Clearly, 2019 benefited from the management and distribution changes we've put in place in PGI and we're confident in the opportunities that lie ahead.","The synergies between PGI and Principal International continued to evolve and drove a large platform win in Hong Kong during 2019. The team continues to look for opportunities to leverage both our global asset management expertise and the distribution force we have in local markets.","The importance of saving for retirement continues to gain traction, as private pension reform discussions advanced around the world in 2019. As a leading retirement provider, we're excited about the approval of the Secure Act in the U.S. We work closely with policymakers and regulators to expand access to retirement saving plans and deliver guaranteed income and retirement through the workplace.","Today 30% of the retirement plans we onboard annually in the U.S. are with companies that have never offered a plan. The Secure Act seeks to improve access to workplace retirement plans by allowing small employers to join multiple employer plans and increase tax credits for start-up 401(k) plans. While the Secure Act is an important step to expand workplace retirement plan accessing guaranteed income options, we expect market growth will take time to materialize.","Outside the U.S., we continue to use our knowledge and expertise to advocate for plan designs that enable workers to fund retirements that may last 40 years. Throughout 2019, several governments have made pension reform a priority, including Brazil and Chile. With our expertise and global footprint, we'll continue to partner with governments around the world to promote sustainable policies and desired outcomes for its citizens.","Turning to slide 5. Our investment performance remained very strong. At year-end, 79% of the Principal's mutual funds, ETFs, separate accounts and collective investment trust were above median for the five-year and 71% were above median for the three-year. Our one-year performance rebounded to 84% above median compared to 41% at the end of 2018.","Additionally, for our Morningstar-rated funds, 87% of the fund level AUM had a four-star or five-star rating at year-end. This strong performance positions us well to attract retain assets going forward. Throughout 2019, we continued to execute on our customer-focused solutions-oriented strategy, as we expanded our global distribution network and array of retirement, investment and protection solutions.","We are in more than 120 total placements, with more than 70 different offerings on more than 50 different platforms. This reflects continued strong interest in our specialty solutions-oriented and alternative capabilities as well as our success in getting these investment options added to third-party distribution platforms' recommended list and model portfolios.","Additionally, the IRT acquisition enhances our ability to distribute through the consultant channel. Our increased capabilities and depth of relationships with the consultants, RIAs and specialist firms will accelerate our ability to achieve new sales. We also advanced our accelerated digital investments throughout 2019 to create better customer experiences and drive revenue growth while gaining efficiencies. We're now two years in and our investments are on track.","We saw incremental benefits to both revenue and expenses in 2019 from these capabilities. For example, Principal Real Start, our new digital and mobile platform to enroll retirement plan participants has shown tremendous potential to get participants on track to save enough for retirement. Since its launch in the fourth quarter of 2018, more than 0.25 million participants completed the experience and shows deferral rates that are 60% higher than other enrollment methods, and one of four participants have elected to auto escalate their deferral rate up to 10%.","Additionally, our fully digital experience for purchasing term life insurance launched in the third quarter of 2019 and is one of the first of its kind in the industry. On average, it delivers policies to customers two-thirds faster than traditional methods. While Deanna will cover this in more detail, I want to emphasize our balanced approach to capital deployment.","In addition to strategic acquisitions and investments in our business, in 2019, we returned more than $860 million to shareholders through common stock dividends and share buybacks. We enjoyed noteworthy third-party recognition throughout 2019, reflecting our company's dedication to its core values.","Pension & Investments named Principal one of the Best Places to Work in money management. And we're one of only five companies to have made that list every year since the program was launched in 2012.","We received multiple awards from Forbes, including being named one of America's Best Large Employers; one of America's Best Employers for Diversity and number five on their list of Best Employers for Women; and Cogent Syndicated recognized Principal as a Defined Contribution Service winner with the highest satisfaction score in Plan Advisor Service and Support, as well as Participant Service and Support, the two most critical categories for continued recommendation among defined contribution advisors.","While we're incredibly proud of the external recognition, Principal's record level of giving back in 2019 also speaks volumes about our company culture. Our employees donated more than $6 million and volunteered 55,000 hours of their time in 2019 to help people around the world learn, earn and save. This team effort shows how Principal strives not only to do business, but to do good in the communities where we live and work.","In closing, I'm very proud of our accomplishments in 2019 and I'm confident in our ability to execute on our strategy in 2020. We'll continue to balance investing in our business, while managing expenses in line with revenues to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Deanna?","Deanna Strable","Thanks Dan. Good morning to everyone on the call. This morning I'll discuss the key contributors to our financial performance for the quarter and full year, as well as capital deployments and our capital position at year-end.","Net income attributable to Principal was $301 million for the fourth quarter and $1.4 billion for the full year. Quarterly net realized capital losses of $96 million were primarily driven by derivative losses associated with hedging activities with minimal credit losses.","Reported non-GAAP operating earnings were $396 million for the fourth quarter or $1.41 per diluted share. Excluding significant variances, fourth quarter non-GAAP operating earnings increased 13% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share increased 14%, compared to fourth quarter 2018. The year ago quarter was negatively impacted by a 14% decline in the S&P 500 and unfavorable macroeconomics in Latin America.","Reported full year 2019 non-GAAP operating earnings were nearly $1.6 billion or $5.58 per diluted share. Non-GAAP operating ROE excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation was 13.1% at year-end.","The full year non-GAAP operating earnings effective tax rate was 16.9% within our 2019 guided range. As communicated on our 2020 outlook call, we expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be between 16% to 19%.","As shown on slide 4 we had three significant variances during the fourth quarter including negative $14 million in RIS-Fee, primarily integration costs from the IRT acquisition and a negative $3 million impact in Principal International due to lower than expected encaje performance in Latin America.","These were mostly offset by a $12 million benefit in PGI from a reduction in an earn-out liability for Principal Real Estate Europe formerly known as Internos. This reduction was due to a change in the timing and pattern of revenues during the earn-out measurement period stemming from two factors; market dynamics allowed the team to sell several properties and liquidate assets in a fund, maximizing returns for our clients, which is always our priority; and we had a delay in receiving regulatory approval to launch a key fund during the measurement period.","Principal Real Estate Europe continues to perform well in their strong interest in their investment strategies. As a reminder in the prior year quarter, we had significant variances primarily due to unfavorable macroeconomic factor that had a net negative $54 million impact to reported non-GAAP pre-tax operating earnings.","Looking at macroeconomic factors in the fourth quarter, the S&P 500 Index increased over 8% and the daily average increased more than 4% compared to the third quarter of 2019. On a trailing 12-month basis the daily average increased 6% in line with our full year price appreciation assumption.","Moving to foreign exchange rates. I'd like to remind you that revenue expenses and pre-tax operating earnings are translated using average foreign exchange rates while AUM is translated using the spot rate.","Fourth quarter AUM benefited slightly from favorable movements in spot rates relative to the third quarter, but the average rates remained a headwind. Impacts to pre-tax operating earnings included a negative $4 million compared to fourth quarter 2018 as well as third quarter 2019 and a negative $24 million on a trailing 12-month basis.","Mortality and morbidity were in line with or better than our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year in Specialty Benefits and Individual Life. Very favorable claims benefited Specialty Benefits' full year pre-tax operating earnings by approximately $19 million, driven by $10 million of favorable group life and disability claims in the fourth quarter and $9 million of favorable group life claims in the second quarter. Over a longer period of time loss ratios remain within our guided range.","RIS-Spread had an experience loss in the fourth quarter that was slightly worse than our expectations in the prior year quarter negatively impacting pre-tax operating earnings.","For the full year experience was below our expectations with a net negative $20 million change from 2018. Over a longer period of time experience is in line with our expectations.","Both long-term and short-term interest rates declined throughout 2019. Our near-term earnings are most sensitive to changes in the interest on excess reserves or IOER rate. The IOER rate was lowered 85 basis points in 2019 including a 25 basis point drop in the fourth quarter. This negatively impacted revenue primarily in the IRT trust and custody business and was reflected in our 2020 guidance for RIS-Fee.","Turning to expenses. As we've experienced in prior years, we expected total company operating expenses to be higher in the fourth quarter than the average of the first three quarters due to seasonality of certain expenses.","Excluding IRT and higher variable expenses, fourth quarter operating expenses and compensation and other expenses were in line to slightly lower than expected levels.","It's critical that we continue to execute on our investments to position us for long-term growth. Our digital investments continue in 2020. We expect the net pre-tax impact to be slightly less than the $50 million to $60 million net impact in 2019 as more benefits are expected to emerge in 2020.","The following comments on business unit results exclude significant variances from both periods. Starting with RIS-Fee on slide 6, pre-tax operating earnings of $129 million were in line with expectations. Lower DAC amortization expense was offset by a true-up of costs associated with the IRT business.","Full year 2019 net revenue growth of 11% is above our guided range as the acquisition brought on additional net revenue in the second half of the year. The quarterly margin was maintained at 25% in the fourth quarter. Longer term we expect margins to expand once the acquisition is fully integrated and the expense synergies are realized.","Importantly, the legacy RIS-Fee business continues to perform well. The fourth quarter margin was 33% for the legacy business above the guided range. As the acquired business begins to transition to our combined platform in 2020, it will become increasingly difficult to provide stand-alone details on the legacy business. The fundamentals of our legacy business remains strong.","Compared to full year 2018 sales of $18 billion increased 30%. Defined contribution participant count increased nearly 300,000 participants or 8%. And net cash flow of $7 billion increased 140% and was more than 3% of beginning-of-year account values above the 1% to 3% targeted range. This was driven by strong sales, 10% growth in recurring deposits and low contract lapses.","Turning to slide 8. RIS-Spread's pre-tax operating earnings of $92 million were lower than expected primarily due to unfavorable experience losses, lower-than-expected net investment income and the impact of lower annuity sales. RIS-Spread's full year net revenue growth and margin were within our guided ranges.","In 2019 account values grew nearly 13% on strong sales of $10.3 billion. This includes a record $3.9 billion of pension risk transfer sales nearly 50% higher than 2018. Looking ahead the pipeline for pension risk transfer sales remain strong despite the low interest rate environment.","As shown on slide 9 PGI's pre-tax operating earnings of $132 million were above our expectations. This was primarily due to growth in management fees and performance fees partially offset by higher variable expenses. PGI generated $51 million of performance fees in the fourth quarter.","Of this, $32 million was related to a Principal Real Estate Europe fund. Per the acquisition agreement these were distributed to the investment team and the previous owners resulting in an immaterial impact to pre-tax operating earnings. A portion of the other performance fees earned during the quarter were also passed through as compensation. As a reminder performance fees are volatile quarter-to-quarter.","Full year 2019 operating revenues less pass-through expenses increased 2%. This was within our guided range and exclude the impact of the accelerated performance fee in 2018. PGI's margin ended the year at 36% within our guided range.","Moving to slide 10. Principal International's pre-tax operating earnings of $80 million were in line with our expectations and negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. A benefit from higher-than-expected inflation in Brazil was more than offset by elevated expenses isolated to the quarter.","We believe that fourth quarter's pre-tax operating earnings, excluding significant variances is a good starting point to use to estimate PI's earnings in 2020. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, PI's full year margin of 39% was at the high end of our guided range, while net revenue growth of 5% was at the low end of our guided range primarily due to foreign currency headwinds.","Turning to slide 11. Specialty Benefits' pre-tax operating earnings of $98 million were strong due to favorable claims and growth in the business. Specialty Benefits had a very strong year and continues to perform well. On a full year basis, Specialty Benefits' premium and fees increased a strong 7% over 2018 and were within our guided range. This was driven by record sales of nearly $400 million, strong retention and in-group growth. The full year margin was over 14%, 130 basis points higher than last year and was at the high end of our guided range.","As shown on slide 12, Individual Life's pre-tax operating earnings of $46 million were in line with our expectations. As part of our third quarter assumption review, we lowered our long-term interest rate assumptions. This decreased Individual Life's earnings run rate by about $2 million to $3 million per quarter with the impact beginning in the fourth quarter.","On a trailing 12-month basis Individual Life's premium and fee growth of 5% and margin of 18% were within our guided ranges. Individual Life had record full year sales of $270 million, an increase of 17% over 2018 with over 60% coming from the business market as we continue to focus on solutions for business owners.","At $96 million for fourth quarter corporate's pretax operating losses were in line with our expectations. For the full year losses of $380 million were higher than our guided range. As discussed on previous calls, higher security benefit expenses as well as increased debt expense and lower net investment income related to the IRT acquisition impacted corporate losses relative to our 2019 guided range.","Looking ahead to 2020, I want to remind you that we typically have elevated payroll taxes in PGI and higher claims in Specialty Benefits in the first quarter. Capitalizing acquisition costs in our group benefits business will improve first quarter earnings for Specialty Benefits, but we continue to expect earnings in the first half of the year to be slightly less than the second half.","With lower interest rates throughout 2019, I want to provide details on some of the impacts on our general account businesses. During the fourth quarter our new money yield of 3.2% was about 50 basis points lower than the overall portfolio yield excluding variable investment income.","This will provide some headwinds to earnings, but it will take time for the new money yield to have a meaningful impact on the overall portfolio yield and our operating earnings.","We remain disciplined in updating our pricing for interest rate movements. We're conservative in the products and liabilities we have exposure to and we remain diligent around asset liability management. While higher rates are incrementally positive our diverse business mix positions, us well in this low interest rate environment.","As shown on slide 13, we committed and deployed $240 million of capital in the fourth quarter including $152 million for common stock dividends, $84 million in share repurchases and $4 million to increase ownership in one of our focused investment teams.","This brings full year capital deployments to nearly $2.1 billion or 150% of net income, well above our $1 billion to $1.4 billion guidance. 2019 deployments included $1.2 billion for the IRT acquisition and more than $860 million was returned to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases.","At the end of 2019, we had $168 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. As always, we will continue to take a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment.","As a reminder on our 2020 outlook call, we increased our free cash flow target to 70% to 80% of net income in excess of capital used to fund organic growth. We are targeting $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion of external capital deployment in 2020.","The full year common stock dividend was $2.18 per share, a 4% increase over 2018. Last night we announced a $0.56 common stock dividend payable in the first quarter a 4% increase from a year ago. Our dividend yield is approximately 4% and on a trailing 12-month basis we're slightly above our targeted 40% net income payout ratio.","Our capital and liquidity position remain very strong including an estimated risk-based capital ratio of 410% at year-end. We ended 2019 with nearly $1.2 billion at the holding company nearly $150 million in excess of our targeted 400% risk based capital ratio and over $400 million of available cash in our subsidiaries.","In addition a low leverage ratio and no debt maturities until 2022 provides us significant financial flexibility. As part of our 2020 outlook, we provided estimated revenue for full year 2019 by business unit to use as a starting point for 2020. Actual results excluding significant variances were within these ranges.","I want to remind you that our 2020 margin guidance for RIS-Fee excludes the IRT integration costs. We continue to expect approximately $55 million to $65 million of integration costs in our reported pretax operating earnings in RIS-Fee. We will continue to identify these integration costs as significant variances throughout the year.","Looking ahead to 2020, we continue to expect an annual growth rate in non-GAAP operating earnings per share in the high single digits over 2019 excluding the impact of the 2019 significant variances and integration costs in 2020. 2019 was a good year and we remain confident in our diversified business model, as well as our ability to execute on our strategy and consistently deliver above market growth.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott","Hi, good morning. First question I had was on RIS-Fee. Just wanted to see if you could provide some comments on the way the end of year has gone in terms of any changes to the plans, I know there's been some moving pieces around, the way commissions are paid in the past.","Also just thinking about the proprietary versus non-proprietary mix of assets, would you anticipate that as a percentage of AUM would sort of begin to flat line? Or would that continue to move down at the pace that it's been moving down?","Dan Houston","Yeah. Thanks Alex. This is Dan. Thanks for the question. A couple of notes before I throw it over to Renee, I don't -- when I reflect on the results for 2019, they were really positive.","If you look at that planned growth on a full year basis, over 250,000 new participants being added over that period of time, and frankly the sales number is really, really strong. So the fundamentals of the business remain very much intact.","As you know, we've had historically very strong proprietary asset management sales in large part, because performance has been good. And again, it differs on size, whether it's small, medium or large.","But we feel very good about our ability to continue to provide a comprehensive bundled solution, including administration, record-keeping and asset management. And there's a lot of collaboration that occurs between PGI and RIS to make that happen.","But, I'll throw it to Renee. I know you're excited about what you've got going on, not only 2019 Renee, but 2020.","Renee Schaaf","Yeah. Absolutely, so Alex, thank you for your question. And the first question that you had was around the movement that we're seeing from commission-based compensation agreements to fee-based.","And the guidance that we provided last year on this was we would typically see about revenue pressures of about 1% to 2% due to this, which of course doesn't impact pretax operating earnings because it's netted out in the expense line.","But we -- what we are seeing is exactly in line with that. And so when we look at fourth quarter results we see about a 1% to 1.5% movement from commission to fee-based. And that's exactly what we would anticipate.","Your other question dealt with the percent of proprietary assets? And what we might anticipate seeing there. First off, we're really proud of the results, our sales results in 2019.","And we introduced pricing and the way that it's packaged to encourage and to incent proprietary -- sales of proprietary assets. And so if you were to look at, the percent of proprietary assets for our small-and medium-sized plans, you would see that they run above market, above the industry. And institutional was pretty much in line with what we see in industry.","Despite that, we do see downward pressure on this, as a -- as kind of a normal -- something we've been talking about now for several quarters, it's the result of more propensity for employers, particularly large employers to move towards passes and also the bifurcation of the record-keeping decision from the asset management and the investment management decision.","If you look at net cash flows overall for target date funds, they've been fairly flat. But we're pleased with what we see in terms of how we perform to market. But we do anticipate that we'll continue to see pressure here, ongoing simply because of the bifurcation between, record-keeping and investment management decision.","Dan Houston","Does that help Alex?","Alex Scott","Yeah. That is very helpful. And look, I appreciate that the flows and the sales have been quite strong there. So I don't mean to take away from that. Second question I had was just on Secure Act. If you could provide any more details on sort of the action plan, are you going after multi-employer pooling? And is there anything in the works there?","Dan Houston","Yeah. Certainly and as you know we advocated for the passage of the Secure Act. We feel good about it. Really sort of three key pieces. The first of which is the formation as you know the -- of the MEPs multiple employer plans.","We've been in that business for a very long time. So we understand how to work with contracts that have adopting employers. So the fundamentals are very much in place. There will be a change.","We'll end up partnering with a third party, to help us facilitate that. But there's very much a battle plan in place to help, provide small- to medium-sized employers, gain coverage and improve adequacy.","The other was the in-plan income solution, which again, we've been in the annuity business for 75 years. We know how to do that. The safe harbor is going to give customers more confidence about adding that provision. And then there's a small incentive for small plan formation in the way of a tax credit.","So I'd say, all in all, we look at that as being a positive. And as I said in my prepared comments, this will take time to emerge. This won't happen overnight. But just like the last major piece of pension legislation which for me was auto enrolling and auto escalate these things collectively put us in a better position to cover more American workers, so, that positive for the Secure Act.","Alex Scott","Thanks very much.","Dan Houston","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. First just one follow-up on the Secure Act and it's specifically the open MEPs. Do you see that, as all kind of new opportunity? Or do you get a sense many of your existing small plans that they may be looking to move into kind of an open MEP structure to try to lower their costs?","Dan Houston","Yes. I actually think it's going to be for more new than existing. And again you have to recognize -- and we again as I mentioned earlier Erik have some experience in this space because there are limitations. There will be a limited number of planned choices. There are other constituents involved in the decision-making.","So, not only will we see emerge multiple employer plans with both multiple record keepers out there providing those services, but I got to believe every single organization like Principal will participate there and as we continue with this digital transformation have our own small employer plans that are very cost-effective very convenient and would effectively allow them to have perhaps a little bit more flexibility. But Renee you want to add some additional comments there?","Renee Schaaf","Yes. I agree that I think we'll see most of the planned take-up be with new plans and start-up plans. Perhaps the one reason why existing plan sponsors might be interested in an open MEP is if they can curtail their fiduciary liability.","And we're still waiting on final regs to see exactly how that may play out but that could be a driver for -- to incent existing plans to adopt the open MEP structure. But I agree it's going to be predominantly driven by new plans and start-up plans.","Dan Houston","But the regs for what I'd describe in three buckets is over 800 pages long and it's still going to require the industry to digest that.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you. Appreciate the color there. And then just secondly I was hoping you could talk about the impact of the macro and political disruption in Hong Kong and Chile. And just provide an update on what impact do you see that having potentially on near-term results in these markets and for Principal international overall.","Dan Houston","It's a good question. I'll make a few comments before throwing it to Luis. And again I think as a reminder to all of us as you think about what is appropriate pension policy by country you also have -- and although we don't aren't in the record-keeping business in France, you also have people on the streets demonstrating against the changes to their pension policies.","And we've been saying for years that the era of personal responsibility and accountability is here. Governments aren't in a position to fund it. And sure enough as you look at Chile and Hong Kong and France and other areas around the world including Brazil, you're seeing more pressure being placed on elected officials to come up with a reasonable retirement policy for people aging.","And so on one hand, it's a huge opportunity for Principal at the same time we've got to make sure that we're advocating and we're helping steer and drive pension policy. And I can't think of a better person to talk about that on the international front than Luis Vald\u00e9s. Luis?","Luis Vald\u00e9s","Okay. Thank you very much. Hi Erik. A couple of things first to start with. The root cause of these social unrest in Hong Kong and Chile are first of all completely different. Also the other thing that we have to keep in mind that in both places they do have different political systems in nature, so hence the evolution pace path of the negotiations and solutions are going to be different are going to take quite amount of time and at this moment are kind of unknown.","What do we have in common in these two places? First, we have had no major disruptions in our operations in both places and we have had second a minor short-term financial impact in both locations.","I wanted to say something. We're reporting record AUMs for Hong Kong for 2019 and we're reporting on a trailing 12-month basis record operating earnings for Hong Kong as well. So, this is a micro scenario in the short-term going into macro perspective.","And having said that and because the severity and the duration of this social unrest both markets are going into a no growth if not in a recession for the next couple of years.","So, what we're doing in light of this new reality we are recalibrating our operations in Chile and in Hong Kong with two main objectives; first of all to continue servicing our clients and to protect their interest and to continue improving their customer experience and second, to keep our expenses in line with our revenues going forward.","We're well prepared and we continue monitoring how the macroeconomics are going to evolve in those markets, but we're taking actions and -- actions in order to be pretty much more in line about is -- might happen in those markets.","Dan Houston","Hopefully that helped Erik.","Erik Bass","Yes. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. First on the -- overall, your results are obviously pretty strong, but it seems like retirement earnings for each of the past -- the fee side each of the past couple of quarters have been a little light. And I'm not sure how the wealth block is performing versus your initial expectation and specifically on how much of a headwind the low fed funds rate is for income on trust accounts for the acquired block.","Dan Houston","Okay. Good questions. And make no mistake there is a headwind with interest rates continuing to fall and it is having a negative impact on that trust and custody business. But again I get back to the fact we're in this for the long haul and feel very good about the fundamentals. Renee you want to talk a little bit further about the integration and where we stand?","Renee Schaaf","Absolutely. Thank you for the question Jimmy. And I think first-off to just speak a moment about the fourth quarter results for fee. We're very pleased with the results, particularly when you look at the legacy business, the growth that we're seeing there, the profitability that we're seeing there, really very good and very strong.","Our sales results I think and our net cash flow results are particularly pleasing and we're excited about the impact that we see on TRS. Our new sales are really being fueled by TRS. And that goes all across the board in terms of defined benefit sales being up 33%, ESOP beat sales being up 70%, a record year for sales for nonqualified. So, a lot of strength in the organic growth machine of that legacy business.","As you pointed out when we look at the IRT business, the area of pressure that we have seen is in the interest on excess reserves. And we saw an 85% decline in the basis points that would reflect for that business. And so, we are seeing pressures there. That's been accounted for in terms of our guidance for 2020, but it does pressure results for the fourth quarter.","Jimmy Bhullar","And how much of a -- are you going to quantify how much of a headwind that is on an annual basis, if you're assuming a stable fed fund rate this year versus where it would have been when you announced the deal?","Renee Schaaf","Yeah. So, if you were to take the 85 basis points and annualize that the impact on revenue is about a $25 million to $30 million impact annualized. But to state it differently, so we have that of course baked into our 2020 outlook.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And if I could ask one more. You've been fairly active with deals, but most of them have been small sort of tuck-in type transactions international markets and asset management. So, if you would just comment on your interest in deals, and specifically if you would be open to a large transaction. You've been mentioned as an acquirer of some of like large public companies in the press recently, but just wanted to see if that's something that you would be open to as well.","Daniel Houston","Well, right now what I would say is we are going through the digestion process of the Wells Fargo IRT business. Our highest priority is successfully migrating those customers, the employees, the participants and reassuring the advisors and the distribution community that we are and they're with safe hands.","And so, job one, successfully migrate those customers. And so, we've got our hands full for another five quarters, say, as we transition through that limited resources to execute and bring those clients on board. But again, as Renee was saying, we're very happy about the progress.","In other parts of our business, asset management is not as connected in terms of the resources. And if there is the right opportunity that presents itself to Tim Dunbar and his team around asset management that allows us to add capabilities and scale, we would want to do that.","Outside the country, in terms of replicating more of what we do for PI, we've been on record before. We like the countries that we're in. From time-to-time we do get presented with the opportunity to again add capabilities and scale, and we would -- we'd look at each one of those on a one-off. But bottom line is right now we've got our hands very full with digesting what we have on the full-service side. Does that help Jimmy?","Jimmy Bhullar","Yes. Thank you.","Daniel Houston","Thanks for the questions.","Operator","The next question is from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for thank you for taking my questions. I have a follow-up question to Erik's question earlier for Principal International. So -- but looking at the kind of expenses for this quarter, they looked a little bit elevated. And then specifically looking at earnings contribution by country on a local currency basis and adjusted for encaje, Chile was lower than what it had been running for the past few quarters, and then also China looked a little weaker.","Like I was just wondering can you talk about what's going on there? Like from Luis' comments earlier, it didn't sound like there's any. Any structural changes or any systemic things going on in there? But I was just wondering is there any kind of some one-off expenses or anything that you can provide some color on?","Daniel Houston","I'll make two broad statements before asking Luis to add to it. And the first thing I would say is, when you're dealing with emerging markets there's always a lot of volatility. There's political volatility, currency, FX, inflation. Certainly encaje introduces its own set of complexity. So we're quite accustomed to the fact that if you're going to do business in emerging market, it comes with a lot of volatility.","The second thing I would point out and I still remember the 10 years of which PI was such a big tailwind every single quarter, PI represents about 19% of our earnings. And if I add Chile and Hong Kong together it's about 10% of the total earnings.","So, the bottom line is we are at any given time going to have disruption and volatility in these various markets in which we do business. And I wouldn't look at any one quarter and any one year around expenses, and somehow think that that was not something that we wouldn't manage effectively. So, Luis you want to take it from there?","Luis Vald\u00e9s","Yes. Humphrey, let me start with China first in order to try to explain what you were asking. We have \u2013 certainly, it looks like the fourth quarter for China is kind of a low quarter. We have a delta between third quarter and fourth quarter of $2.9 million in OE pre-tax and we have a delta of $3.5 million in revenues. So let me try to explain this very, very quickly.","The whole difference is about the average AUMs for the fourth quarter. When you look in the fourth quarter end-to-end comparison with three quarter it looks flat. But we have a lot of volatility. The intra-quarter, particularly we have $7 billion of negative net customer cash flows in October than we had positive net customer cash flows considering November and December. So the whole quarter we have a $3.3 billion negative net customer cash flows but the path was completely different.","So the average was pretty much more lower than the \u2013 you can expect. So with that, the impact in our revenues just because of the lower average AUM it was at $2.2 million to start with then you have another small impact in terms of $0.5 million in FX.","Having said that, this was totally expected for the year, the $5.5 billion negative net customer cash flows in 2019 after having $33 billion, positive billion dollars in net customer cash flows in 2018. The reason for is that there is a profound movement from money market funds in which we're heavily weighted in the Chinese market into equity markets during 2019.","We were pretty flat when the average industry had a negative 6% down from money market funds. So we are doing I would say well end-to-end. But the explanation for China is average AUM for the fourth quarter.","Going into Chile, certainly we should have a $26.1 million to explain in OE. Let me go very quickly with that. Easier to explain the delta is at $15 million in cash here, $13 million positive in third quarter, minus $3 million negative in the fourth quarter. So you have a net of $15 million there.","Elevated prepayment fees in the third quarter by $4 million. And then the FX impact in term of revenues was another $6 million just within the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So with those numbers you can make the math for Chile.","So in a constant basis and adjusted basis, Chile, third quarter and fourth quarter was a flat, I would say a flat growth for Chile. That is essentially the explanation for both countries.","Humphrey Lee","I appreciate the color. Thank you for that. Shifting gear to PGI. Net flows were positive for the full year. And as you look into the pipeline for 2020, do you expect the positive flows to continue? And then I have another question on the performance fees there.","Dan Houston","I know. I do. I'll ask Tim to answer for himself. Tim?","Tim Dunbar","Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. We did see a lot of momentum building in 2019 for our net cash flows. I think we talked a little bit about some of the changes that we've made to management and to the distribution team and really to the infrastructure and the ecosystem of our \u2013 of distributing our products and that bodes really well.","I think the other thing I'd mention is just the strong investment performance. And while it's nice to see a pop in the short-term investment performance, what I think I'm most proud of and what we really focus a lot of our efforts on is really the consistency of the long-term investment performance.","And if you look at that three-year 71%; five-year 79%; 10-year 91% that really bodes well for the types of solutions we're trying to create for our clients and our strategy of building retirement investments for all of our clients. ","So I think that's the backdrop of how we feel about moving into 2020, which is we have some momentum gaining. Obviously, each quarter we'll have dynamics that will be a little volatile or a little different from quarter-to-quarter. But as we look at the backdrop, we have a strong pipeline, we have strong interest in a wide array of our diverse capabilities. So we look pretty positively at 2020.","Humphrey Lee","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman","Great. Good morning.","Dan Houston","Good morning.","Andrew Kligerman","One follow-up on the Secure Act. A few years back you used to provide some stats on what were your small accounts and I think maybe we could get a sense of what the fees on those accounts were. Could you give us a rough idea of what percent of your RIS deposits relate to small accounts and what the fee range is there? And with that answer, as we move to MEP, what would be the differential in fees, if those accounts were to move into a MEP?","Dan Houston","Yes. So I want to make sure you get a good answer here, but I certainly don't remember providing historical pricing, because the reality is that we custom price nearly all of these plans and are they TRS are they not, what percentage of proprietary product? And there is such a wide range there. What you can sort of expect as I sort of -- even the definition of what is small, what is medium and what is large. And the reality is it kind of in our mind we break it into one-third, one-third, one-third.","About one-third of that total account values are in the small, about one-third in what we describe as a medium. And then one-third which is large. And proportionally the basis points that you get on a smaller plan is going to be larger than the very largest plans that we have. But on average, the margins are very comparable in the end. So getting back to the full question around MEPs, that is a question I think that is still yet to be answered. Make no mistake there will be a lot of costs associated with the establishment and the oversight of these MEPs.","I don't want anybody to get off this call thinking that it's a panacea that with the passage of a MEP there's all of a sudden going to be an incredibly low-cost option out there because it -- I just don't think that that's going to materialize. It will over time provide choice to small employers as Renee described earlier who may not or may feel that there's a different fiduciary role that's being completed or different investment options. But I suspect, we're a year away from being able to answer your question Andrew on the specificity around the competitive nature of -- in a MEP or a small plan.","Andrew Kligerman","Got you. Okay. And then maybe shifting over to Specialty Benefits. And you had a really nice change in premium over the last 12 months of fee premium and fees of about 7%. As you look forward, where do you see most of the growth coming? Would you expect it in voluntary? And with that, are you seeing any signs of heavy competition and pricing pressure?","Dan Houston","I can never remember a time where we didn't have heavy competition and pricing pressure in any of these businesses. But again, a lot of credit to Amy and her team for what they're putting in place their focus, their retention. But I'll let her specifically answer your question.","Amy Friedrich","Yes. With regards to -- kind of starting with the pricing pressure, I think we do always see that pricing pressure. I think what -- and I feel like a bit of a broken record here talking about the small case market. But when you look at the small case market, there are just some dynamics there that sort of serve as natural gates that keep some of our other competitors out of there. You got to do things in the scale to -- you have to process 10,000 cases a year as opposed to 1,000 cases a year. You have to do some things with your in-force pricing. You have to be willing to look at it as an advantage that you can have make a pricing decision because you're -- most of your block is only in a one-year rate guarantee.","So what I can guarantee for us is we will continue to grow in that small case market. We've built a system that works for that footprint. We have the underlying technology and we have an awesome sales force lined up against that. I would argue that some of the relationships we have with brokers and advisors who serve those markets -- and again they're not always the bigger name sort of regional or national players. A lot of these are people who have businesses that serve small local communities and we've established really deep and strong relationships there. So as the economy continues to grow, as businesses continue to hire and add, I would continue to see that being a fuel for our premium and fee growth for SPD.","Dan Houston","Thanks for the questions, Andrew.","Andrew Kligerman","Thanks.","Operator","The final question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question was on international. You referenced the $80 million of adjusted earnings as a good starting point going into 2020. That seems a bit lower than what was implied by the guidance in December. So, I just wanted to clarify, if I was thinking about that correctly. And if so what caused the change?","Dan Houston","Luis you want to help clarify that?","Luis Vald\u00e9s","Yes. Let me try to put this in perspective because, we have had this discussion. And particularly when you're looking, what we have reported in Q3 first, so it looks like we're -- we have a comparison with that. It's $92 million versus $80 million. It's important to put this in precise very easy to explain the difference. First of all, $4 million headwind in FX. The same $4 million that we have an additional and an elevated prepaid -- prepayment fees and $3 million more about elevated expenses that are related with the recalibration of our business in Hong Kong and Chile.","So, if you're taking that in consideration, you -- immediately you're going to make the math between $92 million and $80 million. I really believe that, as we said and Deanna said, the $80 million, $81 million that we're proposing is a good representation of our run rate into 2020 and it's pretty much more in line with our guidance that we put together in the month of December for PI.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Thanks. And then, just this last one, Deanna, you mentioned high single-digit EPS growth from a normalized level in 2019. Is the normalized level around $5.55, if I'm making all the right adjustments?","Deanna Strable","$5.55. So, I think -- are you looking at an after-tax basis or pretax basis?","Ryan Krueger","I was -- I think -- I thought the high single-digit growth was for adjusted -- ","Deanna Strable","EPS. You're right. Yes. I don't have that right in front of me. I think how we would do that is, we took out all significant variances in 2019 and then we normalized for the integration costs in 2020. So, we can get back to you on that exact EPS. But that's how -- that's what led to that calculation.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Houston, your closing comments please, sir.","Dan Houston","Yes. Thank you and appreciate everyone's questions this morning. I just want to assure investors out there that, we spend a lot of time aligning our expenses with our projected revenues. That's always been a hallmark of the organization. It will continue to be a focus of this management team.","Second, we made a big bet with RIT and successfully migrating that over. That does not escape us and we focus a lot of time and attention to successfully migrating that business, the support. And you're starting to see the realization of that digital portfolio as we digitize our business and become more relevant. We have enormous confidence that those investments will continue to pay off for investors. So, we're going to stay focused on these efforts and certainly appreciate your continued support. We look forward to seeing you on the road. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, for participating in today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Principal Financial Group's fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. As always, our earnings release, financial supplement, slides related to today's call and additional investment portfolio detail are available on our website at www.principal.com\/investor.","Following a reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO, Larry Zimpleman, and CFO, Terry Lillis, will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A are Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors; Luis Valdez, Principal International; Tim Dunbar, Chief Investment Officer; and Julia Lawler, Senior Vice President of Investment Services.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

As usual, I'll comment on 3 areas. First, I'll discuss fourth quarter and full year 2012 results. Second, I'll provide an update on the continued successful execution of our strategy, and I'll close with some comments on capital management. As John mentioned, we provided slides related to today's call. Slide 4 outlines the themes for today's call.","The company ended 2012 with a very strong fourth quarter. The business momentum continues to be strong, and with a better macroeconomic environment, the business fundamentals were able to come through to revenue and operating earnings. While there were some modest onetime positives, which Terry will discuss, we achieved a 16% increase in total company adjusted operating earnings per share compared to fourth quarter 2011.","We ended fourth quarter 2012 with a record $403 billion in assets under management and $30 billion in total company net cash flow for 2012, outstanding results reflecting ongoing momentum in the businesses. This reflects our competitive advantage and the strength of our advisor-focused distribution model, as well as the strength of our joint venture partners.","Some of the growth metrics from the quarter include: strong sales of $3.3 billion for full service accumulation, contributing to strong net cash flows of $1.6 billion in the quarter; strong sales of $4.2 billion in Principal Funds, contributing to net cash flows of $1.5 billion in the quarter; record unaffiliated assets under management of $98.2 billion in Principal Global Investors; strong net cash flows of $2 billion for Principal International; $85 million in Individual Life sales in the quarter, an increase of 56% over fourth quarter 2011, reflecting strong sales in all segments and continued success in the business market; and Specialty Benefits sales of 18% in the fourth quarter of 2012 over 2011, driving premium and fee growth of 5%.","Turning now to the full year. Total company results were strong, given difficult operating conditions. On an adjusted basis, full year earnings per share were up 12% over reported earnings per share of $2.66 for 2011.","Let me highlight some of the outstanding growth metrics from 2012. Full service accumulation had record sales of $11.5 billion, up 36% over 2011, and record net cash flows of $7 billion, which is 6% of beginning-of-year account values. Annualized net revenue on new sales is up 46% over 2011.","Principal Funds had record sales of $15.8 billion for the year, up 41%, resulting in record net cash flows of $7 billion for the year. Principal Global Investors had full year unaffiliated net cash flows of $7 billion, reflecting continued strong investment performance and demand for our broad investment expertise.","Principal International had record reported net cash flows of $9.3 billion, up 69% over 2011, leading to a record $69 billion in reported assets under management. Total assets for Principal International, including our China joint venture, were $80.5 billion at the end of 2012, up 32% from the prior year.","Net cash flows from our Latin American businesses continue to be strong, and we're generating increasing net cash flows from our Asian businesses as well. In U.S. Insurance Solutions, Individual Life full-year sales of $227 million were up 22% compared to 2011, driven by the nonqualified and business owner markets, which drove 55% of total sales.","2012 Specialty Benefits had sales of $256 million, a decrease of 10% from record sales in 2011 in what remains a competitive environment. The strength of our business fundamentals leads to growth in assets, leading to higher net revenues over time and ultimately higher total company operating earnings. Given the ongoing strength in our close ratios and our investment performance, we remain confident about our competitive position and our ability to continue to grow our businesses into the future despite challenging macroeconomic conditions.","Next, I'll comment on our success in further implementing our strategy in 2012. We announced 2 significant acquisitions last year in Latin America, solidifying our position as a retirement leader in the fast-growing emerging markets in this region. The acquisition of Claritas in April, a Brazilian retail mutual fund and asset management company, complements our existing pension leadership position in Brazil, where BrazilPrev, our joint venture with Banco Brasil, is the fastest-growing pension company in that market. As a reminder, Brazil is the sixth largest mutual fund market in the world and continues to grow at double-digit rates.","Additionally, in October, we announced our intent to acquire Cuprum, a premier mandatory and voluntary pension provider in Chile. We received all regulatory approvals and have completed the tender offer for this transaction. We expect to complete this transaction next week, further positioning The Principal as a retirement leader in Chile.","And in Mexico, with the 2011 acquisition of HSBC's AFORE and our exclusive distribution arrangement, we've successfully built scale in the AFORE market, which is the key to success in the mandatory pension market.","We've proven our ability to create a center of retirement and long-term savings excellence in key emerging markets in Latin America. This expertise serves us well as the long-term savings and retirement markets in Asia begin to develop. Our position in Asia is further strengthened by having large, well-respected joint venture partners like China Construction Bank, CIMB Group in Southeast Asia and Punjab National Bank in India.","In addition to strong joint venture partners, the synergies among our businesses continue to uniquely position us in these key emerging markets. In early 2012, we announced that Principal Global Investors was awarded a Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor, or QFII, license in China. Last month, we fulfilled our existing quota of $150 million. This demonstrates that Principal Global Investors' well-established and growing presence in Asia, with our strong equities management capabilities, provides a compelling proposition to clients.","Finally, we continue to pursue deregistration as a savings and loan holding company. This process will likely take several months. We remain hopeful that we will retain much of our ability to provide products and services to our principal bank customers without the ongoing oversight of our holding company by the federal reserve.","Strong investment performance continues to be a leading indicator of strong net cash flows. Our results continue to be strong across asset classes and are a differentiator for The Principal. As shown on Slide 5 and now referenced in our supplement on Page 1, 84% of our investment platform funds ranked in the top 2 Morningstar quartiles on a 1-year basis, 91% on a 3-year basis and 60% on a 5-year basis. As a result of strong investment performance results, driving large net cash flows, Principal Funds is now ranked 19th in market share for adviser-sold funds and 11th in net cash flows for 2012 based on rankings done by Strategic Insight. Our goal is to continue growing market share as we continue to develop innovative new products and expand and deepen distribution channels.","Our Investment Management + strategy, which encompasses a unique set of businesses, focused on the long-term savings, investment and risk protection needs of clients around the world, continues to differentiate our business model.","Finally, I'll close with some comments on capital management. We continue to operate from a position of financial flexibility as a result of our fee-based business model, providing increasing amounts of deployable capital. This model allows us to return capital to shareholders, as well as invest in our business through strategic acquisitions. In 2012, we allocated more than $2 billion of capital to common stock dividends, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases.","In addition to increasing the total 2012 dividend 11% over 2011, we announced last night that our board has approved a first quarter 2013 common stock dividend of $0.23, a 10% increase over fourth quarter 2012 as we seek to continue to increase our dividend payout ratio. Looking ahead to 2013, we expect to deploy approximately $500 million for common stock dividends, strategic acquisitions and any share repurchase.  The bulk of share repurchases, if any, would be in the latter half of 2013.","Before I close, I want to mention that The Principal was recently named the #1 place to work among large money managers by Pensions & Investments magazine. Attracting talented employees is a key component for long-term success as a global investment management company. This recognition is strong validation that our aspiration of being a recognized global investment management leader is being realized.","Finally, I want to acknowledge and congratulate Julia Lawler on her new position within the company. Julia has been our Chief Investment Officer since becoming a public company. Julia has moved from her role as Chief Investment Officer to Senior Vice President of Investment Services, where she is responsible for overseeing the portfolios for Retirement and Investor Services, as well as Principal International. She'll apply the expertise she's gained from successfully managing the general account to a much larger share of the company's total assets under management.","Tim Dunbar has added Chief Investment Officer to his responsibility, as well as continuing to oversee [Audio Gap]. He's joined the company 25 years ago and has managed operations in Mexico and served in various roles in Principal Global Investors. I'm excited to have both Julia and Tim's expertise in these key investment management roles. Terry?","Terrance J. Lillis","Thanks, Larry. As Larry mentioned, the fourth quarter was a very strong finish to 2012, showing continued business momentum as we move into the new year. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including [Audio Gap] the strength of our capital position and balance sheet. Reported fourth quarter 2012 operating earnings of $244 million were up 21% over the reported fourth quarter 2011.","Looking at Slide 6, you'll see the positive onetime benefits that helped fourth quarter 2012 operating earnings per share. The extraordinary and accelerated dividends the company has paid in fourth quarter 2012 benefited fourth quarter results by $0.03, and variable investment income from alternative investments added $0.01. Combined, these items benefited current quarter operating earnings by $0.04 per share.","On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2012 earnings per share were up 16% over the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong execution and lower share count. Looking ahead, first quarter 2013 will be negatively impacted by closing costs for Cuprum, as well as normal seasonality in Principal Global Investors and Specialty Benefits.","On a reported basis, 2012 full year earnings per share were up slightly. Adjusting 2012 for the third quarter actuarial assumption review, 2012 earnings per share were up 12%. This is a very strong result despite macroeconomic pressures such as low interest rates, a strengthening U.S. dollar and pricing pressures.","Now I'll discuss business unit results. Slide 7 and 8 are the same slides that we provided on our outlook call. They summarize the expected 2013 and 5-year revenue growth rates and margins for each of the businesses. These drivers of profitability provide greater clarity for earnings growth by business unit and are key to how we measure our businesses going forward. We continue to believe we'll achieve the net revenue and pretax margin ranges we announced at our November 27 call.","Turning now to Slide 9 on Retirement and Investor Services. Our Accumulation businesses had net revenue growth of 18% in fourth quarter 2012 versus fourth quarter 2011, driving operating earnings up 27% to $134 million. Adjusting for the benefit received from the extraordinary dividends paid by companies during the quarter and variable investment income, operating earnings grew 16% in fourth quarter 2012 compared to the year-ago quarter. Strong growth in account values was driven by very favorable sales and retention that boosted net cash flows and positive asset appreciation.","Fourth quarter operating earnings for full service accumulation at $81 million were up 39% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting 17% net revenue growth, improved quarterly pretax return on net revenue and $8 million dividend benefit.","Underlying fundamentals within full service accumulation remains strong. The sales pipeline continues to build and close ratios continue to improve. In addition, full year 2012 recurring deposits were up 11% over 2011, reflecting growth in eligible participant count as a result of strong sales and client retention.","We expect 2013 full service accumulation sales to be comparable to 2012 based on assets, but expect to achieve double-digit growth in annualized net revenue on new sales. We expect to continue to drive sales across all plan sizes, small, medium and large, but with greater emphasis on small to mid, where we will capture a higher percentage of proprietary asset management. This shift may also result in lower net cash flows in 2013, but again will enable us to drive higher growth in annualized net revenue from new sales.","Operating earnings for Principal Funds at $13 million in fourth quarter were up 25% from the year-ago quarter on 23% increase in revenue and improved pretax margin. On a full-year basis, sales and net cash flows were outstanding at $15.8 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively. We continue to see strong investment performance and high demand across multiple strategies, including global diversified income fund, preferred securities, MidCap Blend Fund, high-yield and our target-risk funds.","Individual Annuities operating earnings at $31 million, up 12% from the year-ago quarter, benefited $3 million from variable investment income, which partially offset continuing margin compression due to the low interest rate environment.","Slide 10 covers the guaranteed businesses within Retirement and Investor Services. Fourth quarter net revenue was down 3%, while operating earnings of $19 million were relatively flat over the year-ago quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax return on net revenue remained stable at 78%. We continue to approach this business opportunistically and we'll issue investment-only and full service payout business when market conditions generate attractive returns.","Turning to Principal Global Investors. Operating earnings of $26 million were up 50% over the year-ago quarter. Slide 11 shows fourth quarter revenues grew 11%, driven by higher average assets under management while holding costs relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenue is up 8%, and pretax margin expanded to 23%, both strong and expected results.","Investment performance remains competitive. The exit of a large Origin client, as well as a restructuring of the emerging market team, caused slightly negative unaffiliated net cash flow in the fourth quarter. However, we believe the negative flows were confined to the fourth quarter as the emerging market team maintained stellar performance following the transition, reflecting the strength and consistency of our investment philosophy and process.","On a full-year basis, unaffiliated net cash flows of $6.9 billion was very strong, reflecting positive flows in several categories such as currency, real estate and stable value. Our pipeline is at its strongest in many years, and we're confident we'll have strong net cash flows in 2013.","Looking at Principal International, fourth quarter 2012 operating earnings of $45 million are down $5 million from the reported fourth quarter 2011. However, as shown on Slide 12, adjusted operating earnings were up 14% when removing the additional month of earnings from BrazilPrev and the tax credits in the year-ago quarter.","Fourth quarter 2012 combined net revenue grew 16% over the adjusted year-ago quarter. Full year 2012 combined pretax return on net revenue improved to 56%. Despite foreign exchange headwinds during 2012, operating earnings, net cash flow and assets under management continued to grow.","Now that we're nearing the close of the Cuprum acquisition, let me remind you that earnings from the business will be on top of the existing strong organic growth that we're already seeing in Principal International. We continue to expect roughly $0.12 of total company earnings per share accretion in 2013 from Cuprum.","Turning to Individual Life, Slide 13 shows fourth quarter 2012 premium and fees grew at a strong 8% over fourth quarter 2011 due to strong sales in the current quarter. Operating earnings at $28 million were up 2% over fourth quarter 2011, reflecting the headwind from low interest rates.","On a trailing 12-month basis, after adjusting for the impact of actuarial assumption review and the amortization basis change, pretax operating margin is 17% within the targeted long-term range of 16% to 21%. We expect to be at the lower end of this range as long as the low interest rate environment persists.","Specialty Benefits operating earnings at $32 million were up 23% over the same quarter a year ago. Slide 14 highlights Specialty Benefits premium and fee growth of 5%, a solid result, given continued pressure on employment and wage levels. Fourth quarter 2012 operating earnings also benefited from a lower claims loss ratio. Despite the high group disability loss ratio in third quarter, the overall loss ratio of 68% for the year remains at the midpoint of our targeted range.","On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax operating margins of 9% is in line with our long-term expectation of 8% to 12%. Let me remind you that operating earnings for Specialty Benefits are very seasonal, where typically we roughly see 20% of annual earnings coming from the first quarter, 25% in the second and third quarters and 30% in the fourth quarter.","The corporate segment reported an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $39 million. We experienced additional debt interest expense until we early retired our 2014 notes in late December, as well as some costs associated with the Cuprum acquisitions, which were partially offset by miscellaneous income.","Looking at 2013, we continue to expect the normal quarterly run rate for corporate earnings to be a loss of $35 million to $40 million, with an additional $7 million after-tax loss of onetime Cuprum closing costs in first quarter 2013.","For the year, total company net income was $773 million, an increase of 25% over 2011, driven by gains from the sale of assets and better-than-expected credit losses. Aftertax credit-related investment losses in 2012 at $110 million, down 25% from 2011, reflect a continued downward trend to a multi-year low. Our investment portfolio continues to perform extremely well.","Book value per share, excluding other comprehensive income, finished 2012 at $29.20, a 7% increase over 2011, despite the write-downs due to the change in actuarial assumptions in the third quarter. This represents a solid growth in the company's intrinsic value.","2012 reported return on equity of 9.6% was negatively impacted by the third quarter actuarial assumption review. Adjusting for this, return on equity was 10.7% in 2012, up 50 basis points from 2011 despite the macroeconomic challenges.","Looking now at capital adequacy, we estimate our year-end risk-based capital ratio to be 415% to 420%. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $2.5 billion of total deployable capital. Approximately $1.5 billion of capital is earmarked for the purchase of Cuprum. We expect to complete the transaction on February 4.","As outlined in Slide 15, we allocated $2.1 billion of capital for common stock dividends, strategic acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchase in 2012. The evolution of our less capital-intensive, fee-based business model allows us to continue a pattern of increasing our dividend payout ratio, representing 30% of 2012 net income.","Additionally, we repurchased 9.9 million shares, with approximately $260 million in 2012. Looking ahead to 2013, we expect to deploy $400 million to $600 million of capital with a continued commitment to increasing long-term value for shareholders. As Larry mentioned, last night, we announced our first quarter 2013 dividend of $0.23, a 10% increase over the previous quarter dividend.","In closing, we're very pleased with the continued growth and momentum of our businesses, as well as the outstanding execution by our team in 2012. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess first question, can you comment just in terms of the large account that you lost within Origin in terms of maybe what you were collecting on fees relative to the rest of the book?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Chris, this is Larry. I'll have Jim comment on that.","James Patrick McCaughan","Yes, Chris. The large account that exited Origin was about $800 million in asset value, and the fee was a bit lower than Origin's typical because it's a large account, but it was in the order of below 30s of basis points. So there's a bit of a loss there. However, I would point out that Origin has had growth from other sources, and we're expecting revenues in 2013 to be at or slightly above the run rate when we bought the firm just over a year ago. And just in case I can anticipate your next question, the testing of goodwill, we're well in the right side of that one. So although that was an outflow in the quarter, we are pretty confident of the general situation and the solidity of Origin's client base. Just to elaborate, if I may, this was a case where a large client wanted to move several managers into a single strategic relationship. We pitched for that. I believe we were a very credible finalist but on the day, we didn't get it. I think that's true of many of these large institutional pitches, but we're definitely in the frame and a very credible contender for that kind of case.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 other quick ones. One, in terms of the growth in number of plans. You're getting some pretty nice growth there really in all employer sizes. Can you just comment some on the fee dynamics in terms of what you're seeing in that growth, maybe versus your core book and what you currently have in place?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Chris, yes. This is Larry. I think we said in the earlier comments to give you some kind of insight into that, as you know, the actual new sales were up about 36% in 2012. We commented that the annualized fee revenue of that business was actually up 46% over the prior year. So you can see that we're gaining traction, if you will, in terms of, if you will, revenue per dollar as it relates to new sales. And part of that is as a result of focusing a little bit more on the small and medium. Now I'm always a little cautious because when we suggest that we're focusing more in the small and medium, it sounds like we're sort of running away from a different part of the market, and that's not really the case. This really again is more about deploying additional resources and making additional investments. And so it's not like we're running away from an existing book of business or larger plans. We just think at the moment there remains a great opportunity. Part of this, as an example, Chris, is with our Edward Jones relationship. You may remember we brought that relationship on at the start of 2012. And they're an example of the type of firm that is completely and squarely focused on small, medium business. So just as we follow these opportunities, it's taking us a little bit more in that direction, which, of course, we like financially anyway.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just last quick one in terms of the Cuprum acquisition, the multiple you guys paid 13x. The announcement this morning from Met, they're acquiring a similar business for 10.5x. So just curious why the price that kind of you pay, is it the assets to a participant where you think there's better growth on the voluntary side? A little color would be helpful.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, it's a very good question, Chris. I'll make a couple of comments. Luis may want to add some things. First of all, I think that you would have to be a little careful of evaluating the sort of initial financials that come out in a transaction like this. There's some confusion, I think, about the multiples because there's a piece of the company actually owned by BBVA directly. There's a piece that they control through ADRs. So there's going to be -- I think it's going to take a little while before we ultimately know what that multiple looks like. I will tell you, based on kind of our own calculations, we think the multiples, both on their transaction and our transaction are in that kind of 11x to 12x PE range. So I think by the time all the dust settles, we'll find those are very comparable PEs. If they are comparable PEs, I would still argue that our Cuprum acquisition represents better value. And the primary reason for that is that 2 things. First of all, the average AUM per contributor is much, much higher in Cuprum, and Luis may be able to give you some detail on that. And the other thing is that the real opportunity in Chile, the real opportunity and the growth opportunity in the future is really on the voluntary side. So one of the things that you want to look at very carefully in evaluating an acquisition there is how many of the contributors are eligible for additional voluntary. And so in the case of the industry overall, that's about 50% of the contributors. But in the case of Cuprum, our acquisition, about 70% of those contributors are eligible for voluntary contribution. So that's really the growth opportunity and the longer-term opportunity in the AFP business. So I think there's really no question that sort of pound-for-pound and strategically, Cuprum represents better value than Provida, which is a well-respected AFP, but is more of a middle income, lower middle income, whereas ours is more of a middle income and affluent sort of segment. So Luis, any comment?","Luis Valdez","As Larry mentioned, our preliminary analysis about this transaction is confirming our evaluations for this business in Latin America, in particular in Chile. As Larry mentioned, you could see some differences between Cuprum and Provida. But all in all, we are very clear that we have the right valuation for our acquisitions. And again, we are very clear that Cuprum was a very good acquisition for us and we're very happy about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","When I think about the strong operating results that you showed in the fourth quarter and I look at the assumptions baked into your 2013 outlook, and I think the S&P 500 has performed better than is baked in there, and at least 10-year treasury yields are higher. Should we not think of the outlook as being conservative now at this point?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Sean, this is Larry. Well, we all know that a quarter's a quarter. So it's certainly true that the macroeconomic conditions, Sean, that have been in place since our earnings driver call have been more favorable, the macroeconomic events have been more favorable than would have been implied in our earnings drivers. So I accept the premise of the question. I think we'll just have to see, however, because we obviously don't do quarterly guidance. We don't even really do annual guidance. We do guidance on earnings drivers. So I think we'll just have to see as we go forward into 2013 whether those macroeconomic events sort of stay in a favorable mode and may even ultimately become tailwinds as compared to the latter part in 2011 and most of 2012 when the macroeconomic event -- factors were really headwinds. So perhaps some reason for optimism, but it's still very early.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Got it and one follow-up. You said that you are going to close the Cuprum acquisition next week, and you got the shares tendered from Penta. But I thought I saw something in the news about the Chilean regulators having a concern with the tender process. Can you just maybe give us an update on what that concern was and if that's taken care of?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Sure, I'll have Luis comment, Sean. But again, just to be clear, the tender offer process has been completed. It's been completed successfully, and we do have in hand all the approvals from the pensions regulator. So our intent will be to complete this transaction. We're estimating right now on February 4. So Luis, anything to add?","Luis Valdez","No concerns particularly about the tender offer in particular. The regulator was asking to -- us to clarify certain aspects in the article within our prospect related with expenses mainly, but no concerns in particular. Those items were pretty clarified and the tender offer was declared a very successful one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I wanted to kind of jump to the couple of laws and policy items. One, Larry, you mentioned the S&L deregistrations kind of not affecting the bank performance. But I was wondering if we get a little more color on kind of what that looks like on the ground. And then the other question I have is just around DRD. We're right ahead of the budget that comes out in a couple of weeks or 3 weeks. I mean, any thoughts on how DRD might change with the upcoming budget?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, Randy, maybe a couple of comments. I'm not completely sure that I caught the gist of the first question on the S&L deregistration. I think that again, we continue to pursue that. As I said in my comments, we think it will take several months, but we don't -- we haven't seen anything so far that would cause us to think this is proceeding in any way different than we would have expected. It does appear that while there's still actually very few deregistrations that have been completed, it seems like a time frame in sort of the 6- to 9-month period sort of end to end, seems kind of reasonable. But I will also say if you've seen one deregistration process, you've seen one deregistration process because they really are all a little bit different because the entities may want to offer some banking products, maybe not others, another deregistration may not want to offer any at all. So they really are different. But again, I would just say that the discussions have been very, very constructive. I think the right questions are being asked and the right answers are being given and the process is moving forward. So we'll continue to keep you updated on that one, but again, everything is moving as we expect. On the DRD issue, I mean, there is a DRD tax benefit for an obvious reason to avoid double taxation. If we -- I think the only basis on which DRD gets changed, Randy, I think is if there's a broader corporate tax reform that happens in this country. And I would say while in the latter part of 2011 as I make my frequent trips to Washington, D.C. and listen to decision makers there, I might have had some hope in the latter part of 2011 that there actually might have been some corporate tax reform. But I will tell you that as I listen to the dialogue today post the election, I would say my view that the probability of corporate tax reform is going down and is going down fairly substantially. So I'm not expecting and we're not expecting necessarily any significant change in DRD unless a broader corporate tax reform happens. So that's about the best I can tell you on that one.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","No, understood and we agree on that. I guess on the bank -- sorry, if I was vague in my question, but we assume some level of operating earnings from the bank and it's not a huge part of the business. But I mean, I guess so far, that process is not affecting how the business is operating or is it too early to tell?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Correct, yes. So the bank earns about $8 million a quarter, and it's a little bit too early to tell as to how that might change. I think if we have -- if we're able to accomplish all the things that we want to accomplish with the deregistration, which would still allow us to offer some level of banking products, maybe not the full suite we have today, it could impact that number a little bit. But again, relative to total complex, it's not going to be significant. I hope that helps.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes, it does.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","There seems to be a changing dynamic, you discussed it in detail in your 401(k) business, where asset growth seems to be slowing but meaning you're getting very strong net flows. But because those strong net flows are fairly stable and against a growing asset base, the rate of growth, while still positive, is slowing. It seems, too, that you're changing the nature of -- you're trying to change the nature of your customers in favor of customers who may give you more revenue. I don't know about the profitability but more revenue. There's so much going on here. I guess the first question would be this, maybe, Terry, could you go over exactly what you were saying about the outlook for sales in 2013 for flows and for revenues because those are 3 completely different ideas? And I just want to make sure, for starters, I understand that, sales, flows and revenues in FSA.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Okay, go ahead Terry.","Terrance J. Lillis","Sure. Eric, this is Terry. What I said was that we're expecting sales for full service accumulation in 2013 to be a comparable asset level. However, the revenue that's going to be generated off those new sales should be at a higher level and then actually seeing double-digit growth in that revenue generated by those new sales. Why is that? Because as Larry mentioned, we're going to be focusing on and adding more resources to the smaller to midsize client, not necessarily moving away from the larger client. But as we do that, it will generate more revenue because we'll see more proprietary investment offerings. So as a result of that, there should be some additional profitability for the business.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","And just to make -- I'm sorry, just to finish off a comment on the flows because you asked about flows. So -- well first, on a general statement, Eric, you're correct that obviously a growing block of business, it can become more difficult to maintain growth as a block gets bigger and bigger and bigger. Witness Apple as an example as a company. So we sort of all know that's true. In the case of flows, again, what we'd expect is that sales will be relatively flat. Likely what that means, Eric, is that flows would actually be down a little bit. Net flows will be down from $7 billion. Now just so as people don't overreact to that, recognize that $7 billion of flows in 2012 was over 6% of the beginning-of-period account value. And you'll remember that our long-term guidance has been 4% to 6%. So we are outside the high end of that particular range. So the fact that flows maybe a little less shouldn't necessarily be a concern. It's really more back in line with what our longer-term guidance had been. And then finally, you have the issue of revenues, which Terry said, will be increasing our annualized new sales or annualized revenue of new sales another 10% to 15%. So what's happening here basically is that the margin, if you will, on new business and the margin on existing business are now starting to compress and get very close together, which is what's going to stabilize the overall returns on full service accumulation going forward.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If I could ask just one follow-up and then we'll go on to the next caller. Since you don't -- I don't think you report out that portion of your new money coming in the door that is going to be managed by Jim's group. I don't think you do as opposed to by sub-advised relationships or full third parties, both sort of completely outsiders. We don't get that breakdown. I'm looking for a way to keep score on how you are doing with this effort to bring in more revenue-rich business? And I'm just wondering about the following: do you think that we should be tracking as a way to keep score the rate of growth of your revenues versus the rate of growth of your assets with the idea being that if in fact you are succeeding in taking in more revenue-rich products than in the past, that rate of growth of revenues should be higher than the rate of growth in assets, if you can follow my line of thought?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Absolutely, Eric, this is Larry. I absolutely follow line of thought and agree with -- conceptually agree with what you said. If you look at -- I think it's Page 27. We don't need to talk about it now. We need to move on but on 27 of our financial supplement, you can sort of track what we're talking about in terms of PGI's investments as a proportion of the full service accumulation platform. I would just say as a general comment on that, that percentage has been holding or increasing slightly. So PGI is managing about 55%, 56% -- I'm sorry. In total, the proprietary is about 66%, and PGI manages about 55 points of the 65 points. So we're doing well on that score. And the reason we've included the revenue in the script, we'll continue to do that or think about maybe adding that to the supplement.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Thank you for that reminder about Page 27. That's helpful.","James Patrick McCaughan","Then the page -- I mean Page 29 goes into detail that I think would answer exactly your question, Eric. This is Jim.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do you think about PGI's current capabilities? Where do you think you're best positioned? And maybe what asset classes do you think you still need to add to or increase capacity? I guess related to that, can you talk about how you think PGI's positioned if we do start to see a shift from fixed income to equities more broadly?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes. This is Larry, and first of all, let me also say, welcome and we appreciate the coverage that you've picked up on us. So with that, I'll have Jim take your questions.","James Patrick McCaughan","With your last question, which is really what happens if the emphasis goes in customer demand from fixed income to equities. As you know, we've done really well in Principal Mutual Funds and full service accumulation, as well as Principal Global Investors from the investor focus on yield-biased assets. We have had very good flows into high yield into preferred securities and then the global diversified income fund that was launched in Principal Mutual Funds. So as you rightly indicate, our strength in fixed income has stood us in very good stead in the last 2 or 3 years as that's been what investors want. We have actually got some very competitive investment products and equities as well, and some were mentioned in the script with the MidCap Blend Fund, which is the same team manages the Blue Chip Fund, which is Large Cap Quality Growth. We have the equity income fund and the capital appreciation fund at Edge. So if the start -- if the bias in investor demand towards equities continues as it seems to have started in January, then we will be extremely well placed to capture that looking forward. On the broader question of how we're managing Principal's investment platform, it's very important nowadays to have really top-performing assets in various categories. And then equities, for example, I mentioned our capabilities managed by Principal Global Equities and by Edge, we also have some very high-quality capabilities at Columbus Circle and at Origin. Their performance is probably broadly second quartile [Audio Gap] with their very strong capabilities that will show well at times. So with those 4 groups, I think we're pretty well placed in equities. In real estate, we've been a leader for a long time. Our big thrust for future development there is likely be to be towards international real estate. We've already got a global client base, a very strong global client base for U.S. real estate. The gap in our product range is really managing a private real estate on an international basis. So we're quite happy there, but we have work to do on the international side. And by the way, that can be both organic and by acquisition. And then lastly on fixed income, as you know, we added to emerging market debt with the Finisterre acquisition. We've been developing very successfully emerging market debt within Principal Global Fixed Income. So I would say our suite of yield-biased assets is probably taking our fixed income and real estate together about the strongest in the industry. I feel pretty good about where we are, but clients will continue to demand strong investment across the board. So as well as adding for gaps, I think some further diversification in our investment capability will be important so that we can continue producing for our clients and for sales channels top-tier investments whatever happens.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Perfect. And then just on that last point, it sounds like you expected that diversification to come both still organically as well as through potential additional M&A. Is that right?","James Patrick McCaughan","Yes, absolutely. I'll give you a specific example. We took our high-yield capabilities last year and developed short-duration high-yield products, which have gone very well with certain parts of the client base. That's the kind of organic diversification that needs to be done as well to satisfy changing client demand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I want to look at the full service accumulation business from maybe others because -- so new sales were up $3.3 billion this quarter, which clear on an absolute basis is an impressive number. But if I look at it year-over-year, it seems like growth has slowed down a bit. I was hoping to get a little more color on why that was the case.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, Yaron, this is Larry. The better metric really is to look at the sales over, I would say, I would recommend, a trailing 12-month basis. And of course, we're now at the point where we're calendar year over calendar year. So I think really the way to look at that would be to look at the whole year, which is $11.5 billion over $8.4 billion in 2011. Within the context of quarter-to-quarter, sales could be a little bit lumpy. So even though the fourth quarter sales 2012 were frankly just a bit higher, that wouldn't be the comparison because these things will kind of ebb and flow. In other words, there's not a lot of difference between having a 12\/15 effective date, which is a sale in 1 year versus a 1\/15 date, which is a sale on the following year. So you really need to get sort of a trailing 12 months. There's a lot of momentum behind the business. If we look at our pipelines, our pipelines continue to grow, and our close ratios actually continue to hold or get better. So we do have optimism going forward, albeit, as Terry has said I think both in his script and in some answers, what we're really focused on in 2013 is a combination of moving assets and moving net revenues. So it's going to be a balanced approach in 2013.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And then in terms of the increased focus on small mid-level accounts, can you remind us kind of what you would characterize as a small account?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, good question. We normally think about smaller plans as being sort of in the below -- plan assets below the sort of $100 million to $150 million range is normally what we would think of as kind of small- and medium-size plans. So these are -- oftentimes, they're startup and quite often, they have $5 million, $10 million, and midsize would get into the $50 million, $70 million range. But those would be plan assets. Again, about 70% of the business we write is a takeover plan so there are existing assets. So those are -- that's our notion of small and medium.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And do you think about it in headcount numbers as well or is it just assets?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Well, we actually would probably think about it more in terms of assets per participant. So I mean that would really be the way we think about it. There are plans that have very large headcounts, and some competitors will go after those because they are a large headcount. But as we know in this business, Yaron, what really drives the business is the combination of revenue and profitability and revenue is, for the most part, revenue is tied to assets.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. I guess what I'm getting at here is I've seen the headlines over the potential impact of the health care reform on companies keeping headcount low below 50. I was just curious if that would have any impact on either growth trajectory or plans?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, I mean, frankly, I hadn't sort of extrapolated that into the whole equation, to be honest with you. I don't -- I think, really, as long as payrolls continue and salaries continue to sort of hold in at the level they are, as long as we don't get back to a 2008, '09 where you were seeing significant reduction in compensation in an attempt to save expenses. So as long as salaries continue to hold steady and merit increases continue to be given, those are all favorable trends for our business.","Terrance J. Lillis","Yaron, this is Terry. One of the metrics that we look at is the movement in the recurring deposits to get to that point. Pre-financial crisis, we saw a significant increase year-over-year in recurring deposits due in large part due to salary increases, deferral increases, participation increases as well as employment increases. Now we're seeing some of those deferral increases, the participation, the new contracts coming on generating that. But we're not seeing a lot of additional movement inside an existing plan in terms of new employees. Now in order for us to get a quantum leap in that recurring deposits, you'll see when employment comes back, you'll see that increase occur there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Larry, overall, obviously, it seems like it's actually a pretty strong quarter. A couple of points that I thought were a little weak, FSA margins came lower especially if you adjust for the DRD whether you look at it on a return on net revenue or ROA basis. And then PGI flows were a little light. You mentioned the Origin issue, but there's also the restructuring of the emerging markets' teams so do you expect an ongoing -- any ongoing weakness because of that?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","This is Larry. On the point about FSA margins, what I would say on that, and I've said this many, many, many times, is I think it's important not to take a period that's going to be as short as a calendar quarter and try to sort of annualize or divine some inflection point in that. I think the key thing here is that we are adding more revenue per dollar of new sales, we are compressing the revenue rates between the existing book and the new sales book, and that is going to stabilize those margins and move in to that range that we talked about over the long term. So I feel very, very good about where we are with our strategy around margins for that particular business. And I'll let Jim make a few comments on the emerging market restructure and how well that's gone because it's actually a positive point.","James Patrick McCaughan","Yes, the emerging market restructure led -- some clients obviously are unsettled by any change, and it led to outflows in the order of about $1 billion during the fourth quarter. Obviously, that was offset against the PGI levels some very robust inflows elsewhere. I would characterize the emerging market restructure as firstly, we have managed by recruiting people that know our strategy and have been with us in the past and have followed us closely. We've managed to put a very solid team together that actually is as experienced as it ever was before. And we've been around all of the big clients quite intensively because you obviously communicate very closely on any changes. And I would observe as far as we can see that they're pretty rock solid and actually very encouraging of those in terms of the way we're evolving that process. So we feel we're in a very good situation. Basically, we were very proactive in terms of communication and remain very close to clients and distributors. And I think basically, the $1 billion outflow was a short 10% of the assets managed by that group, and basically it was a fourth quarter event. We're not expecting any material amount going forward.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","And Jimmy, this is Larry. I would just make 2 quick additional points, data points. I said in my comments that PGI was recognized by Pensions & Investments as the top place for larger money management firms. It's interesting to note that the primary determinant of that award is based on employee input from PGI. So I think that should give you good insight and comfort about how the broad group of PGI employees feel about both PGI and Principal. And the second thing I would say and Jim's a little bit humble on this one -- the second thing I would say is in the restructured emerging market team, there were actually 2 employees who formerly worked at PGI who came back, who left and came back to PGI as part of the emerging markets' restructure. And I would venture to say you'll find very few instances in the asset management business where people would hold up their hand and ask to return to come back to the place they worked previously. So those are very strong proof points for PGI's capabilities going forward.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And not sort of dance on the call, but the Edward Jones partnership seems like it's gone pretty well so far. But maybe if you talk about it, if it's fully ramped up already or do you expect to further pick up in contribution from that?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, this is Larry. The Edward Jones relationship has gone very well. I think that the buildup of the pipeline to, let's just say, any given level but typically, we think in terms of $1 billion, is faster in the Edward Jones relationship and ramp-up than anything we had seen previously. Although I think in fairness, it reflects the fact that Principal really is a marquee name among financial advisers for either mutual funds or retirement plans. So that relationship's going very well and it is part of the contribution toward the increase in plan count of 1,250 in 2012. So we're very excited about that going forward.","Operator","We reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Zimpleman, your closing comments please.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I'd just again like to thank everybody for joining today's call. We're pleased with our very strong finish to 2012, and we think that the continued momentum of our businesses makes us optimistic going into 2013, although we know there will be continued macroeconomic pressure. As we prepare to complete our Cuprum acquisition on Monday, we look forward to creating a best-in-class retirement platform in Chile and in other key markets in Latin America. We continue to believe that our fee-based business model gives us greater financial flexibility and the ability to create long-term shareholder value through capital deployment, as was demonstrated with our increase in common stock dividend announced last night. So thanks again, everybody, for listening. I look forward to seeing many of you on the road in the days ahead. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference call over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Principal Financial Group's fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call. As always, our earnings release, financial supplement and slides related to today's call are available on our website at www.principal.com\/investor.","Following our reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO, Larry Zimpleman; and CFO, Terry Lillis, will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A are Dan Houston, Retirement Investor Services and U.S. Insurance Solutions; Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors; Luis Valdes, Principal International; and Tim Dunbar, our Chief Investment Officer.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now I'll turn the call over to Larry.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Thanks, John, and welcome to everyone on the call. As usual, I'll comment on 3 areas. First, I'll discuss fourth quarter and full year results. Second, I'll provide an update on the continued successful execution and long-term benefits of our strategy, and I'll close with some comments on capital management. As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are on our website.","Slide 4 outlines the themes for the call. Fourth quarter 2013 was a strong finish to a great year. Total company operating earnings were $286 million in the fourth quarter and full year total company operating earnings were a record at nearly $1.1 billion. The fact that we achieved record operating earnings while still facing the headwinds of low interest rates and emerging market volatility demonstrates strong business fundamentals and the power of our diversified business model. This also makes us optimistic for continued growth in operating earnings as economic conditions return to more normal trend patterns.","Our competitive position remains strong in the U.S. and is gaining momentum globally. We manage assets in more than 60 countries, and we've expanded our retirement leadership position to key countries in Latin America and Asia. We continue to deliver innovative investment retirement and protection solutions, such as Total Retirement Suite, life cycle funds and business owner and executive solutions that competitors are not able to match, and we export these ideas to markets outside of the U.S. to create long-term growth.","Total company full year net cash flows of $17.4 billion helped drive assets under management to a record $483.2 billion, following our key additional growth metrics that highlight our success in 2013. Full Service Accumulation full year sales of $10.3 billion, which was the second highest on record. Margins in this business continued to improve as we strike a better balance across all plan sizes.","Full year recurring deposits, an important growth metric for the business, were up 12% year-over-year. Principal Funds continued to deliver strong sales growth, with full year sales up 26% to a record $19.8 billion. This, along with strong market performance and solid net cash flows, produced record account values at year end. Principal Global Investors had record assets under management of $292.1 billion at the end of 2013, and full year net cash flows of $4.2 billion. Unaffiliated assets under management also ended the year at a record $109.4 billion. Principal International assets under management were $104.5 billion at year end despite an $11 billion negative currency impact. Net cash flows remained strong at $8.5 billion for the year or 12% of beginning of year assets under management. This is despite the emerging market volatility in the last half of 2013.","U.S. Insurance Solutions premiums and fees were a record $2.4 billion. Specific to Specialty Benefits, full year sales grew 5% over 2012 and the loss ratio for the year was favorable and at the low end of our projected range. Individual Life sales were down year-over-year, primarily due to an intentional slowdown of universal life with secondary guarantee sales. Individual Life sales, excluding universal life with secondary guarantee, are up 21% year-over-year. Our business market focus continues to be a differentiator for us with non-qualified deferred compensation and Business Owner and Executive Solutions making up 57% of full year sales.","Again, the fundamentals of our business remains strong. We continue to build a leadership position in the markets where we operate, providing continued momentum into 2014 and beyond.","Next, I'll comment on the continued execution and long-term benefits of our strategy. Our Investment Management Plus strategy has created a durable and globally diverse business model with a set of highly integrated businesses that is unique among our peers. With Global Investment Management at the core of our strategy, strong investment performance is crucial to our success. As Slide 5 outlines, the investment performance remains competitive and is the leading indicator of future sales and flows.","To be a global investment management leader, we must also attract top investment talent. During the fourth quarter, The Principal earned the top spot in its category in Pensions and Investments' annual survey of the best places to work in money management for the second year in a row. We view this as a significant accomplishment when it speaks to our ability to attract and retain top investment talent. Within Principal Global Investors, we've taken a unique approach to executing our multi-boutique strategy. We've acquired and built expertise across multiple investment strategies with particular focus on meeting increased demand for global equities, fixed income and alternative investments. We drive efficiencies in our boutique model through a shared access to a world-class distribution and operational platform. We'll continue to look for ways to increase scale and efficiencies while maintaining our leadership position across multiple investment categories.","Moving to Principal International. Cuprum was a meaningful contributor to bottom line 2013 results, better than our expectations when we completed the acquisition 1 year ago today. In addition to achieving strong financial results, Cuprum was once again ranked at the top for both investment performance and customer satisfaction as published by the Chilean pension regulator in December. Cuprum has topped all of its peers in customer satisfaction, 19 of the past 23 rankings. Maintaining these high scores is testament to the exceptional job the team did to ensure a smooth on-boarding of Cuprum. This successful acquisition will continue to provide long-term growth opportunities as the mandatory pension market continues to grow and we expand our focus on the voluntary market in Chile.","Our combined operations in Chile, Brazil and Mexico make us the second largest pension provider in Latin America. Building additional scale and increasing our leadership position in these countries is a priority as middle-class growth continues at a rapid pace. The Principal is uniquely positioned to provide the long-term savings and retirement solutions this middle-class is seeking.","Principal International continues to build its leadership position in Asia as well. In Hong Kong, all 5 of Principal's MPF pension funds were winners of benchmark Fund of the Year Award in 2013, including one best-in-class fund. In Malaysia, during 2013, assets under management in our new PRS pension company grew tenfold and we now have the second largest market share. These accomplishments continue to position Principal International as a retirement leader as these markets mature. The Principal continues to be a leader in the U.S. retirement and employee benefits market as well.","In this highly competitive environment, we have the right mix of products and solutions to meet the needs of small and medium-sized businesses, their owners and their employees. Our ability to manage both qualified and non-qualified assets through Total Retirement Suite, and our competitive employer paid and voluntary employee benefits products make The Principal the right provider to help business owners attract and retain employees. In addition, our comprehensive business owner executive solutions are unique among our peers and complementary to our other businesses.","The Principal has been a leader in helping individuals prepare for and manage income and retirement for more than a decade. Our ability to win and retain clients has led to an increase of more than 700,000 eligible retirement participants since 2010. The growth opportunity in helping eligible participants in the plans we manage prepare for retirement is tremendous. Retirement readiness solutions, such as auto enroll and auto escalate features built into the plans, as well as continued work site efforts, will help drive further increases in recurring deposits and will allow The Principal to remain a leader in the retirement market as baby boomers enter retirement and millennials begin to save.","Principal Funds also plays a critical role in our long-term growth strategy. Our unique outcomes-based solutions and solid investment performance have led to strong sales and net cash flows for several years. As a result, Principal Funds continues to add market share and is now the 17th largest advisor sold mutual fund family in the U.S., up from 19th a year ago.","Advisor growth continues in our Funds business. We're now doing business with more than 50,000 advisors, yet this is still a fraction of the entire advisor universe. In addition, sales in our Defined Contribution Investment Only, or DCIO channel, have doubled since 2011 as we continue to successfully place our funds on other non-affiliated record-keeper platforms.","Finally, we announced at the end of December that the process to deregister the Principal Financial Group in our other holding companies, as savings and loan holding companies, was complete. As a result, we are no longer subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. Principal Bank will continue to offer individual retirement accounts that complement our full lineup of retirement savings and income solutions to meet the needs of our clients.","I'll close with some comments on capital management. Last night, we announced the first quarter 2014 common stock dividend of $0.28, an 8% increase over the fourth quarter 2013 dividend, demonstrating continued confidence in our ability to grow fee-based earnings and generate higher percentages of deployable capital. We continue to focus on increasing our dividend payout ratio on a growing net income base. As we said on our outlook call, we expect to deploy $500 million to $700 million of capital in 2014. Our broad strategies for capital deployment will not change. As always, our capital deployment strategy is aimed at providing the best long-term value for shareholders.","In closing, we're very pleased with the strong results in 2013, especially in light of continued macroeconomic volatility. We remain confident in the strength of our business mix and fundamentals, our long-term opportunities for growth and our experienced teams' ability to continue to successfully execute on the things they can control. Terry?","Terrance J. Lillis","Thanks, Larry. The fourth quarter was another strong quarter, resulting in record full year operating earnings. Achieving these results in a volatile global economy demonstrates the strength of our businesses and our ability to execute. We are very excited about the continued momentum of our businesses. This morning, I'll focus my comments on: operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment.","Total company operating earnings for the quarter of $286 million were up 19% over reported fourth quarter 2012. When looking at full year results, operating earnings of nearly $1.1 billion were up 31% over reported 2012 results. Even after adjusting for the third quarter 2012 actuarial assumption review, earnings were up 19% for the full year.","Excluding the Corporate segment, 63% of the company's record operating earnings in 2013 were from fee-based businesses. This reflects our scaling back or exiting businesses that produce more than $150 million of spread and risk-based earnings, and replacing them with less capital-intensive, fee-based earnings. These fee-based earnings come from higher multiple businesses that put less pressure on our balance sheet. We strongly believe that our current business mix provides the right diversification for continued growth.","Fourth quarter 2013 operating earnings per share was $0.96, a 19% increase compared to the year-ago quarter. For the full year, earnings per share of $3.55 increased 20% over adjusted 2012 results. This is a strong result, especially in light of macroeconomic volatility in the quarter. Earnings per share growth for the year was higher than our expected 11% to 13% annual growth rate due to the addition of Cuprum, favorable equity markets and disciplined expense management.","Looking at Slide 6, you'll see that fourth quarter 2013 earnings were impacted by some normalizing items, which in total, had no impact on earnings per share.","In Principal International, the encaje returns in Chile benefited operating earnings for the quarter, but were essentially offset by a one-time impact of the change in Mexican tax law that we mentioned on our outlook call.","Higher-than-expected pre-payments and Individual Annuities and better-than-expected operating earnings in Individual Life due, in part, to improved mortality were offset by one-time negative items in Corporate.","Now I'll discuss business unit results. Starting with the Accumulation businesses within the Retirement and Investor Services, operating earnings were $153 million, an increase of 15% over the year-ago quarter. As shown in Slide 7, net revenue was up 14% over the year-ago quarter. Trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue improved at 32%. Quarterly operating earnings for Full Service Accumulation at $93 million were up 15% from the year-ago quarter. Net revenue was also up 15% due to growth in the business and strong equity market performance. The trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue for the business unit was 31%.","Sales, at $3 billion for the quarter, were strong as we continue to focus on striking an appropriate balance of growth and profitability. Net cash flows for Full Service Accumulation were $143 million for the quarter. Increases in the equity market impact withdrawals more than deposits, as recurring deposits are not directly correlated to market returns.","Principal Funds operating earnings were $22 million for the quarter, a 63% increase from the year-ago quarter, as the strong sales over the last several years are now translating into bottom line results. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenue was up 24% and operating margins have continued to improve due to increased scale in the business. For the quarter, retail mutual fund sales were $4.1 billion, leading to $550 million of net cash flow. While down from a year-ago quarter, these results were solid relative to the industry.","Individual Annuities fourth quarter operating earnings were $32 million. The segment benefited from higher-than-expected prepayments in the quarter. This more than offset the spread compression due to the low interest rate environment.","Bank and trust operating earnings for the quarter were $6 million. With the repositioning of the bank as part of the deregistration process, this is a new quarterly run rate for earnings.","Slide 8 covers guaranteed businesses within Retirement and Investor Services. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $26 million were up 37% over the year-ago quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax return on net revenue was 81%. Investment-only operating earnings improved 33% from the prior year quarter to $15 million as increasing spreads more than offset a decrease in account value. New business continues to be more profitable than business rolling off. We continue to approach this business opportunistically, and we'll write business when market conditions generate attractive returns.","Full service payout operating earnings were $11 million for the quarter, a 44% increase over the year-ago quarter, and sales were $205 million. We believe that the rising interest rate environment will allow us to add small to mid-sized pension closeout business at attractive returns.","Slide 9 shows Principal Global Investors' operating earnings were $30 million, up 15% from the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter revenues grew 41% over prior year quarters, driven largely by stronger-than-normal performance fees in the current quarter. The performance fees were generated by boutiques, where we do not have full ownership, therefore, the impact of revenue is larger than the impact of after-tax earnings. The full year pretax margin for Principal Global Investors of 24% is 150 basis point improvement compared to 2012. The margin is down sequentially due to the higher performance fees in the fourth quarter. The very strong performance fees in the quarter will also impact the revenue growth rates that we laid out on our outlook call.","We now expect 2014 revenues to be similar to 2013, with pretax margins improving to the 26% to 28% range previously disclosed.","Unaffiliated assets under management were $109 billion at year end. Unaffiliated net cash flow for the quarter was $1.1 billion. There's continued demand for our diversified investment product portfolio as we move into 2014.","Slide 10 shows fourth quarter 2013 operating earnings for Principal International of $62 million. Encaje returns for the quarter were better-than-expected in Chile. That benefit was largely offset by the one-time impact of the tax change in Mexico. When compared to the prior year quarter, results this quarter were also negatively impacted by the prospective change to the amortization pattern of the intangible assets in Brazil, as discussed in our outlook call in December.","In addition, operating earnings growth from the year ago was suppressed by 11% due to continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Quarterly net cash flows for the segment were a record $2.7 billion, helped by a return to normal cash flows in Brazil. Principal International ended the quarter with $105 billion of assets under management despite the strengthening U.S. dollar. U.S. Insurance Solutions operating earnings were $60 million for the quarter. These results were flat with the year-ago quarter, but the mix between the underlying businesses shifted slightly.","As shown on Slide 11, reported Individual Life operating earnings were up 17% from the year-ago quarter to a strong $33 million. Results in the quarter benefited from improved mortality. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax operating margin was 14% compared to the 15% to 17% communicated for the year. Higher-than-expected mortality in the early part of the year was the main reason for the variance.","As shown on Slide 12, Specialty Benefits operating earnings of $27 million were down $5 million from a very strong year-ago quarter. Both quarters benefited from favorable loss ratios. The decline in the current quarter was primarily driven by several one-time expenses. We continue to expect our quarterly loss ratios to be in the 65% to 71% range, with fourth quarter at the favorable end of the range due to seasonality of claims. Trailing 12-month pretax operating margins of 11% was slightly above our expectations due to favorable claims experienced for the year.","The Corporate segment reported an operating loss for the quarter of $45 million, higher than our forecasted range of $35 million to $40 million of operating losses. Results this quarter were negatively impacted by higher expenses, as well as tax adjustments that are housed in the Corporate segment. Full year losses in Corporate of $149 million are at the lower end of the range we laid out at the beginning of the year. Expectations for losses in 2014 are $130 million to $150 million.","For the quarter, total company net income was $233 million. Realized capital losses for the quarter were $52 million, with credit-related losses making up $25 million of the total. Full year credit-related losses were $84 million, a 24% improvement from the previous year and were better than our pricing assumptions.","Our return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 12.1% at year end, a strong result improvement year-over-year, even taking into account the impact from the actuarial assumption review in 2012. Full year earnings grew 19% over the adjusted prior year, while average equity excluding AOCI increased just 5%. As I mentioned at Investor Day, growing operating earnings 10% to 12% while managing the equity growth will deliver a 50 to 80 basis point annual increase in return on equity.","Looking now at capital adequacy. We estimate our year-end risk-based capital ratio to be 430% to 435%. This allows us to redeem a $100 million surplus note in the first quarter 2014 and still manage to our targeted RBC ratio of 415% to 425%.","As outlined on Slide 13, we announced plans to deploy more than $480 million of capital in 2013, in line with our guidance for the year. This included a record full year common stock dividend of $0.98, which was a 26% increase over the dividend paid in 2012. Our dividend payout ratio for the year improved to 33% on an increasing net income base. As we move to 2014, we expect to deploy $500 million to $700 million of capital in the year, and over the long term, we expect to deploy 65% to 70% of our net income with volatility in any given year.","In closing, we're extremely pleased with the strong results in the quarter and the full year. We feel that we're well positioned for future growth across all of our businesses, and that our diversified business mix will generate successful results across various economic environments. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I was hoping we could talk about capital markets relative to the assumptions you had built into your 2014 outlook. And really, I'm thinking about both -- or I guess, the combination of global equity market weakness, long-term interest rates or lower foreign currency pressures have actually increased. So I'm just wondering, when you combine these factors, can you give us an estimate as to how much pressure on a combined basis this is placing on your outlook, relative to that original guidance provided in early December? And then I'd also like to look at the flip side of that. As a result of some of these pressures and dislocations, are you seeing any increased opportunities, especially on the acquisition side?","Larry D. Zimpleman","John, this is Larry. On the -- on your first question, John, as you know, we did our outlook call in early December, and we don't really update or comment on it after that point. Now you went through in your comments or in your question, a number of factors that certainly would -- the world might look a little bit different today than it did back in early December. But having said all of that, I guess I would make a couple of points. One is that the companies in the local markets outside the U.S. for Principal International continue to grow at double-digit rates. While there has been some noise in terms of the currencies, the actual local economies continue to do quite well, okay? So those companies continue to grow at roughly double-digit rates. Some of them grow faster than that. So for example, Brazil has historically grown at something closer to 20% to 25%. But the main point is that the local companies continue to grow at double-digit rates. The -- I would say that the currencies in January, the currencies have probably added another couple of percent headwind. So from what it was in December, we would have reflected some modest headwind when we made that call, that headwind might be a little bit tougher today. But I think if you net everything out and you think about our capital deployment, I would say, as I said in my comments, we still expect to see growth in operating earnings, growth in EPS during 2013. And I would emphasize again, the fundamentals of the business remain very, very strong. Now in terms of M&A, I think your question is an interesting one because for every challenge, there is an opportunity. And it could be that with the capital flexibility we have, with a more fee-based business model, that there could be opportunities for M&A, and we're aware of some that have come up and it's potentially likely that others may become more attractive in time.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then if I could just follow up on that. So if we assume that you -- that Principal did not issue any equity to do a deal, but rather use existing cash resources or capital resources, and I guess there's some modest debt capacity, can you give us a sense of about how much that, in total, would get to?","Larry D. Zimpleman","I'm not quite sure that I understand your question, John.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Well, if you had -- how big a deal could you do, I guess, without raising equity?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Well, again, I would say that the deal that we could do without raising equity would probably be in the sort of $500 million to $1 billion range. But I guess, I would look at this sort of net -- M&A for us, I would say, John, we'll look net-net on an accretive basis. In other words, we would only do things that we were confident we could execute on, first of all, because they have to be consistent with the strategy. And #2, I would say, they have to be accretive, and they have to be more than accretive with other uses of capital within a kind of 3 to 5-year period. Now, we all know the way M&A works, is it tends to be sort of accounting unfriendly, that is the reality so you're not going to necessarily getting the accretion versus other uses of capital in year 1. But we would want to build an acquisition plan we could execute on so that by 3 to 5 years, we are seeing accretion as compared to other uses of that capital. Regardless of how we finance it, that's how we think about it.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's entirely consistent.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Giovanni from Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to focus again on kind of the emerging markets. And obviously, there's been a lot of focus and not going to change your long-term approach, I think, but obviously, if you could comment some around, maybe a bit more on what you're hearing or seeing on the ground, and would be particularly interested in Jim's thoughts around what you guys are hearing, maybe from your emerging markets, specialist boutique, kind of like Finisterre?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes. This is Larry, Chris. I'll start that and Jim may want to make some comments, Luis may want to comment. I would start by saying, first of all, that we are in very carefully selected emerging markets. We're not a broad emerging markets company, we are not out there in 40 or 50 sort of emerging markets. We are in very, very selected emerging markets. So we take a very, very hard look at the economies and frankly, the political systems that are in place before we would use our capital to invest in these companies. So for example, Argentina was a country we exited, as an example. So we believe that we are in emerging markets but we are in the stronger economies within the emerging markets. So I think that's an important kind of distinction to recognize. Second point is the one that I said in relationship to John's question which is that, this sort of emerging market kind of hiccup is an interesting one and it's a bit different in sense that there has not been disruption in the performance of the local economies. It's a capital flow issue, not a local economy issue. In other words, the local economies continue to sort of trend -- growth trend continues to be sort of give or take what it was before. So for example, the Chilean economy -- even the Brazilian economy, still in that 2% to 3% growth mode. So the local economies continue to be strong and that's really what our expectation is for 2014. We don't see anything on the horizon that would indicate that the local economies are going to struggle to meet the growth targets that we put into our outlook for 2014. So with that, maybe I'll have Jim talk about what he hears from his analyst.","James P. McCaughan","Yes, thank you. To Larry's point about selected emerging markets, I'd also add the diversification point. So if I look at, for example, Finisterre, whom you mentioned, they're long short, and that actually means they can do quite well in up markets and down markets. And in fact, they had, not a great but quite a good 2013 if you research their investment performance. It was mostly around the double digits mark which, for an emerging specialist, in dollar terms, was actually pretty credible. And the reason of that was so was the long short part of it, are other emerging bond capabilities at Principal Global Fixed Income has actually focused on dollar-based emerging market debt and so has been spared a lot of the worst stuff. And I think that highlights the selectivity point that Larry made. And also, I think it illustrates the diversification point I'm making.","If you look at emerging equities, it's been interesting to see at Origin, who have a quantitive approach, very strong performance record, which is actually leading to some interest by clients which is maybe counter-intuitive because it's at a time when most emerging market fund was seeing outflows. So, really, that would be my main point about, to add to Larry, the markets is the diversification. If you talk to our equity analyst, it's really the point that the underlying economies continue to do fine but they're worried about financial squeeze, credit cycle, currency stability.","The other point I'd make though, and this relates to how we are placed to defend against the ups and downs of markets, is -- and this applies to Principal Global Investors and also to Principal International, by and large, our revenues in emerging markets or in international currencies are broadly matched by costs in those markets. So it's actually a matter here of translation rather than of a mismatch, which is something that happens with many companies in emerging markets. So we feel we're managing the risks. They're likely to stay volatile but I think that with selectivity and the diversification we've talked about and also the structure of our businesses, we are managing the risks quite effectively in a temporarily tough time.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Does that help, Chris?","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Very helpful. And then just one last quick one on capital, recognizing your long-term philosophy around capital management. Curious, as the recent weakness in your stock causes you to change maybe the near-term approach, entice you to maybe look at buybacks more, is that still kind of too shortsighted?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes. I'll make a couple of -- this is Larry. I'm going to make a couple of comments. I mean, again, we've thought about kind of share repurchase, and again, a sort of a 2-bucket approach. The first bucket would be to make sure that we're managing share count and therefore, repurchasing shares relative to any kind of newly issued equity, primarily as a result of deferred compensation. So that piece we would do as kind of a standard part of our capital management. The second bucket would then be that more opportunistic bucket. And I think to your point, Chris, while we haven't made any final decisions on that, I think to your point, we've always maintained a zone or a range of sort of intrinsic value of the company. And we're obviously coming closer to that range of intrinsic value. I think it's one of the real items of capital flexibility that we now have. As Terry said in his comments, we're a much more balance sheet-light organization and able to deploy much higher levels of free cash flow for capital management. So we think that gives us a lot more flexibility, and certainly, we recognize that there's perhaps been a little bit of overbaked nature to the emerging market concerned that may give us opportunity. We'll see what happens going forward for some opportunistic share repurchase as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have a couple of sensitivity questions. One is on encaje. Should Central Bank actually start raising interest rates to combat the decline in currencies? What kind of -- can you give us some sort of sensitivity as to what impact on EPS that may have on overall results?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes. Yaron, I'll have -- this is Larry. I'll have Luis comment. Just as a broad reminder kind of going to Luis' comments in Chile, the encaje is a more, somewhat more diversified portfolio. So it includes both equities and fixed income and it even has a dab of sort of global equities in it. In Mexico, the encaje, which is smaller, but that encaje is primarily a fixed income kind of sovereign investment there, so that would be impacted by rates. But Luis, do you want to comment?","Luis E. Vald\u00e9s","Yes, certainly. This is a pretty interesting question because in the country that were pretty much more exposed to the encaje is Chile, as Larry said, and the main debate that you could see in Chile right now is when the Central Bank is going to lower the interest rate instead of to raise the interest rate in Chile. And that's precisely in order to be a little bit anti-cyclic above the financial turmoil that emerging markets are living in. So we don't really see a very important risk about interest rates going up in Chile.","And in fact, the Central Bank last week, they made decision in order to keep the interest rate as it was and probably in their outlook is whether -- saying is that probably they're -- they have a much more stronger opinion in order probably to lower the interest rate going forward. In Mexico, the solution's a little bit different. And also, we don't see that the Mexican Central Bank is going to raise the interest rate, and that's our opinion. We were able to see some interest rate going up in Mexico during January but nothing in comparison with what happened in May and in June of last year that went up like 130 basis points in 2 weeks. So, it's being in a kind of mild movement in comparison with what happened in the very first part of -- or last part of the second quarter in 2013.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Does that help you, Yaron?","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, it does, thank you. And then, Larry, could you talk a little bit about the new legislation that was proposed by Senator Harkin on private pensions and what impact that may have on Principal?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Sure, sure. So I think last Thursday, Yaron, Senator Harkin introduced -- actually dropped the bill. He had been talking about this, maybe almost a better part 2 years. He dropped the bill. I think, broadly, it's sort of called the USA Accounts, and the USA stands for the 3 words, I can't quite remember, I think it's like Universal Secure and Adaptable or something like that. The essence of, I think, the Senator's proposal is that he would mandate contributions among all employers, if you will, into a defined contribution plan. If you're a small employer that didn't already have a plan in place, you would effectively go to the, I guess, the government-sponsored plan. The government-sponsored plan will then be managed by the private sector, so that's a little bit different than the myRA proposal that President Obama had talked about in his State of the Union. We, Principal, obviously, Senator Harkin's a Chairman of the HELP Committee. He's, obviously, the -- he's a junior senator from Iowa despite the fact he's been in the Senate for a very long time, we obviously work very closely with his office, and I talk with the senator on a regular basis. I think his primary purpose in dropping the bill was to continue, which I view as a positive, to put some emphasis on the fact that Americans need to save more for their own retirement. I mean, that's the bottom line, I think, the bottom line message that the Senator is trying to make. Now whether this particular approach of mandating contributions is one that will see the light of day, I think even the Senator might be a little bit skeptical about that. But I think his purpose is to stimulate the conversation, and we think simply stimulating the conversation is going to be helpful for our businesses because the reality is, we do all need to save more for retirement, whether that's mandated or whether that's just on a voluntary basis. So we actually think net-net, it helps to put the focus and spotlight on this issue, and it will perhaps cause people to redouble their efforts to make sure they're saving at the rate they need to do for their own retirement.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My first question of 2 relates to your guaranteed area. When -- if my memory serves me correctly, when you announced several years ago that you were going to limit your exposure to guaranteed investment contracts, I think you sort of -- you left impression that this would be a business with shrinking earnings. Well, this morning, we're reporting sharply higher earnings and your crediting improved net interest margins in contrast to what's going on with your Life Insurance business, where interest rates are actually pressuring your business. Two-part question. One, why the difference between the effect of interest rates on the Life business and from the Guarantee business effect? And should we expect that this business, this Guaranteed business, perspectively, to be a growing business in terms of earnings rather than the shrinking business that it had been for some time?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Thanks, Eric. This is Larry. Yes, it's a -- your questions are kind of interesting. Actually, what we've been trying to sort of manage within the context of what you called the guaranteed business, which another term, for those maybe not quite as familiar, that we apply to this business is the investment-only business. So Eric is talking about investment-only business as compared to the Individual Life business. What we've talked about managing in the Investment-only businesses is the account value of that business relative to the general account. So our general account, what we talked about is managing the Investment-only to be roughly 18% to 20% of the total value of our general account. And that's still our kind of best guess. It's sort of within that range now, and it's probably at the lower end of that range, and we would expect to sort of stay within that range. Now as the general account grows, that means that we'll grow that Investment-only account value, and it also means that earnings will grow, albeit they'll grow at something as closer to a mid-single digit rate. So, 4% to 6% or something like that. Now, the Life business -- the Life business on the other hand, again, as we said, we're making a little bit of a transition into Life business, sort of a way from UL's secondary guarantees toward more toward term products, toward more variable Life products. And so we have absolutely have plans to continue to grow that business, again, focused primarily on business owner and executive solutions. So I think, Eric, what you should expect going forward would be that sort of low -- or excuse me, that sort of mid single-digit growth rate in operating earnings. Actually, in commenting on fourth quarter here, you would note, or you should have noted, that the Individual Life business also had very nice improvement in operating earnings, albeit it was more from mortality than the spread. Whereas in Investment-only, it was more from the spread.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And if I could just ask my second and final question regarding Chile. Why is there, I mean, and this obviously could be an extended response so you'll need to give me an abbreviated one, but why is there a voluntary opportunity? And how should we think of the size of this opportunity and the potential earnings from it?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Okay. This is Larry, I'll make a few comments. The -- just quickly on the side, and then I'll let Luis talk about why the government decided to have a voluntary layer rather than just extend the mandatory. But just to give you a sense of the voluntary opportunity, basically, the mandatory system stops at a salary level that's about USD $38,000. So you're required to contribute roughly 10% of your salary up to the first USD $38,000 of your compensation. So again, if you make $75,000, you're only contributing on half. So that's where the cutoff between mandatory and voluntary occurs, is at that $38,000 of income level in U.S. dollar terms. Now, I'll ask Luis to talk quickly about why the government decided to go voluntary rather than mandatory on that upper income fees.","Luis E. Vald\u00e9s","Yes, Eric, this is mainly because going -- in trying to raise the bar in the compulsory system. It has implied a lot of political pain, if you want. You have a lot of resistance about the employees and employer to go in that direction, so the Chilean government is pretty much more keen in order to go after a voluntary solution, compulsory solution, and that's the -- where they're, I think, adding more incentives in order to develop that market. Having said that, they are putting in -- they're moving these limits that Larry mentioned a little bit but very much more timid. They put a law in 2008 that is moving those limits. But I'm saying those moves are very timid and the need for having a very strong voluntary market in Chile remains as it was, since the beginning of this decade. So that might answer why the Chilean government is pretty much more clear in order to put forward a voluntary market rather than a compulsory one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citi.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was just hoping you could comment a little bit more on what you're seeing in terms of activity in the U.S. 401(k) market, I guess, particularly around recurring deposits and RFP activity.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes, sure, Eric. This is Larry. I'll have Dan comment. I would just say broadly, we are, finally, I think 2013, to some extent, was the year of the rebound as it relates to recurring deposits. On a trailing 12 months, we've seen those that in fourth quarter, they are up about 12%, but I'll let Dan give you some color.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes. 2013, Erik, was really a solid year if you look at it from an operating earnings perspective, but more importantly, just that mix of business of small, medium and large plans. You may have noticed that we wrote a net new 1,900 plans on a full year basis, of plans of less than 1,000 employees and on plans with more than 1,000 employees. We actually increased that by 8%, and we -- on a trailing 12-month basis, improve our return on net revenue. Your primary questions around what's the outlook or 2014, and it's not that different than other years where we had a lot of volatility in the equity markets. And when we see volatility, we see the actual pipeline get smaller, less -- fewer plans going out to bid when the equity markets are performing exceedingly well or if they're incredibly volatile. So they're down slightly. So I would anticipate we could have a light first quarter sales year. But we'll have to see.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, any comments you could make on the competitive trends? And I guess any changes in strategy or pricing you're seeing from either other life insurers or the asset managers in the market?","Daniel J. Houston","I don't think there's been a significant change. As I think about the latter half of '13 and the first part of '14, the traditional players by each of the 3 market segments. One of the advantages we have is just really strong investment managed performance, getting our fair share of the slots for active asset management that serves us very well, and Jim and his team has just done a superb job giving us a good product to sell, whether it's in the DCIO space or the full service. You'll note that our results for '13, over $10 billion, that's our second best year ever. The other number I break out for you is we did another $4 billion in DCIO. So over $14 billion to that core SMB space between full service and DCIO mutual fund sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And maybe just to follow-up on Erik Bass' question, get a little bit more granular on the recurring deposits. 2013 was pretty strong year in terms of recurring deposit growth. I believe some of this was from the return of company matches. Could you just sort of talk about that dynamic, maybe on a year-on-year basis, full year, in terms of how much company net just came back and how much more room there is for runway for recurring deposit growth going into 2014?","Daniel J. Houston","Yes, good question. So...","Larry D. Zimpleman","I'll just make a quick opening comment, if I could, Seth. One of the -- and I commented on it briefly in the opening comments, but I think to your point, there is a real opportunity to see some meaningful growth in recurring deposits, primarily focused around this initiative that we broadly call retirement readiness, which is to say, in responding to the question earlier around Senator Harkin's proposal, the reality is, is that many, many -- the majority of our participants are not saving at the level they need to. And we, as a retirement provider, need to engage much more actively with each and every one of those participants, often in the workplace, in order to get their contributions up to a level that is needed. Again broadly, what you'd say is if you're not saving in kind of the double-digit range with your own contributions, you may not have a sort of retirement lifestyle that you're seeking. So today, participant deferrals are sort of in that 7.25% range, so we need to get that closer to 10%. That's going to take a lot of work. It's going to happen over time. But that gives you some sense of where that recurring deposit stream could go if you had every participant at 10% instead of a 7.25%. And then maybe with that, I'll pass to Dan for his comment.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes, just a couple of additional things to add to that, Seth. And the first one would be, just remember that we're starting to finally see some employment growth. And if we looked at the Deanna's business, which they have tracked that very closely on our group benefits business, we saw a trailing 12-month basis of a growth of about 1%. Remember, at the worst, that was shrinking. And so we're starting to see growth there, we're starting to see job ads. To Larry's point, it's about plan design as opposed to trying to continue down this path of just education, and so requiring, if you will, plan designs that would have auto enroll and auto escalate which will lead to the results that Larry described. I do anticipate that profit-sharing contributions start coming back, we saw good profits by small to medium-sized business. To your specific question about matching, we think that maybe we're about 80% back from the -- from where we were originally, from employers having a stated match in their plans. And so maybe a little bit more upside on the matching contributions. Hopefully that helps.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's great. And maybe just one follow-up on that 7.25% deferral rate. Is there any difference by plan size in terms of the contributions? Do you see small or medium size contributing less than large size or is it all pretty stable across?","Daniel J. Houston","It has more to do with actual plan designs itself. If you have an employer matching contribution, strong employer endorsements and support, you're going to get a better result, whether that's a small, medium or large plan, which, again, is why we get pretty selective and disciplined about the pricing of these plans. We've got to have the attention of the employer to support meaningful employee engagement and profit-sharing contributions, matching contributions. And then of course, sector, retail is pretty difficult, that's where you see the plan designs that aren't quite as advantageous for the plan participant. I would just call out, we continue to see growth in that not-for-profit sector. We have a large business around hospitals. Hospitals generally have pretty generous benefits and so, we again see good engagement, the high participation, high salary deferral and nice employer contributions.","Operator","Your last question will come from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","A couple follow-ups. I guess, one of the comments made, I think in a couple of questions earlier, was on the first quarter of sales outlook being a little bit light. I think it was Dan, you made that comment. What is that attributable to, do you think?","Daniel J. Houston","I think it's, a large part, just the equity market we're very strong and so there's fewer RFPs out. Now the corollary to that is we'll likely retain a lot of business because we don't see our plans being put out to bed either. So we've seen that in other periods, it's a halo effect of strong investment performance for a plan. They're probably less likely to put that out to bids, therefore the pipeline gets a little smaller. So better retention, and perhaps, a little bit lighter pipeline.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes. Mark, this is Larry. What I would say on that is if you go back look at prior calendar years, you'll see a very definite trend towards -- if you divide the year into 2 pieces, first half, second half, you see definite trends towards years where sales are lumped toward the front end or sales that are lumped toward the back end. I would say to Dan's point, I think -- we think, because of just the kind of the psychology of most plan sponsors given the strong market in 2013, we will see growth in sales at 2014, it's more likely to come in the back half of the year.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just following on. And I think, Larry, in your opening remarks, you talked about the objective of having a better balance across all plan sizes in the U.S. and you talked about in the context of margins and sales. And I guess, sitting where we're sitting, like what should we expect to see as you somewhat remix that business? I assume in the kind of small and medium, but what should we actually see?","Larry D. Zimpleman","Actually, I'll go ahead and let Dan. I'll just say that, again, we think about this again with sort of there's a kind of a small, medium, large component. Small is what we call emerging, now the medium is what we call dynamic, the large is what we call institutional. So there's different ways to look at it. You can look at it by revenue, you can look at it by AUM, so -- but I'll let Dan give you sort of what we would like to have for the breakdowns.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes. So clearly, if we can put 1\/3 at each bucket, small, medium and large, we'd be satisfied with that result. But not all plans are created equal, so on those very large plans, again, it depends upon what the employers support is and what they're looking for from Principal. And I'll give you an example. Larry cited better plan design. Well, we use Retire Secure as a way to engage that plan sponsor and plan participant to improve the outcomes of the plan. We have seen some withdrawals this year from plan sponsors that flat out wouldn't support a better plan design. And if we have to adjust the pricing, there might -- they may very well leave Principal. So again, maintaining pricing discipline, encouraging the use of Retire Secure, better plan designs, and then I would tell you again, our strong investment platform allows us to garner a larger percentage of the Principal brand funds on those platforms, and that's what's going to lead to profitable growth. We gave you a -- on the guidance call, that 27% to 29% returns, and I wouldn't alter that at this point in time. We still feel good about that as being our long-term objective.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Yes. One of the really positive points, Mark, about the performance of our block is that we continue to have about 2\/3 of the assets and about 2\/3 of deposits going into what we would call proprietary options. So that's a very, very high number, higher than, I think, needless to say, any competitor. And that's really a key to driving the kind of revenue growth and profitability that we need out of that business.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. One very quick final question. You talked about the voluntary opportunity in Chile. And I'm just curious, do you have the permissions and have you started marketing that to the Cuprum customers at this point? Or are we still trying to get that all...","Larry D. Zimpleman","I'll let Luis comment on that. Luis?","Luis E. Vald\u00e9s","The answer is certainly, yes. We can market voluntary probably to our Cuprum customers. You see right now the voluntary price which is being manufactured by Cuprum. What we are looking for right now is being able to offer and to extend that offering, offering part of our products which are being manufactured by our mutual fund platform in Chile and adding some life insurance policies as well. So the answer is, yes, that we're willing to see and we're working in order to see how we can extend and expand that offering.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Larry D. Zimpleman","Well, this is Larry. I'll make just a closing comment. Thanks to everybody for joining us on the call today. We're very, very pleased with our fourth quarter results as well as our full year 2013 results. And we think that our strategy is clearly working. I would just note, while 2014 has started off with some renewed volatility, I would remind you that we start 2014 with an asset base that's 20% above where it was 1 year ago. And we believe that our higher asset base is going to continue to drive increased revenue and operating earnings for the company during 2014. So with that, thanks, everybody for joining us. I look forward to seeing many of you on the road in the coming months. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

As we move through 2012, this record level of assets under management and momentum in net cash flows, along with stronger variable investment income, higher performance fees and less seasonality in claims, will combine to give a stronger earnings in the second half of the year.","We delivered strong sales and net cash flows in the first quarter, demonstrating our competitive advantages namely: the strength of our distribution relationships, demand for our products and service and investment expertise.","Key growth metrics from the quarter include: Full Service Accumulation sales were $3.2 billion, up 62% compared to first quarter 2011. Net cash flows of $2 billion are more than double from the year-ago quarter. Principal Funds had record sales of $3.7 billion, and record net cash flows of $1.5 billion. Principal Global Investors had record unaffiliated assets under management of $91 billion, and unaffiliated net cash flows were $3.3 billion, a strong improvement over first quarter 2011.","Reported assets under management for Principal International were $59 billion, up 22% over the year-ago quarter, and record net cash flows of $2.3 billion are up 77% over the same time last year.","In U.S. Insurance Solutions, Individual Life sales of $49 million increased 2% over strong sales in first quarter 2011. Specialty benefits premium and fees grew 5% to $354 million over the year-ago quarter. ","Behind our momentum in sales and retention is a renewed excitement across the organization. During the first quarter, I attended sales conferences in the U.S., Asia and Latin America. Enthusiasm among our teams has never been higher and the momentum is the strongest I've seen. We have a well-diversified set of businesses, we are in the right geographic markets and we have exactly the right strategy for future growth.","As we emerge from the economic crisis, we're in the strongest financial position in our history, and we continue to gain market share. We have opportunistically invested in the markets we want to be in, resulting in accelerated growth of our fee-based businesses, which creates increasing amounts of free cash flow and increased financial flexibility. We will continue to strike the right balance between growth and profitability.","Because of the new deferred acquisition cost accounting rules, there is now a clearer and direct trade-off between growth and profitability. So while increased sales hurt earnings in the short term, we believe it is the right path, which leads to higher earnings over time.","Now let me provide some additional comments on the ongoing implementation of our strategy. In Full Service Accumulation, we continue to focus on winning retirement business across small, medium and large segments.","Principal Total Retirement Suite continues to set the principal apart, and as part of a broader strategy to provide advisors and the clients they serve with leading-edge retirement programs that cannot be easily replicated by competitors.","Our strategy also includes features like auto enrollment, work site education and plan designs that encourage greater savings in support of improving individual retirement readiness.","Our independent distribution model continues to drive significant growth in retirement sales. Last quarter, we announced a new relationship with Edward Jones, which focuses on the needs of small and medium-sized businesses. We've already had good traction and have generated a retirement pipeline of more than $1 billion to date from this alliance partnership.","Our third-party administration or TPA channel is also a contributor to growth in the small to medium-sized business market with record sales in the first quarter, which are up 23% over first quarter 2011.","Principal Funds continues to drive record sales with demand for investment solutions that increase income-generating potential, limit volatility and hedge against inflation.","We've had tremendous success to date with multiple strategies, including preferred securities, high yield, global diversified income, midcap blend and target risk allocation.","We're also well positioned for future growth with investment strategies launched during the past 2 years that are focused on managing volatility and protecting purchasing power, such as our global multi-strategy and diversified real asset funds. Our global investment management capabilities and asset allocation flexibility creates strategies that when coupled with our distribution reach are clearly resonating with advisers and clients.","Strong investment performance is a leading indicator of growth for our retirement and asset management businesses. Investment performance continues to be strong, which is a differentiator for The Principal.","Recent accomplishments include 2 2012 Lipper Fund Awards for consistent multi-year performance for The Principal MidCap Blend Fund. Additionally, Finisterre, one of our recently acquired boutiques, won the 2011 Euro Hedge Magazine Emerging Market Fund of the Year. These awards and overall strong performance drive demand and mandates for our multiple boutiques. ","Moving now to Principal International, which continues to deliver very strong results. In the first quarter, we announced the acquisition of a majority stake in Claritas, a leading Brazilian retail mutual fund and asset management company. Entering the Brazilian mutual fund market has been a strategic priority for The Principal.","Claritas has a strong management team, solid investment track record and diversified distribution through financial advisors, which are all important competencies as we continue to grow our mutual fund and Asset Management business in Latin America.","The acquisition closed in early April, and we anticipate future synergies over time that will enable Claritas to expand beyond the retail mutual fund market into the institutional investor market.","As another positive development, the Malaysian government has approved a new voluntary, employer-based, defined-contribution pension system. CIMB-Principal was approved to provide solutions in this new market, demonstrating the success of our longtime foothold in Asia and the strength of our joint venture with CIMB.","The Principal's evolution to our global investment management leader with strong competitive positions in the key emerging markets for private retirement solutions has firmly taken hold. We will maintain our focus on helping growing businesses, individuals and institutional investors around the world, save for the long term, invest for growth and protect their financial well-being.","I'll close with some comments on our capital management strategy. Building on the $1.1 billion of capital deployed in 2011, we continue to actively deploy excess capital in the first quarter, demonstrating the strength of our business model to continuously create free cash flow.","In addition to the acquisition of Claritas, we announced the authorization of $100 million share repurchase and paid our first quarterly dividend to shareholders. These actions reflect our continued confidence in the strength and financial flexibility of our fee-based business model, and we remain on track to deploy $800 million to $900 million of capital in 2012.","Excess capital at the end of the first quarter was $1.6 billion, a level that's been fairly consistent over the past year. Certainly, as we came through the financial crisis, it was important to maintain a higher level of excess capital. Although excess capital levels will remain higher than precrisis levels across the industry, we expect to see our excess capital levels come down over the next couple of years.","Before I close, let me make a brief comment about one of the biggest highlights from the quarter. In February, during his visit to Iowa, I had the privilege to meet face to face with the Chinese Vice President, Xi Jinping, the expected next president of China. In his comments, Vice President Xi mentioned Principal as an example of a highly regarded company operating successfully in China. This is a strong endorsement of our efforts to expand our business in China into the enterprise annuity industry in the near future.","Finally, I encourage you to check out our 2011 year in review, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. The book highlights 10 trends that affirm the power of our strategy we put in place more than a decade ago and why I'm so confident that our best times are yet to come.","Terry?","Terrance J. Lillis","Thanks, Larry. As Larry mentioned, first quarter earnings were solid and our growth metrics continue to show momentum. This morning I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including continued solid performance in the investment portfolio; and the strength of our capital position and strong balance sheet.","And as a reminder, we adopted new DAC accounting guidance on January 1, 2012, with retrospective application. All financial information presented, including the slides for this call, reflects these changes. The impacts were in line with what we previously communicated.","First quarter 2012 operating earnings of $213 million were down 3% from a year-ago quarter. The decline is primarily due to lower variable investment income and higher distribution expenses in the first quarter.","We reported earnings per share of $0.70 for the quarter. There were a few items impacting first quarter 2012 EPS. Bank and Trust Services was negatively impacted by $0.01 primarily due to a legal settlement in the Trust company. Principal International was dampened by $0.01 on a net basis from regulatory changes to assigned lives in the Mexican AFORE business, which was partially offset by delayed expenses in Latin America.","Individual Life benefited by $0.01 from a change in prescribed accounting practice, and the Corporate segment was reduced by $0.01 from higher tax and legal expenses. Adjusting for these items, we consider the first quarter 2012 earnings per share run rate to be $0.72. ","Now let me discuss business unit results. Full Service Accumulation operating earnings at $70 million were down 4% on lower net revenue from a year-ago quarter. Pretax return on net revenue remained steady at 30% as we expected and previously communicated.","Let me make a couple of comments related to Full Service Accumulation margins. Slide 5 summarizes the leading factors impacting profitability since 2004. Factor 1, which had the largest impact, is a shift in business mix, which I'll describe in more detail in a moment.","The second factor is the current market environment, which has slowed the growth in recurring deposits. The third factor listed, growth, retention and efficiency, is one we have and will continue to influence through scale and focused execution.","Assuming these trends continue, we'd expect 2012 Full Service Accumulation net revenue to grow between 4% and 6% based upon average S&P index level of 1,400 in 2012. Additionally, we'd expect to maintain pretax return on net revenue of 30% to 32%.","Slide 6 shows how the mix of business is shifting away from general and separate account investments into mutual funds and employer securities, reducing return on assets but improving free cash flow generation.","As this business mix continues to shift and more assets are written on our mutual fund platform and are using more nondomestic equities for investments, fewer dividends are eligible for the dividend received deduction benefit.","Return on revenue measures for Full Service Accumulation are better indicators of the financial performance of the business. The bottom of Slide 6 illustrates our stable track record of driving revenues to the bottom line, even as customer preferences migrate to different asset types.","Return on revenue margins will continue to be a key focus for us.","First quarter 2012 Full Service Accumulation sales of $3.2 billion were very strong, up 62% over 2011. Looking at full year 2012, we'd expect to see Full Service Accumulation sales growth of approximately 20% over 2011.","Robust transfer of deposits and strong client retention help drive net cash flows of $2 billion, more than doubling first quarter 2011 results.","The underlying fundamentals within Full Service Accumulation continued to improve. ","The sales pipeline continues to build across all market sizes and distribution channels, and the close ratio continues to improve. We are actively executing on our strategy to win more business and gain market share.","Operating earnings for Principal Funds at $12 million in the quarter were flat compared to a year-ago quarter due to higher compensation and sales-related expenses as we invest in growing the business.","Record sales of $3.7 billion reflects strength across multiple strategies, including preferred securities, high yield, income, mid cap blend and target risk allocations.","Net cash flows of $1.5 billion were driven by particular strength in our Global Diversified Income Fund, which leverages our ability to combine multiple strategies and managers, as well as the Principal Preferred Securities Fund, managed by one of our Principal Global Investors' boutiques, Spectrum Asset Management.","Investment performance continues to be strong across asset classes and it is a differentiator for The Principal. The strong performance includes particular strength in asset allocation, where at quarter end, 93% of our target date and target risk funds were ranked by Morningstar in the top half on a 1-year basis, 94% on a 3-year basis and 73% on a 5-year basis.","Individual Annuities operating earnings in the first quarter 2012 were $33 million, down $3 million from a year-ago quarter, due to lower net investment income and a higher tax rate. As the low interest rate environment persists, Individual Annuities will be subject to spread compression.","Bank and Trust Services earnings decreased to $6 million, primarily due to a legal settlement in the trust company. First quarter 2012 earnings from Principal Global Investors were $16 million, down 2% from a year-ago quarter on a 6% increase in average assets under management.","With a focus on growing our global investment management leadership footprint, we headed distribution and investment staff across our boutiques. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax margin of 21.1% was down slightly from fourth quarter at 21.4%.","On a full year basis, we would expect pretax margin expansion in 2012 driven by higher profits from performance fees in the second half of the year.","Unaffiliated net cash flows for the quarter were $3.3 billion, driven by positive flows into our variety of asset classes, including currency, real estate, stable value and equities.","We see rising client interest in awarding new mandates for capabilities from our multiple boutiques. In first quarter 2012, new mandates awarded totaled $3.8 billion.","Pipelines continue to build and the representative offices in The Netherlands and Dubai are now staffed and operational, giving us continued optimism for the remainder of 2012.","Moving to Principal International, operating earnings at $42 million include a one-time loss from the regulatory change impacting Mexican AFORE assigned lives, which was partially offset by delayed expenses in our Latin American operations.","Assets under management were $59 billion at quarter end, up 22% from a year ago, primarily driven by strong net customer cash flow and a strategic acquisition.","Current quarter record net cash flow of $2.3 billion were driven by a 24% increase in Brazil prev deposits over last year and positive flows in Asia. While the underlying growth of the companies on a local basis remain strong, so far in the second quarter, we're facing headwinds from foreign currency exchange rates and slowing inflation.","As a reminder, our financial supplement now includes foreign exchange rate information used for financial reporting to help you better analyze the impact of exchange rates on Principal International.","In April, we closed on the Claritas acquisition and approximately $2.5 million of after-tax transaction costs will impact second quarter Principal International results. The acquisition is expected to be EPS-neutral in 2012 and accretive thereafter.","Individual Life first quarter operating earnings were $32 million. During the quarter, we changed our method of accounting for reinsurance contracts, and this change was included in our recast results released on April 10. Under the new method, we will recognize reinsurance recoveries as they are received, which creates better alignment between accounting and economic results.","Additionally, according to prescribed accounting practices, we changed the amortization basis for certain Individual Life policies. This change impacted several income statement line items that netted to a $3 million benefit for first quarter earnings. These accounting changes will result in a more intuitive earnings pattern for Individual Life. We believe the run rate for Individual Life operating earnings is approximately $30 million per quarter with variability in any one quarter.","Turning to Specialty Benefits, first quarter operating earnings were $19 million, down $4 million from a year-ago quarter, primarily due to stronger-than-normal investment performance in 2011. The decline in sequential earnings was due to normal seasonality and dental claims. We continue to experience stable loss ratios.","Although first quarter sales were down from our record results in 2011, retention results were strong and premium and fees grew 5% from a year-ago quarter. Continued recovery in employment and salary trends were the main drivers of that results.","The Corporate segment reported an operating loss of $39 million, driven by higher tax and legal expenses. Going forward, due to higher ongoing regulatory expense, we expect quarterly operating losses for the Corporate segment of $30 million to $35 million in 2012.","For the quarter, total company net income was $202 million, an increase of 11% over a year-ago quarter. A key contributor to the improvement in net income was a continued reduction in after-tax credit-related losses to $26 million. Our investment-related losses continue to be in line or better than our loss projections and better-than-market expectations, reflecting sustainable recovery in commercial real estate. This improvement has given us additional financial flexibility.","Moving to our balance sheet, our net unrealized capital gains position of $1.9 billion increased $300 million from fourth quarter 2011, predominantly due to tighter credit spreads.","As a reminder, due to our strong asset liability management, changes in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest rate movement do not result in an economic impact and do not force us to sell assets. In late February, we announced a $100 million share buyback authorization and completed half of it during the quarter. As of today, we've completed 80% of that authorization.","Looking now at capital adequacy, we estimate our first quarter risk-based capital ratio to be 440%. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $1.6 billion of total access capital, with approximately $600 million of the excess capital at the holding company.","Slide 7 illustrates our recent pattern of return on equity. Current operating earnings are in line with precrisis levels, yet average equity is 34% higher. We are holding considerably higher amounts of excess capital as compared to precrisis levels. As Larry mentioned, higher capital levels are here to stay for us and for the industry.","But as our business model becomes more fee-based, we plan to reduce our excess capital of $1.6 billion to our targeted capital reserve currently at $1.15 billion over the next couple of years. For 2012, we feel that an RBC ratio of 425%, 435% is appropriate given our mix of fee-based and risk-based products. Our long-term expected annual return on equity accretion continues to be 50 to 80 basis points.","As outlined on Slide 8, so far in 2012, we have allocated $220 million of capital for strategic acquisition, opportunistic share repurchase and the quarterly common stock dividend.","And as Larry mentioned, we expect to deploy $800 million to $900 million in capital in 2012. We believe our decision to move to a quarterly common stock dividend and our overall capital deployment actions demonstrate our commitment to creating long-term value for shareholders.","Before I close, I want to take a moment to comment on a couple of things that Larry's too humble to mention. First, if you haven't seen it yet, check out the April issue of Institutional Investor Magazine. The magazine did an in-depth and very positive cover profile of Principal's 132-year transformation from a small life insurance company to a global investment management leader. The cover article highlights the leadership team, past and present, at The Principal.","Additionally, Larry was recently honored as this year's Plan Sponsor Magazine Lifetime Achievement Award Recipient for his extraordinary contributions to the retirement industry. As a company, we're all proud of Larry's commitment to the company and to the industry and congratulate him on this distinguished award.","In closing, we're very pleased with the continued growth and momentum of our businesses as we look into 2012 and beyond. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Joanne Smith with Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","I guess, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the strong sales results in your FSA operation. They far exceeded my expectations, and I'm just wondering if you could talk about the trends there?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Joanne, this is Larry. I'll let Dan comment. But what I would say at a very high level is that we're really in a very nice sweet spot in terms of our retirement sales. And I say that based on, of course, having great distribution presence and continuing strong pipeline. We also have, because of PGI, we have very solid investment performance to present to clients. And of course, the unique bundling that we do around total retirement services, as well as a lot of or worksite activities, really does put us in a strong competitive position. I'll let Dan give you some of the specifics.","Daniel J. Houston","Thanks, Larry. So Joanne, a couple of stats that you might find interesting. The growth really was across emerging dynamic and institutional, which is the way we like to see it. We did have 7 nice-sized institutional plans come in. Those were plans over $100 million but nothing over $1 billion. So again, this speaks right at that lower end of large and high-end of medium-sized marketplace. We had good traction again continuance and the third-party administration area. About 40% of the sales for the quarter were TRS or Total Retirement Suite some combination of DVDC or non-qualified or ESOP. And alliance sales were up roughly 120% from first quarter of 2011, as Larry mentioned in his earlier comments. We did add Edward Jones, which is a really great partner for PFG, and we're looking forward to working with the people at Edward Jones.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","Just as a follow up, just on the ROAs. You mentioned in the beginning of the call that the change in DAC induces a trade-off between good sales numbers and near-term earnings. Can you give us an estimate as to how much the increase -- or decrease in capitalized acquisition expenses impacted the ROA?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Joanne, this is Larry. I would say, it impacts at about $15 million to $20 million in terms of quarterly earnings, so you can sort of work it out from that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Larry, even if I apply a relatively strong ramp to your earnings for the remainder of the year, it appears pretty difficult to get to your guidance. But interestingly, your guidance had originally assumed, I think, an average S&P of about 1275, and that average is already year-to-date 100 points higher. I guess the question is, where is the weakness versus your original expectations when -- I would've expected your business model and leverage to equity markets to frankly be a nice tailwind.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Sure, John. This is Larry. Let me make a few comments. And what I would say here is a very general comment before I walk through a little bit of detail with you. What I would is say is that guidance is based on a full year. And I'd say, it would be very important to remember that things that happen over the course of a full year don't happen in 25% increments over each quarter, okay? So for example, a variable investment income, as an example. Last year, that was a little bit front-loaded. This year, we expect it to be a little bit back-loaded. You have seasonality in Specialty Benefits, as we've commented before. The general comment you might see specialty benefits first quarter earnings be 20% of the full year earnings, not 25%. So what I would say is if you sort of take Terry's normalized, the $0.72, you ramp it up to 2% to 3% that you'd expect so based in our assumptions of equity market growth. That gets you very near the $2.95 to $3 level. You then adjust for things like variable investment income, specialty benefits. You adjust for the change in share count. And you are, if you will, well inside our previously communicated guidance. Having said all of that, we obviously don't update that guidance, and it really doesn't take into account, John, at all, the very strong asset accumulation and net cash flow growth that we saw in the first quarter, which obviously hasn't yet fed through to financials because it's just received in the current quarter. And as the market stays steady and that continues to repeat itself in subsequent quarters, that's going to be a very significant tailwind on earnings as we go into the subsequent quarters of 2012. So like always, there's a number of assumptions in there. But the key thing, I would continue to remind everybody is things don't happen in 1\/4 increments every year. There's front loads, there's back loads. All that's taken into account when we gave our guidance back in December.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. I have one separate one, and that is, are you and the Board giving any consideration to changing your approach to setting your buyback authorization? I asked this, Larry, because obviously with your current approach, you were out of the market for the first 2 months of the year. And that clearly has at least, at the margin, a negative impact on your ability to generate EPS and ROE improvement at a somewhat faster pace.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Right. So that's an interesting question, John. And I suspect that every management team you talk to might have a little bit different view on share repurchase in the era post the financial crisis. I think we have tried to communicate over several different times, including at our earnings guidance for 2012 that we see share repurchase now as a more opportunistic lever for us. And we frankly see higher levels of common stock dividend as a more regular level -- lever for us to return capital to shareholders. So we see ourselves moving to higher payout ratios over time, and we see ourselves moving to somewhat lower levels of share repurchase over time because we do want to invest in the businesses. And to the extent we would do share repurchase, we would look at that based on sort of our view of the intrinsic value of the shares versus where they're trading at. So in the past, I think share repurchase for many companies has been more of a \"automatic lever.\" And in our case, we're really trying to not see as much capital return in share repurchase and we're trying to be more thoughtful to make sure that we're doing share repurchase at the right times and that we're not doing it at the wrong times. So I hope that helps a little bit.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That does. I guess, my only follow up to that, Larry, would be, I'm not necessarily asking you to put up an authorization that would be a giant number that covers the potential buybacks over a couple of years. But I'm not sure I understand why not just an authorization that would cover at least your expectations for a 12-month period, let's say?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Right. And again, a lot of that, John, is because I think we are trying to recognizing the changing nature of our business model with more fee-based earnings. I would argue that it's much more appropriate for us as a management team and a Board to think about returning capital to shareholders in the form of common stock dividends more than share repurchases. What you already know from things we've communicated is that somewhere between 65% and 70% of our operating earnings for the year are going to be able to flow through as capital deployed back to shareholders based on whatever amount of M&A we might do. So I don't have to sit and really give you a large share repurchase. I mean, investors already know that the vast majority of our earnings are able to be returned to shareholders. So we've shown in the past, we're good stewards of our capital. Again, the thing I would want to communicate is that it's going to be done more as common stock dividends and higher payout ratios. That's appropriate because we moved to a more fee-based business model, and that's very different than our competitors, where perhaps they're able to return 40% or 50% of their earnings back to shareholders. In our case, that number is closer to 65% to 70%.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess, I wanted to go back to Joanne's question, Larry. I think you give a number of $15 million to $20 million. I actually have the same question regarding what FSA would have looked like were it not for the high sales number. And I want to make sure that I understand your answer correct. So if I look at FSA as kind of pretax earnings of $80 million, are you suggesting that the number would've been $15 million to $20 million higher, were it not been for the change in the accounting or the extraordinary sales? Can you just give us a feel for exactly what you meant by that comment?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes. I'm sorry if I confused you, Mark. This is Larry. What I was trying to communicate and answer to Joanne's question was really a more generic question, not answering a question related to the level of sales in the first quarter. I was answering the generic question about what impact we would expect to see to FSA from the change in DAC accounting guidance. So that was the question that I was answering. Does that help?","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","It does but I think it also kind of brings a follow up, which is obviously, you had strong sales in the quarter, good flows in FSA. But I think most of us, including myself, were a little bit surprised that in a market that rallied as much as it had, the ROAs were kind of maybe not as high as maybe we would've expected. So to the extent that there's some of that can be attributed to the change in the accounting and higher cost that occurred this quarter relative to what we would expect to be a normalized cost based on that flow level, it would be helpful to understand kind of how to quantify that number so we can think about that and how we think about ROAs..","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Right. You're exactly right. While there was some positive benefit FSA in this quarter, it wasn't as great because of the DAC accounting as it would have been under the prior set of rules. So maybe I'll see if Terry wants to comment a little bit about that.","Terrance J. Lillis","Mark, this is Terry. As you look at the change in the accounting rule, there's less capitalization that's going on, and there's also less amortizations because of the $3.2 billion of sales, you're also seeing more of the expense incurred in the current period than you had in the previous accounting. Now what we gave as guidance for the year was an impact of around $35 million to $45 million of operating earnings impact due to the change in the accounting rules. Now we said a little bit over half of that was due to Full Service Accumulation. So that's basically in line. So if you look at the upper end of that range, $40 million to $45 million impact, you would expect about $20 million or $24 million or $25 million due to FSA alone. Now you take 1\/4 of that, but as Larry says, it doesn't always occur throughout the year. So you're probably getting a number that's more in the $5 million, $6 million after-tax impact on this quarter because of, once again, lower capitalization and lower amortization.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, I guess, following up on an John Nadel's question. I guess, the focus really is on generating greater pre-cash flow and capital. Why not have a larger outstanding buyback program to be in the market more opportunistically? So I guess, today's kind of the perfect example where you have $20 million left and the stock is off 6%. I think we now need to wait until mid-May to get another authorization?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Right. Chris, this is Larry. Again, what I would say is that and certainly, we're well aware of some other companies that will announce the potential, the potential for a large multi-year share repurchases. And what I would say is, first of all, I don't think that that's necessarily an approach that as a Board that they necessarily gotten comfortable with. We've tried to take an alternative, which is to recognize that there is a substantial free cash flow generation capability here. And we've now again tried to refine that further by recognizing that there are times that your shares are outside of what you would consider to be the intrinsic value. If we saw an extended period where that was the case, not one day but if we saw an extended period where that were the case, we'd certainly be in position to be able to execute a share buyback. But our focus in terms of capital deployment, our focus really is more on moving to a higher payout ratio over time and continuing to invest in the business as we need to. So again, the fact that we've done 4 acquisitions in the last year exactly in the spot we want and there's always some level of sort of pipeline around M&A that you'd want to be in position to execute on I think makes them, and I completely agree with this, would make me cautious about wanting to promise too much, too far into the future. So that's the reason that we've gone the way we have. And I think that's definitely the route that we'll continue to operate with.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Understand that. I guess, as volatile as things still are today, sometimes the opportunities are there at a present time and if you just can't be in the market when things maybe are a bit more rational, just sometimes can be confusing for investors, but I'll leave it there. And the next thing just in terms of, I guess, the trends in terms of number of plans with NDC? You had some pretty good momentum there on a sequential basis. I want to see kind of what your thoughts are around that moving forward?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Sure. Dan, you want to comment?","Daniel J. Houston","Yes. We feel good about that. Thanks for noticing that, Chris. So up a couple of hundred plans, and this is to the credit of the team primarily run that the emerging and dynamic area, may take the necessary steps the better job retaining business. There's also fewer plans being terminated. So we're holding onto those plans and then there's actually been some movement towards startup plans again. So we all keep our fingers crossed that we've kind of bottomed out here in terms of the economic fallout and the negative impact it's had on qualified retirement plan. Pipeline is up double-digit for both emerging and dynamic. It's a little bit flat for institutional but that tends to be a little bit lumpy to begin with. So again, the pipelines are very good and close ratios are very solid. So to your point, we feel good about our ability to grow these plans going forward.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last quick one on foreign exchange. I guess with international growing as quickly as it is, Terry, you made the comment around some is some FX headwinds here in 2Q. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about potentially hedging of foreign currency?","Terrance J. Lillis","Chris, this is Terry. We've looked at the possibility of that. But you'll see volatility in any hedging that you do, as well as the volatility and the exchange rate. And there's an additional cost associated with that, that at this point in time, we don't know if we're getting that much more value out of it, but we'll continue to look at it. As in the past, what we've seen is PI as a smaller percentage of our earnings but now it's in that 17%, 18% range and moving up to a larger range. We'll take that into consideration in the future, but at this point in time, we're not providing that hedging of that currency, but we are providing in the financial supplement more detailed as to what the average we're using on a quarterly basis, as well as the spot yield at the end of the period of time. So it gives you more insights as to what the impact will be based upon the different currencies and the different locations that we're doing business.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","A question on capital deployment. You disclosed that you allocated $220 million in the quarter and $56 million of dividend, $50 million to buyback. Can we assume the rest is for Claritas?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","This is Larry. I think the Claritas was roughly $65 million.","Terrance J. Lillis","Randy, this is Terry. The $220 million includes the full authorization of $100 million, and if you actually look, what was deployed was $50 million of it.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. So Claritas is around $65 million? And can you disclose what level of assets under management you acquired in the deal? It said it was majority stake. We're just looking for a little more clarification on what was acquired for that $65 million.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Sure, I'll let Luis comment.","Luis Valdez","Okay. The size of that operation is about $2 billion total AUMs, and we acquired 60% of that, the total ownership of that.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Does that help, Randy?","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","It does. Just one last one on that is, what is the -- is it fixed income, more equities, or just asset type?","Luis Valdez","It is much more equity and balance funds rather than fixed income.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Balance funds. One of the reasons that we had specifically identified Claritas was because they actually had a slightly --  they had a different portfolio than most mutual fund managers in Brazil. As you probably know, most mutual fund managers are, as you said, invested in not only fixed income but primarily sovereign debt. So again, Claritas is relatively unique because they've demonstrated competency across several different asset classes within the Brazilian sort of security space. So it was very attractive from that perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I want to revisit one more time the FSA -- the effect of sales on FSA without discussing ASU 2010-26, just forget about that. Are we looking at the situation similar maybe to some asset managers where a high level of sales leads to very high expenses before earnings can really come in off of the assets? Is that the situation that we're looking at here?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Okay, Stephen, this is Larry. I'm going to stay away this time and I'll let Dan clean it up for you.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes, I think that's exactly right. As we've changed they come to methodology, our Full Service Accumulation, even for group annuity contracts, which has separate accounts as well, will start to reflect -- look more like our mutual fund sales our Principal Advantage product, and that's actually from our perspective a good thing. So we're certainly seeing higher expense as a result of acquiring those. But as long as I'm on that same topic, I was kind of looking closely at where else are we making the investments over and above last year. So what would cause these expenses, where aer we making investments? One is around mobile applications. One is around expense and fee disclosure, which was a significant investment here in the first quarter. Increasing the size of our sales and service teams. We're continuing to build out the size of that ESOP practice and defined benefit capabilities. We're making additional investment in our product development areas as Larry and Terry both commented about the growth in those diversified real asset and real income mutual fund solutions. Allianz Management, we're continuing to build out that team as we added additional Allianz partners. We've got to build out relationship managers to go along with that. Income solutions, this isn't just about the accumulation business so we've got to continue to make those investments around how we're going to help those in nearing retirement and then retirement, draw down those funds. And again, there's a lot of time and resources being spent there. We still think that the workplace is a great place to educate plan participants on the need to save for retirement. And where some of our competitors have pulled back, we've actually bulked up on our deployment of our workplace efforts. And then lastly, you keep hearing us talk about the TPA initiative. That also requires a lot of resources. Some of the expense lines are up only modestly, and at the same time, you can see we've got a lot of work to do. And that's partially to offset some of the erosion that you've all witnessed in the past on changes that are taking place relative to mix of business, as well as this economic headwind that we continue to fight. The other line worth noting there was the recurring deposits are really showing now a nice solid comeback. They're not back to that pre-crisis level, but again, we think that's going to be a nice contributing factor to operating earnings going forward. Hopefully that helps.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That was good. That's really what I wanted to get at with that question. Just a follow up, since you mentioned it, fee disclosure. Any new thoughts on that and how that might affect the company and the business?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes. So the 408(b), which is a component relative to notification to the plan sponsors, we started back in November of '11. That's effectively completed at this point in time. The 404(a) is the part that goes to the plan participant. That'll happen after July 1 within those first 60 days. And where the majority of our education specialists and relationship managers are spending their time right now isn't on the absolute dollar of the fees. Those decisions have been made. That's water on the bridge. Now the discussion is pointed towards how does Principal help the plan sponsors go about educating plan participants on behalf of the plan sponsors on what those fees are. So there's a little bit of work. Some employers are making decisions to start paying some of those fees separately. Some of them are revising the investment lineup, that they're making available. So that's where a lot of our time is spent. And I would tell you that certainly by the fall time, we will have fee disclosure really in our rearview mirror at that point.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But on existing plans at current customers that you currently have, the plan sponsors, their change in behavior has neither been negative or positive for the company. Is that...","Larry Donald Zimpleman","That's correct. There's a few on the edges where as long as we're reviewing expenses, they might put it out for a check bid. But I would say, for all intents and purposes, this discussion has now migrated to how we go about rolling it out to the participant more so than the employer going back and forth with PFG.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one for Terry, if I may. Terry, the historical kind of guidance had been for every 2% move in the S&P 500, it was probably 1% move for EPS for Principal. Is there a relationship that we could look at maybe for that net revenue number?","Terrance J. Lillis","Steven, just to clarify, we talked about a 10% shock in the equity market, up or down and then followed by a 2% increase on a quarter-by-quarter basis from there would have a 4% to 6% impact on operating earnings. And that was a pre-DAC change guidance. And we think it's very comparable, but we'll give you more clarity on that as we see it play out. In terms of the net revenue growth, the net revenue growth, I think, is probably -- will lag the growth in the assets under management a bit because of the types of assets that don't all have the same net revenue. But we monitor the net revenue growth on each of our different businesses. And that's why we look at margin, a return on that net revenue by each of the businesses. Now if you look at, and what we've said in Full Service Accumulation, for example, we think that the net revenue growth will trend pretty stable, and the stability is in that 30 to 32 basis points -- excuse me, 30% to 32% range for that. But we also look at it the total company and it's really a relationship between the net revenue and the expenses that we really monitor very closely by each of the different product types.","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Barth with RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I realized that there was a lot going on here. That's apparent. Between return on assets, return on net revenues, return on revenues, the DAC accounting, you'd have to be a partner at Deloitte to understand what's going on here. All I know is that for a business, any businesses earnings to grow sustainably at a healthy rate, there's got to be revenue growth. There has to be in any business revenue growth. At least this is my view. And so my question is this, even if you add back, absent the variable income that you didn't have, it looks like there wasn't much revenue growth or net revenue growth. Again, even if you add back the variable income to the -- business, this despite the fact that you have respectable asset growth. And so while I do have a second question for Jim on PGI, what I'd like to know is, what is holding back, putting aside all this other stuff about margins and accounting changes, what is holding back the revenue growth even if you adjust for the absence of that variable income given the strong asset growth that you had? And when can we expect the revenue growth and why?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes. Well, Eric, this is Larry and again, I'll take a shot at this and look at Dan and Terry to clean it up. But for what I would say is if you just focus on sort of first quarter over first quarter, the net revenue would look relatively flat despite the AUM growth, okay? The average account value would be up about 6%. The net revenue would be about flat. The reason that you don't see more net revenue growth, and again, I want to emphasize, this just a very short look quarter-over-quarter. The reason that don't see the revenue growth equal to the asset growth for that particular comparison is for 2 things: One is the variable income that we've talked about before in first quarter '11, we had a fairly substantial amount of variable investment income in the form of real estate sales that was distributed out to the business units as additional investment income that was there in 2011, not there in 2012. The second factor that impacts the revenue is that again, if you will, investor sentiment, investor choice is moving away from guaranteed accounts and is moving towards fee-based accounts. From an investor perspective, that's a good thing. That's a good thing. That is moving towards fee-based accounts. So ROA can be down, okay, ROA can be down but free cash flow is actually up. And again, the primary reason, if you just took quarter-over-quarter, which I would encourage everyone not to do because that's too short a period to determine trends, but that is more tied to the issues around the variable investment income. So you will see net revenue growth. We've said before, we sort of expect at this point, net revenue growth will be in that 4% to 6% range. And so now the question about seeing growth in FSA earnings will come down to that point that I talked about in my comments and that Dan commented on in the earlier question. It's a point of, do we still feel we need to selectively invest in the business because we have an opportunity to grab substantial market share and we're investing for the long-term health of the business. So how many of those investments do we have to make in 2012? Or would we rather put all of that into your earnings growth and the answer is, it will be some of both. So we'll see net revenue growth, we'll see some earnings growth, but net revenue is going to trail assets under management because of these investor shift differences.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question to Jim. Jim, I certainly understand, congratulations to you on what looks like one of the quarters in sometime in terms of net flows. I know you're making these acquisitions, growing your business very successfully but here to, we didn't see earnings growth and I understand that you're investing in your business. How long will these investments sort of last? Will some of these costs go away? And are you -- relatedly, are you dependent on these performance fees to show earnings growth?","James Patrick McCaughan","Okay. Thank you, Eric. There's quite a few pieces to this, to the answer to that question. As we've said, there are number of accounting issues in the first quarter that make the earnings look worse than I think the underlying performance of the business. We've talked about the tax charge being anomalously high. There was a catch up of a few hundred thousand dollars in incentive comp pull in the first quarter, whereas the previous year, there have been a release for the PFG overhead and security benefits. If you take those things out, though, the numbers for Principal Global Investors underlying are that first quarter 2012 versus 2011 saw a 6% increase in assets under management with a 10% increase in revenue. So revenues in the institutional business actually is slightly richer, very slightly richer relative to assets and with expenses up 7%. And that increase in expenses in a way is higher than you think it would be if you were looking at the operational leverage in the business. That's where the investment is. And Terry mentioned Amsterdam and Dubai. There's also other areas. Those are not the only places we're investing. We have put more people in China, for example, this year compared with last. These are looking to the growth over the next 3 to 5 years. And really, I think what I'm saying here is by putting on significant assets under management at a time of change in the investment management business, when a lot of other players are seeing big outflows, we can build a lot of long-term shareholder value. Now as to your question or when will this really show through to earnings, 1.5 years ago, at Investor Day, I really talked about improving the pretax margin on Principal Global Investors towards 30%, which I regard as a really sort of good industry benchmark over a 5-year period. It may look with the growth we've seen and with margins continuing to be a little bit laggard as if we're a bit behind schedule on that. We're probably ahead of the schedule that we set 1.5 years ago in terms of flows in AUM. But I think all in all, I feel that, that 30% pretax margin remains the target. And I'd really like to try and achieve that 5 years from the initial time that we set it, which was 1.5 years ago. I hope that puts it in context for you, Eric.","Eric N.

As John mentioned, slides related to today\u2019s call are on our website, slide four outlines the themes for the call.","The Principal achieved strong results across our businesses in the first quarter with record total company operating earnings of $317 million. Coming off record operating earnings in 2013 the momentum in our businesses continues despite persistent headwinds including a low interest rate environment and a strengthening U.S. dollar. The ongoing success proves our ability to execute the relevancy of our strategy and the power of our diversified business model. Strong earnings growth is continuing to increase return on equity which expanded to 13% at quarter end a 90 basis point increase year-to-date. As we\u2019ve communicated we expect to once again achieve at least a 15% return on equity within the next few years despite the impact of historically low interest rates in the U.S.","Results this quarter continue to reflect strong underlying fundamentals as momentum continues across our businesses. We continue to win and retain business because of our strong investment performance, our ability to provide outcome oriented solutions, excellent customer service and the diversity and strength of our distribution partnerships. Total company assets under management were a record $496 billion at quarter end and total company quarterly net cash flows were $4.8 billion. Following our additional key growth metrics from the quarter, full service accumulation sales were $2.7 billion and net cash flows were $1.8 billion. Margins in this business continue to improve in part because of our efforts to achieve better balance across all plan sizes. We are achieving the combination of good growth and attractive margins that reflect our leadership in this business.","Principal Funds sales were $4.5 billion for the quarter, net cash flows were $760 million, this is the 17th straight quarter of positive net cash flows in Principal Funds reflecting strong investment performance and our ability to offer solutions that financial advisors and retail investors seek.","Principal Global investors ended first quarter with record total assets under management of $298 billion including record unaffiliated assets under management of $112 billion. First quarter total net cash flows were $1.1 billion and unaffiliated net cash flows were $100 million. Principal International, assets under management of $109 billion at the end of first quarter was also a record. Net cash flows for the quarter were $2 billion.","Suppress market conditions in Brazil negatively impacted net cash flows at the beginning of first quarter, but flows rebounded to normal levels by the end of the quarter, Individual Life\u2019s business market focus continues to be a differentiator for us with 58% of full year sales from non-qualified deferred compensation and business owner and executive solutions.","The increased activity in a non-qualified market reflects enhanced confidence among business owners as the economy recovers. Specialty benefits premium and fees were up 5% from the year ago quarter and loss ratios continue to stay within our desired range.","In total we had a strong start to 2014 and we remained optimistic for the full year as leading indicators such as investment performance and sales pipeline continue to be very solid. Next I\u2019ll provide a few updates on the continued execution of our strategy. Our diversified business model is extremely well suited for the world aging population and emerging market middle class growth.","We remain committed to helping business owners, individuals and investors around the world achieve financial security and success. In full service accumulation, we\u2019ve added nearly 1,500 plans in the past 12 months. This not only helps drive growth in recurring deposits, which increase 10% on a trailing 12 months basis, but we also have the opportunity to educate more plan participants about the importance of preparing for retirement. With more than 1 billion people over the age of 60 worldwide and that number expected to double by 2025, there has never been a more critical time to promote financial literacy and retirement readiness.","Our new Principal Plan Works program was introduced to help plan sponsors and advisors improve participant retirement outcomes. Through this program we have delivered thousands of retirement readiness reports to help raise awareness about income replacement needs, encourage effective plan design and positively impact participant savings behavior.","As mentioned earlier and as slide five shows, investment performance remains strong and is a leading indicator of growth for our retirement and investment management businesses. Principal Funds currently has 17, four and five star funds as ranked by Morningstar and we expect that number to increase over the next six months. Principal Funds was once again recognized by Lipper in March.","The Principal Global Real Estate Securities Fund ranked number 1 for its consistently strong performance. This important third party recognition validates our ability to offer high quality investment options to investors.","REITs will continue to attract assets in the future due to their above average yield. Principal International had record operating earnings in the quarter. Cuprum continues to be a meaningful contributor to earnings and as we said last quarter, we consider the acquisition complete and are now moving into the second stage of integration. With regular deposits from the mandatory retirement markets in Chile and Mexico, combined with upside potential from growing voluntary savings opportunities, our Latin America businesses remain in excellent position for continued growth.","As another example of our strong position in Latin America, in April assets under management in BrazilPrev, our joint venture with Banco Brasil reached R$90 billion, which equates to approximately $41 billion in U.S. dollars.","On a local basis, the compound annual growth rate of BrazilPrev assets under management has been 32% for the past five years, because of their focus on asset retention BrazilPrev is the market leader with more than 60% of total net flows in the Brazilian retirement market over the past 12 months.","It is important to understand that due to the expertise of our team in Principal International businesses in our select emerging markets are performing well on a local level. The strong fundamentals of these businesses, our proven ability to execute and our relationship with premier partners allow us to weather short-term volatility including foreign currency movements to achieve long-term growth.","Principal Global Investors continues to build scale in the business which is driving margin expansion. Trailing 12 month pretax margin was 25.2%, an increase of 180 basis points over the same period last year. Principal Global Investors\u2019 multi-boutique business model with our diversified investment platforms combined with the strength of a share distribution capability allows us to maintain positive net cash flows as client demands shift. This along with our strong investment performance and a robust pipeline, gives us confidence for continued growth and margin expansion.","An important part of our overall strategy is to provide a better experience for advisors and customers to increase operational efficiency and to drive productivity through innovative uses of technology. The Principal was recently recognized in this regard by InformationWeek for the 17th year as a top business technology innovator in the U.S.","I\u2019ll close with some comments on capital management. With record operating earnings and strong net income, we remain well positioned to increase shareholder value through a variety of capital deployment options. In the first quarter, we paid a $0.28 per share common stock dividend and bought back more than $72 million of shares outstanding.","Additionally last night, we announced a $0.32 per share a common stock dividend payable in the second quarter of 2014. This 14% increase over the first quarter dividend demonstrates confidence in our ability to grow fee based earnings and generate higher percentages of deployable capital. We remain focused on increasing our dividend payout ratio to our target of 40% on a growing net income base.","Finally, there is an active M&A pipeline that includes opportunities to further enhance our global investment management expertise. Our fee based business model allows us to generate deployable capital and strategically deploy it to create long-term value for shareholders.","Before I close, I want to mention one other recognition that Principal recently received. For the 12th consecutive year, Principal Financial Group was named one of the top companies for executive women by the National Association for Female Executives. We share their commitment to women succeeding in their careers and we are honored to receive this recognition.","In closing, we are very confident that the execution of our strategy and diversified business model will continue to enhance shareholder value. Terry?","Terry Lillis","","Thanks Larry. The first quarter results were a strong start to the year. While earnings were aided by one-time items that I will address shortly, our strong business fundamentals and proven ability to execute are driving continued momentum. This morning I will focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter, net income including performance on the investment portfolio, and I will close with an update on capital deployment.","Total operating earnings of $317 million for the quarter were up 36% over first quarter 2013 results. Net revenues increased 13% over the year ago quarter while operating expenses only increased 4%. This led to strong earnings growth and margin expansion. Total company assets under management increased to $496 billion at quarter end.","Excluding the corporate segment, 67% of the company\u2019s earnings in the quarter were from our fee based business. These fee based earnings come from higher multiple businesses that put less pressure on our balance sheet and provide more free cash flow.","We strongly believe that our current business mix provides the right diversification for continued growth. At quarter end, our returning on equity excluding AOCI was 13%, this is a 320 basis point improvement compared to a year ago. Organic growth contributed a 130 basis points of that increase. The remainder came from the addition of Cuprum and the negative impact of the actuarial assumption review in 2012. We believe that an ROE of 13% driven mostly by operating earning expansion rather than just capital deployment is a strong result. We continue to expect 50 to 80 basis points of annual ROE expansion into the future.","Looking at slide six, first quarter 2014 operating earnings per share was a $1.06, a 34% increase when compared to a year ago quarter. As noted on the slide, we normalized first quarter 2014 earnings for three items.","In Full Service Accumulation results benefited by $15 million, predominantly from a true up of a prior year dividend accrual. In addition, RIS Guaranteed operating earnings were helped by $6 million from higher than expected variable investment income.","These benefits were partially offset by higher than expected claims in Individual Life which hurt earnings by $4 million in the quarter. Combining these items, we believe that the normalized earnings per share for the quarter was approximately $1, a 28% increase on an adjusted basis.","Now I\u2019ll discuss business unit results. Starting with the accumulation businesses within retirement investor services, operating earnings were $185 million, an increase of 30% over the year ago quarter.","As shown on slide seven, net revenue was up 12% over first quarter 2013 and 14% on a trailing 12-month basis. Trailing 12-month pre-tax return on net revenue improved to 33%. Quarterly operating earnings for Full Service Accumulation at $119 million were up 38% from a year ago quarter.","As I mentioned, the current period was helped by $15 million most of which was a true-up on a prior year dividend accrual. As a reminder, the year ago quarter benefited from an $8 million dividend accrual true-up. Excluding the true-ups from both quarters, earnings were still up more than 30%.","Net revenue was up 13% due to the growth in the business and the strong equity market performance, while operating expenses were only up 4%. As a result, the trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue for the business unit improved to 33%.","Full Service Accumulation sales at $2.7 billion for the quarter were strong as we continue to focus on striking the appropriate balance of growth and profitability. Net cash flows for Full Service Accumulation were $1.8 billion for the quarter. Large case withdrawals can be lumpy and we did not have any in the first quarter.","We still expect net flows for the year to be 1% to 3% at beginning of year account value. Principal Funds operating earnings were $25 million for the quarter, a 31% increase from the year ago quarter as the strong sales over the last several years are translating into bottom line results.","On a trialing 12-month basis, revenue was up 21% and operating margins continue to improve due to the scale based nature of the business. For the quarter, Principal Funds\u2019 sales were $4.5 billion, contributing to $760 million of net cash flows. While down from very strong year ago quarter, these results were solid relative to the industry.","Individual Annuities first quarter operating earnings were up 17% to $34 million. Increased fee revenue in our variable annuity business due to market appreciation has more than offset spread compression on our fixed deferred block of business. As macroeconomic factors improve, we expect Individual Annuities earnings to be around this level going forward.","Slide eight covers the guaranteed businesses within Retirement and Investor Services. First quarter operating earnings of $32 million were up 13% over the year-ago quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax return on net revenue was 81%. Investment-only operating earnings improved 15% from the prior year quarter to $17 million. In addition to the benefit from variable investment income this quarter, business rolling off the books is being replaced with higher margin new business.","Full Service Payout operating earnings were $50 million for the quarter, a 12% increase over the year ago quarter, aided by variable investment income. We continue to approach these guaranteed businesses opportunistically.","Slide nine shows Principal Global Investors' operating earnings for the quarter were $27 million, up 33% from the year-ago quarter. Total net cash flows for the segment were $1.1 billion for the quarter. Assets under management increased 9% to $298 billion, leading to revenue growth of 11% over first quarter 2013.","Unaffiliated assets under management ended the quarter at a $112 billion, with $6.5 billion of deposits coming in during the quarter. There is continued demand for our diversified investment options especially as investors seek yield. The percentage of our assets under management in equity investment options which generated higher revenues has increased to 38% of the total up from 31% compared to the year ago quarter. Diligent expense control resulted in expenses only growing 6% over that timeframe. Trailing 12 month pretax margin for the segment improved to 25%.","Slide 10 shows first quarter 2014 operating earnings for Principal International of $63 million. These record earnings were a strong result especially considering the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Adjusting for Cuprum operating earnings were 14% over the prior year quarter on a local currency basis, this highlights the strength of our businesses in the local markets.","While exchange rates have negatively impacted our U.S. dollar financial results, we feel very confident in the growth prospects for the markets where we do business. [Importantly] net cash flows for the segment were $2 billion contributing to an increase in assets under management to a record $109 billion at quarter end.","Turning to U.S. insurance solutions, our operating earnings up $43 million were up 22% from the year ago quarter. As shown on slide 11, Individual Life operating earnings were $17 million for the quarter, results in the quarter were negatively impacted by alleviated claims severity.","When compared to the prior year quarter sales in first quarter 2014 excluding universal life with secondary guarantees were up 11%. We continue to intentionally change our desired sales mix to be less focused on universal life with secondary guarantees thus improving the risk profile of our sales portfolio.","As shown on slide 12, specialty benefits operating earnings of $26 million were up 25% from the year ago quarter. The loss ratio for the quarter was 68% right in the middle of our 65% to 71% expected range. For the quarter total company net income was $294 million, a 65% increase over prior year quarter. Realized capital losses continue to trend down at $23 million for the quarter. Credit related losses continue to improve and at $12 million for the quarter or down 39% from the year ago quarter.","Turning now to capital deployment. As outlined on slide 13, we\u2019ve announced plans to deploy more than $475 million of capital so far in 2014. This includes a 14% increase to our second quarter common stock dividend that we announced last night and the $100 million debt reduction that was executed on March 1st.","In addition during the first quarter our Board authorized a $200 million share buyback program. This is an addition to the $55 million remaining from last year\u2019s authorization. Year-to-date we have spent $100 million on share buybacks leaving a $155 million of authorization for additional buybacks.","Our capital deployment strategy is fluid with multiple options available to enhance shareholder value. We believe that we will end the year on the top end of the $500 million to $700 million capital deployment range that we discussed on our outlook call.","In closing we are extremely pleased with the strong results in the quarter. We are well positioned for future growth across all of our businesses and our business diversification enabled us to be successful in various economic environments.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Hey good morning everybody. Hey Larry, I am not -- I guess I am not too shy to admit that I am very surprised that the level of expense control in the quarter and maybe I shouldn\u2019t be so surprised by it, but I am. Can you give us some sense, you hit on the operating leverage but you didn\u2019t really go into any details on what\u2019s sort of driving the expense controls here? I just want to get a sense for is there anything in the first quarter level of overall general expenses I am not talking about debt or amortization that you think with sort of one-time in nature where we expected to pick back up as we look throughout the year?","Larry Zimpleman","Good morning John. This is Larry.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Good morning.","Larry Zimpleman","I think in response to your question John, what I would say is that the years sort of 2010, \u201811, \u201812 were very, very challenging relative to the issues around expense control and some of that was because, it was a good news thing, because we were having a lot of growth, we were bringing on a lot of assets, so obviously there is an acquisition cost associated with that. And as I have said before, I mean I think to some extent we were emphasizing a little bit too much growth and a little too much at the expense of profitability. And I think that the team did a great job in 2013 of doing a much, a good balance between growth and profitability. So we started to see some improvement in margin expansion in 2013.","I think when you roll into 2014 and when you look at the first quarter John, it\u2019s probably two things there that are worth mentioning. One is sustainable which is that as the kind of interest rates begin to move up a little bit as your discount rate moves up for all of employee benefits that has a positive and sustainable element to expense control and then the other one which is a little bit more one-time was again in the asset management business. We had sort of higher expenses in the fourth quarter associated with essentially, employee compensation particularly within the asset management group that doesn\u2019t necessarily recur in the first quarter.","So that one we hope is actually going to be back later in the year, because every time, we're paying high performance fees, it\u2019s because the funds did well and they were good flow. So a good chunk of it is sustainable, some of it is a bit of seasonality. I hope that helps a little bit.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Any chance to give us some sense for how much the corporate pension and benefit plan costs maybe down in 2014 versus \u201813 my sense is it\u2019s actually a pretty reasonable tailwind?","Larry Zimpleman","Yes. It\u2019s probably in the range of about $60 million pre-tax.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.","Larry Zimpleman","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","Hi thank you. Could you provide a little bit more detail on the results in the international business at a country level? And then in particular, can you comment about the local currency flow and earnings dynamics in Brazil, Chile and Mexico and how those compared to your expectations?","Larry Zimpleman","Yes, I\u2019ll let Luis to comment on that. I would just say again, we would emphasize that Principal International had a really nice quarter and nice quarter not just in terms of earnings but a nice quarter in terms of flows, in terms of sales, in terms of expenses control. As Terry said in his earlier comments, if you look at our PI local companies operating in their local markets and their performance in local currencies, you\u2019ve seen a 14% increase year-over-year, aggregate across all the PI member companies in local term. So, I think that validates very much, that the issues here to the extent investors have concerns around emerging markets, what they should not have concern about, is the performance of the companies in local terms When you translate that back to USD, you may see some diminishment due to the strength of U.S. dollar, but at the local market level, I think it's really important that investors understand, these companies continue to grow at double-digits. And so with that, I'll forward over to Luis.","Luis Valdes","Yes, thanks. Eric, as Larry said year-over-year in local currency we are showing a double-digit 14% growth year-over-year. But if you are paying attention to quarter-over-quarter and you are paying attention to our last quarter 2013 and in terms of USD. We are showing a growth of equal to 3%, which is a pretty interesting, but in local currency is then 8%. So, we continue showing a very, very dynamic growth in our companies in PI.","Having said that, this is proven that, this proves that we have a very resilient business model in our market. And certainly we are not just working in emerging market. We are working again, again in select emerging markets, which is the main difference. So, it's a very resilient model and again repeating in a very interesting number of select emerging markets.","About FX, we paid a very important headwind in the last year, 14% on average in Brazil and Chile, a kind of 5%, 6% in Mexico. What we are being able to see in the last quarter that the situation is much more stable for these emerging markets and our expectation is that going forward FX for emerging markets are going to fly probably about in same level that they are today. Does that help, Eric.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","Yes. And then maybe if you could just add a little bit more in terms of the flow dynamics where I think you commented for Brazil that if I have this right, January was the pretty weak period when you saw kind of the height of the turmoil but flows have recovered in February and March and assume that\u2019s continued probably through April. And then is it fair to assume that Chile and Mexico, the activity levels are little bit more stable since it\u2019s a mandatory system?","Larry Zimpleman","Yes. I think all of that is very, very accurate. And again, we have seen the situation in Brazil sort of return to what you would consider to be normal in March and April.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","Okay. And I mean as we look year-over-year in terms of the earnings comparisons on a local currency basis, are there any sort of unusual things that we should kind of factor in, in making the comparison? I know you had some tax changes as well as the accounting changes in Brazil that may kind of affect the year-over-year?","Larry Zimpleman","","Right, this is Larry. I don\u2019t think there is anything unusual, we had the fourth quarter commentary around Mexico tax changes and we also had the change that we opted to make that greater amortization of the intangible relative to the prev but that was in fourth quarter, nothing in first quarter and nothing that we can see going forward, although of course one never knows.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","Okay, thank you for the color.","Larry Zimpleman","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss - Bank of America","Hi, good morning, thank you. If we could talk a little bit about accumulation and the run rate implied by this quarter in terms of how it fits in with your margin guidance of 30% to 32% for the full year. Even after sort of normalizing for the items you mentioned, if we run rate this out, the full year will I believe significantly outperform what your guidance was. So maybe you could just help us think about run rate earnings. Terry, you had spoken about this being a decent run rate for individual annuities, if you could touch on that say which on a normalized basis was running over $100 million that would be helpful as well? Thank you.","Larry Zimpleman","","This is Larry, Seth. I suspect both Dan and Terry want to comment. I will just again for those maybe not quite as familiar, I want to drop back and maybe remind everybody that in the outlook call we had at the end of last year looking into 2014, we talked about net revenue growth for the accumulation businesses in that 6% to 8% range and we talked about pretax return on revenue in that sort of 30% to 32% range. Obviously at the moment, the higher equity markets from 2013 give us a if you will a tailwind coming into 2014. So net revenue at least in the first quarter was growing above the top-end of that range.","In our outlook call what we assume is that you have 2% per quarter equity market growth going forward. So if in fact that\u2019s what you have then that 12% net revenue growth going to start to come down a little bit and when that happens I think we are also going to start to come down towards the top end of that range. So that\u2019s a general set of comments looking forward. Terry, do you want to make any further comment on that?","Terry Lillis","","No, not on that one Larry, but I think on the what you talk about Seth also was on the variable annuity block business being a little bit higher than we had seen in the past, $34 million this quarter. We see that the variable annuity block has benefited from some higher fees because of the equity market run up and this more than offsetting some of fixed deferred annuities spread compression that we\u2019re seeing. We see that this is very a pretty good run rate on a go forward basis. So that observation of it being a bigger block of business for us on a go forward basis is a good observation.","Larry Zimpleman","And then I\u2019ll ask Dan maybe to comment a little bit for you Seth on full service accum.","Dan Houston","Yes, good morning Seth. On full service accum, it\u2019s refreshing because although we\u2019ve had some benefit from the equity markets, a lot of things we\u2019re working down in the tranches of business itself, you know that we had good retention of existing plans, we also had -- we\u2019ve added roughly 1,500 new plans in the last 12 months. And if you don\u2019t lose many, you are able to add those new plans, you get that flywheel going relative to deposit which all contribute to improving on your margins.","The other note I would make is we\u2019re continuing to see strong investment performance from Principal Global Investors; it\u2019s giving us more product to sell more competitive product which means a higher percentage of our sales going towards proprietary and then as mentioned in Larry\u2019s prepared comments, on the mutual fund side which also is just a very leverageable business, we have really strong investment performance with 17 funds now with 4 and 5-star ratings from Morningstar. So again very, very strong margins and again over the course of the year, I think the best way to look at whether it\u2019s net cash flow or sales or margins is to look on a trailing 12 month basis and I am still very comfortable in that 30% to 32% for RIS accum.","Seth Weiss - Bank of America","Okay, thanks a lot. And Dan maybe just a follow-up on FSA because even assuming kind of that 2% normalized run rate, I am still getting very strong earnings growth there. Should we assume that if markets stay as favorable as they are, there may be a higher reinvest in terms of the expense line in FSA?","Dan Houston","Yes. The demands there are always high, so we constantly are making investments in distribution and technology and of course the mobile technology is a big part of that. We know that we are on the top quartile relative to margin and profitability for full service accumulation, so there is what I\u2019ll call some restrictions in the marketplace.","But again don\u2019t lose sight side of the fact that we are very deliberately focusing on that mid to small size market plan as opposed to the jumble plan, which is going to just naturally contribute to having higher margins than maybe what we had two or three years ago.","Does that help?","Seth Weiss - Bank of America","Okay, thanks a lot.","Larry Zimpleman","","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Thank so much. Good morning.","Larry Zimpleman","","Hi Chris.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","I wanted to see you could comment on few regulatory areas which thankfully for you guys haven\u2019t been much of a focus, but first at the federal level, given your size and the disposal of the bank, maybe not an issue, but certainly a lot of focus not just in insurers but asset managers as well. So anything you guys are participating in or preparing for from that regards? And then two, at the state level, it\u2019s hard to ignore kind of the influx of the insurers moving into Iowa, and just wondering if that\u2019s having any impact on either trying to approach or talent or issues in terms of how you run new business?","Larry Zimpleman","Yes, those are interesting questions Chris, I appreciate that. This is Larry. Let me again just kind of backup because I think your question is interesting. And one of the things that I think has differentiated Principal over the period since the financial crisis because we\u2019ve had within the industry and across all of financial services, we\u2019ve had very significant, both legislative and regulatory change that has gone on. And the two most noteworthy ones I think would be the Affordable Care Act and Dodd Frank.","And I think to the credit of this management team, I think they\u2019ve done an excellent job in managing and maneuvering around the substantial change that both of those pieces of legislation are going bring to broadly to financial services. So the very effective wind down, a very successful financial wind down of our medical business, difficult as the decision was, I think really position us well.","And then as you noted, the deregistration of the bank, again we're still in the banking business, but we\u2019ve changed the charter of the bank, so that we no longer have Federal Reserve oversight Principal Holding Company. Those are really significant items that may not get full credit for those who maybe aren\u2019t as close to our industry or our businesses.","I\u2019d say going forward, so most of the regulatory things that could snag us for the most part, we\u2019ve maneuvered around. There is still, as you know, there is still the potential around, we don\u2019t know what systemically important definitions are going to be around asset managers. I would say, we\u2019re sort of in the range of somewhere between 25 and 30th largest global asset management company. And I\u2019ll let Jim comment in a minute. So, it\u2019s kind of hard to see that we would be in -- anything approaching the first phase of any definitions of systemically significant.","So, I don\u2019t really worry too much about that. Again, I\u2019ll let Jim comment. On your point about Iowa, that\u2019s an interesting question. Actually to dig into that, what you\u2019ll find is that the company is re-domesticating, but in many cases, and I think this is true both of Symetra and Fidelity & Guaranty Life, they are re-domesticating, but if you actually look at the jobs that they are going to bring here, it sort of numbers in the 100s, it certainly, and they\u2019re going to keep many of their existing -- they\u2019re going to keep their locations and their existing employees. So maybe overtime in 5 or 10 years it has some impact, but we are talking maybe 100 to 200 jobs that they will be bringing here over the next year or two, so I don\u2019t see it as a big factor. with that maybe I will forward over to Jim.","Jim McCaughan","Yes. Thanks Larry. In terms of regulations of assets managers, if you go back to the financial crises, the one piece of the asset management business that was really at the center of the troubles of those money market funds and whether they could preserve the buck. I think appropriately if one looking to what regulators are doing related to asset managers their focus is on money market funds and that\u2019s where the systemic risk might be.","But fortunately and deliberately that\u2019s a pretty small business for us. And we handle client\u2019s cash in appropriate ways. And Larry, talked about our bank in the insurance separate accounts. So money market funds is something we are not at the center of.","If I look at regulation and how it affects our asset management activities, it\u2019s much more the second order affect, how it affects the parties we trade with. So we had new market system came in, in 2007 with a lot of controversy about equity trading. Like all big equity houses we have much more sophisticated metrics and controls now than we used to have to cope with those competitive markets.","And then of course in the bond market, as you know we\u2019re a big high yield manager, we deal in a lot of relatively illiquid bonds like preferreds. I think that the consequences of Dodd-Frank and the fact that the banks are devoting less capital to bond trading are something that we have worked on, upgraded our trading capabilities and essentially we are able to work on it.","So I think, it\u2019s more second order than the first order for us in terms of asset management regulation. And just to close, of course there is a lot going on in Europe. I think that may actually turnout for us with the alternative products we have in Europe and the new regulatory framework there it may turn into an opportunity.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","I appreciate the thoughts. And then one just quick follow-up in the past quarters you have talked about kind of RBC ratio as well as excess capital and didn\u2019t see that in the first quarter press release, so Terry maybe if you could give us an update on where you stand in any changes in your targets there?","Terry Lillis","Sure, Chris. Our targets for long-term for the end of the year for the RBC are still in that 415% to 425% range, as we make estimates during the year and that\u2019s still a pretty good range for us. We were up 439% at the end of the year and we have brought that down purposely because of the $100 million surplus note redemption. So we are back down into that range and expect to be there at the end of the year as well.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Larry Zimpleman","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger - KBW","Hey, good morning.","Larry Zimpleman","Hi Ryan.","Ryan Krueger - KBW","Question on the M&A pipeline I guess one thing I am wondering about is, does that comment include opportunities to buy an additional stakes from boutiques that you already own?","Larry Zimpleman","Yes. Ryan this is Larry. Our comment around M&A would be broadly inclusive of any deployment of capital. So if we were to buy a bigger ownership share of some of our existing boutique, obviously that would a deployment of capital. So yes that is part of our commentary when we talk about the kind of M&A pipeline.","Ryan Krueger - KBW","Okay. And then just my understanding was that you had to accrue as if you already own 100% of these boutiques under the statutory accounting regimes. So I guess one, am I right? And if I am would that suggest that when you do buy an additional stakes that actually doesn\u2019t really impact your RBC ratio at all?","Larry Zimpleman","Right. I\u2019ll let Terry to comment on that and then Jim may want to comment as well.","Terry Lillis","Yes, Ryan, this is Terry. The non-controlling interest that we have is reflected as mezzanine equity in both the GAAP and statutory basis. So we already have reflected the obligation that we have to acquire some of these boutiques that can be actually put back to us. So we\u2019ve recognized that already, but as Larry says as we deploy that capital to buy a bigger share of that then we get the earnings in it and we\u2019ll release it as well, but doesn\u2019t have an impact on the RBC ratio.","Larry Zimpleman","Jim, maybe you want to comment about kind of how we view the relationship between what we own versus what each boutique management owns?","Jim McCaughan","Yes. There is two different types and the boutiques that are consolidated, you\u2019re correct that we put in a 100% of the boutique into our income statement. But then we deduct for the minority interest, and so if we buy in some of that minority interest as a positive impact on earnings. The other sources where we\u2019re on a smaller stick for their non-consolidated equity method accounting, in those cases if we buy in some more then we end up with a bigger share on the equity method. And eventually it will trip into consolidation at a point for debate with between our CFO and our auditor.","So that would be the technical side of it. In terms of the business side, we are keen eventually to buy in some of these minority interests, but when we have bought a stake in a boutique, particularly from a founder or an entrepreneurial manager we like them to keep some equity in the boutique for the rest of their careers in effect. And so buying in tends to be related to succession planning. So if a retired partner in a boutique, if he retires, he or she retires then we will buyback their stock and sometimes have limited recycling to the next generation, but that\u2019s more difficult technically. So I think on balance, we view positively that evolution, but we take it in a measured way because we like to keep the equity for alignment.","Ryan Krueger - KBW","Understood. That\u2019s very helpful.","Larry Zimpleman","Yes.","Ryan Krueger - KBW","And then just lastly on the PGI pipeline, you mentioned that was robust, just anymore color on how does it compare to recent quarters and what types of mandates are you currently seeing demand for?","Jim McCaughan","Yes, Jim McCaughan here. In terms of the pipeline, sales so far this year are up high single-digits percent from last year which was a record year for sales. So, so far this year, the sales are looking quite buoyant in the pipeline with its visibility as at least to good as it\u2019s ever been for us. I think it\u2019s the same story as it\u2019s been for the last two years on sales which is increased demand for specialty product.","Terry mentioned yield in the script, and we have a remarkable array of yield buyers, investment capabilities from real estate, other alternatives through high yield equities, high yield bonds preferred securities and all the real estate products. So if you added up, we are really in good demand for investors seeking yield.","Also more broadly specialty products, things like small cap and emerging markets, emerging markets may not be this year\u2019s theme, but they are coming back. And so we are well positioned we believe to continue building that pipeline which as I say has been quite strong this year.","Ryan Krueger - KBW","Great, thank you very much.","Larry Zimpleman","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","Good morning.","Larry Zimpleman","Hi Mark.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","I guess I wanted to go back to Eric\u2019s question, I think it was on, just looking at the earnings internationally. And I mean again if you look at the AUM growth in particularly in Brazil, very strong kind of outstanding. But it actually doesn't feel like when you adjust from a constant currency basis, it doesn't feel like the earnings are catching up with the AUM growth. And I understand there is amortization changes and there is other things going on. But I guess the real question is are there any dynamics that you are currently seeing particularly in Brazil to start that would suggest that going forward earnings shouldn't keep up with AUM. Are there any market dynamics, [case] sizes, anything that would keep pressures, anything that would influence that?","Larry Zimpleman","This is Larry, Mark. I'll offer a few opening comments and then Luis can comment as well. As I said in my opening comments, if you look at AUM, assets under management, when you look at assets under management over the past five years in BrazilPrev, what you'd see is about a 32% compound annual growth. So, we're at, again as we've said we're at R$90 billion, when we, which is US$40 billion, when we bought into that joint venture in 1999, it had less than a $1 billion in assets. So, I'd say that's a pretty amazing growth rate.","In terms of operating earnings, I think that we're in the range in terms of again five year compound annual growth, we're in the range of 25% per year compound annual growth rate. So, they correlate, but similarly to say full service accumulation, you're not going to see your AUM growth rate be, your OE growth rate be parallel with your AUM, but they're going to be in the same zip code, would be the way that I think about it.","Now on your question about, is there anything in the market that could disrupt change that, there are competitive pressures in Brazil just like any other market, although there is a fewer number of players, basically the significant players are the four -- are the banks, particularly the private banks Bradesco, Ita\u00fa.","The thing that might enter into it in the long term is that Brasilprev for the most part has pursued the retail market. And one of the real opportunities that is there to even further the growth of that company, if that seems even likely when it grows to 30% would be to be more active in the corporate pension market in Brazil, as compared to just the retail pension market.","So again, we are only going to do that, but makes sense financially, but that would be an example of where you might see increased growth. But if you try to measure it profits for dollar, you might be able to compromise because again it\u2019s the corporate market as compared to the retail market. But this is an amazing company. And again for those who maybe aren\u2019t quite as familiar, if you want to hear more or see more about the performance of this company, it is part of a publically traded company in Brazil called BB Seguridade. And you can get some great insight into this very fast growing, very profitable company","So Luis, anything you\u2019d like to add?","Luis Valdes","Mark, this is Luis. And truly what you have to keep in mind also, if you are looking the trend of Brasilprev which is a very, very interesting company and as Larry said, the company that is having a very interesting performance in the last five years, just certain things are happening also in Brazil. So first, the interest rate is going down that has been the trend for last five to six years. The market is getting a little bit more competitive. So we have seen a very moderate as well margin compression in Brasilprev but that is a totally normal in that kind of environment going forward.","Does that help?","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","Yes, it does, thank you. One quick question maybe for Dan. There have been some recent actions Dan, largely kind of on the fiduciary standard, largely directed towards Plan Sponsors relate to sub account options, investment options for participants, it sounds like it\u2019s largely directed at Plan Sponsors in terms of kind of the responsibility, but I am just curious if you see any impact towards your business and the fee structures that you are able collect or PGI is able to collect from on 401(k) accounts?","Dan Houston","Yes, thanks Mark for the question. So really, there is a couple of issues, first is around the appropriateness of the fees; the second is whether or not there is adequate investment options available to the plant participants. And as you know we\u2019ve run a multi-manager, multi-asset class, multi-style approach for over a decade, and that\u2019s even true within our target date funds as it turns out, Principal Global Investors does manage a generous portion of those.","But we have always taken the approach that we are going to put best in class investment managers into those respective line-ups. So you could go right through our target date funds, you can go through many of our standalone investment options and find that we have a mixer of both proprietary and non-proprietary.","As far as fee disclosure and fee reasonableness goes, that gets scrutinized by the advisor and the Plan Sponsor every year, most of those discussions take place annually. And so I don\u2019t see any sort of issues that we are up against that the rest of the industry isn\u2019t, matter of fact, I think we are well positioned because of our willingness to go multi-manager and our willingness to have very adaptable fee schedules depending upon what the Plan Sponsors looking for in terms of services for their participants. Does that help?","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","Yes, thank you.","Larry Zimpleman","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital","Thanks very much and good morning to everyone in Iowa.","Larry Zimpleman","Hi Eric.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital","Good morning. My first question is directed to either Larry or Dan whoever feels best suited to answer it. It seems like there continues to be a lot of commentary about how the 401(k) business is going to change in a big way, with some people who are self proclaimed experts and some people are genuine experts I suppose, saying that we\u2019re going to see all sorts of new options, private equity, liquid alts, hedge funds, ETFs, this that it boggles to mind all the choices.","I consider you guys absolutely to be experts on the 401(k) business. If there anyone who knows sort of whether this can happen and to what degree would be you. Where is the business headed from this regard?","Larry Zimpleman","Yes. That\u2019s interesting, this is Larry. That\u2019s a really interesting question. What I would say is that we often forget that the average participant in a 401(k) plan likely doesn\u2019t read the Wall Street Journal every day and they don\u2019t turn on CNBC, Squawk Box or Bloomberg or FOX Business channel or any of the other media that probably many of us on this call look at multiple times each and every day. And so therefore we forget that the average 401(k) investor is in a very, very different world. They are middle income sort of person focused on their job and their family and they know they need to say but they\u2019re clearly not an investment expert.","And I think one of the unique elements of our business model and the platform that we put together including the investment platform is that we get that, we understand that, and we understand that our role is to construct very solid, but also easy, able to understand sort of investment offset. So when people start talking about ETFs and liquid alts and private equity and all of that stuff, I too chuckle a little bit, because it\u2019s really hard to see, how that is something that can be easily explained in a way that the average 401(k) participant is going to have the interest in.","Now I will say, on the other hand Eric, I will say the area where it\u2019s possible those types of options could make some inroads would be to be a part inside some sort of target date structure. So for example, taking 5% of an investment allocation inside of target date fund and then deciding whether some alternative investments like the ones you describe might be a piece of that as a way to perhaps have higher investment performance or more stable investment performance. But that\u2019s something where the participant really doesn\u2019t need to be involved in that and frankly wouldn\u2019t be involved in that.","Terry Lillis","[This is Terry, Eric]. (Inaudible) just a couple of comments and that is remember that we still make available a brokerage window on plans where the advisor or the plan sponsor is keen on providing additional investment options, but most of these plans as said, a lot of trusties meeting 10 to 15 options, 30% of these dollars generally flow to a target date or target risk like fund, there is 30 minute group employee meetings if you got to get that message other too complicated, my last prove point even if we look at non-qualified deferred compensation, which often times funded with life insurance, on those that are funded with, mutual fund options, they are not asking in that target market for exchange traded funds or hedge funds in that place as well.","So I do think it\u2019s more of a after-tax investment option for many of the high wage earners.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital","Last question, second last question is for Jim. Jim, I would have thought given the strength of sales in 2013 that your first quarter 2014 cash flows would have been better than they were. What were the dynamics in the quarter that held back the cash flows?","Jim McCaughan","","Yes, thank you for that question Eric. There is a very rapid set of changes going on in clients\u2019 desires and needs. And we\u2019ve talked before about the move by clients away from active core products. That actually wasn't a big factor this quarter, but it's one that we must be vigilant about looking forward.","Our challenge by the way with clients or inactive core products, which may be less attractive in future is to offer them some of these more in demand products that I talked about earlier in the call. That's one element, but in the particular quarter, they are a lot of moving parts and some of this is to do with these kind of inevitable losses of clients\u2019 requirements change.","So, for example, there's no one big theme, but for example we had a withdrawal in our currency group, which was really related to the changed hedging policy of the client. We had withdrawals from stable value, which was I think well known move more into equities, more into target date funds as people gain confidence. We had some profit taking in real estate that leads to an outflow, but it also leads to a happy client who hopefully will come back for more when we\u2019ve got propositions to offer them.","So, I think this will continue to be a theme. The fact that we have the attractive products to replace it with that\u2019s why structurally we feel confident that we'll continue to have positive flows in the institutional space. But I do think it's very important that we beat continued diligence and vigilance about dealing with those clients.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital","Thank you.","Larry Zimpleman","","Does that help, Eric.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","","Hey, everybody. Actually the last part was something I wanted to ask about. Jim the clients that you referenced, these changes that you referenced, this is all on the PGI direct side, right?","Jim McCaughan","Yes, that's correct.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay, I just wanted to make sure, that was correct. All right, just a couple, Terry, early on you talked about the pension expense, there was some discussion with regards to the net revenue margin for FSA and others in FSA being very, very high. The guidance that you gave late last year, did that incorporate this lower level of pension expense in it?","Terry Lillis","Steven, this is Terry. Yes it did, it factored in. Now that will come in all year long. In fact, one of the things that we talked about the guidance is that it will also reflect some other changes such as variable income, it's somewhat spotty throughout the year as well. But over the long period as Dan talked about that you'll see this revenue and expense get back to that higher end of that 30% to 32% return on that revenue range.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. And then on the variable investment income, it's correct that it was all real estate, it was all allocated to guarantee and in individual annuity there is nothing else out there, there is nothing accounted for?","Terry Lillis","Yes, Steven, this is Terry. The variable annuity that we called out was a little bit bigger in the guaranteed businesses, the investment-only, the full service payout, you can actually reflect it there. But there was also some variable income that was spread among all the other businesses, and what we found in those other businesses that there were some partial offsets to that. For example the individual annuity, it got some variable income as well, but that plus a lower effective tax rate somewhat offset some of the higher amortizations of tax. So, we kind of looked at it as what was a good number for each of the businesses and called those numbers out.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. And then one more if I may, on China, I don\u2019t believe that you are participating in the RQFII process yet, are you intending and I guess if not, why not?","Larry Zimpleman","","I\u2019ll let Jim to maybe answer that one Steven.","Jim McCaughan","","I think the answer to that is yes, we're looking at it. We have QFII capacity through our joint venture, so it happens to CCB Principal Asset Management which is part of Principal International but we have Principal Global Investors are managing or advising rather on those QFII assets. RQFII is expanding, it's relatively modest as far as global asset managers are concerned, but we do expect to be involved.","Larry Zimpleman","","I think one of the -- this is Larry Steven, I think one of the interesting things is that the challenges have been so significant in the Chinese equity market that I think many of the more sophisticated investors are now actually starting to think that we're getting closer to maybe an interesting opportunity relative to Chinese equity A shares. So it will be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of years basically with us.","","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. Thank you guys.","Larry Zimpleman","","You bet.","Operator","","We have reached the end of our Q&A.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Principal Financial Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. As always, our earnings release, financial supplement and additional investment portfolio detail are available on our website at www.principal.com\/investor. Slides related to today's call are also on the website. ","Following a reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO Larry Zimpleman; and CFO Terry Lillis will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A are Dan Houston, Retirement and Investor Services and U.S. Insurance Solutions; Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors; Norman Sorensen and Luis Valdez, Principal International; and Julia Lawler, Chief Investment Officer. ","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The company does not revise or update them to reflect new information, subsequent events or change in strategy. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Larry.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Thanks, John, and welcome to everyone on the call. As usual, I'll comment on 3 areas: First, I'll discuss fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. Second, I'll provide an update on the continued successful implementation and execution of our strategy. And I'll close with some comments on the financial strength of the company and our capital management plans. ","The fourth quarter saw a continuation of a challenging external environment that had a negative impact on quarterly operating earnings. This includes continued volatility of credit spreads, especially on financials, low interest rates and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against emerging market currencies. Terry will discuss all of these in more detail. ","Despite these external challenges in the fourth quarter, the diversified nature of our business model allows us to weather these difficult periods without any significant degradation of the strength of our financial position caused by having significant long-term equity or interest rate guarantees. This is a significant differentiator from many of our insurance competitors. Despite these external challenges, good momentum continued to build across our businesses in the fourth quarter, demonstrating our competitive advantage and the strength of our distribution relationships and product leadership. Some of the growth metrics from the quarter include strong quarterly sales of $3.3 billion for Full Service Accumulation, the third highest on record, contributing to strong net cash flows of $1.6 billion in the quarter; record quarterly sales of $3.1 billion in Principal Funds, contributing to record net cash flows of $900 million in the quarter; strong net cash flows for Principal International of $1.7 billion; and strong sales in U.S. Insurance Solutions, including $55 million in Individual Life sales in the quarter. These strong results will lead to improved earnings and continued growth in 2012 and beyond. ","Turning now to the full year, as outlined on Slide 4, overall results were solid despite the external challenges. Total company assets under management were $335 billion at the end of the year, up 5% over year-end 2010. Total company earnings for 2011 improved 4% over 2010 to $878 million, the second highest operating earnings on record, driven by strong sales and enhanced efforts around client retention. ","Let me highlight some of the outstanding growth metrics from 2011. Full Service Accumulation full year sales of $8.4 billion were the second highest ever and were 27% higher than 2010 sales. We saw sales growth across all distribution channels and across all plan sizes. Full year net cash flows in Full Service Accumulation were $3.8 billion compared to $600 million for full year 2010. This means net cash flow was 3.5%, a beginning of year account value which is close to flows prior to the financial crisis. Additionally, the pipeline has returned to precrisis levels and is up 25% compared to the same period in 2010. ","Principal Funds once again had record sales of $11.2 billion for the year, up 20%, resulting in record net cash flows of $2.2 billion for the year against industry flows which were neutral. ","Principal Global Investors had $11 billion in mandates awarded in 2011. As of year end, $3 billion had yet to fund, giving us the opportunity for strong net flows in 2012. ","Despite the currency headwinds and an equity market decline in emerging markets, reported assets under management in Principal International were $53 billion for the year, up 15% over 2010, driven by strong organic growth, as well as assets from the HSBC AFORE acquisition. This growth is in spite a roughly a 10% drag from unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Full year net cash flows in Principal International were a record $5.5 billion, a 17% increase over 2010. ","In U.S. Insurance Solutions, Individual Life full year sales of $186 million were up 13% compared to 2010, and year-over-year premiums and deposits increased 9% over last year. The nonqualified and business owner markets continued to drive sales in this segment, leading to significantly higher growth than the life industry overall. Full year Specialty Benefits sales were $285 million, up 18% over 2010, with all products showing growth and record sales in Individual Disability. ","As we think about 2011 and how that positions us going forward, we have a focused set of strategically aligned businesses that are performing well, have good momentum and have exceptional long-term growth potential. ","Now I'll provide an update on the continued successful execution of our strategy, as well as the key differentiators that make our strategy the right one for long-term growth. We remain committed to providing comprehensive solutions to small and medium-sized businesses. In Full Service Accumulation, Principal Total Retirement Suite continues to be a differentiator for us, driving 61% of 2011 sales. Plan sponsors and plan participants like the convenience of having all of their retirement plans from one top-tier provider, driving better close ratios and better persistency for this block. Client retention efforts in Full Service Accumulation over the past few years have resulted in lower withdrawals, contributing to improved lapse rates overall. Our focus on the Allianz distribution channel continues to drive strong Full Service Accumulation sales, with over 44% of total sales coming from Allianz firms. We continue to build out these relationships by adding more products to their platforms and creating more ways to win. Our Allianz distribution relationships were recently strengthened with the addition of another national broker-dealer, Edward Jones. Edward Jones is one of the largest and most recognized broker-dealers in the U.S. and focuses on small and medium-sized clients like we do. We're excited about the opportunity to build upon this multiproduct relationship in the coming years. ","Moving now to our efforts to capture and retain more baby boomer assets, our growth in Principal Funds is driven by an outcome-oriented, multi-manager product strategy. We offer mutual funds that meet specific investor needs, such as providing income strategies for helping to protect against inflation and market volatility, especially for investors nearing and in retirement. The most recent fund launched was the Global Multi-Strategy Fund, which seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation with an emphasis on positive total returns and relatively low volatility. ","Our product innovation and distribution model continued to be differentiators for Principal Funds. Four funds had more than $1 billion in sales in 2011: the Global Diversified Income Fund, High Yield Fund, Preferred Securities Fund, and Strategic Asset Management Portfolios. Additionally, our broad suite of investment and income solutions, which allows us to capture and retain assets as plan participants retire, contributed more than $1 billion in Principal Funds sales in 2011. ","The single best leading indicator of future sales is investment performance. Investment performance continues to be strong across asset classes and is a differentiator for the Principal. The strong performance includes particular strength in asset allocation where at quarter end 94% of our target date and target risk funds were in the top half on a 1-year basis, 84% on a 3-year basis and 69% on a 5-year basis. ","2011 was a very successful year in terms of executing our global investment management strategy. During the year, we announced and closed on 3 acquisitions that were exactly the right fit for our strategy. In Principal Global Investors, we acquired a majority stake in Finisterre Capital and Origin Asset Management, both based in London and both focused internationally with an emphasis on emerging markets. These fit perfectly within our successful multi-boutique strategy and through our global distribution platform, we expect to grow assets under management by 3 to 5x in the next 5 years for each acquired boutique. ","In the last week, we received approval to launch a Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor or QFII fund, which allows foreign investors to invest in China. This further positions us as a leading global investment manager. ","In Principal International, we announced and closed on the acquisition of HSBC AFORE, which is the mandatory Defined Contribution business in Mexico. This acquisition added scale to grow our operations in Mexico, making the Principal the seventh largest AFORE in Mexico and giving us an important 5-year exclusive distribution agreement with HSBC Mexico, which has the fourth largest bank distribution platform. This deal complements our existing infrastructure, is already accretive and a meaningful contributor to Principal International's earnings. This acquisition is just one example of the tremendous growth and success we've seen in Principal International. That's thanks in large part to the contributions from the Chairman of Principal International, Norman Sorensen. ","As we announced several weeks ago, Norman will retire at the end of this month. We thank him for his tremendous contribution during his 14 years at the Principal and look forward to his continued involvement on our international advisory council in 2012. As the successful head of our Latin American operations for the past decade, Luis Valdez, President and CEO of Principal International, will continue to lead this division. This transition is part of a planned succession that we announced last year. Norman and Luis have been working closely together and we look forward to additional global growth under Luis' leadership. ","Overall, I am very pleased with the continued execution of our strategy across the businesses. With a strategy that is focused on businesses that offer potential for significant long-term growth, our outlook remains positive going into 2012 and beyond. As a global investment management leader, our business mix is the right one. We're in the right growth markets and we know what it takes to stay competitive. ","Moving now to some comments on the strength and flexibility of our financial position. As shown on Slide 5, our business model has shifted to a more fee-based investment management model, which means we need less capital to support organic growth. And with realized capital losses now down to their lowest levels since the financial crisis, we can put even more capital to work to build long-term shareholder value. This enables us to deploy more capital towards strategic acquisitions and return more capital to shareholders. As evidence of that, we strategically deployed more than $1.1 billion of capital throughout 2011 while starting and ending the year at the same level of excess capital in what remains a challenging environment. We are very pleased with the combination of capital deployment actions we took this year, and we will use this model as a template going forward. ","Further evidence of our commitment to building long-term value for shareholders is our recent announcement that we will move to a quarterly common stock dividend schedule starting in first quarter 2012. This action reflects the migration of our business model to more fee-based businesses and the absence of a significant exposure to products with long-term guarantees that can negatively impact our financial strength. ","The solid performance in 2011 is the result of our employees' dedication and focus on successfully executing on our strategy. Despite ongoing market challenges, our employees continue to work hard to serve advisers and clients. I'm proud of the work they do and look forward to our future as a leading global investment manager. Terry?","Terrance J. Lillis","Thanks, Larry. As Larry mentioned, fourth quarter earnings were negatively impacted by headwinds. However, business fundamentals remain strong. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including continued solid performance of our investment portfolio; and the strength of our capital position and strong balance sheet as we enter 2012. ","Fourth quarter 2011 operating earnings of $217 million were up 1% from a year ago quarter, on 5% higher average assets under management. There were a few notable items impacting fourth quarter 2011 operating earnings. Fourth quarter 2011 had positive DAC amortization true-ups due to the equity market performance, which benefited Full Service Accumulation, Individual Annuities and Individual Life by $0.01 each. Principal International benefited by $0.03 from foreign tax credits and the removal of a 1-month reporting lag in Brasilprev, thus reporting 4 months of earnings from that operation in the fourth quarter. Full Service Accumulation was dampened by $0.04 from lower spread and higher expenses in the quarter, and the Corporate segment was negatively impacted by $0.04 from lower variable investment income on excess capital held at the holding company from an active credit strategy. Adjusting for these items, we consider the earnings per share run rate for the fourth quarter to be $0.73 and fourth quarter 2011 earnings down 2% on a 5% increase in average assets under management, compared to adjusted fourth quarter 2010. ","Now let me discuss the business unit results. Full Service Accumulation operating earnings at $64 million were down 16% from a year ago quarter on a 3% increase in average account values. The earnings drop was driven by higher quarterly cost for pension and other postretirement benefits, which we refer to as security benefit cost, higher nondeferrable sales compensation expense and less variable investment income. A more normalized earnings results for this quarter would have been $72 million. ","In 2012, new regulation for plan sponsor and participant fee disclosures are scheduled to take effect. The Principal has been well positioned for this regulatory change and we were an early adopter of the proposed disclosure regulations in fall of 2011. Advisers and plan sponsors place business with us because of our compelling value proposition, not because we're the cheapest provider. The retirement industry is fragmented, and we expect to see the industries consolidate to the top players, such as the Principal. ","Let me make a couple of comments related to the Full Service Accumulation margins. Slide 6 summarizes the leading drivers of the return on assets since 2004. Factor one, which has been the largest impact, is a consumer-driven shift in business mix, which I'll give more detail on in a moment. The second factor is the current market environment, which has reduced recurring deposits. The third factor listed, growth, retention and efficiency, is one we have and will continue to influence through scale and focused execution. ","As depicted on Slide 7, the mix of business is shifting away from general and separate account investments into mutual funds and employer securities, reducing return on assets but improving free cash flow generation. As this business mix continues to shift and more business is written on our mutual fund platform in a nondomestic equity investment, fewer dividends are eligible for the dividend received deduction benefit, which also reduces the return on assets. Despite this, we continue to deliver industry-leading return on assets. When we measure results for Full Service Accumulation, we also look at other profit metrics, such as pretax margins and pretax return on net revenue, which are better indicators of the financial performance of the business. ","Slide 8 illustrates our stable track record of driving revenues to the bottom line, even as customer preferences migrate to different asset types. Return on revenue margins continues to be a key focus. 2011 Full Service Accumulation sales of $8.4 billion was very strong, up 27% over 2010. The underlying fundamentals within Full Service Accumulation continue to improve. The sales pipeline continues to build across all market sizes and distribution channels, and the close ratios continue to improve. We are actively executing on our strategy to win more business and gain market share despite the shift in business mix and environmental headwinds. ","Strong transfer deposits, combined with excellent client retention, drove full year net cash flow of $3.8 billion or 3.5% of beginning year account value, against an industry that ended the year flat as estimated by Cerulli. We also saw modest growth in recurring deposits year-over-year, reflecting improvement in employer matches and salary deferrals. While unemployment rates remain elevated, these trends increase our optimism about improvement in the U.S. economy in 2012. ","Principal Funds continues to deliver strong operating results. Operating earnings at $11 million in the fourth quarter were in line with the year ago quarter. On a full year basis, 2011 operating earnings of $48 million were up 22% on 12% increase in average account values. Full year 2011 sales were $11.2 billion, up 20% over 2010, driving full year net cash flows to a record $2.2 billion. Individual Annuities operating earnings in fourth quarter 2011 were $30 million, down $3 million from a year ago quarter. As the low interest rate environment persists, Individual Annuities will continue to experience spread compression. ","Fourth quarter 2011 earnings from Principal Global Investors were $18 million, down 9% from a year ago quarter on a 2% increase in average assets under management, primarily due to higher compensation cost and the acquisition cost related with our purchase of Origin Asset Management. In fourth quarter 2011, we earned performance fees on our hedge funds at Columbus Circle Investors, one of our investment boutiques. As is common in the industry, a substantial portion of those fees is shared with the investment managers. On a full year basis, earnings were up 26% on a 5% increase in average assets under management as pretax margins expanded to 21.4%, another step on our road back to the target of over 30% pretax margin. Unaffiliated net cash flow for the quarter was a negative $900 million due to market volatility causing some delay in the funding of mandates awarded until after year end. Principal Global Investors had $11 billion in mandates awarded in 2011, double the amount awarded in 2010. As Larry mentioned, as of year end, $3 billion of the 2011 total awarded had yet to fund. ","We remain optimistic about the likely institutional net flows for Principal Global Investors in 2012. We base this optimism on a high level of client interest in awarding new mandates for our capabilities, and also on a generally good client appreciation of our investment performance and service. Additional activities that bode well for the long-term growth are the 2012 launch of the QFII fund, as well as the expanded series of Islamic investments. However, market volatility continues to feed uncertainty about client plans, so we see this as a risk. As we continue to monitor the global economy and focus on things we can control, such as execution and fund performance, we remain cautiously optimistic as we begin 2012. ","Moving to Principal International, operating earnings at $51 million include one-time benefits of approximately $10 million. Of this, $7 million results from an additional month of earnings in current quarter results from Brasilprev as we closed the 1-month reporting lag for that business. This also impacts assets under management and net cash flow. After this change, we will no longer have any material operations in Principal International on a 1-month reporting lag. The remaining $3 million benefit came from some foreign tax credits we were able to recognize. Assets under management were $53 billion at year end, down 3% from third quarter 2011. Net cash flow of $1.7 billion and positive investment performance of $1.3 billion was more than offset by the negative $4.8 billion effect of exchange rates from the strengthening dollar. While the underlying growth of the companies on a local basis at approximately 15% remain strong, 2012 began with operating earnings weighted foreign exchange rates, roughly 10% less favorable than the 2011 average rates, providing a headwind to U.S. dollar reported earnings. Our financial supplement now includes foreign exchange information used for financial reporting to help you better analyze the impact of exchange rates on Principal International. ","A quick comment on an item that will impact Principal International in the first quarter 2012. In the Mexican AFORE pension market, participants who did not select in AFORE are assigned to various providers. The regulator of the Mexican AFORE pension market has initiated a program to reassign these participants to providers with higher net investment returns. Principal will both gain and lose participants from this recent reassignment. A reassignment of participants out of the Principal AFORE will result in an after-tax write-down of present value of future profits, while participants that transfer in will not generate capitalized expenses. In January 2012, participants were transferred out of the Principal AFORE, generating an after-tax present value future profits write-off of approximately $5 million. Future revenue loss on these accounts will be partially offset by revenues from any future participants assigned to us. ","Individual Life fourth quarter operating earnings were $33 million. This was in line with the year ago quarter after adjusting fourth quarter 2010 for the impact of a one-time increase in net reserves following a periodic long-term interest rate assumption review. On a full year basis, Individual Life had record operating earnings of $119 million. Full year life sales of $186 million were up 13%, driven by nonqualified product offerings, as well as continued success in the business owner and executive solutions market. ","Turning to Specialty Benefits, fourth quarter operating earnings were $26 million, down $4 million from a favorable year ago quarter. Premium growth and stable claim experience were more than offset by lower variable investment income and higher security benefit cost in the current quarter. On a full year basis, Specialty Benefits earnings were up 5% on a 6% increase in premium fees. Additionally, on a full year basis, loss ratios remained very stable and at the midpoint of our targeted range. Our Specialty Benefits business continues to perform very well. ","The Corporate segment reported an operating loss of $43 million, driven by a shortfall in performance on an active credit strategy of approximately $13 million. The loss was primarily driven by the write-down of an MF Global bond. The active credit strategy provided a 4 1\/4% annualized return since inception. However, we have completely wound this strategy down as of January 2012 due to the added volatility and the continued deployment of excess capital at the holding company in 2011. As we communicated on our guidance call, we expect full year 2012 operating losses for the Corporate segment of $120 million to $130 million. ","For the year, total company net income was $682 million, an increase of 2% over 2010. We also experienced $147 million of credit-related investment losses for the year, a continued downward trend to a multiyear low. The evolution of our business model means we now have a much higher portion of our earnings coming from less capital intensive, more fee-based businesses. As the low interest rate environment persists, our earnings will grow but at a slower rate, as shown in Slide 9. ","In addition to the items I previously mentioned that will impact 2012 results in Principal International and the Corporate segment, let me provide a brief update on the impact of deferred acquisition cost guidance that went into effect in January. We continue to refine our modeled impacts from the new guidance, and Slide 10 summarizes our updated estimates. While the 2012 total company earnings impact estimate remains at $35 million to $45 million, there is a slight shift in the business segment split. ","Moving to our balance sheet, our net unrealized capital gain position of $1.6 billion was unchanged from third quarter 2011. As a reminder, because of our strong asset liability management, changes in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest rate movement do not result in economic impact and do not force us to sell assets. In the fourth quarter, we completed a $100 million share buyback authorization, paid $215 million for our common stock dividend and closed on the Origin acquisition for approximately $60 million. Looking at capital adequacy, we estimate our year-end risk-based capital ratio to be 445%. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $1.6 billion of total excess capital, with approximately $600 million of the excess capital at the holding company. ","As outlined in Slide 11, in 2011, we deployed more than $1.1 billion of capital. This includes $350 million for strategic acquisitions, $550 million for opportunistic share repurchase, and the common stock dividend I previously mentioned. We expect our 2012 capital deployment strategy to be very similar to 2011. We believe our decision to move to a quarterly common stock dividend and our overall capital deployment actions demonstrate our commitment to creating long-term value for shareholders. ","In closing, we are very pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals of our businesses as we look into 2012 and beyond. ","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just a question on ROA. The slides are helpful and the guidance is a little bit lower, the 24 to 26 basis points. I'm just trying to get a perspective on how that might get better or get worse in 2013. It seems like the -- of the 3 bullets you laid out in your presentation, the consumer shift, as well as a lot of your initiatives on retention and efficiency, thus far, it don't change as much or maybe the market would get better. I'm just trying to think about how we want to think about that ROA a little bit longer term.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Randy, this is Larry. I think what you said makes a lot of sense. I don't think we'll see quite as dramatic shift in some of those consumer-driven components. Probably, the one that will have a little bit more impact is that -- and it's a good news event and that's the reality that we are writing on a relative basis, more and more of the business on the mutual fund platform. And it has 2 impacts: One would be, of course, the difference in DRD on the mutual fund platform. And the second is, which is a little bit muted because of the EITF change, but the second one is that we don't DAC anything on the mutual fund platform. So in the short term, that might look like a little less ROA but obviously, in the longer term, assuming again we can continue the kind of client retention we've had, it should contribute to actually improved ROAs over time as that new business becomes less as a percentage of the total.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And just a quick one on FSA as well, the number of cases, it kind of keeps falling and I think this had been a topic on previous calls, but the cases are larger. And is that just -- is that something we can expect to continue? Is that a function of less new business creation? Or is that something you're intentionally doing, maybe to take advantage of scale?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, there is -- our intention, Randy, is to write small, medium and large-sized plans, write them in all categories. And if you actually look at the number of cases written in 2011, they were up 30% over 2010. And you remember, the assets that were written in 2011 were up 27%. So obviously, we're continuing to focus on the small plan, but I'll let Dan comment on the trend overall for the platform.","Daniel J. Houston","Randy, it's certainly our intention to sell across the entire platform, small, medium and large. And with an 80% plus increase in TPA sales, that gives you some indication of our reemphasizing on the small case market. But a couple of stats relative to the startup plans and plan terminations. And again, this is a differentiation between not going to another service provider, but the plan terminated itself. What we've seen is start-ups are themselves are down by about 500 contracts on an annualized basis. And if we look at plan terms, those plan terms are still up by over 10% from a year ago. So most of the shrinkages occurred in that small, less than 500 life employer market. And until we start seeing the economy turn around and we see new startup plans and we see fewer plans terminating, we probably won't see a significant increase in that space.","Operator","Next question is from Ed Spehar with Bank of America.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The question I have is on the FSA ROA roll forward from 2004. And I guess if you -- could you give us some numbers around the pieces here? Like the general account shift, I mean, I would guess that might be 3 or 4 basis points of ROA. But maybe could you give us some sense of each of those pieces? And then a related question is, you mentioned the greater use of nonproprietary options as a factor behind the ROA decline. I thought that the impact to FSA margins was 0 if depending -- regardless of whether it was a proprietary or nonproprietary fund, and that the benefit of that was where you would see the benefit of a proprietary fund was in the PGI segment. So maybe help us understand that.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes. Ed, this is Larry. I'm going to make a couple of comments, then I'll let Terry kind of deal with that greater bucket about consumer driven. My comment on the nonproprietary, Ed, is really more focused around the issue on new business. The reality is that most of the time, when you write new business -- and the good news is we've been writing more than our fair share of new business, you're not going to drive as much proprietary assets into that new business initially. That's just the way it's worked for decades. And so as you write new business and you write greater volumes of new business on a nonproprietary platform, that will have some negative impact. It will have some degradation in the ROA. Now what happens over time, because of the expertise of our service staff and our relationship managers, we basically convert a lot of that nonproprietary money over to proprietary assets in Years 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as the investment lineup is reviewed and changed. And as I said in my comment, the great thing here is that our investment performance across our proprietary platform, and particularly on PGI, is exceptionally strong. It's exceptionally strong. So we do believe that we'll see that help us and become more of a tailwind as we go forward. So I'll have Terry comment on the consumer-driven component.","Terrance J. Lillis","Ed, this is Terry. As we look at the roll down of the ROA since 2004 to 2011, there's a lot of components that come into it. But mix of businesses, as the slides indicated, is probably our biggest driver of it now. I'm going to give you some metrics associated with each of these types of investment but you have to realize that these are revenues that are generated, expenses are allocated to it, the equity market and the DAC amortization, all that stuff that comes into play. But in general, the general account is probably the more profitable business because there are more risks associated with that type of investment and more capital associated with that as well. But that's probably in that 70, 75 basis points range would be a profitability. Separate accounts also have profitability associated with them of around 30 to 35 basis points. Now it is where most of the DRD or the dividend received deduction benefit is coming into play. And so that's why we separated that out. As that rolls down, that tax credit we get will probably be a little bit less. But 30 to 35 basis points would probably be a good profitability measure there. The proprietary funds and the nonproprietary funds, they, as you mentioned before, have similar profitability metrics. It also comes into play as to what types of investments that they're making, whether they are passive or active or they are international fixed income equity. All that comes into play. But roughly, we're talking 15 to 20 basis points of profitability for those types of businesses. And then the employer securities, which is more of a consulting relationship, where we'll be able to benefit as those participants cash out of their plan and retain them in other markets. That's probably in that 5 basis points. So if you weight those, you get roughly what we reported in terms of the ROA roll down in our slide deck as well. Now once again, as I mentioned, you got to take into consideration some noise. The equity market improvement or decline has some play as to how much DAC amortization, but that would get you roughly those numbers.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, that's extremely helpful. Just one -- did you say 15 to 20 or 15 to 25 on proprietary?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","15 to 20.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","15 to 20. And the number that you -- I can't recall if you had said -- when you gave your outlook, I think maybe you did about expected capital deployment of $800 million to $900 million for this year. Did you comment on how much of that you consider to be just the free cash flow generated versus how much of it is working down on the on balance sheet?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Well, I would say, Ed, that the vast, vast majority is really just coming. If you will, it's basically net income. So the vast majority of that -- I mean, we -- again, we have excess capital of about $1.6 billion that we want to hold an internal cushion probably around $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion. So we'd have what we have considered to be somewhere around $400 million, $450 million of sort of truly excess cash. We'll work that down, but that will be down over multiple years. So for the most part, that represents the net income that we expect in 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I've got a few. Firstly, just a follow-up on Ed's question. The difference between the annuity structure and the trust structure of 30 to 35 on the annuity and the 15 to 20 on the mutual fund structure, is that purely the DRD? Are there any other factors that's driving that change in profitability?","Terrance J. Lillis","Mark, this is Terry. I'd say that's entirely the DRD at this point in time.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a few other clarifications. Just -- I think you stated it in the presentation, but the 22 to 26 that you're looking at for 2015, that compares to the 27. That doesn't compare to the 24 to 26 that you're assuming for 2012 due to the DAC. Correct?","Terrance J. Lillis","The lower number, the 22 to 26 is on a post-EITF basis. That's a reduction. So that would be down from that 27 basis points that we are saying at this point in time. It's probably a good run rate.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sorry, just to clarify. So the 22 to 26 is assuming that the EITF 09-G is implemented. So it does compare to the 24 to 26 that you're assuming for 2012.","Terrance J. Lillis","The 22 to 26 is on the after DAC changes.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","No, the 22 to 26, Mark, is done on the same consistent basis as the 27 in 2011. If you can see from the slide, the slide says all years on a pre-DAC change basis.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Right.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, okay.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That was my interpretation. I just want to understand.","Terrance J. Lillis","I apologize.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I agree.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just a couple of questions on that. Firstly, in the explanations, you have kind of the market impacts, which I think was a negative 3 basis points. In your 22 to 26, are you assuming any recovery in some of those factors, planned terminations, et cetera? Or are you kind of assuming that where we are today is what we're going to look like 3 years from now with no recovery from market factors?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I would say -- Mark, this is Larry -- it would be our best guess that whatever trends we kind of see sort of operating in the market today, which would be, again, generally speaking, sort of a slow economic recovery, those are the trends that we would be sort of looking at between now and 2015. So we're not assuming any particular rapid recovery. We're not assuming any particular significant fall in the economy. We're assuming it looks more like it does today.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the capital deployment, picking up something you actually said in your opening remarks, is there any change in your thinking between M&A and buybacks in the $800 million to $900 million that's not allocated to dividends?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I wouldn't say there's any change in thinking, Randy (sic) [Mark], but the one thing that I always say is that M&A is very, very, very difficult to forecast. It's just very, very difficult to forecast. So when you'd say to anybody who sits in my seat, \"How much do you expect to deploy of that $800 million to $900 million, how much do you expect to deploy in M&A for the year?\" I mean, that would literally just be throwing a dart at the wall because you really don't know. What I would say is that we have a strategy that has probably the highest level of organic growth embedded into it. If anybody -- any of our competitors, whether it's on the insurance side or the asset management side. So for us, M&A needs to be the right M&A. It needs to be accretive. It needs to further augment our growth capability. And I would just say again, the real success for us in 2011, among other things, were the 3 acquisitions that we did. And if we could do that every year, I would be a very, very happy CEO.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Actually, just one final quick question. In the expectations around 2015 of 22 to 26, what's the assumed AUM growth annually?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Well, you'd have -- again, generally, Randy (sic) [Mark], what you'd have there would be about 8% equity market growth. You've got some of it in fixed income. So it's not going to grow as fast. You've got a little bit of it in international. It might grow at 9%. And then again, we'd probably be looking at net cash flow, about 4% of beginning account value. That would get you to your total AUM growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Suneet Kamath with Sanford Bernstein.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just one quick follow-up to Mark's question and I'll have another one -- excuse me. So looking at Slide 8 in the illustration for 20 to 25, as well as the title that says, \"pre DAC,\" given there seems to be this 2 basis point reduction from the DAC accounting change, if we did it on a sort of post-DAC basis, is the 22 to 26 really 20 to 24?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Correct.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess the other thing that I'm sort of struggling with -- and I appreciate the detail on the slides. But the other thing I'm struggling with is, if you look at this business from 2004 to 2011, you had, I don't know, 84% growth in average account values just using the numbers that are on your slide. So I'm just wondering why this business, why we're not seeing -- in addition to all the issues that you laid out that are resulting in a decline in the ROA, why we're not seeing massive positive operating leverage?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes. Suneet, this is Larry, and I'll ask Dan to comment as well. We are driving positive operating leverage into the business. As we've shown you on the slide, we think that we've driven somewhere around 4 basis points net, 4 basis points net of efficiency that there are truly scale advantages to this business. And we've commented before about how, in the recent years, we've added very, very -- actually sort of the net employee count is actually down a little bit, but we've obviously been adding business. But one thing I would say here though, just to kind of temper that enthusiasm because there are economies of scale, but at the same time, Suneet, it is absolutely critical that we continue to invest in this business. And that means investing in distribution. It means investing in the IT platform. It means investing to make sure we have the right asset management of things in place. So we will continue to invest in this business because it is critical for the long-term success. So we have to balance that. We have to balance the need to drive operational efficiency and scale, but we also have to invest in the business. And I think, again -- actually, again, net-net on a 4 basis points over the last 7 years, that's actually a pretty good record. But maybe I'll let Dan comment.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes, well said. So you set aside those consumer-driven issues and the market impact. I'm very optimistic that as the economy continues to recover here, we'll get those market, environmental component back into our operating earnings leverage. If you just look at the overall contribution that investments would have contributed to net cash flow this past year, it was  -- or to our account values, it was 0. That was the overall contribution that we derived from the investment from this $1 billion -- $100 billion plus platform. The other piece of what I would call very good news comes from Chatham, and it's, \"Alright, you've reduced your expense structure. You've made some investments. Are your clients satisfied?\" Among our emerging clients that we surveyed recently, we had 96% satisfaction. We look at our dynamic, where Principal is 42% above the industry benchmark. When you look at institutional, we were 36% above the industry benchmark. Overall satisfaction is 97% for institutional and dynamic. So not only are we becoming more efficient, not only are we launching new products, but we're retaining customers at very record levels. So I feel as if we are establishing a very solid base here for our ability to continue to be truly one of the nation's leading providers of these retirement services to small to medium-sized businesses. Hopefully, that helps.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, that's great. Just one last quick follow-up. On Slide 8 again, on this ROA versus ROE trade off for FSA, given your commentary, what was the rough ROE of this business in 2004 given versus where it is today?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I'll ask Terry.","Terrance J. Lillis","Yes. Suneet, this is Terry. The -- in 2004, that business had a much more capital intensive because of the general account mix. So it was probably just slightly below the net 20% range. And so it's now plus -- 25-plus percent. So as that ROA has declined, it's freed up capital, less capital intensive businesses, and you've seen the ROE increase significantly as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","One more on Page 8. Given what we're looking at here in terms of the return on assets, and particularly the proposed DAC, I don't think this was touched upon -- maybe I missed it. But the ability to take cash out, you've been at 60, 65 for a while. You've got up to around 70 now. If you're looking at just 2015 and this works out the way that you think, how much money do you think you can get out? What kind of percent?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Oh, you're talking -- I'm sorry. Steve, this is Larry. You're talking about the percent of asset -- the percent of the earnings that can be passed through to free cash flow?","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, that would be right.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes. So I'm sorry. So again, today, my guess is that we'll continue to be able to increase that. I mean, maybe it's in the range of 1 to 2 percentage points every year. So that sort of 65 becomes 67 in a couple of years, becomes 70 in couple of years. That sort of rate.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then if I can, just on a comment, I think, Larry, you mentioned that FSA pipeline was up 25% year-over-year. Does that imply that we could be looking at a 25% increase in sales for the first quarter?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I'll let Dan take that one, Steve.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes. Knowing that many of our members of the sales force are listening to the call, yes, absolutely. We do like to think that we can convert our pipeline to sales, but you know how this goes. We don't -- we're not 100% successful. We feel good about the pipeline for a couple of different reasons: One is, it isn't filled with just large cases. This isn't just an institutional place. We've got really great traction going on for small, medium and large. Our close rates are up from where they were a year ago and we feel optimistic about delivering a solid sales result for 2011, and we're off to a good start so far.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I would just say, Steve, it isn't like that to get a very solid sales result in Q4, we had to clean up the pipeline. Let's just say it that way.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. And then if I may, one kind of out of the blue, there was -- I think it was an investor. It was one of the trade reps. China, is something going on in the pension market in China? It looked like they might be going to some voluntary individual type of pension plan. Could you comment on that?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I'm going to let Norman comment on that one. He's been Mr. China here for several years. So Norman, take that one.","Norman R. Sorensen","Basically, what's been happening since 2005 is the Chinese government has established something called enterprise annuity, which is a clone of 401(k), but it doesn't have the tax advantages that 401(k) has in the U.S. So they've been perfecting this. So far, foreign companies have not been allowed. We are first in line for this, and our application stands back to about 2007. So we're very hopeful that sooner than later, we'll get approval to enter that market with a license for the enterprise annuity. By the way, it's not an annuity. It's a misnomer. It is really a 401(k) type plan. We have enormous confidence that, that market will be very, very large. And not only us, but a number of American companies will benefit from it.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So there's nothing new going on. It's just the same process that's been going on now for quite a while.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","That's correct.","Norman R. Sorensen","The process is underway, but they're perfecting it. For example, they're beginning to add some tax advantages to the thing. They see that employees will not contribute as much unless they have tax advantages. So the tax department is working on this. It's a whole roundabout of many -- various ministries that are trying to perfect this system. The key to us, to it obviously, is our entry. We need to get entry first since no foreign company has yet been allowed.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First question, in terms of we're seeing some better payroll data, small and medium-sized business data is finally showing a bit more momentum at least, sort of the best since '08. So, curious in terms of how we should think about the potential benefit to sales and flows, if this persists, and then ultimately, what that should imply from an ROA and ROE standpoint, things flowing through the bottom line.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Okay, well, I'll make a few comments on that. I think we'd said, going into 2011, Chris, as you remember, we expected to have sort of a muted economic recovery and we talked, for example, for full service accum, we talked about net cash flow that was in the 3% to 5% range. I would say, as you know, when things are sort of hitting on all cylinders relative to the economy and small and medium employers and we get the startup plans that Dan was talking about before, we'd expect that net cash flow to be more in that 4% to 6% of beginning account value range. So we're sort of 2\/3, 3\/4 of the way back towards what might be normal under the old conditions. I don't know if we'll get there exactly in 2012. It does look like we're inching closer to that. But whether we'll see that consistent growth in 2012, I don't know. My own personal view is that we've got to deal with some of the longer term and more systemic sort of budget issues. And we may need to think a little bit more about tax reform before we finally see that uncertainty, which has been sort of hanging over the American economy for some time. In terms of ROAs and ROEs and all of that, again, what I would just caution you about there is that again, with the change in EITF, you're going to see some negative impact on those ROAs. And the other thing, again, we're writing more and more the business on a mutual fund platform that doesn't allow any sort of DAC. So it looks less profitable in the early years, and more and more of the business are going on that platform. So that one is a little bit harder to predict. Anything else, Dan?","Daniel J. Houston","No. The only thing I was going to throw out is we're just trying to test the markets for the economic recovery. We know that we track in our Specialty Benefits division the number of workers covered in our life and disability and dental businesses and for the first time now, we have a full trailing 12 months positive growth. It's not up to where it has historically been at that 1.5% growth per year, but it's now turning positive. So again, we feel good that there is employment growth returning to the small to medium-sized marketplace.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up then in terms of the competitive landscape. There's been the finalization of the Fee Disclosure Act that came out yesterday. There's been a lot basically saying that if you're a small business, now is the time to really be shopping 401(k) plans because you're seeing a lot of sort of new entries, Vanguard's coming out with sort of a low -- another low-cost feature. So there's been a lot of sort of pressure around continued shopping. So I'm curious in terms of what you guys are seeing there, potential opportunities and risks from the recent environment.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Sure. That's a good question. I'll let Dan comment.","Daniel J. Houston","Chris, this isn't something that happened just this week or just this year. This has been going on for the last several years. All the advisers are out there, doing their jobs with their respective companies and they've put these plans out to bid. We see the fee disclosure frankly as a very positive move overall. It gives us an opportunity to clearly articulate our value proposition. It resonates with the advisers. It resonates with the plan sponsors. And then another note relative to an article earlier in the week about passive investment options and what's the implication on Principal, we have already in excess of $15 billion of passive investment options on our platform. About 24,500 of our plans, call it mid-30,000 some-odd plans, already have a passive investment option, and we have 6 passive options available to our clients. So we don't see that this is a pivotal event then all of a sudden the money migrates towards passive. And frankly, investment return for active managers like Principal Global Investors has really improved here in the last 12 months and we feel very good about getting out and not only talking about fee disclosure, but talking about TRS, talking about TPAs and option and profiling again so many of these new investment options that we have available to our customers through our relationship managers and our customer service associates that are deployed locally.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A.

This morning, I'll comment on three areas; first, I'll discuss first quarter results at a high level followed by more detailed comments from Dan and Terry; second, I'll comment on the environments surrounding our businesses and I'll close with some comments on capital management. As Slide 4 shows the Principal delivered strong results in the first quarter.","First quarter operating earnings of $326 million were up 3% over the year ago quarter and are the second highest quarterly earnings on record in what is normally a seasonally low quarter, this compares to a very strong year ago quarter that benefited from large real estate sales and higher prepayments which contributed to higher variable investment income across the businesses. Persistent macroeconomic factors including low interest rates, strengthening U.S. dollar and low inflation all massed excellent results in the first quarter. If you adjust for these macroeconomic factors, operating earnings growth would have been in the 10% to 12% range over the year ago quarter, demonstrating the strength of our team\u2019s ability to execute.","On a trailing 12 month basis, operating earnings grew 16% over the same period a year ago. Our ability to generate above market earnings growth, speaks to the strength of the fundamentals of our business and the power of our diversified business model. The first quarter was a good demonstration of our ability to strike the right balance of growth and profitability. Total company net cash flows of $9 billion in a quarter, were double the year ago net cash flows and contributed to record assets under management of $530 billion. Assets under management increased 7% over the year ago quarter, despite a $25 billion negative impact from foreign exchange rates. As I have said before net cash flows and assets under management are leading indicators of future earnings growth.","Next, I'll comment on the current operating environment for our businesses and some positive developments we see contributing to our growing momentum. The Principal is the leader in retirement and asset management, and we are passionate about helping people save and invest to meet their long-term financial needs. Throughout my 43 year career, I've served on many industry committees that focused on ensuring that we have an environment conducive to helping people prepare for retirement. I along with other members of Principal\u2019s leadership team have met with leaders in Washington and around the world, many times to advocate a system that works to benefit those who need it most, middle and lower income workers.","Since, ERISA was passed in 1974 I've seen approximately 40 different pieces of retirement legislation and regulation. The latest is the recent Department of Labor proposal potentially redefining the fiduciary rules for operating in the retirement business. While it's too early to know the precise impact of these proposed regulations and while I\u2019ll acknowledge there could be challenges I'll offer two initial observations; first, this proposed regulation will continue to further complicate the U.S. retirement plan industry. This increased complexity will continue the 30 year trend of market share shifting from second and third tier players the recognized leaders like the Principal; second, it's clear that the underlying intent of the proposed regulation is to encourage more in plan solutions for job changers and retirees. This should improve our asset retention rates overtime from what is today an industry-leading percentage of 50% to 52%.","I believe the net impact of the proposed regulation will shift some of the influence from the advisor and brokerage firm to the retirement services provider. Our value proposition as a total retirement solutions provider remains a key differentiator for advisors and for plan sponsors. Our focus on helping plan participants take the appropriate actions to save for retirement and our ability to serve plans of all sizes garners high client satisfaction scores year-over-year. We've received an average overall satisfaction score of 95% over the last three years in plan sponsor surveys conducted by Chatham Partners and the Principal, contributing to industry-leading retention rates. We will not waiver in our commitment to provide a industry-leading total retirement plan solutions, including new and innovative in plan solutions and to working with advisors who share our goal of helping people save.","Our established infrastructure of locally deployed and experienced sales and service professionals and strong advisor relationships are not easily replicated by new entrants into the markets we serve. As a global asset management leader we continue to also provide investors around the world the outcomes-based investment solutions they seek. Despite a general shift to more passive strategies among institutional investors we\u2019re still seeing strong interest in our fund line up that focuses on alpha generating strategies, continued strong investment performance and a broad platform of outcomes-based investment options drove nearly $5 billion of net cash flows in Principal Global Investors and Principal Funds in the first quarter.","As you know Principal International has become an increasingly important part of our growth strategy. Last month many of you took the opportunity to attend our investor event in San Diego Chile or listened to the Web cast. We hoped you came away with a much greater understanding of the power and long-term growth opportunity of our Latin American operations. The Principal's long time retirement expertise combined with marquee distribution partners in those countries uniquely positions us to capitalize on the tremendous opportunity created by the undeniable savings needs of the fast growing middle class in those countries. The management teams in Brazil, Chile and Mexico are keenly focused on being a leading retirement and asset management provider in these key markets.","Cuprum continues to perform exceptionally well and remains a leading pension provider in Chile. The opportunities in the voluntary market are taking hold as well with Cuprum in the top spot for voluntary market share among Chile and AFP providers. Voluntary sales in Chile increased 33% over the prior year quarter on a local currency basis. The success of Cuprum is further validation of the strength of our acquisition strategy Brazil perhaps was market-leading. Trailing 12 month net cash flows in PGBL and VGBL were 53% of the industry at the end of the first quarter. This contributed to the Company recently capturing the highest market share by total assets under management as well, according to third-party sourced data. Our leadership positions in Latin America and increasing presence in Asia are proofs that global expansion strategy we put into play more than a decade ago is absolutely the right one for long-term growth.","Finally I will provide an update on capital management. Our fee based business model allows us to generate free cash flow and strategically deploy it to create long-term value for shareholders. We've remained well-positioned to deploy capital through a variety of options in addition to supporting organic growth. Through the first quarter we've already announced plans to deploy more than $700 million of capital in 2015 on common stock dividend increases, a stock repurchase authorization announced in the first quarter and our planned purchase of AXA's pension business in Hong Kong which is on-track to close in the second half of the year. Last night we announced a $0.38 per share common stock dividend payable in the second quarter. A 6% increase over the prior quarter which is the eighth increase in the last 12 quarters. Additionally, the merger and acquisition pipeline remains active with selective opportunities to further enhance our global retirement and investment management platform.","Before I turn the call over to Dan I want to highlight one award that Principal received in the quarter which in my view is one of the more important recognitions we've received. The Ethisphere Institute recognized the Principal as one of the 2015 world's most ethical companies. The designation recognized our efforts to conduct business by fostering a culture of ethics and transparency at every level of the Company which drives quality for our customers, timely information for our shareholders and deep involvement in our communities.","In closing I remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth throughout 2015 and beyond despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. The Principal remains well-positioned for continued growth with proven success and a unique business model that positions us to provide long-term value for our customers and our shareholders. Dan?","Dan Houston","Thanks Larry, I will cover two things this morning. First I will share some positive trends in our U.S. Insurance Solutions business then I will talk about our truly outstanding results for our retail retirement and institutional investment platforms. In the supplement we provide trailing 12 month growth trends over the most recent five quarters. Individual life premium and fees have trended from a 2% decline to 5% growth and Specialty Benefits premium and fee growth has doubled from 4% to an adjusted 8%. Specific to sales 63% of individual life sales in the quarter were from the business market, as business owners continue to seek our expertise for their long-term planning needs, Specialty Benefits had its second highest sales quarter with 110 million in sales as we continue to be very well-positioned in our core market in diversified industries. Further, improving employment trends for small and midsized companies continues to contribute to underlying growth in our U.S. businesses. On a trailing 12 month basis Specialty Benefits in-group growth was 1.8%, its highest level since 2006.","I will now talk about our investment management platforms starting with a little more color around first quarter net cash flows. Principal Funds delivered record net cash flows of 2.6 billion, its 21st consecutive quarter of positive flows on a record 6.6 billion in sales. Mutual fund sales have grown every quarter over the last five quarters. Principal Global Investors delivered near record unaffiliated net cash flows of 3.2 billion for the quarter, on strong retention and demand from investors seeking income and yield. We continue to expand our global investment management presence with two-thirds of the unaffiliated assets under management coming from investors outside of the U.S. and clients in more than 70 countries.","Moving to our retirement platform, Full Service Accumulation flows were 1.7 billion for the quarter on 2.8 billion of sales and continued strong retention. Strong growth in reoccurring deposits was also contributor to flows reflecting employment growth in the existing plans and some traction around our retirement readiness initiatives. Principal International delivered net cash flow of $2.3 billion, an increase of 41% from a year ago on a local currency basis, this drove assets under management up 23% on a local currency basis. First quarter was also marked by notable third-party recognition for our asset management franchise.","First, and at the annual ranking of mutual fund families Barron's Magazine named Principal Funds a top five fund family based on one year performance and number nine in the five year timeframe. Second, for the third year in a row the Principal Global Real Estate Securities Fund received a Lipper Award as the best global real estate fund over a five year period. Third, our CPAM joint-venture was recognized as a 2014 best international equity portfolio manager and best three year international equity portfolio manager for the FTSE Shariah World Developed by the employee provident fund in Malaysia. And finally Cuprum ranked first for investment performance among AFP providers in Chile and four out of five strategies for the one and three year time periods at quarter-end. The fifth strategy ranked number two for both time periods.","Helping to drive these strong flows and recognition is competitive investment performance. 79% of our rated mutual funds have a four or five star Morningstar rating. And as the Slide 6 shows at least 85% of our Principal investment options were in the top half of the Morningstar ranking on a one, three, and five year basis at quarter-end. As you know targeted funds are an important investment option for plan sponsors, more than one-third of full service accumulation assets under management are in target date funds with 100% of our target date funds in the top half of Morningstar rankings across all time periods at quarter-end.","We recently announced changes to align Principal Global Investors and Principal Funds and created a more integrated investment management operation. I see this move is having meaningful benefits particularly in the areas of product development and distribution. The leadership changes were effective immediately later this year we will provide more information about changes to financial reporting in addition to addressing many of the other requests from stakeholders regarding our financial supplement. Our team continues to be laser focused on executing our global investment management strategy and providing innovative solutions to our customers. No doubt our best years are ahead and our growth in the first quarter continues to build on the strong momentum of our businesses. Terry?","Terry Lillis","Thanks, Dan. The teams have delivered strong results in the first quarter while operating earnings were aided by some one-time items that I'll address shortly the strength of our business fundamentals and proven ability to execute continue to drive our company forward. This morning I\u2019ll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter, net income including performance of the investment portfolio and I will close with an update on capital deployment. Total company operating earnings for the first quarter was $326 million up 3% over a very strong year ago quarter. And at the end of the first quarter return on equity excluding AOCI was 14% this is 100 basis points improvement from a year ago. If we adjusted the average equity for exchange rate movements as other companies with large international operations do, the return on equity would be 15%. Excluding the corporate segment 65% of the Company's earnings were generated from our fee-based business. This diversification allows us to perform well despite pressures from the continued low interest rate environment, flat equity market performance in the first quarter and a strengthening U.S. dollar.","Moving to Slide 7, we normalized first quarter 2015 earnings per share of $1.09 down by $0.04. The following one-time items positively impacted the earnings per share in the quarter. retirement and investor services accumulation earnings benefitted $0.03 from the true up of prior year dividend accrual in full service accumulation and a payment received related to the transition of part of our trust business to a third-party and Specialty Benefits operating, earnings benefitted $0.01 due to the net impact of a recovery of reinsurance premiums that was partially offset by higher expenses primarily from prior year true ups. After normalizing both periods, earnings per share increased 5% over the year ago quarter the growth rate was massed by items that we don't typically normalize for such as the strengthening U.S. dollar and Latin American inflation.","Now I'll discuss some of our business unit results staring on Slide 8. The accumulation businesses within retirement and investor services had adjusted operating earnings of $177 million. This is a 5% increase over adjusted first quarter 2014 results. Strong fee growth of 9% was offset by decline in variable investment income. Trailing 12 month net revenue was up 7% which lead to 100 basis points increase in pre-tax return on net revenue to 34% compared to the year ago quarter. Full service accumulation operating earnings were 114 million in the quarter down 4% compared to the year ago quarter after adjusting for the dividend accrual benefitted both periods, operating earnings increased 4% over the first quarter 2014. Net revenues of $330 million were slightly lower than a year ago quarter due to lower variable investment income.","Principal Funds first quarter operating earnings were $27 million, an 8% increase over the year ago quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis reported revenues were up 12%. Over that timeframe revenues net of pass through commissions were up 17% and our return on adjusted revenue was 35%. Record sales in the quarter along with higher sub-advisory fees contributed to higher expenses compared to the year ago quarter. Strong investment performance and flows contributing to a record account values of 128 billion at quarter end for the total Principal Funds complex. Individual annuities operating earnings were $37 million for the quarter. The results were positively impacted by strong fee revenue growth of 14% in variable annuities which helped to offset the impact of spread compression on our fixed deferred business. We expect normal quarterly volatility in this business.","Turning to Slide 10, Principal Global Investors operating earnings for the quarter were 31 million this is a 14% increase from the year ago quarter in what is typically a seasonally low quarter due to timing of certain expenses. First quarter 2015 benefitted from performance fees that were partially offset by lower transaction fees and higher expenses. The trailing 12 month pre-tax margin continued to increase at 26.6% from a reported 25.2% in the year ago quarter.","Slide 11 shows quarterly operating earnings for Principal International of $60 million. Slightly stronger than expected encaje returns were offset by a negative impact from inflation. Combined that revenue grew 21% on a local currency basis, the strengthening U.S. dollar suppressed operating earnings by 16% and assets under management by 21% compared to first quarter of 2014. Principal International continues to drive strong results with operating earnings growth in the mid-teens on an adjusted local currency basis.","Turning to U.S. insurance solutions operating earnings were 55 million a 27% increase over the year ago quarter. As shown on Slide 12. Individual Life operating earnings of $26 million were a 20% over the adjusted year ago quarter. Adverse mortality impacted the year ago quarter\u2019s results while first quarter 2015 had a return to expected claims experience.","Turning to Slide 13, Specialty Benefits adjusted operating earnings of $26 million were essentially flat compared to a strong first quarter of 2014. As a reminder, first quarter is impacted by seasonality and is typically the lowest quarter of the year. Premium and fees grew 9% over the year ago quarter on an adjusted basis and the adjusted loss ratio of 66% is within the targeted range of 64% to 70%.","For the quarter, total company net income was a record $440 million including realized capital gains of $13 million. Net credit related losses of $6.5 million were the lowest quarterly loss since before the financial crisis. Our portfolio continues to perform in line with expectations and better than our pricing models. The real estate market is performing very well and we expect mortgage and structured credit risk losses to continue to trend down. Net income benefited from $75 million of other after tax adjustments in the quarter. The adjustments included the deferred tax benefit related to the merger in Chile which was offset by a loss due to an update on our uncertain tax positions in the first quarter.","As outlined on Slide 14, we continue to target $800 million to $1 billion of capital deployment in 2015. In the first quarter 2015 we paid a $0.36 common stock dividend and we announced last night a $0.38 dividend payable in the second quarter. On the trailing 12 month basis the common stock dividend is 27% higher than the same period a year ago. In addition we repurchased $50 million of shares in the first quarter, which completed our previous authorization.","Our Board of Directors authorized a new $150 million share repurchase program in the first quarter that\u2019s still outstanding. We continue to first focus on anti-dilutive share repurchases and depending on other capital deployment options buying back shares opportunistically. Our 2015 expected capital deployment range also includes the $335 million already announced for the AXA Hong Kong pension business acquisition, which should close in the second half of 2015.","Our approach to capital deployment remains balanced and focused on increasing long-term value for shareholders. In closing while macroeconomics factors such as the strengthening U.S. dollar and low interest rates are providing near-term pressures, the strong business fundamentals and our proven ability to execute are driving continued momentum. We remain confident that our diversified business model positions us well for future growth across various macroeconomic environments.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan","I wanted to follow-up with Terry around capital deployment this year. I think you have the opportunity to call a 300 million of perpetual preferred stock in June. So just doing the math if you are still planning on deploying between 800 million and 1 billion you have already allocated 335 million to the asset transaction. I think you are going to pay at least 450 million common dividends. If you were to call the preferred with that, I guess is that factored into your 800 million to 1 billion estimates?","Larry Zimpleman","Hi Sean this is Larry, I will just get that over to Terry for a comment.","Terry Lillis","As we have mentioned before we have the ability to call the preferred shares in June. They were issued back in 2005 and they have a pretty high coupon rate, just a grossed up basis they are around 10% and 8.6%. So given our move to a more longer term investment operation that\u2019s moving to less capital intensive fee-based businesses we\u2019re reviewing our capital structure and we\u2019re taking into consideration all the audiences that we have. And so we\u2019re evaluating our options at this point in time, but to your question the $800 million to $1 billion does not include anything that we would do in terms of the preferred shares.","Sean Dargan","And then I guess a question for Larry. Keeping in mind that the DOL proposal. And given the fact that a low cost provider has made its intentions known that it wants to move into the small and medium business for a 1K plan business. Do you think that I guess I just want to hear your thoughts on if that\u2019s going to materially impact your business given that advisors may believe that they have increased liability in placing small and medium businesses in retirement plans?","Larry Zimpleman","So, a couple of things there that are frankly a little bit independent, but in the earlier remarks Sean you heard me comment with respect to the DOL fiduciary proposal. Now again I will say like others and other companies that have commented kind of early on in the process it's a 1,000 page think about that for a second it's a 1,000 proposed regulation and -- but the -- if I step back from that for a second I step back from the details what we're talking about is an even more complicated landscape for our retirement plans not just from a potential legal perspective but just overall more complicated and every time this happens and again I've seen it for more than 30 years it redefines what scale is in the sort of 401(k) and retirement plan business and it will continue to push I believe it will continue to push market share from second and third tier more local players that frankly just don't have a platform the compete they don't have an investment option line up to compete and these increasing kind of compliance and the regulatory costs are going to make it more and more difficult and as you know 70% of our business is takeover business in other words 70% of our business is business coming from second and third tier players who find it difficult to compete so I think that pressure is going to continue to be there.","Now with respect to Vanguard first let me say I have tremendous respect for Vanguard as an organization. I have tremendous respect for the business model that they have constructed. But I do believe Sean I do believe that that business model is not appropriate for every investor, every retail investor neither is it appropriate for every small or medium employer because the reality is most small and medium employers access the market through advisors and they need a lot of help and sort of handholding through the process of not only setting up the plan but servicing out on an ongoing basis and that's very difficult to do that well when you are a low fee player like a Vanguard is so again we respect them but we think that our advisor driven model is really going to be at the end of the day is going to be the winning model in the small and medium space. So, I hope that helps.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of with Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.","Steven Schwartz","This is going to be a long beating of the stead horse. But Larry on the DOL proposal to follow-up to Sean's comment one of the big issues that I see is that a differential compensation and that differential compensation will not receive the best interest contract exemption. I believe you pay on volume to your advisors as well as on fund choice and I'm wondering about your views of this as a sales model going forward?","Larry Zimpleman","Well I mean again I want to just start by saying I think it would be premature for any of us to necessarily draw conclusions at this point with respect to what may or may not be allowed I guess with respect to compensation generally what I would say is that we believe that transparency is the best way to sort of deal with overall to deal with compensation issues and I think that the department of labor would agree with that. And I can tell you that going all the way back to ERISA in 1974 we have been among the leaders frankly well out in front of many competitors in terms of making sure both at the time of sale and on ongoing basis that our retirement plan customers have a full and complete understanding of compensation both direct compensation plus any other volume related compensation that may be attached to that if for some reason volume related compensation were to go away for some fashion and frankly I don't know why it would because it is not necessarily any sort of amount that's taken from our plan participants but that were to go away we\u2019re still on a very level playing field we\u2019re still dealing equally with the other retirement service providers and to squeeze of course as you would recognize Steven the squeeze is actually going to come on the financial advisors and the brokerage firms the squeeze is not necessarily going to come on the retirement service providers.","Steven Schwartz","Believe me at Raymond James we\u2019re well aware of that. I guess what I'm interested in here though is fund choice as well do you see fund choice changing maybe being forced by advisors to move away from your proprietary offerings?","Larry Zimpleman","Well. That's another interesting question so let me make a few comments on that. First of all again we've never had a business model where we are trying to put proprietary funds on a platform in some less than clear fashion as a way to sort of try to stuff proprietary product inside a retirement plan. So, for example if you look at our target date funds Steven I would say we are today still one of the few that has outside managers in as a part of our target date fund line up, because while we think PGI is one of the top global asset management companies in the world the reality is they can't do everything perfectly and so they are going to be situations where it's appropriate to bring in outside managers. I think the real test here and the real issue is going to be do your proprietary funds compete do they compete in terms of investment performance, do they compete in terms of fees and if they compete in terms of investment performance and fees then I can't see any reason why the Department of Labor would just per se wall off your ability to put those investment options which are value-add for the participant why they would not allow those to be on the platform.","Final point I will make is as Dan commented when you are sitting here today with A5 or more percent of your investment options in the top half of their Morningstar peer group it would be our investment performance stands on its own, not only inside our retirement platform but frankly through the DC investment only space which has been one of the fastest growing parts of our business where you can kind of see the strength of our investment platform and the interest that it has not only to Principal's retirement customers but retirement customers of other service providers as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik Bass","One question on 401(k) sort of profitability, I guess as we think holistically for Principal overtime is it a more important driver the basis points kind of fee that is charged or is it the level of assets managed? When I say level of assets managed in sort of proprietary offerings?","Larry Zimpleman","Yes so this is Larry and I will have Dan probably want to comment as well. But what I would say is that there isn't meaningful -- there really is would be no meaningful difference with respect to proprietary versus non-proprietary. And we've tried hard over the years to have a business model that doesn't necessarily result in largely different returns by plan size. So for example your small plans are two or three times as profitable as your large plans. Now I am not saying there aren\u2019t some differences by size, now are there some differences that all of a sudden proprietary assets were a 5% of a single plan. But when you think it's really important financials are subject to the investment decisions that are made by plan sponsors and advisors. So I think again I just wanted -- I know some have commented on sort of a decline in margins from first quarter \u201914 and what I want to suggest is that margins in those periods of time were actually above what we would consider to be normal industry trend. So we\u2019re very pleased, very pleased with where we are today with respect to the return on net revenue for a full service accumulation. So I'll let Dan add a comment.","Dan Houston","Yes, that\u2019s right Larry the variable investment income a year ago was quite strong relative to the current quarter and certainly we saw traditional P revenue arise during that period of time. The other comment I guess I would make about the profitability profile of these plans has a lot to do with TRS. And so to the extent that we have more than just a 401(k) relationship there is defined benefit there is ESOP and there is deferred compensation that clearly becomes a variable in terms of the earnings that could be generated from that plan. The second component of course is our ability to retain assets. So those are number of plans we have the ability to retain assets in a Principal rollover IRA or somehow the stay within the plan and then the last part I would say is remember that we\u2019re paying market pricing or near market pricing for the majority of the plan assets managed by PGI and of course PGI is capturing a component of profitability as well. So I think you do have to look at this from a much more macro-comprehensive way than just simply getting it down to either what the investment option is or whether or not it is a small plan or a large plan.","Erik Bass","And that\u2019s what I was asking holistically to Principal combining kind of the revenue for both FSA as well as PGI. But I guess am I interpreting your comments correctly that based on your pricing you are targeting the same return whether you are assuming a plan say has 25% of the assets managed in Principal Funds or it has 75%. You would factor that expectation into your pricing and target a similar return for both cases?","Larry Zimpleman","That\u2019s certainly our intention, that\u2019s certainly and what I would call our core base pricing strategy. Correct.","Erik Bass","And would that pricing be sort of variable overtime if you saw the kind of allocation to proprietary funds shift in one direction or another?","Larry Zimpleman","Yes if there is any one thing I have seen in the last 30 years is a constant resetting of pricing and of course we have the benefit of having one of the most efficient record-keeping administrative platforms out there. And so again we keep on working on the expense side so that we can continue to be market priced and still in the meantime maintain reasonable margins. And if you look at that margin range of 30 to 32 for full service accumulation that certainly will be in the top quartile in the industry. So again I think we hit it on both sides, we hit it through effectively managing our expenses, and driving out efficiencies and we get it by having top-tier investment performance which certainly helps drive revenue and assets under management.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar","I wanted to turn back to the Vanguard as a competitor. And if I look at the market data if I understand correctly they partnered with the Census and the two basically have a top five market share in the under a 1,000 employee market. So when I think about Principal going out in China win a new account or I think you have mentioned in the past that you believe the market is underserved. What gives you the confidence that a new account that doesn't a retirement plan today would chose the high service higher fee proposition over a low service low fee proposition when they have nothing in the past?","Larry Zimpleman","Sure. Yaron so it's a very good question. So, let me just make a few comments and obviously Dan has a lot of perspective having actually have been in the field and done this in the real world, so I'm sure he\u2019d want to comment as well, but I cannot emphasize enough having again it's been a very long period of time in this business that retirement plans have to be sold they have to sold in the small employer marketplace, so say any under 100 life even under the 250 life market they have to be sold there isn't -- there are a very few small business owners that would sort of wake up this morning and say okay today is the day I've been thinking about and today is the day I'm going to go out there and get bids for my 401(k) plan it just doesn't work that way in the real world and this is why the financial advisors\u2019 role we believe is so critical in order to extend the coverage inside the under 100 life marketplace it is the advisor who is really the one who if you will creates the opportunity through conversations to business owner brings in several proposals because the business owner themselves aren't that knowledgeable in these issues and ultimately helps them make a good decision for themselves and their employees.","Now there is probably a 10% I make that number up I don't know what it is but there is a 10% to 15% of the market that the owner would consider themselves very financially sophisticated they might feel like they don't need a financial advisor but I will tell you Yaron my experience is that's a relatively small percentage of the universe and even that proportion probably doesn't really again have the capability to go out on their own and sort through record keeping systems, compliance issues, plan design issues on their own there was a day when we had a 401(k) plan in a box you could buy 401(k) plan from Principal and many other in the early days of the Internet on a self serve basis and quite frankly we folded that particular product after about three years because they wasn\u2019t enough demand for it so anyway I hope that helps and Dan wants to comment.","Dan Houston","Yes just a couple of comments and again thanks for the question firstly if I had to start is compounding on what Larry said it's more than just plan level service it is a participant services it's local service relationship management it's things like retire, secure and plan works when you sit down with an employee of less than 50 or 100 employees let's say they don't want an unsuccessful plan well what's an unsuccessful plan, it's low salary deferral low participation and confusion among the employees on what it is that is available to them it is the financial advisors that are representatives from Principal that make these plans come alive to the average small to medium sized business employee and that has everything to do with driving participation, increasing salary referrals, staying in the plan making sure they've got good investment diversity and then also just a reminder there is really two parts two halves to expenses related to the plan one is related to the asset management fee and one is related to the record keeping administrative cost.","When it comes to record keeping administrative cost whether it's a Census or Vanguard partnership or Principal those are going to be very-very comparable when you look at the fees associated with asset management then it gets out into an active passive debate I went back and took a look at our existing block of business, this is our existing 401(k) plan block and our merging plans of less than $5 million 96% of those plans today make available a low cost index option, 99% of all of our clients over $5 million already have a low cost at least one index investment option so again it's really not low fee low service high fee high service it is how do you want to spend if you\u2019re a investment lineup do you want to have heavily more biased on lower cost investment options so you can use our collective investment trust you can use our index suite and you can supplement that with more actively managed funds but then you have the separate conversation around record-keeping and administrative related expenses and believe me you do some of those economies of scale on the small case market so again if you already have a lot like Principal does over 35,000 plans we know how to service a small client that chooses passive or CITs as their investment option hopefully that helps.","Yaron Kinar","One follow-up Larry when you talk about the deal or proposal it sounds like it's actually you view that's more of an opportunity that many potential threat but I'm curious to hear your thoughts as to where you make see where you believe in these early days there could be more pressure on your business whether it is from a compliance spending side or other?","Larry Zimpleman","Yes, yes Yaron while you answered the question the -- and first of all in my comment what I'm trying to do is to just have people understand does that when there is a 1,000 page proposed regulation like this there is both challenge and opportunity and so we well understand the challenge side and many others do as well and my only point was to suggest that there is opportunity as well so the things that are challenges it's simply the kind of increased complexity and at least by my view and again this is based on many-many years of experience when you have a 1,000 page proposed regulation that is kind of sitting there and is not yet final and nobody really knows what the rules are I can assure you that\u2019s an environment where it's going to be very difficult to see many new plans be formed, right.","Because if you were thinking about putting in a 401(k) plan this sort of a thing at the margin is going to cause you to say you know what I'm going to wait a year, I am going to try to figure out what this regulation looks like. So sort of at the margin I think as far as new plans are concerned I think it's going to be a bit of a dampener, but on the other hand I think for us and for other retirement service providers that really have the scale and the technical expertise to compete again more importantly what\u2019s going to happen is there is still about a 1,000 players in the 401(k) industry today, a thousand players. There shouldn't be a 1,000 players in the 401(k) industry. And so there is going to be 500 of those that are going to be going through an analysis of whether they really want to stay in the business once all of those regulations are finalized and we understand what the new rules of the game are going to be.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.","Eric Berg","And my question is directed to either Larry or Dan whoever feels best to answer my question. Here it is, it's my sense that distributors think of conflict of interest not only in of actuals but also perceived. So my question is why isn\u2019t the conversion between the customer and the broker or the advisor going to go something like the following. Customer walks into the Smith Barney office, Merrill Lynch office the broker there recommends a Principal product as well as a majority of is 100% of Principal Funds broker points out outstanding track-record, and -- but in the end in order to avoid even the perception of conflict of interest the broker decides then in order to avoid liability is just too risky to have all these Principal Funds he is speaking to himself and he ends up recommending a different mix of funds with fewer Principal product and then would otherwise have been the case. Why isn't that going to be the discussion and the ultimate outcome here?","Larry Zimpleman","So again I will make a few comments and ask Dan to weigh in as well. So, with respect to the first part of your hypothetical, so the customer walks into Smith Barney or Morgan Stanley or whatever of course it works the other way, of course it\u2019s the Smith Barney broker who walks into the small employers office, because that\u2019s again the way these plans gets sold. And the first thing I would say is that of course that broker isn't going to present singularly a Principal proposal. I mean I don't know the average but my guess that in the initial stages any broker is going to present -- first of all after they go through a discovery process with the small employer what are you looking for, they could present as many as five to seven different retirement services providers and it's through subsequent conversion and involvement with our sales team which again is among the best in the industry and locally deployed that the financial advisor and the small employer then ultimately decide okay out of these five to seven quotes which one am I going to select who is going to be the retirement services provider.","Now you are correct that more and more today the choice of the provider, the retirement services provider is somewhat separated from the choice of who's going to manage the assets. So it's a kind of the second step decision. Again go back to what I said before, first of all when Principal's investment options are high performing options in the top half of the Morningstar peer group or the top 25% or the top decile and investment fees are competitive there isn't any reason in the world, there isn't any reason in the world that a rationale advisor and a small employer wouldn't see fit to put that on the platform.","I mean the reverse situation could be equally true. So again when I think when it comes to investment platform what you need to sort of think about is it's a very level playing field. And what PGI and some of our other chosen sub-advisors bring to us is product that is manufactured specifically for retirement plan clients. Many of the competitors that are out there are using kind of share class versions of their retail funds that aren't manufactured for the retirement space. So it's one of the unique differentiators of Principal and I think it\u2019s going to continue to service well albeit we\u2019re going to have to negotiate kind of a new set of forces and factors but again I remain very confident having seen us go through 40 years of these changes in legislation and regulation I'm highly confident that we\u2019re going to figure out the right way to compete whatever the new business model is going to be.","Dan Houston","To that point Eric and good morning this splitting of the decision between the plan services and the investment lineup that\u2019s been in place for the better part of five to 10 years, we have got people today whose sole job is to make the call on those alliance partners and the various investment management firms to educate them and inform them on the particulars of the Principal investment lineup. You see part of that is showing up in the results for DCIO. So again it's a split decision today Larry commented earlier on the earlier question relative to our very-very market competitive target date funds which find themselves in about 40% of the lineups that\u2019s already multimanager and that\u2019s in recognition of plan sponsors and advisors desire to have best-in-class in the investment lineup. So although there may be a bit more disclosure, a bit more debate and discussion I got to believe that the reasonable fiduciary the trusty and making these decisions looks at the fees, looks at the performance looks at the line up and is going to in a very similar way that they do today get the appropriate line up and no doubt it's going to be multi manager.","Larry Zimpleman","Eric Jim McCaughan want add just one quick comment as well.","Eric Berg","Sure.","Jim McCaughan","Eric it's Jim here. I just want to add to Dan's point about the split decision that we welcome transparency and so that should give us opportunities in the DCIO space the reason these plans sponsors and plan participants choose us is as have been described it is investment performance it's the multi-asset multi-manager products target date target risk increasingly global diversified income diversified real assets those are all extremely attractive carefully constructed products as Dan described specifically for the retirement market with those products transparency should help us not hinder out looking to the future and we see that great growth opportunity in the DCIO space if as one hoped the move continues to be towards greater transparency.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Jim could you give some additional color on the drivers of PGI\u2019s strong flows in the quarter and then also commentary on the current pipeline?","Jim McCaughan","On the institutional side we've been nicely building up flows and as Dan described of the strong international component a lot of different countries different parts of the world we've been nicely building up sales over the last two to three years and what happened in the first quarter is we continued the momentum of sales it was growth but not massive growth this is not an usual quarter in terms of institutional sales but we tightened up our act in retention and that was really the issue that led to the very-very the positive that led to the very strong institutional cash flow in the first quarter.","In terms of where it's coming from it\u2019s true that it's very diversified in terms of investment category the bias I would say there is if I look through our list of sales is towards different kinds of income biased products whether it's our assets underlying diversified income funds investment grade credit high yield preferreds emerging debt and then income equities has been a very strong capability for us real estate and REITs so it's very diversified across countries and across investment capabilities and really the difference this quarter to each quarter last year that made us stronger was greater retention.","Now looking forward I do see the continued development of the pipeline of new business as being very encouraging. We also has a senior management team get to see all our substantial clients on a very regular basis and I would say the tone of those meeting is currently extremely solid we feel very confident that the improved retention can be continued now clearly that depends on future events but the current tone is extremely good.","Ryan Krueger","And then one on the deal or proposal if I could, there is a carve out for plan brokers providing advice to plan sponsors on plans that's over 100 participants or over 100 million in assets in terms of the lack of the carve out for the smaller plans is that something you think is appropriate or would that be something that Principal would be lobbying to get changed in the final rule?","Larry Zimpleman","Ryan this is Larry. I mean again I can\u2019t size enough this is 1,000 pages this is proposed regulation I'm not going to sort of claim to be an expert on carve out versus non-carve out what I would say is that what seems logical and reasonable to me is that we have kind of a single set of rules with respect to investment line items we have a sort of single set of rules that we operate by whether it's whether it's a Fortune 100 plan or whether it's a 15 life tool and die maker in Rockwood Illinois so what we will lobby for once we sort of understand what the overall proposed rules are what we will lobby for is that we have a consistent standard really across all plan sizes we will argue for a level of transparency that's appropriate and the reason I say that is we are not -- I don't think there is advantages in saying a distributing prospectuses for example as an example of overkill, but we really do believe in transparency we really do believe in an informed customer we really do believe in working with well informed brokers who have great expertise to bring to the table in terms of advising the small plans sponsors so those are the things that will be focused on and I'm confident at the end of the day Ryan the Department of Labor wants to do the right things here we've had many-many meetings with them these are very experienced people who know this landscape very well and at the end of the day we share with them a responsibility to see retirement plan coverage grow in this country at the end of the day success in terms of retirement outcomes is going to depend on 401(k) plans and we are not going to go back to the client benefit plans and so we\u2019re going to continue to press the case to the Department of Labor that we need to have a fair rules transparent rules consistent rules, so that we can see retirement plan coverage continue to be extended among employers of all size. So Dan any comments you want to add.","Dan Houston","No, I think that really wraps up nice Larry.","Operator","And we've reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Zimpleman your closing comments please.","Larry Zimpleman","Well I just want to say thanks everybody for joining us on the call today. We are continuing to be very pleased by our results and our results in the first quarter and the ongoing momentum of our business. We think that the credit for the recent results and the strong momentum really goes to our experienced teams that are all over the globe executing on behalf of our customers every day. We do believe the macroeconomic conditions are going to remain challenging but as we look forward we think the diversified nature of our business is going to allow us to continue the positive momentum.

Welcome to Principal Financial Group's third quarter conference call. As always our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation related to today's call are available on our website at principal. com\/investor, due to the annual actuarial assumption review another significant variances at this quarter we posted some additional materials on the website including comparison of quarterly operating earnings excluding significant variances from the third quarter 2016 compared to the year ago quarter.","Keep in mind our reporting, structure changed in the fourth quarter 2015, following a reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO Dan Houston and CFO Terry Lillis will deliver some prepared remarks then we will open up the call for questions.","Others available for the Q&A include Nora Everett, Retirement and Income Solutions, Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors, Luis Valdes , Principal International, and Deanna Strable, U.S. Insurance Solutions and Tim Dunbar, Our Chief Investment Officer.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company's most recently annual report on Form 10K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed by the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ","Before I turn the call over to Dan, I would like to remind everyone of our upcoming Investor Day event in New York City on November 16th. Our executive team will provide strategic updates on each of our businesses with a particular focus on some of the key topics impacting our businesses. Please let me know if you haven't received an e-mail invitation. We look forward to seeing you in a couple weeks. Dan?","Dan Houston","Thanks, John, and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning I'll focus on my comments on three areas, I'll characterize results for third quarter and through the first nine months of 2016. I'll share some thoughts on execution highlights as we continue to extend our distribution reach and expand our product and service solutions set.","I'll close with some thoughts on certain external factors and how they are impacting our outlook for the future. I'm very pleased with the third quarter results with reported operating earnings of $336 million excluding significant variances. We had double digit growth in operating earnings when compared to a year ago quarter. Terry will provide more details on the significant variances for the quarter including the annual actuarial assumption review later in the call. Compared to a year ago we increased assets under management or AUM by some $80 billion or 15% bringing AUM to record $596 billion as of the end of the third quarter.","As shown on slide 5, our longer term Morningstar investment performance remains among some of the best in the industry. As of September 30th, 90% of Principal mutual funds separate accounts and collective investment trust were above the median for the three-year performance and 86% were above the median for the 5-year performance. For 10 consecutive quarters, at least 85% of our investment options have been above median for 3 and 5 year performance, though our 3 and 5 year investment performance remains among the best in the industry, the one year number with 59% of funds above median is off its highest.","Because of investment needs of our customers we focus on managing assets for retirement and other long-term strategies. We have created a leading array of multi-asset, multimanager outcomes oriented solutions and we have purposely designed our investment platform to provide diversification and non-correlation for different teams within key asset. Between the strength of our investment teams, our global research platform and our process, we remain confident in our ability to continue to stand out among active managers in both performance and net cash flows.","With multiple sources of demand for our investment solutions, we're on track for a 7th consecutive year of positive net cash flows. By comparison, approximately half of the funds complexes were in outflows between 2010 and 2015, according to data from the investment company institute. Our track record of positive net cash flows during this same time frame underscores the benefit of our diversified integrated business model with strong diversification by investor type, asset class and geography and strong integration of our businesses enabling us to meet investor needs as they transition from accumulation into retirement. While Terry will cover these topics in more detail, I'll provide a couple of comments on expense management and capital deployment. As stated on previous calls, we continue to focus on aligning revenue and expense growth.","Over the trailing 12 months, despite flat equity markets a strong U.S. dollar and competitive pressures we have managed expenses and improved margins, driving growth and operating earnings compared to a year ago. I'm particularly proud of this ultimately in light of 8% higher average AUM on a year-to-date basis, the additional cost to implement the department of labor's fiduciary rule as we have quantified in last quarter's call, an increased investment in key areas including technology, product development and our global brand.","Through the first nine months of 2016, our capital deployment strategy has enabled us to deploy more than $600 million between common stock dividends, share repurchases and increased ownership in boutiques. As announced last night we have included our quarterly common stock dividend for a third time this year.","Moving to execution I'll start with enhancements to our solution set. In the third quarter we have launched five new funds bringing year-to-date launches to nine. Our global product strategy contemplates both opportunities and challenges, including aging global populations and growth in emerging market middle class, potential regulatory disruption and a trend towards lower cost product structures.","We remain purposeful in our approach, building our four key areas, our suite of outcomes based funds with a particular focus on income solutions, our Alternative investment platform to enhance diversification and manage downside risk, our international retail platform in light of tremendous opportunities in Latin America, Asia, and Europe, and our ETF platform as part of a larger effort to address increased demand for lower cost options and provide cost effective alternatives to passive management.","Beyond our investment platform we are also highly focused on digital solutions that are shrimp already and faster, address how future generations will buy financial services and reduce barriers to access, allow easier decision making and eliminate pain points for our customers and advisers. Throughout 2016 I have shared initial success with recently launched digital enrollment like Easyelect and My Virtual Coach as another example we launched an online application for our individual disability income products earlier this year. Since the launch we have received 2400 applications electronically, nearly 20% of the total volume. This is helping fuel strong sales within specialty benefits.","Moving to distribution, we continue to make meaningful progress toward getting our funds on third party platforms recommended list and model portfolios. Through nine months we have had more than 40 placements in total putting 30 different funds on 18 different investment platforms with success across asset classes. I also want to comment on the joint venture with China construction bank, not included in our reported AUM, China reported a record $127 billion of AUM in the third quarter 2016. A majority of the recent net cash flows in China have been short-term investments meaning lower fees and shorter duration in nature.","The results illustrate two important points, one, the magnitude of the opportunity in China, and two, the power of our partnership with China construction bank. Even more so as we expand our relationship and execute on our strategic cooperation agreement focused on asset management and pensions. China is now the third largest contributor to the pretax operating earnings within Principal International with the trailing 12 months pretax operating earnings more than doubling from a year ago quarter. ","I'll close with sharing some thoughts on the future. First and foremost we go forward from a position of strength. Importantly we are also seeing certain opportunities further materialize and certain head winds beginning to abate. First I will express my optimism around Latin America. In 2016 the tide seems to be turning in the regions largest academy in the Brazilian real and the Brazilian's benchmark index, Ibovespa, strengthening our third quarter net cash flows in Brazil increased 50% compared to a year ago quarter .","On the continued strategic of BrasilPrev, our joint venture with [indiscernible] we have generated at least a $1 billion of positive flows in Brazil for 12 consecutive quarters. Importantly we are taking market share from the next two largest competitors. Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil is gaining traction as well delivering its best quarter of net cash flows on record. Despite recent press we remain optimistic about Chile, our value proposition in the AFP market is intact as we continue to be a market leader in long-term investment performance and customer satisfaction.","To be clear, our 2013 Cuprum acquisition is not under review by the Chilean regulatory authorities. They are once again reviewing the merge of two legal entities in Chile that gave rise to the deferred tax benefit we recognized in 2013. The merger has already been reviewed and approved twice and we have no reason to believe it will be overturned. Over recent weeks, Luis and I have had multiple opportunities to meet with senior level officials in Chile. There is increasing awareness of the pressure on pay as you systems and the ability of workers to support a growing number of retirees who are living longer.","In turn they are increasing awareness of importance of voluntary contributions to achieve adequate income and retirement. We'll continue to be an advocate for retirement readiness and active participant in the pension dialogue, not only in Chile but around the world.","Additionally lower for longer interest rating present an opportunity and we continue to expand our suite of income solutions including guarantees to meet the increasing demand nor yield and security. Additionally, our business mix makes us less rate sensitive than many of our peers. Lastly, while the DOL fiduciary rule clearly presents challenges, it also presents opportunities. During the third quarter one of our top third party distributors communicated a decision to reduce their proof of record keeper list by more than 80%. Principal was selected as one of their approved providers. We expect this consolidation trend to continue.","In the meantime we'll continue to strengthen relationships by helping our distributors work through implementation. In closing, our business fundamentals remain strong. While I'm pleased with our financial results through nine months, I'm even more satisfied with our execution. We have again made meaningful progress towards enhancing distribution, expanding our solution set and strengthening relationship with customers and advisers.","I look for us to continue to build momentum as we wrap up 2016 and move into 2017 and for that momentum to translate into long-term value for our shareholders.","Terry?","Terry Lillis","Thanks, Dan. This morning I'll provide commentary on operating earnings for the quarter, net income including performance of the investment portfolio and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. Principal reported $336 million of operating earnings for third quarter 2016 up 6% over the year ago quarter driven by over 10% growth in quarterly average AUM.","Total company net cash flows were $7 billion for third quarter and $20 billion on a trailing 12 month basis. Strong net cash flows and positive market performance drove total company AUM to a record $596 million in third quarter. Keep in mind that total company AUM excludes $127 billion of AUM in China that also contributed to quarterly earnings. That's shown on slide 6 there were three significant variances from expectations reflected in third quarter 2016 operating earnings. This slide provides the line item impact by business unit of our annual actuarial assumption review and model enhancements, a single large real estate sale and higher than expected encaje in Principal international.","Consistent with prior years, we completed our annual review of actuarial assumption and model enhancements in the third quarter. The review reflected a lower interest rate environment in 2016 compared to what we expected a year ago and other retypements to our actuarial models. As part of the review, no changes were made to the long-term interest rates or the time it takes to get to the ultimate rates.","The actuarial assumption review decreased third quarter pretax operating by $74 million. However, third quarter operating earnings benefited from a real estate sale that generated higher than expected variable investment income. As a reminder, real estate sales are part of our overall investment strategy but can add volatility to any given quarter. This significant variance increase third quarter recorded pretax operating earnings by $3.5 million, third quarter operating benefits from higher than expected encaje performance in Chile, and increased reported pretax operating performance by $8 million.","Slide 7 provides a comparison of the significant variances in operating earnings in third quarter 2016 versus the year ago quarter. Both quarters were impacted by actuarial assumption review and other significant variances. Third quarter 2016 reported earnings per share of $1.15 was up 8% over the year ago quarter excluding significant variances in both periods earnings per share of $1.22 was up 17 percent from the prior year period.","At the end of the third quarter, trailering 12 month return on equity, excluding AOCI was 13.5%. However, excluding the impact of both 2015 and 2016, assumption reviews, this measure was 14% in third quarter 2016 and third quarter 2015. Now I'll discuss the business unit results starting on slide 8 with retirement and income solutions or RIS-fee. Third quarter reported operating earnings of $131 million increased to 57% from the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on slide 7 third quarter pretax operating earnings were $145 million, a 6% increase from the year ago quarter.","This was driven by a combination of growth in business and disciplined expense management. The fundamentals of the business remain strong as RIS fee net cash flows were a positive $1.4 billion in the third quarter. The positive net cash flows were driven by quarterly sales of $2.7 billion. A 7% increase in reoccurring deposits from the prior year quarter and continued song plan retention levels. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, pretax return on net revenue was 34% in third quarter 2016. We expect to end the year at the high end of our guided range. ","Turning to slide 9, RIS spread reported third quarter operating recordings of $76 million up 52% over the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on slide 7, RIS spread third quarter pretax operating were $66 million, a $14 million increase over the prior year quarter. Average account values grew 13% over the same time frame driving growth and net revenue. Continued low interest rates negatively impacted retail annuity sales while pension buyout and investment only businesses continued to be opportunistic. We continue to meet our pricing discipline when deploying capital in this space. Trailing third quarter pretax return on net revenue was 60% above our guided range.","Turning to slide 10, Principal Global investors reported pretax operating earnings of $113 million in the third quarter an 18% income over the year ago quarter on 12% growth in AUM. This demonstrates the continued benefit of scale in Principal Global investors. Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to a record AUM of $397 billion with more than 4 billion-dollar of positive net cash flows in the third quarter. Our unique boutique strategy is proving successful and allowing us to provide value added solutions that continue to resonate with clients. On a trailing 12 month basis, PGI's pretax return on an adjusted revenue was 35%, and at the higher end of our guided range.","As shown on slide 11, reported third quarter pretax operating earnings for Principal international were $84 million, up 65% from the year ago quarter increasing record operating earnings in BrasilPrev. Encaje performance was higher than expected during third quarter 2016. But was more than offset by the impact of the actuarial assumption review, excluding the significant variances shown on slide 7, third quarter 2016 of pretax operating earnings increased 25% over the year ago quarter. ","Foreign currency translation was a $1 million benefit to pretax operating earnings for the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter excluding significant variances. This is the first time in the past 5 years we have experienced tail winds from currency translations in earnings when compared to the prior year quarter.","As slide 11 shows, there can be volatility from quarter to quarter in Principal international's growth rates, excluding significant variances and on a constant currency basis, Principal international continues to produce mid teens growth in pretax operating earnings on a trailing 12 month basis.","Principal international's net cash flows for the third quarter were $2.5 billion.","Primarily driven by $1.8 billion from Brazil and a very strong $1.1 billion from southeast Asia. While not included in Principal international's reported net cash flows, China reported third quarter net cash flows of nearly $27 billion, another very strong quarter that contributed to China's 51% growth in pretax operating earnings from a year ago. Excluding the significant variances shown on slide 7, Principal international's trailing 12 month combined pretax return on net revenue was 38% and within our guided range. ","On slide 12, specially benefits reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were $7.4 million, up 13% over the year ago quarter, excluding the significant variances shown on slide 7, pretax operating earnings were $56 million, an increase of 5% from the prior year quarter driven by underlying growth in the business. Additionally, especially benefits hit a milestone during the third quarter and crossed $2 billion of premium. On a trailing 12 month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review our loss ratio of 64% reflects continued strong underwriting, pretax return on premium fees and specialty benefits was 12% on a trailing 12 month basis excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review. This was at the top end of the our guided range.","As shown on slide 13, individual life reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were a negative $4 million, however, excluding the significant variances shown on slide 7, individuals like pretax operating earnings were $40 million, 8% lower than the prior year period. While mortality for both quarters was within the expected range, third quarter 2015 experienced favorable mortality while third quarter 2016 mortality was in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12 month pretax return on fees was 15% and was within the guided range. Corporate's third quarter pretax operating losses were $58 million, in line with our guided range. For the quarter, total company net income was $308 million, credit rating loss, $7 million. ","Turning to slide 14, we have deployed and committed nearly $730 million of capital so far in 2016. In third quarter 2016, we paid a $0.41 per share common stock dividend. Last night we announced another $0.02 increase in our common stock dividend bringing the fourth quarter, $0.33 per share. We take a long-term view of our balanced capital deployment strategy looking for ways to increase long-term shareholder value and improving our financial flexibility.","While capital deployment may fluctuate quarter to quarter, we expect to be within our $800 million to $1 billion guided range for full year 2016. As we near the end of our prepared remarks, I'd like to leave you with a couple of thoughts. We continue to manage through the competitive pressures and volatile macroeconomic environments to forecast growth in revenue. We have aligned growth and expenses accordingly as we focus on balancing growth and profitability while still investing in our businesses. As a result our efforts to manage expense growth have contributed to operating earnings growth and margin expansions over the trailing 12 months.","In conclusion, I'll echo Dan's earlier comments, third quarter was another strong quarter, adding to a very strong 2016 thus far. I'm very excited as I look ahead and see great momentum going into the end of the year, and 2017. This concludes our prepared remarks.","Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo Securities","Sean Dargan","I have a question about Chile, and Dan, you addressed the issue at length, but realizing that the merger itself is not under review, what is the status of the tax benefit that you have on your books and if that was unwound, what would that do to earnings in the quarter in which it was unwound and secondarily, I'm wondering if you see any impacts to coupons flows next year as fallout from these protests?","Dan Houston","I'll have Terry hit the tax piece, and Luis make some additional comments. First let me come from the perspective, we have every reason to believe that this tax credit is very much intact. There are actually 48 other companies that took the exact same tax credit back in 2015 so again, we feel very, very confident we'll prevail.","We have been in Chile now since 1995. There's 21-year history of providing chill with retirement solutions on the voluntary, certainly on the payout and now the mandatory program. We have great performance, we have strong customary service, we are well-positioned in Chile to continue to do that.","We employ 15,000 individuals down there that go work every day trying to strengthen that program and again as you noted in my prepared comments we have had this codified now twice, so with that as a bit of a backdrop on a very, very stretch, if you will I'll have Terry comment on the tax implications if it were to be overturned.","Terry Lillis","Just to put it in context here, 2015, we recognized the benefit of the merger with the AFP with one of our subsidiaries in Chile. As a result of that merger, we were allowed to amortize or reflect the amortization of the intangible in our tax calculation that amount was $105 million at that point in time, and we ran it through another after tax adjustment.","Now, that would be reflected over a 7-to-10 year period on a quarterly basis, so it wasn't going to have a significant impact in any one particular period but if we were to have that overturned, we would have to unwind that $105 million and again, we probably run it through another after-tax adjustment, as we did when we recognized the benefit.","Dan Houston","Luis will make a couple comments relative to the flows in Cuprum and your thoughts there.","Luis Valdes","Talking about our flows in Chile that you might see in our page 16 in the supplement. It's important to say if you're paying attention now [indiscernible] to put inflows remains impact, the 1.4 billion level, so the problem we have had is about outflows during this particular quarter. Two main factors are affecting our outflows. One is affecting the whole industry. There's a new discussion about a potential pension reform in Chile is making more customers have and are anticipating their retirement decisions so they are taking their money out from their SPs and mostly they are buying a compulsory annuity as a [indiscernible] in life insurance companies. That is one factor which is affecting the industry, and it's affecting Cuprum as well.","The second thing is further market aggressiveness in the transfer market in the SPs, certainly they're using the window of opportunity that the headlines and press is providing to them about our merger. We are working and paying a lot of attention about asset retention and client retentions because all our fundamentals remain very solid, investment performance and client service remains among the best in the industry, so we're taking care of all of that, and I'm saying that our people is paying a lot of attention about that, and as I'm saying, we continue good inflows and we are paying a lot of attention about these two factors.","Having said that, it's important to remain Sean that in Cuprum we don't charge fees over AUMs. Instead we charge fees over flows on contributions and monthly contribution, so o this affects particularly specific what happens last quarter has a very marginal impact in our financials.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","And RASB, your margins are currently running ahead of plan. I know you talked about the high end for the year of the 28 to 32% range. Is that still the right general range to think about going forward or has anything changed given some of the expense management that you have been able to complete?","Dan Houston","As you know, we don't update on the ranges that we provide but what I would say generally is we still feel as optimistic about the long-term potential for our full service accumulation business for a variety of different reasons, but with that let me have Nora frame for you our expectations.","Nora Everett","We and Terry mentioned this as well. We still expect to be at the high end of our outlook guidance, the guidance that we gave last year, and we have mentioned that other the last couple of earnings calls. What you saw this quarter were a couple of things. Obviously even when you adjust for the annual assumption review and adjust for the real estate sales that were called out, we're still going to be this quarter, lower with regard to our amortization expense, and we have got some expense timing issues as well.","Great quarter, we're very confident with regard to our ability to manage expenses going forward, but you're always going to get some lumpiness with regard to timing of expenses and we got the benefit of some of that this quarter, so high end of the range for sure, great quarter, and we look forward to continuing to extend the success of the business.","Dan Houston","And just a reminder on that point, Ryan, that if you look at the trailing 12 month S&P performance on the average contribution it's actually only up 0.4% so there really is a lot of heavy lifting going on in terms of managing the expenses and driving reoccurring deposits and improving overall quality of these plans.","Ryan Krueger","Thank you. And then Terry, could you provide some more detail on the interest rate assumption changes you made, and I guess what your long-term assumption is at this point?","Terry Lillis","As we talk about the assumptions, there's more to it than just simply the interest rate assumptions. We look at all the experience adjustments in our annual actuarial review that we do, and if you recall, if you recall in 2012 and 2015, we took a look at our long-term interest rate assumption and we brought those long-term ultimate rates down, but probably more importantly, we changed the trajectory in order to get to that longer term rate.","We went from a relatively short period of time to over 10 years in order to get to it. Now, you're very well aware that the long-term interest rate assumption really varies by product that we have and we'll be across the yield curve and it will also reflect not only what the risk free rate is, but it will also have an impact for the spread that we have, the default rate goes into the assumption which we don't disclose any of that information as for pricing and proprietary purposes, but to try to give you maybe a little bit more insight in terms of using as a proxy, a proxy of the yield curve, we talk about the 10-year treasury, and that seems to be a pretty good proxy to use.","A year ago when the 10-year treasury was about 2%, we talked about basically a 25 basis points increase to that rate over a 10-year period. Now, the expectation, then was that we would be up by 25 basis points this year, but as you're very well aware, instead of going up by 25 basis points, it went down by 50 basis points or so, the 10-year treasury. However, as we look in terms of our forecast into the future, which everybody will have a forecast as to what they think. We take into consideration what we're hearing in the industry, what we're hearing from rating agencies, what we are hearing from auditors, what we are hearing from different groups, economists, central banks, investments, we take all of those things into consideration, and we feel very comfortable where we are at this point in time.","We have actually moved out and keeping that time period, that 10-year time period in order to get to our long-term rate consistent.","But we're from a different starting point, so you'll look at going out into the future, what we're hearing anecdotally is that others are starting to increase their trajectory or their time period as well but still we feel that our ultimate rate as well as our time period in order to get to the rate, we're very comfortable with that at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss","A lot of commentary on the call in terms of expense management, driving the margins, I think more broadly speaking there's concerns of secular pressure on fees in both retirement and asset management. Can you talk about what you're seeing both in the retirement space as well as asset management and the different asset categories that you manage in terms of the fee side of the equation.","Dan Houston","First let me kind of hit the macro sort of expense initiative that we have, and we have always had a lot of expense discipline around Principal. What we have tried to do is to make sure, Seth, that we're lining our expenses with the revenue that we're able to generate, and as part of that process, as you might expect, we rigorously go through the organization to determine if there's services that we're providing that aren't valued by our clients or they're unwilling to pay for, so I would say it's basic blocking and tackling, making sure that we have a disciplined approach to expense management.","Now, having said that, we're also continue to go make some very significant investments around digital, and technology, certainly we have talked about the expenses related to the DOL implementation and we're wanting to make sure we're still planting seeds within all of our businesses, so we have future growth. So I don't want anybody to walk away from the call or quarter and think somehow it's taking out all expenses at all costs, because that's just not the approach that we would take here at Principal, so with that as a backdrop as it relates specifically to fee growth and revenue growth along the lines of business, I'll have Jim go first and have Nora make additional comments.","Jim McCaughan","If I look at the industry and institutional, the fee pressures depend a lot on which product and which asset category you're in. If you want a rule of thumb, over the last three to four years, passive fees for institutions have roughly halved.","When you look at large scale, large cap core assets and fixed income and equities where there is a passive alternative, there has been intense fee pressure and in the industry they have maybe halved over the last decade or 15 years. There is a whole area however of relatively newer, relatively less liquid, relatively less efficient markets and those are areas where there is still quite a lot of pricing power and the fees have not moved for at least a decade, and that includes areas such as real estate, both public and private, high yield, other investment grade fixed income and preferreds all of which are areas we're strong in, and that's why our revenues have been quite buoyant, relative to assets compared with most of the industry.","So we have some carefully chosen last liquid categories for active management still pays and where clients benefit from it and are prepared to pay. In the retail and mutual fund area, you can add some of those areas as helping the general performance, but the other piece to this in terms of where fees are going is our strength in multiasset, multimanager strategies which are designed to produce an outcome thiazide by clients.","Here I think diversify income, diversified real asset. Those are areas where the outcome is beneficial to the client so the pricing is more resilient than it would be for the more commodetized passive and core areas. We feel pretty good right now about where we are relative to the fee pressures in the industry. We need to become more efficient because pricing is going down, but I would say that relative to the industry we feel very well placed.","Nora Everett","I'll be brief. To Jim's point, we have a couple things going in our favor here, one is in the retirement area, tremendous scale with regard to services and record keeping in that platform, just a tremendous scale and with the consolidation in the industry we're going to be a net gainer on that front.","Two, and this is really critical, part of our retirement franchise, well, two pieces of it, one is what we call total retirement suite, we are one of very few competitors in the U.S. where you can have one stop shopping with regard to your DB, your DC, non-equal, and ESOP plan, and that is hugely valuable to our plan sponsors and advisors with regard to the one stop shopping, and three and this is another critical piece is we have one of the most extensive layups of target dates in the U.S., and they are multimanaged, which is a real benefit in this environment.","Multi-managed and hybrid, in other words, the choice not only around sub advisers but also around passive versus active. We don't pick a position in that space. We have the choice in what we have seen add planned sponsors, really, really taking that particular investment product and putting a premium on that and the ability to have the one stop shopping in addition to that qualified default option.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling Partners","Humphrey Lee","Just a follow up to Luis in terms of what you're seeing in terms of Chile pension reform, what can you see in terms of potential impact to the industry?","Luis Valdes","Let me say first that we\u2019re very pleased about the fact that finally the Chilean government is taking serious actions in order to review and propose a more comprehensive pension reform in Chile that it might sound counter-intuitive. But I have to say also that Principal since the early 2000 we have been a strong advocator in order to review the pension reform in Chile in a much more comprehensive way as I said, the pension system as you know is the golden standard in system [indiscernible] but it has some issues that has to be addressed about adequacy, and the most important problem is the one that's created, this kind of unrest you have seen in pillar zero. It has nothing to do with the ASPs, the pillar that\u2019s been called a solidarity pillar, in which the governance is in charge of that pillar is very much more the one that provides a safety net for low income segment in Chile and most of the low income segment, they haven't been part of the labor force they were, they had a few contributions AFP system.","For you to know, not this government, you know, many governments, even, you know, in the past, they took a kind of free ride with the pension system. The total government retirement expenditure in the pillar zero is 0.7% of the GDP. Average for countries is OECD 18% up to 20%.","So here we have the most important issue about adequacy in the pension system. The Chilean government, they send very quickly, the bill in order to raise the minimum pensions in pillar zero upto 10% last week. So they're reacting very quickly. Having said that, the government has to pay a lot of pension of Pillar O and Pillar Zero and that\u2019s the most important initiatives about this whole discussions are going with.","The second thing that we have to address in Chile, and this discussions about the self-employed segment. You know, they are not well covered. They don't have any compulsion contribution. They don't belong to any system, and they have to. The third element is to put some adjustment for the ASP system, which our pillar one, still the [indiscernible] 10% contribution rate over salary, I mean, its absolutely insufficient lower for longer is an issue for every place and Chileans are living longer as well.","Also they do have a salary cap and the salary cap remains almost the same one in the last 30 years. At the beginning of the system, just 2% of the labor force was kept, today more than 20% of the labor force is capped, 35% of our customers are capped, so that 10% over your salary is even lower than 10%, so we have to address the 10%. We are advocating for a 15% minimum, and to remove the salary cap.","The third issue is to reinforce the pillar two, which is the workplace solutions and group solutions in that country, and we have I would say good and [indiscernible] in order to support those -- I will say improvements, but I will say that the whole discussion is going to take a kind of long time in order to really have a solid and good pension reform, and I think that is very unlikely that this current administration is going to be over to go through and absolutely sure that probably this whole discussion is going to go over the next administration in 2018.","Humphrey Lee","I think just a quick follow up. I think there was some discussion about the fees, I think some opposition of the current system complaining about the fee being charged to the pensioners. Can you just talk about in general how do you see the fee structure right now, and what could potentially be at risk?","Luis Valdes","We're going into details. We have been vocal in our proposal, not just now is to charge over AUMs instead of flows, there is much more transparent, much more clear. That is going to align the interest of our customers and our oldest stakeholders in the ASP system.","So we really do think that the system has to charge fees over AUMs. On average today, that discussion is going to help us in order to make much more clear that the pension system in Chile is one of the most efficient and cheapest, around the 27 pensions [indiscernible]. On average, the pension system charged 60 basis points over AUMs and in the case of Cuprum we charge a number which is lower than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Credit Suisse.","John Nadel","So it sounds like if pension reform, you know, really gets through, ultimately in Chile, there's actually some potential, you know, for your business to thrive a bit more if some of these things go through, but I'm interested in what the sort of near to intermediate term might end up looking like as you sort of transition through this process, and, you know, the deposits, if I'm looking at page 16 of your supplement, have been very stable, you know, but the withdrawal side, you know, has started to really expand these last cup of quarters and I'm wondering if there's really cause and effect there, you know, cause being the, you know, the protesting. And where you expect that money to end up going and what your flows could look like at least during a transitory period here?","Dan Houston","I guess the way I would go at this is to, again, remind everyone on the call that our strategy in Chile does not limit itself just to the compulsory. That's the newest piece of business that we have. The second is the voluntary workplace environment that Luis very appropriately articulated and the last piece is to provide lifetime income to retirees, all three of those are key components in this strategy.","I don't think Chile is different than the U.S. in the DOL debates or the challenges around the rest of the world, whether it was a conversation in Hong Kong, there is an outcry, I would suggest about making sure that the fees are appropriate and just Reich in the case of Chile, and Hong Kong and the U.S., there's conversation with the DOL, and various regulators around the world to make sure they understand that the products and services that are being provided for by the service companies, and you know, we all know, and we can speak to the issue of asset management, but the hand holding, the call centers, the ability to provide information, education, and advice in some instances, is really the life blood of this business model around the world.","So Luis was articulating, we have spent a lot of time educating regular regulators that there need to be a reasonable fee associated with all of these products so to answer your specific questions, we are getting outflows today in Chile in large part because some of the protests that were large, six weeks ago, they continue to get smaller and smaller and smaller in terms of the number of people participating. ","I don't think this is going to have any sort of meaningful impact on our flows or our ability to generate an earnings off the investments that we made in Chile.","John Nadel","And I had a separate question for Terry. If we look on a consolidated basis your investment income in the quarter and we adjust for the fact that encaje was a little bit stronger and you had the real estate gain, would you characterize, you know, investment income X those items, as, you know, still a bit elevated, you know, maybe driven by some prepayments or bond calls or would you characterize it as more normal.","Terry Lillis","As we look at these items, there's going to be volatility from quarter to quarter as to Hoyer or lower, a little bit from expected variances. What we try to do is call out the significant items in this particular quarter, we talked about three significant items, the one being the annual actuarial review that had actually a volatile number this quarter. But the real estate sale that we had as well as the encaje performance, we felt that that was a little bit more transparency, visibility into the volatility that we have seen in terms of volatility, I have talked in the past about real estate sales as well as prepayment activity generating anywhere from 3 to 7 cents EPS.","This quarter, we were significantly higher than that, well north of, you know, 12, 13 cents. So actually, this volatility that we called out brings us right back into that more normal range for that particular piece. But as I said, you'll have periods where the Alternative investments might be a little bit higher or a little bit lower, the general count is actually growing, so you'd see some increase in the net income because of that.","But we try to give you the best information possible in terms of variance and volatility from what we would have expected, so the $1.22 that we had is the run rate that we believe is an appropriate number for this quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from [indiscernible] with Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","I want to go back to the RIS margins which seem to be quite strong relative to your guidance in previous periods. I guess what's driving this performance. You have highlighted expenses or expense management. Is there a timing issue there or are there also other drivers that have really driving this performance here.","Dan Houston","I think it's a fairly clear explanation, but Nora please go ahead and make some additional comments.","Nora Everett","I mentioned earlier, even when you exclude some of the variances that Terry has talked about, we're still on the lower end of our DAC expenses this quarter and we have some meaningful timing issues with expenses so that's why we're not saying this is the run rate.","What I would say is what's creating the very strong quarter, what we can't lose sight of is the fundamentals, the really strong fundamentals in this business. You're seeing growth basically across every metric, plan count, whether that\u2019s total reoccurring deposits, we're just seeing very strong, very broad growth in this business.","So the underlying growth is exceptionally strong. What we're just, what we're speaking to is that run rate, and just want to make sure people understand that we've got two issues here, one is a timing issue with regard to expenses this quarter, and the other is this DAC amort that tends to be light this quarter in addition to the annual assumption review issue with DAC amort. So that combination of things is why we're still guiding towards the higher end of our original outlook guidance.","Unidentified Analyst","And then we haven't spent a lot of time on this quarter for a change, but as we're nearing the implementation deadline of DOL, just wondered if you have any updated thoughts on where you stand there.","Dan Houston","Just a couple of quick comments. You know, I'm very pleased to say that the way things are turning out are fairly consistent with what we have been articulating and that is that our large distribution partners who we have been out to see and worked very closely with, most of them have come in on what their strategy is and allowing their financial advisers to work under two environments, one on a fee basis, one on the basis of the best interest contract standard.","We're seeing a full range and a lot of discussion around that, and again, we were anticipating that, and we would expect it. Secondly, we don't see any sort of change as reflects our ability to continue to have a robust investment platform with proprietary investment options being made available to small and medium sized employers, and third a benefit event for job changers and retirees, again, requires disclosure, but again, a workable model for the sake of being able to continue to provide our customers with choices in retirement, whether they decide to keep the money in the plan, choose a rollover IRA with Principal or to take their funds to a different service provider and lastly as we have worked through our own broker dealer and looking closely at our financial advisers, our 1500 or so financial advisers, we're retaining our talent.","They have found what we have shared with them as a workable solution to allow them to continue to have a successful practice here at Principal. Again, we don't think there's a really a lot of new news as it relates to DOL here.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill.","John Barnidge","You mentioned that foreign currency favorably impacted you year over year for the first time in five years, I believe, how much of a tail wind do you think this could prove, and then I have one follow up.","Terry Lillis","Sure. As we look at the exchange rate, actually we saw more stability in the exchange rain on a year-over-year basis. However on a trailing 12 month basis there's still a pretty significant head wind that we're fighting because of the strengthening of the dollar has really, excuse me, the weakening of the dollar has really occurred since the beginning of the year.","So this was the first quarter-over-quarter comparison where we actually saw some benefit from it. I think long-term we have always talked about stability in the dollar. We're not actually looking for tail winds or looking for head winds, but when you actually reflected on a constant currency basis, which I think is a way we want to look at the business on a constant currency basis, we're still seeing that mid- to upper teens growth rate of our international businesses.","It's very strong, and we have been trying to reflect that on a year-over-year basis or excuse me for several quarters but now we actually have some numbers when the dollar is relatively stable that you're actually seeing the growth of that underlying business.","Dan Houston","Yes, it's so unfortunate as you think about the last five years, there's been really solid work and performance from those local businesses driving local net cash flows, driving revenues, driving customer satisfaction, accumulating a lot of really significant number of investors and unfortunately because of the effects, it undermined its credibility and now we hopefully can see that start to turn around the other way. Thank you, John for the question.","John Barnidge","And then my follow up, if I may. Yesterday, the DOL released FAQ's on the fiduciary rule that significantly disrupts how brokers recruit, and require a major overhaul, to recruit bonuses a way from making them contingent on asset sales or sales targets, how do you see this change impacting your distribution partners?","Deanna Strable","You're right, those FAQs came out yesterday, and we expect a couple more rounds of those, I would say what was clarified in that FAQ was actually very consistent with how we had set up our plan forward with our advisers.","Again, I think we had anticipated the clarification would have been there, and we feel good relative to how we were planning to comply and compete going forward. You know, I think as Dan mentioned, we have actually made announcements relative to our internal sales force, and we have moved from decision making into implementation, but I think those FAQs that came out really aligned with how we were targeting our implementation pact going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kovac with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kovac","One for Dan here, as you think about uses of capital. In the past acquisitions have been a key strategy in use of capital Principal, and we have seen increased $ activity in some of your core markets and you did mention, I believe in your prepared remarks some expected consolidation continuing, so I'm wondering if you're expecting this to increase the use of capital heading into, either year end or into 2017, specifically as you think about asset management, multiples at these compressed levels today and as you build upon that, where would you be looking, whether it's asset management, retirement operations, internationally, and then give us a sense of what you see as the deployable capital against those types of acquisitions.","Dan Houston","That's probably a 30 minute response but I'll give a relatively brief response, and what I would say is we have tried to really have a disciplined approach to capital deployment whether it's to increase our dividends, stock buyback, making investments in our organic growth strategies here at Principal, being very cautious about even within the organic lines, allocating that capital where we feel the shareholders benefiting the most, and as you point out, we have had a nice track record of making relatively small tuck-in acquisitions, I wouldn't call Cuprum tuck-in, but certainly across asset management and asset accumulation, we have had really, really nice acquisitions over the years, and I would say that we are going to continue to look for those opportunities and we\u2019re going to continue to take a larger ownership share in some of the boutiques we have acquired in the past.","You saw some of that traffic in the most recent quarter. We just believe fundamentally that's a great way to deploy capital for our shareholders. The other area we want to emphasize is getting tangential strategies where we have got existing boutique where we can infuse some additional capital and maybe acquire some talent and build out that capability. Jim's also added some sales offices over the course of 2016 to try to drive sales. So that's still very, very much part of our strategy.","We feel like we have had really good organic growth in the core funds business. I don't think we would have to necessarily acquire another funds operation, and in terms of asset classes, we have talked about European real estate, we have talked about strategies that really align with what our investors needs are, which is generating long-term income and retirement, and long dated solutions, infrastructure is another area where we have looked at. So we're going to continue to be inquisitive, where again we can deploy capital in the best interest of our long-term shareholders' needs. Is that helpful?","Michael Kovac","That is. So just as we think about the mix this year versus maybe future years, it appears sort of pretty light, I guess, on the acquisition front. It sounds like maybe you're expecting that shifts in the future?","Dan Houston","Well, you know, pricing has a lot to do with these decisions and again, we try to be very organic and very disciplined in making acquisitions. It hasn't been from a lack of taking a hard look but we're going to continue to hold ourself to very high standard in terms of how we deploy our capital and whether it's, you know, managing our debt, managing our acquisitions, managing our share account or dividends, we're going to just take a very, very disciplined approach.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Houston, your closing remarks please.","Dan Houston","Again, thanks everyone for joining the call today. I know it was a busy day with the number of other companies reporting. You know from our perspective we're going to continue to invest our business, we're going to continue to grow our businesses, globally.","We want to make sure we have a disciplined approach to aligning our expenses with our revenues and we're going to continue to take a very disciplined approach to tour capital deployment to the benefit of our long-term shareholders. Again, we look forward to seeing many of you on Investor Day, as John mentioned in the opening comments on November, 16th.","So with that, have a great day, and thank you, again, for taking the time to listen to the call today.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

As John mentioned, we've again provided slides for today's call. Slide 4 outlines the themes for the quarter.","Second quarter results were strong, especially given the macroeconomic volatility in the quarter, giving us a great first half of 2013. Total company operating earnings for the second quarter were $271 million, a 29% increase over second quarter 2012. This reflects growth in our business, improved U.S. equity markets and continued expense discipline. Net income in the second quarter increased 33% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting improvement in our investment portfolio.","Our results again demonstrate that our globally diversified business model is working, and that we continue to execute effectively regardless of macroeconomic conditions in any one country or region. We have now successfully rebuilt operating earnings and net income close to pre-crisis levels and have replaced a significant portion of spread and risk-based earnings with fee-based earnings, giving us more capital flexibility.","Total company assets under management, at $451 billion, remained relatively unchanged from first quarter 2013, reflecting the strengthening U.S. dollar and a rise in interest rates. Some of the growth metrics for the quarter include double-digit growth compared to the year-ago quarter in Full Service Accumulation new sales revenue on $1.8 billion in sales. This reflects our focus on having better sales balance across small, medium and larger plans, which gives us greater ability to grow net revenues. Record sales of $5.8 billion in Principal Funds, an increase of 73% over the year-ago quarter, reflecting success across multiple products and distribution channels. These sales contributed to quarterly net cash flows of $2.3 billion, which outpaced the industry. Principal Funds' total assets under management hit $100 billion in the quarter as well.","Second quarter Full Service payout sales increased 37% over the year-ago quarter to $115 million. We'll continue to be opportunistic with this business. Unaffiliated assets under management of $101 billion for Principal Global Investors, up 10% from the year-ago quarter. Solid inflows of $6.6 billion for the quarter were offset by outflows due in part to a couple of large clients repositioning their portfolios. Net cash flows of $2.2 billion in Principal International led to reported assets under management of $103 billion despite the strengthening in the U.S. dollar. $49 million in Individual Life sales in the quarter, an increase of 12% over second quarter 2012, driven by continued success in the business market. And Specialty Benefits sales of $58 million, up 11% over second quarter 2012 as a result of strong growth in the pipeline. We continue to provide products and service solutions that are in demand in this era of personal responsibility and benefit from our diverse distribution platform.","Next, I'll comment on our success in further implementing our strategy in the second quarter. We've been successfully expanding our fee-based businesses and global investment management footprint for more than a decade. Because of the financial crisis, we've had the opportunity to accelerate that transition. Since 2010, we've successfully completed 7 strategic acquisitions, adding fee-based businesses and expanding our global footprint. We continue to believe this will create long-term value for shareholders. Despite recent volatility in certain emerging markets, the need for retirement and long-term savings in these markets continues to grow rapidly due to the exceptional growth in the middle and upper middle income segments. Having been in these markets longer than many of our competitors, we've established The Principal as a global retirement expert and are well positioned for continued success with a good brand and strong local distribution. We know there will be ebbs and flows in any market, but our broad global footprint allows us to weather cycles of volatility in the U.S. and abroad.","Moving now to an update on Cuprum, the pension company we recently acquired in Chile. The onboarding continues to go extremely well. In fact, during this onboarding process, the pension regulator in Chile once again gave Cuprum the best customer service rating among the 6 AFP providers. Cuprum has now received this distinction a remarkable 18 out of the last 22 quarters. Net cash flows and operating earnings from Cuprum continue to exceed our acquisition plan. In addition, when Standard & Poor's recently affirmed our ratings and changed the outlook to stable from negative, they referenced our success in building out our operations in fast-growing international retirement markets.","Achieving financial security in retirement is a campaign talking point for candidates in the upcoming Chilean elections. We see the discussion of possible changes to the Chilean retirement system as a positive to our businesses there as the goal is to further increase retirement savings for all income segments. In Full Service Accumulation, all of the fundamental elements remain strong, and along with solid equity market returns, contributed to revenue growth in the quarter.","Second quarter 2013 recurring deposits were up 17% over the year-ago quarter and were essentially flat with first quarter 2013, which is typically the largest quarter for recurring deposits. Additionally, the number of participants making a deferral and the number of participants receiving an employer match were both up 8% over the prior year quarter. While down from record levels in 2012, retention rates remain strong across the segments in the first half of 2013.","Our focus on growing sales in the small to medium-sized market to create more balance across plan sizes, along with equity market growth and our continued expense management, contributed to an increase in Full Service Accumulation margins in the second quarter. Principal Funds continued its string of successful quarters. Record quarter end account values as a result of positive net cash flows for 14 consecutive quarters and higher equity markets helped drive a 40% increase in operating earnings over the prior year quarter. Principal Funds continues to provide outcome-based products across asset classes that retail customers seek.","As shown on Slide 5, investment performance remains competitive and is a positive leading indicator of future net cash flows for the organization. We continue to benefit from our well diversified, multi-boutique strategy in Principal Global Investors. On May 1, we closed on our acquisition of Liongate, a London-based investment boutique that specializes in global alternative investments and managing portfolios of hedge funds, adding to our multi-asset class capabilities. We believe these multi-asset class solutions will remain popular, as institutional and retail investors move to outcome-based products. As investor appetite swings to equities and alternative investments, we remain in excellent position to retain and attract clients to our broad investment options and expertise across multiple platforms. Despite negative net cash flows in the quarter for Principal Global Investors, overall revenues increased 9% on a sequential basis, and pretax margins increased to 29%, reflecting performance fees and continuing to gain scale.","Next, a quick update on Principal Bank. As we announced in June, we signed a strategic agreement with Bank of the Internet Federal Bank to transfer substantially all of Principal Bank's individual checking and non-IRA accounts while retaining the products that complement our U.S. retirement and asset accumulation businesses. This action will have minimal financial impact to the company and furthers our progress to deregister as a savings and loan holding company. We still expect to complete the process by year end.","I'll close with some comments on capital management. As announced last night, we will pay a $0.26 per share common stock dividend in the third quarter, which is a 13% increase over the previous dividend. This reinforces our commitment to return capital to shareholders by increasing the dividend payout ratio over time. It also demonstrates confidence in our ability to deliver future earnings growth. So far, we've allocated $405 million of the $400 million to $600 million of capital we targeted for the full year. Looking to the second half of 2013, we'll continue to look at combination of common stock dividends and opportunistic acquisitions and share repurchases. As always, we continue to look for the best and most accretive ways to deploy capital and increase long-term value for shareholders.","Before I turn it over to Terry, I want to mention that IDG's Computerworld recently named The Principal Financial Group as one of the 2013 Best Places to Work in IT, our 12th consecutive year on the list. Our ability to attract and retain world-class IT talent is critical to our success, so we take great pride in being consistently recognized for providing a great environment for IT professionals.","In closing, we're pleased with our team's ability to grow our businesses above industry growth rates while maintaining expense discipline, resulting in a very strong first half of 2013. Despite volatility that will likely continue in the second half, I'm confident that our business model and proven ability to execute will continue our momentum through the remainder of the year. Terry?","Terrance J. Lillis","Thanks, Larry. The second quarter was a continuation of the strong start to the year. Our fundamentals remained strong and margins have improved. This morning I'll focus my comments on 3 items: operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance in the investment portfolio; and the strength of our capital position and balance sheet.","Total company operating earnings of $271 million were up 29% over second quarter 2012. This reflects a full quarter of Cuprum. Even without Cuprum, earnings were up 16% over the prior year quarter. On a reported basis, second quarter 2013 earnings per share were $0.91, up 30% over the year ago quarter. This reflects organic growth from our domestic business, strong results from Cuprum, favorable equity markets, expense discipline and a lower share count.","Looking at Slide 6, you'll see that second quarter 2013 earnings were impacted by 2 items. First, Principal Global Investors' quarterly earnings benefited by $4 million from a performance fee that typically occurs on a 3-year cycle. Although performance fees are a positive impact, infrequent fees, such as this one, do impact comparability between quarters. Second, Principal International earnings were negatively impacted this quarter by $7 million due to lower-than-expected returns on a mandatory investment known as encaje. Local regulations in Chile and Mexico require that mandatory pension operations hold a small investment in the underlying funds offered to customers. We report the change in value of the encaje investment through net investment income. This could create some volatility on a quarterly basis. The volatility this quarter was due to a spike of 150 basis points in interest rates in Mexico.","There's more background information on the encaje investment on Slide 7 and on our website, along with publicly available information on how to track the encaje performance throughout the quarter. A normalized result for the second quarter is $0.92 earnings per share. This normalized earnings per share should not be considered a run rate on which to base future quarters. Seasonality of earnings, investments in our businesses and macroeconomic factors particularly in Latin America, should be considered. We continue to stay focused on what we can control, executing on our strategy.","Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting with the accumulation lines of businesses within Retirement and Investor Services. Reported operating earnings increased 22% to $144 million. As shown on Slide 8, net revenue was up 17% over second quarter 2012. Growth in the underlying businesses, driven by more than $30 billion of sales over the past 12 months, equity market performance and improved spread, were the main catalysts for the increase. Trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue stabilized at 30% for the sixth straight quarter. Assuming an equity market total return of 2% per quarter for the second half of the year, we anticipate 2013 full year net revenue growth to exceed our long-term range. We also expect pretax return on net revenue to be above the 27% to 29% range communicated for Retirement and Investor Services accumulation for the year. Quarterly operating earnings for Full Service Accumulation, at $90 million, were up 25% from the year ago quarter. This reflects a 16% increase in net revenue due to strong growth in businesses and equity market performance.","Account value growth due to market performance is more beneficial in the short term than growth from net cash flows as there is no cost associated with acquiring the revenue. The net cash flow over the trailing 12 months of $4.1 billion also has more positive impact in recent years as we shift to a more balanced mix of business. The revenue growth, coupled with expense discipline, resulted in a pretax return on net revenue of 34% for the quarter. While fee pressure continues to exist in the marketplace, we're working closely with advisors and plan sponsors to adjust our service model to align with our clients' needs.","Net cash flows for Full Service Accumulation were approximately $300 million for the quarter. And as communicated last quarter, we expect full year 2013 net cash flow for Full Service Accumulation to be 1% to 3% of the beginning of the year account value. This metric has dampened in time periods with large equity market returns. That's because sales and recurring deposits do not directly correlate with the market in a similar fashion as withdrawals.","Full Service Accumulation sales, at $1.8 billion for the quarter, were down $500 million from the year ago quarter. However, due to our sales focus in the smaller end of the market, new sales generated a higher amount of annualized net revenue on a lower account value base. As expected and mentioned last quarter, Full Service Accumulation withdrawal rates are returning to more normal levels, with the dollar amount of the withdrawals increasing due to growth in assets under management. However, we are replacing some lapses with higher revenue business as we focus on profitable growth.","Principal Funds operating earnings were $17 million for the quarter, a 40% increase from the year-ago quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenue was up 22% and operating margins continued to improve due to the scale-based nature of the business. Although the sales costs are expensed in the quarter in which they occur, strong fundamentals over the last several quarters should continue to drive increased bottom line earnings. For the quarter, sales were a record $5.8 billion, driving $2.3 billion of net cash flow. Individual Annuities operating earnings were $29 million for the quarter. This is an increase of 17% from the year ago quarter due to improving equity markets and more favorable expense experience in the current quarter.","Slide 9 covers the guaranteed businesses within Retirement and Investor Services. Second quarter operating earnings of $28 million were up 18% over the year ago quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis, pretax return on net revenue improved to 80% due to improved spreads. We continue to approach this business opportunistically, and we'll issue investment-only and full service payout business when market conditions generate attractive returns. Principal Global Investors operating earnings were $29 million, up 59% from the year ago quarter. Earnings benefited by $4 million from a once-in-3-year performance fees on one of our real estate funds.","Slide 10 shows second quarter revenues grew 19% over the prior year quarter, driven largely by higher average assets under management. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax margin improved over 500 basis points from the same period a year ago to 25%, an exceptional result as Principal Global Investors continues to build scale.","Regarding Principal Global Investors' portfolio, even though approximately 1\/2 of the overall assets under management are categorized as fixed income, 2 factors helped minimize our exposure to interest rate movement. First, 1\/3 of the fixed income portfolio is in the general account, where fees are billed on a book value basis. Second, a sizable portion of the remainder is invested in high-yield, stable value and liability matched strategies, which do not directly correlate to the change in treasury yields. Unaffiliated assets under management ended the quarter at $101 billion. The unaffiliated net cash flow for the quarter was a negative $1.8 billion. Lapses this quarter were primarily due to a couple of large mandates that transitioned out of our stable value and currency investment options. These assets had lower revenue and margins, so the impact on earnings from these lapses was minimal.","Slide 11 shows Principal International operating earnings of $58 million for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, quarterly earnings were negatively impacted by $7 million due to the lower-than-expected return on the encaje investment as a result of local interest rate spikes. Most of the loss this quarter was due to the encaje in our Mexican AFORE business, as Cuprum's results are reported on a 1-month lag. The encaje return will cause some quarterly noise, but should benefit earnings over the long run. Quarterly net cash flows for this segment were $2.2 billion. Principal International ended the quarter with $103 billion of assets under management, despite the strengthening U.S. dollar. On an adjusted trailing 12-month basis, combined pretax return on net revenue was 56%, in line with expectations even with macroeconomic pressures.","As shown on Slide 12, Individual Life operating earnings were $22 million for the quarter, a decrease of $6 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the continued low interest rate environment. We continue to expect a quarterly earnings run rate for this business of $25 million to $27 million with volatility from quarter-to-quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted pretax operating margin was 14%, just below the range of 15% to 17% communicated for 2013. Although claims improved in the second quarter, higher claims for the first half of the year could put us slightly below the range for the full year. Specialty Benefits operating earnings of $26 million were up 14% over the same quarter a year ago, reflecting improved claims experience and growth in the business. The loss ratio continues to perform well at 67% for the quarter.","Slide 13 highlights Specialty Benefits premium and fee growth of 3% over the year ago quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, premium and fee growth was 4% relative to our 6% to 8% target, reflecting our focus on profitable growth. Trailing 12-month pretax operating margin of 10% was in line with our expectations. The Corporate segment reported an operating loss for the quarter of $35 million, within our expected range of $35 million to $40 million of operating losses. For the quarter, total company net income was up 33% to $222 million. Realized capital losses for the quarter were $48 million and credit-related losses remained in line with expectations, down 11% from the year ago quarter.","Our unrealized gains at the end of the quarter were $1.8 billion, down from $3.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, predominantly due to the rising interest rate environment. As a reminder, because of our strong asset and liability management, changes in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest rate movement do not result in an economic impact and in periods of stress do not force us to sell assets. Additionally as I mentioned in the past, our fee-based business model limits our exposure to the interest rate environment. However, our diversified business model provides some benefit over time from an improving rate environment.","Looking now at capital adequacy, we estimate our second quarter risk-based capital ratio to be 417%. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $920 million of excess capital. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, at $29.81 increased 7% over the prior year quarter. Our reported return on equity was 10.4%, a 70-basis-point increase from a year ago. This result was negatively impacted by approximately 90 basis points due to the third quarter 2012 actuarial assumption review. We expect ROE at the end of the year to grow 50 to 80 basis points from the normalized year end 2012 result.","Regarding capital management, as outlined on Slide 14, we've allocated $405 million of our expected $400 million to $600 million of capital to be deployed for the year. Last night, we announced our third quarter 2013 common stock dividend of $0.26, a 13% increase from the second quarter. We continue to focus on increasing our dividend payout ratio on a growing net income base. In the second half of the year, we will continue to evaluate all of our opportunities to deploy capital and will manage capital in the best interest of our shareholders. In closing, we're extremely pleased with the continued momentum of our businesses and feel that our business model is well positioned for future growth.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You mentioned that you think the political pressure out of Chile or the political reforms out of Chile will be beneficial for the pension system. The Chilean public pension providers have declined in market cap since those reports came out last month. Maybe you could just help us think about the pressure on fees versus what you see as an expanding pie of pension assets.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Sure. This is Larry, Seth. I'll comment, and I know Luis will want to add some comments as well. Let me just make a few comments. Luis and I spent considerable time down there about a month ago and had an opportunity to meet with many of the regulators, in particular, who have been very involved in this. First, I'd say a few things. First of all, the AFP system is very, very well accepted as an important element of the Chilean economy. It's been around over 30 years, and I've not seen any indication, there's any intent in any way, to sort of unwind the AFP system. Now the problems that they're trying to solve, I would say are twofold. One is that the contribution rate that is currently being made into the AFPs is too low. If you look at the replacement ratio that's produced by those contributions, it's about half of what it needs to be in order to provide a full replacement of preretirement income. The second problem they have is a problem that exists all over the world, which is trying to get the lower middle income and those who have a more in-and-out employment record into the system, so that they're going to end up with some amount of retirement savings. So the discussion -- the reason I say all that, Seth, is because the discussion is really about improving the system, whether it's higher contribution rates or other ways to get the lower income in. It's not about in any way, shape, or form sort of rewinding the system. Last thing I'll say before asking Luis to comment is, I think as it relates to many of the other AFPs, part of the reason that you're maybe seeing some decline there is because at the end of the day, I think if you're going to be a leader in this Chilean retirement system, not just the AFP, but also the voluntary system, you've got to have a very sort of coordinated and integrated platform that you can use, not only for the AFP side, the mandatory side, but a mutual fund platform and other products that you can capitalize on for the voluntary side. And as you know, Cuprum, as well as Principal prior to the acquisition have been the leaders in the voluntary portion. And that's where you're going to see most of the growth in the Chilean contributions going forward. The growth -- there's going to be some growth in the AFP, but most of it's going to come in the voluntary. And given our leadership position there, I think we're going to be in the strongest position to benefit as these changes may take place. But Luis, additional comments?","Luis Valdez","Yes. The main issue here is that actually, the system and its replacement ratio is going kind of well below expectations. But mainly about what Larry said, did you -- a 10% contribution rate, which is kind of low and insufficient in order to get this kind of 75%, 85% replacement ratio. So that 10% contribution rate is coming from 1982 when the system was designed. And since then, what the Chileans have seen is a dramatic improvement in their longevity and also a very important drop in their interest rates. So that is essentially 2 factors that are driving this kind of low replacement ratios right now. And we think that there's a great opportunity in order to really, really improve the system going forward. The pressure on fees is not exactly the point here because it's a little bit confusing for the Chilean system. Fees are being charged on flows, not over AUMs. And if everyone is making a kind of very simple math in order to calculate how much you're charging over AUMs, the Chilean system is a very efficient one and has a very, very, very, I would say, very appropriate changes on -- over AUMs for the entire system.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Does that help, Seth?","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","As I look at the encaje slide that you provided, I was just wondering if you could tell us about the composition of the assets in Mexico and Chile, I guess the relative proportion of fixed income versus equity in there?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, that's -- this is Larry. Sean, that's a very good question and perhaps something that as we go forward, we can provide you a little bit more insight on in general. In general, what I would say is that the Mexican encaje is predominantly a fixed income investment. So sort of think 80%, 85%, 90% fixed income. So that's why you saw the negative impact as interest rates in Mexico rose about 150 basis points, pretty much right at the end of the quarter. Again, that's a positive in the long term, but it's a negative in the very, very short term, which is why you see that adjustment. The Chilean encaje is a broader basket. It's a broader basket of fixed income and equity. And even within the equity component, it has some element of, if you will, non-Chilean or more global equities as well as Chilean equities. So think more balanced fund when it comes to the Chilean encaje. But we'll try to perhaps get you more information as to what that makeup is, Sean.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And just one additional question. As we think of how we're modeling margins going forward, was there any change in transfer pricing between FSA and PGI?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","The answer is no.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question, Larry, I just want to make sure I understood your comment correctly on the onboarding of Cuprum. I think you mentioned net cash flows exceeded estimates. Just looking at the disclosure that you guys had, it looked like $200 million of net flows compared to $40 billion of AUM. That would be an annualized growth rate of around 2%. Is that exceeding expectations? And is that kind of a normalized level that we should expect?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes. This is Larry, Tom. It's, again, a good question. I would say when we talked about exceeding our plan, what we're talking about there, of course, is exceeding our acquisition plan. So one of the big unknowns, and again you can well understand this, one of the big unknowns anytime you make an acquisition is what's going to happen with some of the existing contributors, in this case, of Cuprum. And while we think and believe that the Principal acquisition of Cuprum really now supports Cuprum with a strong global player, we recognize that in the local market, in the local market, you're going to have other AFPs all taking their shot at you during this kind of transition period. So from an acquisition plan perspective, you always want to be a little bit conservative in modeling those flows. What I would say is, I think we've essentially, through the good work of the local team there, we've essentially blunted all of that. So we essentially have not seen any of that potential for outflow that may come just from the sheer announcement of the acquisition. So the kind of 2% that you referenced of net cash flow is probably in the reasonable range for Cuprum on the AFP side. Again, the real opportunity here in the long term is going to be building that more integrated platform between Cuprum and Principal. And the growth, the larger net cash flow is going to come on the voluntary side as compared to the AFP side. Luis, anything you want to comment?","Luis Valdez","Yes. As probably is also is interesting to comment that Cuprum, in particular, is a pretty mature company. So part of our inflows and outflows are very much more determined because we have, every single month, we have customers that are getting their retirement income products. So Cuprum also pays a lot of benefits. Close to 30,000 clients are receiving their monthly income from Cuprum. So that is part of our natural kind of outflows. Also, other clients are choosing other kind of retirement income products like annuities. And we have an annuity company there. So it isn't in their normal process and pace. I should say that $200 million that we already have.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one follow-up on the U.S. Full Service 401(k) business. The margins were quite good this quarter. And I know that you guys have talked about the mix shift should be helpful. And that looks like it's coming through. Any -- I guess my question is, should we assume that this higher level is sustainable? Or do you think we'll get some slippage? And then just a specific question, the -- shall I presume the fact that sales and transfer deposits were lower this quarter, had a positive impact on the margin? Is there any way to quantify that?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Okay. There's a quite a lot packed in there so -- and I know Dan will want to comment. I would say on the question about the sustainability of the margins, Tom, I think that really, really, really comes down to what any persons or analysts or investors view is of the future kind of economic conditions. I mean, if we continue to see the strong fundamentals that we saw in second quarter, and by strong fundamentals I mean we saw compensation increases -- we, although modest. We saw payroll -- I mean, we saw growth in employment, albeit modest. And we saw a very positive equity market return. So the upshot of that is that the incremental account value coming through is some of the more profitable account value. And I think Terry commented on that during his comments. If you think that's going to continue, if you think that represents the economy that we're going to have in the United States going forward over the next few quarters, then I think you would tend to believe that those margins are more sustainable. If, however, you believe that we may see payroll growth rollover, we may see comp growth rollover, we may see equity markets rollover, then I think you would tend to want to model something where there would be -- you'd see those margins kind of decline. So it's really going to vary based on I think your outlook for the economy in the markets going forward. And I'll let Dan comment and then also handle your second one on sales.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes, Tom. Just a couple quick comments relative to the growth and some of this was covered in the script. We just can't forget about the fact that the first quarter of '13 enjoyed a 10% rise in the S&P 500, 2.9% for the second quarter of '13. But as you know, we get compensated on the average daily balance, which was up 6%. So we really had some really nice tailwinds relative to revenues for the first -- for the second quarter. We have really good expense management throughout the quarter, very deliberate. And then something that we haven't had a chance to talk about a lot is these reoccurring deposits. As mentioned in the script, it was up 17%. These are strengthening the matching contributions, the profit-sharing contributions. There's increased salary deferrals and increased participation. During this period of time, we just kind of looked at the last trailing 12 months. Net new contracts, they're up 7% or 2,200 contracts. And we've added 215,000 participants during the last 12 months. So you're seeing the inertia of that in-force block business starting to add a lot to our success. You mentioned in your second question around sales and what the positioning is there. We, frankly, have oriented the sales force to more focus on new sales revenue. It was up more than double digit. Again, as opposed to assets, at the same time, our alliance sales continue to be about 61% of our sales. TRS is 45%. And our TPA business that we've talked about on this call for years now is up over 68%. And again, that's a very efficient way for us to administer these programs. The shortfall in sales isn't small to mid. It's on the large side compared this quarter versus the year-ago quarter. We're down about $831 billion in terms of sales. And that speaks in large part to the shortfall. So we like the mix. We like the current fundamentals of the business and feel good about working towards, and continue to maintain those 5-year benchmarks that we had set out relative to margins in net revenue growth. Hopefully that helps.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Smith with Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Just as a follow-up to Tom's question on the FSA business and the strong recurring deposits that Dan mentioned. When we look at the second quarter recurring deposits, how much of that can we look at as being sustainable, recognizing obviously the first quarter is the strongest period for recurring deposits? And then the second quarter, I would expect, would be more on a normalized basis for the remainder of the year?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, go ahead.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes, Joanne, I think you got that dialed in exactly right. I think that's the kind of the expectation that we would have. There's always that benefit after the 1st of the year where you see people do financial planning. And they make their initiation to participate in a plan or increase their deferral or even possibly change their investment mix. But I would anticipate the balance, latter half of the year looks more like the second quarter.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Joanne, this Larry. I just want to jump in with one more general comment, if you'd allow me. And then I think you have another question. But the 401(k) system has taken a lot of criticism over the last few years by some people who I think would have different ideas about how he would construct a healthy retirement system in this country. But I find it very interesting, and as part of this question on recurring deposits, I think we've seen increases in the average deferral rate now. So the deferral rate is the amount the employee is contributing out of their own payroll. And we've seen that average deferral rate increase for something like 8 to 10 to 12 quarters since the financial crisis. So I think there's a strong indication that employees get it relative to the fact that they need to get their deferral rates up to a much higher level. So today, you're talking about an average deferral rate that's kind of in that low 8% range, the 8.2%. And that's up very significantly from what it was, say, before the financial crisis. So I want to get a plug-in here for the fact that I think both employers and plan providers like Principal are doing a much better job of getting people to save up near the levels that they're going to need to be if they're going to have adequate retirement income. And so that's part of what you're seeing in this growth in recurring deposit.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","I would also expect, Larry, that it would be a function of people feeling a little bit better about their own financial position given the fact that we've had relatively low economic growth, but at least it's stable. Would you agree with that?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Right. I would agree with that. I would agree with that. And I think the residential mortgage piece, Joanne, I think also plays in that because that's kind of that wealth effect. I think when people feel like the value in their home is at least stable and now is starting to increase, I think again they're more willing to kind of dig in their pocket a little bit deeper for a little increase in that deferral. And the final thing would be we've been using this kind of step-up concept for several years now. And so we're now getting to a point where those step-up contributions, the increase is now coming through because we're 2 and 3 years down the road. So again, what we find is once people commit to the higher level, they commit in advance, they don't go back on that. They actually follow through. And that's another reason you're seeing these deferral rates increase.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a question for Jim on PGI. Are there any other mandates that could be at risk at this point in time or you think you're pretty much through that?","James Patrick McCaughan","I think the way to really think about this, Joanne, is that there are always in the institutional market going to be mandates flowing in and out. Some of this is a function of changing allocations by institutions. And what you've seen is an allocation away from active core mandates and towards, in our case, active specialties. That means that we're not necessarily going to be seeing positive cash flows every quarter, as the last quarter described. But we are going to be seeing consistent growth of the revenues because those active specialties are on significantly higher fees. So the answer is there could be. And those will tend to be the kind of active core mandates even where performance is good, that institutions are turning away from. But in our case, we believe that the revenue will continue to grow because we are very strong in areas like high-yield, emerging market, debt and equity, real estate, including something that's very active at the moment, which is origination of commercial mortgages. So all of those areas, we think, will lead to a better revenue picture than necessarily you see from the asset flows.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My questions actually follow directly from Joanne's. Jim, if AUM cannot be expected to grow consistently, what would you consider to be a reasonable level over an extended period of annual revenue growth from your business? And the second question is perhaps more important than the first. Why are we seeing now such a large increase in the profit margins in your business? And where can those margins head?","James Patrick McCaughan","Yes. Thanks, Eric. I think the long-term trend in AUM and revenues will obviously depend somewhat on the market change. And that has been a tailwind certainly for the last 6 months. But it doesn't solely depend on that because flows and the change of mix will continue to help us. Just to illustrate that, the quarter we're currently reporting on saw a 14% increase in average AUM across PGI. The revenue is up 19%. I think that's the kind of trend that feels right for the long term. Now obviously, if you didn't see the strength in the equity market, the numbers might've been both down by 3%, 4%, 5%. But remember, we are not so dependent on the equity market given that we have significant alternatives, including real estate, a lot of different fixed-income options, many of which are not really linked into purely the treasury market. So I think that trend is really a decent indicator of the long-term trend. And it's very much in line with what we said last year to our Investor Day in terms of our 5-year expectations. In terms of the margins, sure, the 29% pretax margin in the second quarter is a bit above long-term trend simply because it included $4 million arising from a performance fee. But in all other respect, I think it basically is in line with long-term trend. And what we said last year at Investor Day was we were on a 5-year view as we gain scale and we grow into the expenses we've made, we've got a significant all-expensed investment in growth in Principal Global Investors. As we grow into that and as our new offices and new capabilities generate assets, we will be able to increase profitability towards, we believe, that 30% pretax margin. The fact we almost got there in this quarter is incidental and not sustainable. But on a 3-year view, I do believe that, that 30% will prove to be sustainable as we develop our scale and our higher added value products. Hope that helps, Eric.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Eric, this is Larry. I just want to make one comment on this kind of in defense and support of Jim and PGI. I think when you do compare PGI against margins from other asset managers, you do need to take account of the fact that today, about 60% of PGI's assets are basically transfer-priced to other businesses of the Principal. So whereas when you look at other asset managers, my guess is probably 80% to 100% of their assets are unaffiliated clients. So when you think about the fact that we're sort of working towards 50% unaffiliated, 50% affiliated, and we're still pushing sort of leading-edge margins in PGI, I think they're doing a really nice job of managing expenses along the way.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","You mentioned that the $0.92 normalized result shouldn't necessarily be viewed as a base going forward given some potential timing of expenses. I was hoping you could give us some sense for what type and magnitude of additional expenses you may incur in the second half of this year?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes. This is Larry, Ryan. And I'll have \u2013 I'll ask Terry to comment as well. I mean, again, I think whether you view $0.92, I mean this is what I was sort of commenting on earlier, I really think whether you view $0.92 as the jumping off point for Q3 or Q4 or whether you discount that to some degree for Q3 or Q4, again, I think really depends in large measure on your view of the economy and your view of the market. I mean, I think you could go in and sort of financially dissect this or that, and you could try to figure out, was DAC amortization this time a little higher or a little lower or whatever, whatever. And maybe that leads you to a conclusion. Although I think sometimes it's a bit of paralysis by analysis. I mean, my personal view is, again, as long as the economy continues to normalize and the markets continue to heal and interest rates don't necessarily spike up, but that they continue to increase as a result of economic growth, then I view the $0.92 as a kind of reasonable neighborhood from which we launch into third quarter and fourth quarter. But if on the other hand, you believe the market's overvalued, the economy is going to roll over, then I would be cautious about just forecasting $0.92 into the rest of the year. So Terry, you want to comment?","Terrance J. Lillis","Yes. Ryan, this is Terry. It's a great question. And as you -- when we talk about the $0.92 in the current environment. And we think that that's a good, normalized number for this quarter. However, there are some things that are going to affect the future. We've had seasonality in all of our businesses. And that'll continue. Some of it will be somewhat favorable into the future. You talk about dental claims, for example. We've talked about the impact on security -- excuse me, the Specialty Benefits business. We also talk about the macroeconomic conditions in Latin America. Right now, the -- you're seeing some impact because of the 1-month lag on Cuprum's earnings. And what happened in Mexico could have an impact on us in the third quarter. That is yet to be played out. You also look at the exchange rate. The spot rate at the end of the quarter was lower than the impact or the average for the quarter. And so that could have some impact. And it will once again play out. Expenses could be larger in the second half of the year, and you'd expect that. Sales could be larger. We expect them to be larger in the second half of the year. And depending on the mix of that, we may have to expense all that cost in the current period and not have an opportunity to defer it. We also are going to continue to investing in our businesses. And so to some extent in the first half of the year, we may not have included as much of expenses as we have in the past. Once again, it's somewhat spotty. And then the other item, the last item that I'll comment on, is the effective tax rate. You do expect -- we do expect the tax rate to go up. We benefited in the first half of the year because of a true-up on the dividend received deduction. And so that held our effective tax rate down a little bit lower than what you normally would have expected. In the second half of the year, with the higher earnings and those having a smaller impact on it, you could see a higher effective tax rate as well. So all of those things need to be taken into consideration, modeled, looked at and analyzed. And that's why we don't say you just simply can go just jump off as this is the normalized run rate. I hope that helps.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Understood. And maybe just along the same lines, so the FSA margin was about 34% in the quarter. In the past, over a pretty long period of time, I think it's hovered closer to 30%. So I guess maybe I'm just trying to get a sense for, I think, Larry, you said that if we tend to continue in the same environment that we're in, you don't necessarily see any big changes. But at the same time, that margin's actually quite a bit above what you tended to do. So that was kind of my question in regards to the expenses, if maybe there was just some timing considerations for the quarter that wouldn't necessarily lead you to believe that, that 34% margin would be sustainable even in a good macro environment.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes. I mean, we've commented many, many, many times that you always want to be careful about taking one quarter and prognosticating that for the future. So I think if you wanted to sort of look at a better estimate of what it might be, you always want to work with trailing 12-month periods rather than work with current quarter periods because there's just naturally going to be some ebb and flow. But I think even if you look at trailing 12 months, you're still getting a number that is in that 30%, 31% kind of range that really does represent best in class. I mean, the bottom line here that I would say, I think, investors and analysts should focus on relative to FSA is not the level of margin in any one place. I think the key message here, and what you should focus on, is the fact that this business model is not broken. This business model has faced a lot of headwinds in the period of time since the financial crisis. But a lot of reports have said, has something happened? Is the model broken? Can it get back to where it was in 2004, '05, '06? And I believe firmly the answer to that is when the economic conditions normalize, when the market conditions normalize, it absolutely can get back to that same sort of growth trend we saw back in those days. And this quarter happens to be a 3-month period where the economy and the markets performed more in line with what was happening in those periods. And you saw very nice returns and you saw very nice margins. And so, again, I would just comment that I think the key thing here is not the kind of current margin level and prognostication. The point is the model works. The growth in earnings is there when the macroeconomic and market conditions allow it to come through.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","After that public service announcement, Larry, I'm now going to completely ignore it and go back to the FSA margin. Is that okay?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","You bet.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Two questions, and I think one of Tom's myriad of questions wasn't answered. Did -- but Terry may have touched on it a little bit later, did the low sales or the low transfer deposits in the quarter benefit margin? Because there was a lack of expenses that maybe would not have been DAC-able under the new rules.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","I think short answer would be yes. But in terms of quantification of that, Steven, it'd be awfully hard to do. I don't know, Dan, you want to comment?","Daniel J. Houston","No, you're right. It's -- obviously, if we had lower sales and the split of sales was roughly 50-50 between our group annuity contract and our 40 Act funds. And so if you just think about 40 Act funds as having to be 100% expensed, that's where you would see this expense that would've been deferred. So we reach our full year sales goal which we said was roughly flat with the year ago, about $11 billion. We would anticipate we'd have higher sales-related expenses in the second half of the year than we did in the first half.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, good. I'm glad I asked that. And then to look at these -- couple of more follow-ups. To look at the PGI outflow that Jim talked about from the 2 accounts, my understanding is that one of the accounts was Nationwide pulling funds from Morley, which was always going to happen anyway. Jim, do you happen to know that number?","James Patrick McCaughan","Yes. It's approximately $1 billion. Whether it was always going to happen anyway or not, I wouldn't want to make a judgment on. But the account had performed pretty well, but they decided to take it back to one of their own teams. And that's always a hazard with sub-advisory mandates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one more on Chile. I think one of the other proposals with regards to the pension system there, I think the guy who's leading so far in the polls is a socialist. And he is also proposing that the government set up one of these AFOREs. Is that possible? Is that an issue? Would it really concern you if that did happen?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Well, we happen to have, Steven, the best Chilean political commentator with us today. And there actually have been some sort of late-breaking developments relative to candidates there in Chile. So maybe I'll just have Luis comment on it.","Luis Valdez","Okay. As Larry mentioned before, one of the main issues that we're facing and the Chilean system is facing there is the coverage in order to go deeper into the middle and low-income segment. And probably, and this is one particular idea, probably one way in order to try to better cover that particular segment, it could be the creation of kind of state-owned AFP or a pension company in order to try to go into that particular segment. But this is still a kind of idea. And the truth is the Chilean government, they have to really better figure out how they can build a much more stronger first pillar. And we don't know yet if within that kind of design and a state-owned AFP is going to be the right solution. But as those comments and the initiatives are going into that particular way to go and to try to tap that unattended market, which is particular is not our market. So we're right far away from that particular market. Cuprum is a premier provider, and is having on average, the highest average salary in the pension system in Chile. So we're kind of away from that problem. And even if that AFP is coming, we think that we're going to be pretty much more isolated from that particular effect.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference call over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Principal Financial Group's First Quarter Conference Call. As always materials related to today's call are available on our Web site at principal.com\/investor. I'll start by mentioning two changes to our first quarter financial supplement.","As a reminder effective January 1, 2019, we changed how we allocate certain expenses and net investment income among the business units. These changes were evaluated in conjunction with the enterprise wide global financial process improvement project. Results for prior periods have been recast so that they are on an comparable basis. There was no impact to total company financial results. Also effective January 1, 2019, Claritas our investment management company in Brazil with approximately $1.4 billion of assets under management moved from Principal International to Principal Global Investors. This realignment results in deeper integration with PGI's global distribution and stronger connectivity to the shared services and investment teams within PGI.","I also want to note that with the planned acquisition of the Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement Trust business, we are currently evaluating our reporting structure and financial supplement to best reflect the combined organization. The acquisition is scheduled to close third quarter 2019. Following the reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO, Dan Houston; and CFO, Deanna Strable will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions.","Others available for the Q&A session include Renee Schaaf, Retirement Income Solutions; Tim Dunbar, Global Asset Management; Luis Valdez, Principal International; and Amy Friedrich, U.S. Insurance Solutions.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures may be found in our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation. Dan?","Dan Houston","Thanks John, and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning, I'll share some performance highlights and accomplishments that position us for continued growth, including the planned acquisition of the Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust Business that we announced April 9. Deanna will follow up with details on our financial results and capital deployment. First quarter was a good start to the year for Principal. We continued to expand our distribution network and array of retirement investment and protection solutions, advance our digital business strategies creating value for customers and gaining efficiencies, balance investments in our business with expense discipline, be good stewards of shareholder capital, and deliver strong results despite ongoing revenue pressure.","At $400 million, non-GAAP operating earnings were down 2% compared to a very strong first quarter 2018 but up 27% on a sequential basis reflecting a strong rebound in macroeconomic factors. On a trailing 12-month basis, non-GAAP operating earnings were nearly $1.6 billion up 5% from the year ago period reflecting 2% growth in non-GAAP pre-tax operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate.","Compared to a year ago, total company reported assets under management or AUM increased nearly $2 billion to a record $675 billion. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency exchange and operations acquired and disposed during the trailing 12 months, AUM would have increased by $29 billion or 4%.","On a sequential basis, AUM increased $49 billion or 8%. Asset appreciations added $43 billion to AUM in the first quarter more than offsetting the $34 billion drop in the fourth quarter from unfavorable market performance.","We've also increased AUM in our joint venture in China to a record $158 billion in the first quarter. This is an increase of $14 billion or 10% compared to a year ago despite a negative $8 billion impact from foreign currency exchange. As a reminder, China isn't included in our reported AUM.","As further color on our asset management franchise, we again received some noteworthy third party recognition during the quarter including multiple best fund awards from Lipper. Additionally, at the Asia Asset Management 2019 Best of the Best awards, CIMB Principal was recognized as the Best Asset Management House in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and was awarded Fund Launch of the year, and in Chile we were recognized by Morningstar as the best equity fund manager in 2018 for having the best Latin American equity fund in 2018.","Principal Real Estate Investors recently received the Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award for continued leadership and superior contributions to Energy Star. This reflects our longstanding commitment to responsible property investing and our focus on high-performing energy efficient buildings.","Slide 5 highlights the improvement in our investment performance. At the end of the first quarter, for our Morningstar rated funds, 81% of the fund level AUM had a four or five star rating, and 83% of the principal actively managed mutual funds, ETFs, separate accounts, and collective investment trusts were above median for a five year performance, at 53% above median, for the one-year performance, and 66% above median for the three year performance, we delivered 12 and 14 percentage point improvements respectively compared to the year-end 2018. These gains reflect a rebound in our international equity strategies, which as discussed at the fourth quarter call, were also dampening performance of our target date solutions.","Given our focus on long-term strategies, it's important for us to maintain conviction in our investment process. It's reassuring when performance recovers after short downturns. Moving to total company net cash flow, we delivered a positive $5.5 billion in the first quarter relative to outflows in the sequential and prior year quarters. RIS delivered $4.1 billion of net cash flow, its fifth consecutive positive quarter and the second best quarter on record. This was driven by record sales, strong retention, and recurring deposit growth in our RIS fee, and RIS spread sales increased $1.2 billion or 139% compared to the year ago quarter.","Principal International generated $800 million of net cash flow, its 42nd consecutive positive quarter and $1.7 billion of positive net cash flow from our joint venture in China that is not included in reported net cash flow. PGI sourced net cash flow turned positive in the quarter and nearly $300 million after five consecutive quarters of net outflows. First quarter was the best net cash flow quarter for our U.S. retail mutual fund business in more than two years.","As we've discussed on prior calls, we have approximately $3 billion in the at-risk investment grade bond strategy with a single international client in PGI due to high currency hedging cost. We expect the client to withdraw the entire amount over the course of the second quarter. We continue to manage other assets for this client in other strategies where hedging costs can be more easily absorbed. The client continues to award us additional mandates reflecting the ongoing strength of the relationship. As we're all aware, of the asset management industry and PGI continues to experience pressure including increased demand for lower-cost investment options and volatility in capital markets. We\u2019re pleased with our headway on multiple fronts to address these industry pressures.","We're starting to see benefits emerge from restructuring our distribution teams. We continue to add key resources and we're building our business intelligence to help inform our sales process positioning us for increasing success in key institutional retail markets. Other progress in the first quarter included the launch of more than a dozen new investment strategies across our U.S. and international platforms with the vast majority in Latin America and Asia. I'm particularly encouraged by the continued collaboration between PGI and Principal International in these markets.","We also launched the Principal Guaranteed option during the first quarter expanding our lineup of fixed income investment solutions for retirement plans. This new option offers a compelling crediting rate and seeks to preserve capital and support performance through differing market cycles. It's also portable. Customers can maintain their investment even if the plan moves to a new record keeper.","As a notable ETF development, we created a guided approach to factor investing to help customers achieve their unique goals. We partnered with NASDAQ Dorsey Wright for the first time to launch the Principal NDW factor rotation model portfolio. We also earned nearly 30 total placements in the first quarter with more than 20 different offerings on 16 different platforms. This reflects our continued success getting our investment options added to third-party distribution platforms, recommended list, and model portfolios.","More broadly, we continue to see strong interest in our specialty, solution-oriented and alternative investment capabilities as we help clients diversify, build wealth, generate income, protect against downside risks, and address inflation.","Now, I will share some key execution highlights starting with our planned acquisition of the Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust Business. As of year-end 2018, this business had more than $825 billion of assets under administration across several retirement and non-retirement products including Defined Contribution, Defined Benefit, non-qualified executive benefits, institutional trust and custody, and institutional asset advisory. This doubles our footprint of our U.S. retirement business, increasing our retirement assets to over $500 billion and will serve a combined 7.5 million participants making us a top three retirement plan provider.","Given the current competitive environment, it could have taken us more than a decade to grow participants to this level organically. Beyond adding scale to our retirement businesses, the addition of the non-retirement trust and custody offering adds a diversifying revenue source. Importantly, the acquisition is expected to generate $425 million of run rate revenue for Principal once fully integrated in 2022.","The acquisition is clearly strategic further enabling us to capitalize on one of the largest opportunities in financial services, U.S. retirement savings and retirement income markets. This acquisition will solidify our leadership and enhance our position in pension reform discussions around the world. We look forward to serving our new customers and working with new employees and new advisors.","As part of our accelerated digital investments, we launched simple invest during the quarter. Our first product with robust wealth, the solution introduces robo advisor services for retirement savings and retirement income. While we've provided education guidance to our customers for many years. This is our first foray into digital advice for our U.S. retirement business initially we're focusing on participants who are retiring or changing jobs where we are the plan provider. It's designed for participants who don't have an advisor or prefer to do it themselves over the long-term, the addition of Wells Fargo institutional retirement business only magnifies the potential opportunity.","We recently became the first retirement plan provider to offer voice activated financial wellness and retirement readiness education. With our February launch of a weekly Principal flash briefing through Amazon Alexa. We launched a new onboarding experience for retirement plan participants last November nearly 70,000 people use the tool in the first quarter.","Early results show that we are improving retirement outcomes. Average deferral rates exceeded 7% with more than one in four participants at 10% or higher and at 26% the take up of the automatic savings increase is twice the rate of our existing block of participants. And our protection businesses, we continue to invest in initiatives that make us easier to do business with. Our specialty benefits call center chatbot is now giving general providers more convenient access to answers while reducing call volume.","We've also debuted edelivery of our term life insurance policies enhancing the experience for both the customer and the advisor. Deanna will cover this in more detail, but I want to emphasize our balanced approach to capital deployment in addition to ongoing investments in organic growth, strategic acquisitions and our accelerated investment in digital business strategies, we continue to return capital to shareholders.","In the first quarter, we returned $280 million to investors through common stock dividends and share buybacks bringing our trailing 12-month total to more than $1.2 billion. I'll also share some additional recognition for the quarter.","Forward's name Principal one of America's best employers for diversity. For a fourth consecutive year Principal earned a perfect score on the human rights campaign's Corporate Equality Index making us one of HRC's best places to work for LGBT equality. For the ninth time [indiscernible] Principal as one of the world's most ethical companies. And for the 18th time, the National Association of Female Executives named Principal one of the top companies for executive women. This speaks volumes about who we are as a company and why we're going to be successful long-term.","In closing, again, first quarter was a good start to the year for Principal. We continue to make steady progress in helping customers and clients achieve financial security. I expect us to build additional momentum throughout 2019 and for that to translate into long-term value for shareholders and each of our stakeholders. Deanna?","Deanna Strable","Thanks Dan. Good morning and thank you for participating on our call.","Today I'll discuss key contributors to our first quarter financial results and I'll provide an update on capital deployment. The first quarter was a good start to 2019 with net income attributable to Principal of $430 million, an increase of 8% from the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $400 million or $1.43 per diluted share in the first quarter.","EPS increased 2% compared to a very strong first quarter 2018. Our non-GAAP operating earnings effective tax rate was 16.4% for the first quarter at the lower end of our 2019 guided range of 16% to 20%.","ROE excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustment was 13.4% on a reported basis. As a result of favorable macro economic conditions, we had three significant variances during first quarter with a positive $33 million benefit to reported non-GAAP pre-tax operating earnings.","The significant variances included $15 million of lower DAC amortization and RIS fee due to the point to point increase in the equity markets, $13 million of higher than expected encaje performance in Principal International and $5 million benefit from the net impact of inflation in Latin America also in Principal International excluding significant variances in both periods, total company non-GAAP operating earnings of $376 million increased 6% from fourth quarter 2018, but decreased 10% from the very strong year ago quarter.","Looking at macro economics equity markets started the year strong with a 13% increase in the S&P 500 Index during the quarter. Despite this, the Daily average increased only 1% compared to fourth quarter and decreased slightly from the year ago quarter. As there was only a slight increase in the daily average, revenue and earnings did not receive much of a benefit from the positive market performance in the quarter. Foreign currency exchange rates created a headwind of $10 million for Principal International's pre-tax operating earnings relative to the prior year quarter, but were a slight benefit compared to fourth quarter 2018.","Mortality and morbidity experienced for RIS spread and specialty benefits were in line with our expectations, but less favorable than first quarter 2018. Seasonality impacts our first quarter results in both PGI and specialty benefits. As expected, PGI had higher compensation costs in the first quarter. That said, PGI's total operating expenses were lower than a typical first quarter.","Also as expected, specialty benefits experienced higher dental and vision claims and higher sales related expenses in the first quarter. As a reminder, first quarter 2018 benefited from an extremely low and unsustainable individual disability loss ratio. We expect annual earnings and specialty benefits to emerge approximately 45% in the first half of the year and 55% in the second half of the year with the seasonality concentrated in the first quarter.","The following comments on business unit results exclude significant variances from both periods. On a trailing 12-month basis excluding the annual actuarial review and encaje performance, pre-tax margins for all business units were within or above the 2019 guided ranges. Expenses continue to be well managed even with our accelerated digital investments and other ongoing investments in the businesses.","Pre-tax operating earnings for all businesses with the exception of corporate were in line with our better than our expectations for the quarter. RIS fees underlying business fundamentals continue to be strong compared to the year ago quarter, sales were up 30% to a record $5.4 billion, recurring deposits grew 9% with an 11% increase in deferrals and a 14% increase in employer matches. Defined contribution plan count increased more than 3% or over 1200 plans and defined contribution participant count increased 9% with nearly 300,000 net new participants.","During the quarter, RIS spread had $2.1 billion of sales more than doubled the prior year quarter. Fixed annuity sales were $800 million and we had record first quarter pension risk transfer sales of $600 million. The pipeline for pension risk transfer sales remained strong for 2019.","U.S. insurance solutions also started the year with strong sales including record sales and specialty benefits. We continue to grow and deepen relationships with customers as we increase lines of coverage and our group benefits block by 13% from the prior year period. PGI's pre-tax operating earnings declined 11% from the prior year period to $101 million. This was primarily due to lower fee revenue due to a decline in average AUM resulting from muted market performance, negative net cash flow and operations acquired and disposed over the trailing 12 months.","At$84 million corporate pre-tax operating losses were higher than our expected run rate due to normal quarterly volatility and expenses. For full year, we do anticipate corporate losses to be above the high-end of our 2019 guided range of $300 million to $320 million. This is primarily due to the impact of the planned acquisition of the Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement Trust business and higher security benefit expenses due to the market decline at the end of 2018. After we closed the acquisition, we'll have transaction cost and additional interest expense from our new debt issuance as well as lower investment income from using available capital to finance a portion of the acquisition.","As shown on Slide 12, we deployed $280 million of capital during the quarter including $150 million in common stock dividends and $130 million in share repurchases. We expect to deploy well above our $1 billion to $1.4 billion capital deployment range in 2019 after taking into consideration the $1.2 billion that we committed in April for the planned acquisition of the Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust business.","We anticipate the acquisition to close in the third quarter of 2019 and we are evaluating our reporting structure and financial supplement to best reflect the combined organization. As shared on the acquisition announcement call, we have suspended share repurchases and expect to resume no later than first quarter of 2020.","Last night, we announced a $0.54 common stock dividend payable in the second quarter a 4% increase from a year ago. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have approximately a 4% dividend yield and we're at our targeted 40% net income payout ratio.","During the quarter, we made the decision to lower our long-term [NIIC] [ph] risk based capital target by 20 percentage points with the midpoint of our range now at 400%. As a reminder, at year-end 2018, our RBC ratio was reduced by 45 percentage points as a result of a change to the NIIC formula associated with U.S. tax reform.","Our capital and liquidity positions remained very strong. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1.1 billion of available capital in the holding company, $400 million of available cash in our subsidiaries and $200 million of capital in excess of our new RBC midpoint of 400%. The financial flexibility we've created allows us to execute the Wells Fargo transaction without compromising our liquidity and leverage targets.","We have no meaningful debt maturities until 2022 and our leverage ratio is expected to remain within our 20% to 25% targeted range. Whether through strategic acquisitions organic growth or investing in our businesses, we continue to prioritize investments that position Principal for long-term success.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. A question for Renee regarding. RIS fees, flows obviously were very good in the quarter, transfer and recurring deposits were strong. But one thing that's notable is the withdrawals came down meaningfully compared to the past couple of quarters. Can you talk about the driver for the improvement and kind of what you think about the net flows pictures for the balance of the year?","Dan Houston","Yes. Humphrey thanks for the question. It really was a great quarter for RIS full service, and Renee is in an ideal position to respond to your question.","Renee Schaaf","Thank you, Humphrey. Yes, you're correct. If you do look at our withdrawals for first quarter 2019, they are favorable. And if you were to dissect that a little bit further, you would see that our plan sponsor or the contract withdrawals in particular were very favorable. One thing to know, though is, as you make a quarter over one year ago quarter comparison, we did have a relatively large plan withdrawal in first quarter 2018, so that needs to be taken, excuse me, third quarter -- excuse me, first quarter. Pardon me. And so that would have to be taken into consideration as well, but it was a very good net cash flow quarter overall.","Humphrey Lee","I guess, are you doing anything different in terms of client retention or anything like that that helps to foresee the more favorable withdrawal activities?","Renee Schaaf","I would say, Humphrey, that if you were to look at our overall model, we continue to invest in the customer experience and you see this in several different ways. We've made consistent digital investments into creating new tools that would make both the plan sponsor and the participant experience better. So, from a plan sponsor perspective, for example, investing in the chat features, investing into new tools that would allow the plan sponsor to better serve their participants using online capabilities certainly lead to a better experience and better retention. And the same thing is true in the participant side. So I would say that the favorable retention results that you see here reflect a very strong underlying business model.","Dan Houston","Yes. The only thing I might add Humphrey to that impressive list of things that Renee and her team are doing is, if I look at it, it's still 50% of the sales are total retirement suite. They find great value in combining deferred comp, defined benefit, and defined contribution. Also, I think that the new tool that was rolled out within the last six months called Picture that allows our sales reps to be more fluid in their sales presentations to prospective clients and advisors, very positive feedback from the market. And then, also noteworthy, a 12% increase in the number of new advisors we're working with in this current period. So I think across every one of the important metrics around leveraging technology and our position with our alliance partners we've got good momentum. So thanks for the question Humphrey.","Humphrey Lee","I appreciate the color. Just a follow up on PGI. So you've talked about the $3 billion outflows. You saw and I understand that they have very low fees, but I was just wondering, can you size the earnings impact from that outflow, and then on the flip side, the new mandate that you're getting from the same clients, do you expect that to offset the earnings impact from the $3 billion outflow?","Dan Houston","Tim, you\u2019ve got a quick response. ","Tim Dunbar","Sure. Thanks for the question, Humphrey. I think as we've talked before, this is a good relationship with a really good client. We continue to see interest in higher-value added strategies that fit well with the hedging costs that they're seeing today. We don't quantify exactly how much we're losing in terms of the fees related to the $3 billion, but I would say the new mandate goes a fair way to replacing that revenue.","John Egan","Thanks for the question.","Humphrey Lee","Thank you.","Operator","The next question we will come from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. For RIS fee, looking at the adjusted return on net revenue ex the favorable DAC this quarter, looks like they are still at the high-end of the guidance range for the year even though fee income was still dampened a bit by market. So just wondering if there\u2019s anything else that boosted results this quarter or do you think margins at the higher end of the range are sustainable going forward?","Dan Houston","Renee?","Renee Schaaf","Yes. Thank you for the question Erik. When we look at the 30% return on net revenue for our first quarter, we're not seeing anything unusual that would boost the results there. And so, when we look forward for the remainder of the year, we think our guidance of 26% to 30% remains very appropriate.","Erik Bass","Thanks. Got it. And then another question for RIS shifting to the spread side, PRT activity was strong both for you and it looks like across the industry in 1Q, I\u2019m curious what you think is driving this and does it suggest that we're on pace for just a really strong sales year or is that a pull forward of activity? ","Dan Houston","I think it's a great question. I'll have Renee answer it, but I will say that it's been interesting to me as we've seen these interest rates go up and sort of tested 3.25, 3, and knocking on the door at 3.5, and they've fallen back. I think again, it just sort of wakes up. These things are normally in process. They're in motion. They're -- they've already sort of aligned their thoughts with things they want to unload this liability from their balance sheet, and frankly it not only was a good quarter but it's an incredibly strong pipeline for the balance of the year. Renee?","Renee Schaaf","Yes. Erik, just to give you a little bit of color about the sales that we saw in first quarter. We did see about $600 million of pension risk transfer sales and this was not dominated by a single large sale. This was really many smaller sales that are smaller sized transfers that fall comfortably within our sweet spot.","We do continue to see a very robust pipeline for PRT and the other thing that I would, I think is very interesting when you look at the industry. There's about $3 trillion of defined benefit or pension corporate plans out there. And only a very small portion of that has been derisks from corporate balance sheets. So I do think we'll continue to see strong pipelines moving forward. We will also continue to be very careful and very disciplined as we look at these opportunities to make sure that the risk profile and that the returns are well within our comfort range.","Erik Bass","Sure. Thanks for the questions.","John Egan","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott","Good morning. First question I had was just on PGI on the fees. I mean just looking at the fee rate quarter-over-quarter, I mean doing a calculation it seems like it dropped more than it has sequentially for a while now. So I'd just be interested in any commentary was there any kind of repricing activity that maybe drove that. Does it have to do maybe just with the fear of fee days or something like that? I'm just trying to get a feel for -- if there is more pressure there or if it's just something with the calculation?","Dan Houston","And certainly mix comes into that as well Tim you want to go and take that.","Tim Dunbar","Sure. So the fee rate did drop as you suggest for the first quarter here and I would say the large majority of that is related to transaction fees. Those are predominantly on commercial real estate. So if you think about first quarter after that sort of volatile fourth quarter commercial mortgage loan activity got started off at a slower pace. I would say that's picked up dramatically and we're seeing that come back. So, we don't see that being a long-term issue throughout the year.","We also had a little bit less than what we would have seen in performance fees. And then, as you suggest there has been fee pressure in the industry and we've continued to update our fee level but that's been -- and so you've seen a little bit of that but that's been a much smaller component of it.","Alex Scott","That's helpful. And then, my follow up question is, just in the corporate segment, compensation and other came in a bit higher, I guess can you add dimension, how much do you expect to continue, I mean is the 300 to 320 range for the full year still so a good way to think about it.","Dan Houston","Yes. It's a good question and one of course Deanna is in a good position to respond to.","Deanna Strable","Yes. Thanks Alex. As I mentioned on earlier on the call, we do now expect to be above the guidance. So really have a larger [indiscernible] two drivers of that, one that was seen in the first quarter and one that will more play out towards the end of the year. The one that was seen in the first quarter was that we did have higher security benefit pension expenses. That was not known at the time of the outlook call it really gets determined really on 12\/31. And due to the market decline that increased our GAAP expense for the pension plan and that will continue as we go throughout the year.","The other driver and corporate will actually be due to the impacts of the Wells acquisition. So we will have some one-time transaction costs that will come into corporate. We'll also have the additional financing costs due to our debt issuance and we'll also have some lost investment income due to lower excess capital as we fund that acquisition. And so that will cause us to be above that original targeted range of 300 to 320. I would say that the first quarter loss is a good proxy, absent the impact of the Wells transaction. But as you have seen in corporate for many, many years, this will obviously be very volatile quarter-to-quarter.","Dan Houston","Appreciate the questions Alex.","Alex Scott","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi. Good morning. First, I just had a question on asset management flow. They obviously turn to positive this quarter after I think five straight quarterly decline. So does this have anything to do with any of the management changes or the initiatives you've been undertaking over the past year in the business or just if you could give some color on what drove this?","Dan Houston","Yes. We're excited about the change in direction and Tim and Dunbar and Pat Halter, I think have just done an extraordinarily outstanding job Jimmy looking under the hood of PGI and understanding where some efficiencies in distribution could be gained. And so there has been some realignment and I'd also tell you that the group is highly motivated and excited about the leadership. With that I'll ask him to fill in the blanks.","Tim Dunbar","Jimmy thanks a lot for the question. And we have talked a lot about some of the management changes we've made, some of the structural changes and really trying to align the group with our clients. And so really the focus has been in creating that long-term relationship and bringing to bear all of the solutions that are diversified boutique model brings. And so we are starting to see some positive signs of that placements on platforms of some of our products. And really for this quarter one of the things, I'm probably most excited about is that the range of products we've seen positive flows and has really been something that we've been trying to achieve. So not only did we see some of our yield oriented products like preferreds, high yield, diversified real assets see positive flows, but even a lot of our equity products.","So REITs, blue chip which has a large cap U.S. equity product really sets some decent flows, equity income and small cap international, so really across a broad range of capabilities. And so we're optimistic about the future. Obviously second quarter we'll have some headwinds with a client that's leaving, but for the second half of the year, we still feel good about that then net cash flows.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then, there's a lot of talk about new pension regulation, secure act and how that affects smaller employers. Do you see that as more as an opportunity or is there a threat in there as well that the potential sort of better bargaining leverage on the part of smaller employers as they can combine to offer a retirement plan.","Tim Dunbar","Jimmy, we spent a lot of time on this topic, it's an important one not only important here in the U.S. but there's a lot of pension regulation changes occurring around the world. But, the idea of the MEPs, the multiple employer plans. We've been in that business for a long time. We understand exactly how to execute on that strategy. And our vantage point is, if it increases coverage and it increases adequacy for American workers, we want to pursue that. It's just good policy. But I'll ask Renee to add some additional color on how we're executing on that strategy. Renee?","Renee Schaaf","Thank you, Jimmy. As Dan said that we're very excited about the potential of what could evolve with pension reform in the United States. And the open MEPs is just one of the aspects that we think will extend coverage to smaller employers. But there's another aspect of this reform that I think is very important and we believe will serve Americans well and that is better positioning the annuity to be a part of retirement plans moving forward. As you know today, it's not clear there's not a safe harbor plan design for plan sponsors to add the annuity option [indiscernible] defined contribution plan. So we really believe that it's in the best interest of Americans to have this kind of income guarantee available to them moving forward. And so, we're excited not only about the open MEPs, but also about the ability to provide that higher through retire solution to the U.S. worker.","John Egan","Thanks Jimmy. Great questions.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Dan Houston","John, you there?","John Barnidge","Sorry. My phone is muted. Specialty benefits on increase in lapse rates for group life and incurred loss rates for group dental as compared to a year ago. Can you talk about what you're seeing there a little bit please?","Dan Houston","Yes, absolutely. Amy please?","Amy Friedrich","Thanks for the question, John. I think what we're really getting at here is probably mostly a comparison issue. I think Deanna mentioned it in her comments before, but we typically see a lot of first quarter seasonality from our dental vision line. And last year first quarter we didn't see quite as much of that. I would say we're back to normal seasonality for dental and vision for first quarter of this year. For group disability in terms of the loss ratios, first quarter last year was unusually low. We had a lot of moving pieces happening first quarter last year that kind of made things a little noisier product by product. But I would say we're back to something at this point now that we feel like is indicative of a pretty good run rate. So always a reminder too on loss ratios given the seasonality, given the things that can happen quarter-by-quarter in these businesses, trailing 12 months tends to be a good guideline to go back to.","Dan Houston","And well within the ranges.","Amy Friedrich","Yes. And then lapses. Did you have a lapse question as well John?","John Barnidge","Yes. I did. Thanks.","Amy Friedrich","Okay. Let me get at the lapse question then Q. One of the things that will happen with the businesses from quarter-to-quarter, we can have larger cases that have some impact into our lapses. And so when I look at Group Life, Group Life for first quarter of this year was impacted by some larger case lapses. Keep in mind that as we look at the business we look at what rate we need. We asked for rate increases against that business and when I look at our Group Life Lock, we are increasing the profitability and performance of that block. So I'm comfortable with any lapses that happened first quarter.","John Barnidge","Great. And then my follow up sticking with the group a bit, it's really strong sales continued a lot of the progress seen. What are you seeing there on the pricing competitive landscape and where you're maybe seeing demand come from? Thank you very much. ","Dan Houston","Amy?","Amy Friedrich","Right. So that the landscape is competitive but not irrational in the markets that we're in. So, keep in mind in the markets that we're in, we're mostly in that small to medium sized marketplace. So, we don't tend to be in that larger and we don't tend to be in the jumbo case on the hunt for some of those jumbo cases. And so, when I look at the pricing we're able to typically get the type of price that we want on a really attractive growth rate. I would come back to I think we do the fundamentals of the business really, really well especially in the small market. In fact I'd argue in the small market we're probably one of the best total offerings out there in terms of total value.","John Egan","Appreciate the questions John.","Operator","The next question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the Wells retirement acquisition more strategic. In the past, they typically seemed more cautious on a larger case record keeping business, so was hoping you could give some perspective on how and why your view on that has changed now?","Dan Houston","Ryan thanks for that question. Well, I can't tell you how excited we are about welding the Wells Fargo institutional retirement and trust business to Principal for a lot of different reasons. We actually as you've pointed out have focused on that small to medium with a modest amount of large plans. And then, if you looked at their block, it really inserts nicely because we actually have more jumbo cases than Wells Fargo has. So there was a little bit of a gap in our sort of total lineup. So we're excited about what that feels. Additionally as was mentioned in the prepared comments, the fact that they have this trust business gives us some additional flexibilities.","I would also tell you that the fact that they have an ESAP program in place, a non-qualified structure in place. It just fits like hand in glove in terms of our existing structure. So other than size, it is also additive and that they have historically worked with a group of advisors, consultants that maybe weren't first top of mind for Principal and given our strategy in terms of bringing over a large percentage of the relationship managers and the consultants, relationship management teams et cetera. We feel that we can really create a seamless transition for the advisors, for the clients, for the participants and just frankly add a whole lot more value. And with that, I realize I took quite a bit of time Renee. But we'd love to have you make some additional comments.","Renee Schaaf","Yes. Thank you. Yes, I would agree with Dan's comments. This acquisition is really ideal from so many different perspectives. First off, it reinforces our commitment to the retirement industry. And when you look traditionally at the capabilities that we've brought to the marketplace, from a record keeping perspective, we serve a wide range of clients in terms of size, in terms of makeup, in terms of the various characteristics and needs.","And so having the ability to add scale to our recordkeeping platform makes us that much more competitive, the ability to lower the unit cost, the ability to scale our platforms to allow us to remain competitive in the industry to continue to invest in this business and to deliver favorable margins. The capabilities that we're adding in the large planned market are very attractive to us. Adding abilities in the consulting channel again is very important.","And the last thing that I'll mention is, we also have access to a very experienced and talented employee pool and I can't stress that enough. We had the opportunity this past week to invite about 100 of the Wells Fargo institutional retirement and Trust Team members into the line. And I can't tell you the level of energy and enthusiasm that we had amongst the group. And what struck me was the commonality that we all have in terms of keeping the customer at the center and making sure that everything that we do is customer-centric and will advance our ability to serve both the plan sponsor and the participant in the years to come. So we're very excited about this transition and the acquisition.","Ryan Krueger","Great. Thank you very much.","John Egan","Thank you, Ryan. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will come from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman","Hey, good morning. Maybe just staying on RIS fee for a bit. Just in terms of the fee levels maybe you could give a little guidance as to where you kind of see that going in the next year or two, we kind of do a calculate. We calculated 66 basis points of fees and other revenues divided by average assets in '17, and then it was 63 last year. And we will get this quarter and it was about 58 basis points and I know that it has something to do with the average daily balances versus 59 in the prior quarter. But, maybe you could just give us a little color on where you see that going over the next one or two or three years. ","Dan Houston","Happy to cover that, Renee?","Renee Schaaf","Sure. First off, let's maybe take a look at what happened in first quarter and then I'll make some comments about where what we might expect moving forward. But when we look at first quarter and you compare that to a quarter one year ago. The first thing to keep in mind is that the S&P daily average was down about 0.5%. And so that of course had a very -- that muted market performance had an impact on the year-over-year fee levels that you can expect for us to deliver. So, a portion of that of the gap there was about a 6% gap year-over-year, a quarter-over-quarter rather. So most of that again as a result of a very muted market performance.","The other thing that I would draw your attention to is, when we mentioned this in our outlook call, we anticipate seeing about a 1% to 2% decline in fees as a result of commissions beginning to transfer to fees paid to advisors. And what this does is it, it reduces the net revenue, but it also reduces the commission line, so that the impact to the pre-tax operating earnings remains the same and the impact to the margin remains the same.","And just a quick commentary on that trend, we view that very favorably. It absolutely isolates the advisor, compensation and makes that very visible to the plan sponsor and it removes it from a conversation that's necessary as we think about our fees with the plan sponsor. So, we would anticipate that kind of activity to continue. So, then looking forward, historically you've heard us talk about that 5% to 8% gap between growth and account values and growth in net revenues. And that's the result of the typical pressures within the industry on revenues that results from decoupling the recordkeeping decision from the investment management decision, the open architecture reduction and investment management fees due to passive investing things of that nature.","We envision that that's a reasonable guideline moving forward. So, we would say, you can expect to see about a 5% to 8% gap due to simple industry revenue pressures as well as maybe a 1% to 2% shift due to commissions moving to a fee-based compensation arrangement.","Dan Houston","Andrew, I think it also speaks to why we feel we have to have scale on these businesses for this very reason.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. And very helpful. And then, just the next question actually maybe I could sneak a one liner before the next question. But just the tax rate at 16 were and Deanna talked about 16 to 20 guidance. Can we expect the low end going forward? And then just shifting over to just staying on pension risk transfer. Maybe talk about the level of competition in these smaller accounts. You mentioned that the pricing is better than the jumbo, but how many competitors do you see when you typically go after one of these smaller PRTs. Is it aggressive?","Dan Houston","Yes. Let me take both of those, I would say that the tax rate we still think is going to be well within the range. I wouldn't want to speculate at this point in time on a full year basis, but when we look at the tax rate on the lower end, but well within the range. On the pension risk transfer business there really does break into two different groups large and small. Think about kind of below $0.5 billion and greater than a half a billion. And I would say in each case there's about a half a dozen key competitors we know who they are. We know how they get to where they're at. We're still getting what we consider to be a very nice return on invested capital in these lines of business. There are a few more competitors today than there was two or three years ago, but it is a competitive marketplace. But we think we're getting more than adequately compensated for the use of the capital for this line of business. And again very committed to it. Appreciate the question.","Andrew Kligerman","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Thomas Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. Another follow up on RIS fee. So it looks like it is going to be related to I guess the comment that you made about that 5% to 8% gap in revenue growth versus asset growth. But, if I look at the disclosure that you have between plan sizes, it looks to me like either all or vast majority of your growth in flows is coming from a thousand lives and in larger plans. If I just look at either playing grow or asset growth. Is that a fair characterization, I mean are you sure in terms of the business that's a thousand lives and smaller. Are you actually seeing net outflows overall. And can you talk a little bit about what the economic difference is, if revenue field for these large plans versus mid to small.","Tim Dunbar","Yes. We actually see good net cash flow in each of the market segments, but I'll have Renee speak specifically to your question Tom.","Dan Houston","Yes. Thank you for that question Tom. When we look at the mix of business that we have between the larger plan and the smaller plan, we're actually seeing good growth in both of these segments. And certainly the retention of clients in both of these segments remains very positive.","In any one quarter, we will tend to see sales migrate just naturally, we'll see some volatility or some difference in the mix of the business that we sell. So, for example in first quarter if you look at that record $5.4 billion of sales, you'll see that it is not dominated by any single large plan at all. But there's a really nice mix of the midsize plan. And that will vary from quarter-to-quarter. With respect to your question around the vary variation in the revenues that we would collect.","As you might imagine with smaller plans, we tend to not only pick up the record-keeping but oftentimes we pick up a share a larger share of the asset management as well. And with a larger plans they tend to steer more towards open architecture and our ability to win or capture assets is certainly favorable in that size market. But, it's going to be less than what you see in the smaller planned market. So, we feel very comfortable with the business mix and showed very comfortable with our approach and our and our ability to deliver growth in both small and in large plan and certainly our ability to retain that.","Dan Houston","The other thing worth noting, Tom, on the asset retention part it's fairly indiscriminate on the relative size of the employer. We have a really good shot at small medium and large individuals who are part of a plan and who are looking for advice and benefits. Whether it's a job changer or a retiree.","Got you. and just a follow up on that, can you break out in terms of flows how much of your flows, if you can quantify of the, I think it's what $3.4 billion of cash flows would have been a thousand lives in larger versus the below that size if you're able to quantify that you know that's not something we're going to provide at this point. But, appreciate your comment. Thank you.","Thomas Gallagher","Thanks.","Operator","The final question is Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. I just want to circle back on the well deal. So in RIS fee as you've spent a fair amount of money on digital over the past couple of years as you get to know the Wells block. Any color on -- are you getting anything that you didn't have or are there going to be some incremental expenses that you're going to have to incur to get digital on those plans. Certainly today would be helpful?","Dan Houston","Yes. Great, great question. And as you might expect, you get some of that during due diligence, but the real lift is starting as we speak to really fully understand some of the capabilities and what you might onboard to augment and it is our promise and commitment to take best in class on all fronts. With that Renee, want to add some additional color on specificity.","Renee Schaaf","Sure. When we think about the path forward and how we will integrate our businesses, we've really arrived at thinking about this in terms of four overarching principles. And the first principle is to keep the customer clearly at the center and to make sure that we minimize any disruption in service that we do everything we can to provide business as usual an excellent service to those clients.","The second thing, as Dan mentioned, we have the ideal opportunity to take the best from both operations and team and to put this together into an extremely compelling offering to the marketplace.","The next thing that we are very concerned about and we are paying a lot of attention to is talent. We are picking up a very experienced team from the Wells Fargo institutional retirement and trust business. And we want to make sure that we do everything we can to make their onboarding smooth as well.","And then, last of all, we don't view this as just an integration of business. We view this as an opportunity to create unsurpassed value to the marketplace. This is our opportunity to move the needle. And so will approach this very thoughtfully, very carefully and you can expect to hear a lot more on this as the months ahead unfold.","Suneet Kamath","Got to make sense. And then my follow up is again on RIS fee. See if I look at your disclosures it looks like the percentage of assets that are non-proprietary is now slightly over a third of the mix and it's been the fastest growing piece. Based on your disclosures. So I guess is that performance, is that fee-related is it active to passive and where does that. I think it's about $33.5 today where does that do you think that goes over the next couple of years. Thanks.","Tim Dunbar","Yes. So, maybe quickly on that one, it has in part as Renee described earlier. A difference on the size of the plan sponsor and if you're skewing towards the larger end you're going to put downward pressure on the percentage of proprietary Asset Management.","The percentage of small medium and large they've drifted slightly downward over the over the last few. But, again it's our objective to be customer centric, provide customers and advisors for what they are looking for, there are multiple sources of revenue growth for Principal in totality. And so we continue to manage that but we will continue it to be customer centered and how we present our investment offering. The fees are competitive, the performances is good and a little bit of an hiccup in Q4 period. But, as I look at the relative strength of the investment performance on the 1, 3 and 5 that still puts us on a formidable position to attract a lot of assets.","The last thing I would say and you can't forget this. We still capture a lot of assets through DCIO, it's where we're putting our investment options on our competitors platform and again that's been a growth engine for the company as well. And those results are not shown in full service, but rather within PGI. So thank you for the question.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A session. Mr. Houston, your closing comments please.","Dan Houston","Good. Thank you. And again, from our perspective good start to the year. We do have multiple parallel pass of growth that we're executing on as we speak and we've talked about this. One is around the digitizing of our business and it does have some cost, but that is starting to bear fruit and we're excited about what that's going to deliver. We also remain very enthusiastic about successfully onboarding the Wells Fargo Retirement Trust customers. And I emphasized both the retirement and the trust customers, it's a big part of their franchise as well as putting us in a favorable position with their advisors and their clients and executing on that.","The third is around our operational excellence initiative, a big undertaking for us here as we continue to be as efficient as we can in aligning our resources with the needs of our customers. And then, lastly, as you would expect delivering outstanding customer service. And again, if you looked at all the growth initiatives for the first quarter there is a clear sign that there's a good value proposition for principal clients. And so with that thank you for taking the time today and look forward to seeing you on the road. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

Welcome to Principal Financial Group\u2019s second quarter conference call. As always our materials related to today\u2019s call are available on our website at principal.com\/investor. Following a reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO, Dan Houston; and CFO, Deanna Strable will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions.

This year's focus will be on our spread and risk businesses and our long-term capital deployment strategy. Dan?","Dan Houston","Thanks John and welcome to everyone on the call. A special welcome to Amy Frederick on her first earnings call. As communicated in our May announcement, Amy brings more than 20 years of business experience including extensive leadership within our Specialty Benefits division and a strong background in strategy development. This morning I'll share some performance highlighting an key accomplishments to position us for continued growth. Deanna will provide details on second quarter financial results and an update on capital deployment. Building on first quarter's momentum, we delivered a record $384 million of operating earnings in the second quarter that contributed to operating earnings of $754 million year-to-date. This is an increase of 21% compared to the first half of 2016 reflecting double digit net revenue growth and strong expense discipline.","As I reflect on our performance in the first half of the year, we continued to deliver strong growth, execute our customer focused solutions oriented strategy, balance investments in growth and expense control and be good stewards of shareholder capital. I'm particularly pleased with the trailing 12 month trends across our businesses for revenue, margins and pretax earnings. Our diversified integrated business model continues to work for our customers and shareholders. Compared to a year ago, we've increased assets under management or AUM, 10% to a record $629 billion as of mid-year. This increase provides a solid foundation for revenue and earnings growth for the remainder of 2017 and it reflects strong asset appreciation as well as $9 billion of positive net cash flows. I do want to call out after 24 consecutive quarters of positive net cash flows, we had negative net cash flows during the second quarter. I don't view this as a systemic issue, there were a few primary contributors to this quarter's net cash flows.","First and foremost, it reflects the volatility that\u2019s inherent in the global institutional asset management and retirement space as large deposits and withdrawals can occur unevenly over time. This negatively impacted flows in PGI, Principal International and the RIS-Fee business. In the second quarter we had two large mandates in PIG withdraw a total of $3.3 billion during a period that we did not have any new large mandates fund. One of the mandates left due to a rise in currency hedging cost, the other decline took the investment management in-house. Importantly, these large withdrawals are not translating into significant revenue losses as we've had good success bringing in somewhat smaller higher revenue mandates. As discussed last quarter, we continue to see negative net cash flows from Columbus Circle investors.","During the quarter, CCI had $900 million of negative net cash flows. We've made a number of changes at the boutique and investment performance has improved year to date. Additionally, the ongoing turmoil in the Chilean pension system continued to elevate withdrawals at Cuprum early in the second quarter, driving negative net cash flows of $400 million. Even with the outflows during the quarter, Chile reported record assets under management and local currency. Lastly, despite some softness in sales during the quarter, we still delivered $700 million of positive net cash flows in Brazil and remain the market leader in that deposits. Despite the pressure of this quarter we continue to have multiple meaningful sources of positive net cash flow.","Through six months, RIS-Fee, RIS-Spread and Principal International all delivered positive net cash flows totaling $5 billion. We delivered at least 200 million each of positive net cash flows for eight of our boutiques and PGI as sales of our niche institutional strategies remain solid. Our US retail funds business generated $0.5 billion of positive net cash flows and our target date suite flows remain positive including positive flows in second quarter, with strong sales and contributions from retirement plan participants. Our historical positive total company net cash flow was not an accident, it comes down to several key factors, strong long-term investment performance, expertise across asset classes and in-asset allocation, a wide array of solutions that meet the needs of retirement, retail and institutional investors, our breath and diversity of asset gathering businesses, and leading positions and strong distribution networks in key asset management markets around the world. This all remains in place.","At mid-year, more than 80% of principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trusts were above median for the three and five year performance periods. Additionally 56% of our rated funds have a four or five star rating from Morningstar. We again received multiple best funds awards during the quarter around the world. CPAM Malaysia was named Funhouse of the year by Asian investor during the quarter and our global high yield fund won nine Thomson Reuters Lipper fund awards. For the second half of 2017 I'm cautiously optimistic about net cash flow as we expect improvement for PI in Brazil, Chile and Hong Kong, additional momentum for PGI across multiple platforms including US retail, Dublin and global SMA. There are a number of large mandates that we are working on PGI that could fund by the end of the year. Growth opportunities within our spread business particularly in the pension close out business. That said we also expect a handful of larger retirement plans to terminate in RIS-Fee over the next two to three quarters totaling approximately $3 billion.","We continue to expect strong net cash flows in our core US retirement plan market, small to medium sized businesses. Taken in total, we expect improvement in net cash flow for the second half of the year. While net cash flow remains an important measure, what's more important is driving sustainable growth and revenue and operating earnings. To do so, we'll continue to capitalize on leading positions with our broad array of investment options, with institutional and high net worth investors around the world and with retirement investors and long-term savers in the US, Latin America and Asia. I\u2019ll focus my remaining comments on key execution highlights and the work we're doing to further strengthen our competitive positioning. In the second quarter, we continue to expand and enhance our solution set with emphasis on outcomes based funds with a particular focus on income solutions, alternative investments to enhance diversification and manage downside risk, our international retail platform to capitalize on opportunities in Latin America, Asia and Europe, And our ETF, CIT and SMA platforms to provide lower cost divestment options to complement our more traditional strategies.","Product launches during the quarter included an emerging market income fund on our UCITS platform, two new funds in Chile and actively managed yield oriented equity ETF strategy on our US platform. Our ETFs are providing lower cost ways to improve diversification for retail and high net worth investors. Two of our recent launches have received important recognition, Principal Active Global Dividend Income ETF is not only the largest 2017 launch to-date, it is the largest active equity ETF in the world. Principal US Small Cap Index ETF was also recently recognized as one of the five most successful ETF launches of 2016. Moving to distribution, we continue to advance our multichannel, multiproduct strategy, I\u2019ll highlight a few key developments. We continue to get our funds added to platforms recommended list and model portfolios. Through mid-year we've earned 36 total placements getting 22 different funds on 16 different third-party platforms, with success across asset classes.","CCB principal asset management was selected as one of seven fund companies to offer their mutual funds on Alibaba's online financial portal. We began the national rollout of Easy Elect, our patented technology designed to make it easier and more intuitive for people who make decisions and enroll in employer sponsored benefits. Results remain strong with participation levels 10% to 15% higher than traditional enrollment methods. Our term life insurance is now offered on a direct to consumer basis through AIG Direct. Lastly, we continue to make progress on our digital advice and sale platform in the US, Latin America, and Asia.","Before closing, a quick DOL update. The DOL fiduciary rule became applicable on June 9. We continue to work closely with our distribution partners around the implementation. This effort only strengthens our relationships with these key partners while there is some uncertainty in the marketplace we remain laser focused on helping advisors deliver retirement protection and income solutions to their customers. In closing, we'll go forward from a position of strength, with excellent fundamentals and the benefit of broad diversification. I look for us to continue to build momentum through 2017 and for that momentum to translate into long-term value for our shareholders. Deanna?","Deanna Strable","Thanks Dan. Good morning to everyone on the call. I\u2019ll focus my comments on the key contributors to our financial performance during the quarter and provide an update on capital deployment. In the second quarter, we generated a record $384 million of total company operating earnings and a record $1.31 of operating earnings per share. Both a 14% increase over the year ago quarter. We had two significant variances during the second quarter that resulted in a net benefit to operating earnings. Pre-tax impacts of these items included a $10 million benefit from higher than expected variable investment income, RIS-Spread benefited by $7 million dollars and individual benefited by $3 million. And $5 million of elevated quarterly expenses in principal international primarily in Mexico.","Net income available to Principal Financial Group was $310 million for second quarter 2017. This included net realized capital losses of $74 million primarily driven by derivative marks. Credit related losses were only $9 million and remain well below our pricing assumption. At quarter end, ROE excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustment was 14.8% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact from the 2015 and 2016 actuarial reviews, ROE improved 230 basis points from a year ago to 15.3% reflecting strong earnings growth, improvement in macroeconomic conditions and disciplined capital management. Keep in mind that over the long term we expect to improve ROE by 30 to 60 basis points per year with fluctuations in any period.","Second quarter results were fueled by continued strong business fundamentals, underlying revenue growth and disciplined expensing and capital management. Additionally, quarterly operating earnings benefited from strong US equity market performance as the S&P 500 Index quarterly daily average increased more than 3% over first quarter and 15% over the prior year quarter. As Dan indicated, total company AUM increased 10% from a year ago to a record $629 billion in second quarter 2017, providing us with a solid foundation for continued operating earnings growth. However, total company net cash flows for the quarter were a negative $2.9 billion. While the large withdrawals we experienced this quarter totaling over $5 billion were meaningful to net cash flows, the revenue impact is not significant.","To illustrate this point, the same client that terminated $2 billion mandate during the quarter recently awarded us an emerging market debt mandate. While the new mandate is only a small fraction of the assets they withdrew, it offsets nearly 60% of the annual revenue from the larger investment grade mandate. While net cash flow is an indicator of future earning, it doesn't always tell the whole story due to our wide array of product offerings with a broad range of fees.","Moving to business unit results, on a trailing 12-month basis and excluding the impact of the 2016 and 2016 actuarial assumption reviews, revenue growth and margin metrics were within or above our 2017 guidance ranges for all of our business units. RIS-Fee, RIS-Spread and PGI were above the guidance range for revenue growth, while Principal International, Specialty Benefits and Individual Life were in line. Additionally, RIS-Fee and RIS-Spread were above the guidance range for margins, while PGI, Principal International, Specialty Benefits and Individual Life were in line. These strong results reflect the successful execution of our diversified and integrated business model with a constant focus on balancing growth and profitability. Consistent with last quarter, my comments will exclude the impact of the significant variances I mentioned earlier.","As always reported business unit results and key drivers can be found in the slides, supplement and press release. Principal Global Investors, Principal International, Specialty Benefits and Individual Life pretax operating earnings were in line with expectations in the second quarter. Each of these businesses continue to produce growth and margins that looks very attractive relative to peers. In addition, corporate pretax operating losses were in line with our expectations. We continue to anticipate full-year 2017 corporate pretax [Technical Difficulty] of the previously announced range of $200 million to $225 million. RIS-Fee and RIS-Spread [Technical Difficulty] our expectations for the quarter and I\u2019ll cover these in a little more detail. ","As shown on Slide 6, RIS-Fee\u2019s pretax operating earnings of $148 million increased 18% over the year ago quarter. The strong increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue stemming from higher account values and disciplined expense management. Strong market performance relative to our assumptions continues to positively impact RIS-Fee\u2019s net revenue growth, margin and thus, pretax operating earnings. Spread on Slide 7, pretax operating earnings were [Technical Difficulty] or 27% higher than the prior year quarter. For the same time period, RIS- Spread account values grew 8%, driven by strong sales in the pension risk transfer business and fixed annuities as well as opportunistic issuance and investment only. Similar to first quarter 2017, mortality and experience gains in our pension risk transfer business contributed to favorable operating earnings this quarter.","Moving to capital deployment on Slide 12, in second quarter, we deployed $166 million of capital including $133 million in common stock dividends, $26 million in share repurchases and $7 million to increased ownership in a PGI boutique. Year to date we've deployed $414 million of capital and remain on track to deploy $800 million to $1.1 billion for the full year. Five years ago we announced our intention to increase our payout ratio to 40% to better reflect our business mix. At that time, our payout ratio was approximately 30%. Last night, we announced a $0.47 common stock dividend payable in the third quarter, a 15% increase from the prior-year period and approaching our targeted 40% dividend payout ratio. We\u2019ll continue to be strategic and disciplined in deploying capital. We have an active M&A pipeline and have created the financial flexibility to execute on attractive opportunities that enhance long-term shareholder value.","On a trailing 12-month basis, we have delivered a five-year compound annual growth rate of 13% in operating earnings, exceeding our 9% to 12% long-term target. I'm confident we\u2019ll continue to deliver above market revenue growth and industry leading margins and achieve our long-term targets in the future. In closing, I have enjoyed the opportunity to meet with many of you in my new capacity this year. I look forward to future interactions in the coming months. ","This concludes our prepared remarks, operator please open the call for question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill.","John Bakewell","A few questions, the dividend was increased for a six consecutive quarter. Can you talk about ability to maybe keep that pace up, should anticipate maybe a penny every quarter? And then I\u2019ll ask the other questions later.","Dan Houston","I wouldn't expect $0.01 every quarter, we again try to provide you with guidance that this 40% targeted payout ratio is really ideal from our perspective, it's taken a while to get there and certainly our intention to be in around that 40% unless something material was disruptive to the business.","John Bakewell","And then premiums were up nicely across products in Specialty Benefit. Can you talk about that a little bit, is it pricing power, maybe taken advantage of some of the disruption in the market or simply the US economy is doing better we had a decent print this morning for the second quarter? Thanks.","Dan Houston","Good question John, I appreciate that. I\u2019m have Amy, Amy go ahead and answer that.","Amy Friedrich","Hi John, good to talk with you. You're right, premiums were good. When we look at 8% premium growth rate I'd say that\u2019s within our expectations. We've been seeing that for the last few years. And I do think we're benefiting from some pricing power. When we're in a small market with the type of reputation we have consistently in there with good business processes, good products, good practices we're seeing an ability to get off a spreadsheet and be a preferred provider and we like that. I think one factor though, you mentioned larger trends. I do think one factor going on in that premium growth is employment growth. So when I look at our business on a trailing 12-month basis, we're seeing employment growth of about 1.4% on our group product and as we look back over the arc of the last ten years that's near a high for us. So that 1.4% is clearly helpful in driving our in-force premium. And it's indicative of employment growth going on particularly in the small market. So again with our over indexing in the small market that's a really helpful trend for us.","Operator","The next question will come from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Just a question on RIS-Fee, so in Dan's prepared remarks, you mentioned that there some expected terminations in the second half of the year, roughly about 3 billion. So when you factor in the pace of the net cash flows in the first half of the year and the expectation for the redemption, is the normal kind of 1% to 2% RIS net cash flows, AUM still a good expectation for full-year of 2017.","Dan Houston","We don't provide updates on the guidance, but I would say that we're still feel reasonably good about the range, could be to the low end of that. And we again try to help investors understand the patterns there by giving you some insight when we know through M&A and other sorts of related transactions where we know we have a large known out. What we don't know is wealth at this point in time, Humphrey, is what the ins look like. But again our pipeline looks healthy, the business is very healthy and we're doing well in terms of competing out there, you can see that by the growth in the business. But maybe I can have Nora add a little bit color for you on that question. Nora?","Nora Everett","Sure. So the estimate that Dan gave at 3 billion, one thing to be aware of is we always have timing issues. So when we say two to three quarters it could be this calendar year, some of that could slip into next calendar year 1Q in particular. So again just trying to give an approximation. Another important part of the 3 billion is the majority of that 3 billion represents one case, the one case is north of 1.5 billion. So again that timing in that particular case whether it falls on the 4Q or 1Q at this point in time we're not sure when that would occur. We don't see the balance of that $3 billion primarily reflects in M&A with a couple of larger cases. And in fact in one case a bankruptcy, so we don't see any systemic issues here. And back to Dan's earlier point, importantly what we see with our core SMB segment, small to medium business segment is continuing strong net cash flow. So whether it's 1% to 3% or not it will depend on some timing here within the 1% to 3% percent, but probably more importantly that core SMB segment has still has strong net cash flow.","Humphrey Lee","And then shifting to principal international So at least the media related to China, there is a lot of discussions about financial services reform, especially they had a meeting in a couple weeks ago in July and then there seems to be a lot of thoughts about there could be some announcement following the 19th National Congress meeting in the fall. So I was just wondering if you have any kind of additional insight in terms of the pension opportunities that you've mentioned in the past?","Dan Houston","I'll take that, Humphrey, and then pass it off to Luis. Luis and I and other members of management were just there a couple of weeks ago, right, on the heels of the financial forum that you mentioned. And what I would say is we had very healthy dialog with our joint venture partner China Construction Bank as well as with regulators. There seems to be a lot of advocacy and support on the part of state and commerce to support US companies planning a more active role working in partnership with Chinese companies. And so those trade discussions are very much alive and well. But we walked away feeling very good about the robustness of our conversations. The MOUs delivering what we had hoped it would be, which is healthy exchange of ideas on how we can usually work together to be successful. But maybe I\u2019ll have Luis to add some additional color. Luis?","Luis Valdes","Yes, you are totally right. I mean many reforms are coming particularly if President Xi is going to be confirmed for the next five years, they\u2019re going to continue looking at the financial services industry. As you know China is a policy driven economy, so they're very much more focused on internal consumption and to continue development in that system. In particular, Humphrey, the pension reform in China is a big issue. And they are continually thinking how do switch their payroll system, Pillar 1 into contoured system based on Pillar 2 and Pillar 3. So very encouraging discussions, in order to do that they really need help, they need a pension experts, and global pension experts at Principal Financial Group. So we're very much more in those discussions, Humphrey.","Operator","The next question will come from Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss","I want to focus on RIS margins, maybe starting with fees. Obviously you're running well ahead of the 29 to 33 margin guidance for the full year. The longer term guidance suggests that you know those margins come down significantly. Can you just help us think about what actually drives that lower, is it pricing pressure, higher expenses, just trying to understand from a modeling perspective because it seems like a steep to what your longer term suggests versus the current.","Dan Houston","Yes Seth, I certainly appreciate the question and you're right and to ask those kinds of questions, but the first thing I would tell you is, you really have the benefit of strong domestic equity markets today that help really propel you to the high side of that and that's certainly one of the very key components. The other is and we have lighter expenses for the quarter albeit sometimes you have timing issues those do get spread out over a period of time, but the management team, Nora, Greg Burrows and others are doing a really good job managing the efficiencies of the operations. And then of course we know that we've just got a really strong investment performance for three and five year, which allows us still to manage a lot of a proprietary assets, which contributes to a successful franchise for a full service accumulation. But with that I\u2019m going to ask Nora to put some additional color on what the future might look like relative to those margins.","Nora Everett","Yes, as Dan said it, but you can't underestimate the power of equity market tailwinds. If you look at the daily average, up 15.5% 2Q over 2Q and so just the ability to have, for those equity markets to drive both top line and bottom line is significant. But probably as important again, not overlooking a strong fundamental, strong sales, up 25% year-to-date over year-to-date, strong recurring deposits. So the fundamental is very strong, but we certainly anticipate that the pricing pressure is going to continue. So that's why you see directionally the margins that we talk about. With that said, full year, we still expect to be at the high end of margin expectation and still expect to be at the high end of our earnings range. So we certainly are expecting continued good growth, but the margin discussion reflects both on the positive side, the equity market lift and the fact that we expect pricing pressure to continue.","Dan Houston","Did you have a follow-up, Seth?","Seth Weiss","Yeah. A follow-up, Dan, on your comments on the timing around expenses, particularly for the back half of the year. It sounds like that could just kick up a bit from a timing perspective. Any granularity you could help us there just to avoid surprises in the back half of the year?","Dan Houston","Yeah. It was not intended to be a sort of a loaded question, but from one quarter to the next, there are always some lumpiness the way expenses come in. When I think about, not only the balance of this year, but as we think about 2018 and beyond, enhancing the customer experience is a big deal for me. We know that competition and I'm not talking about financial services, I\u2019m talking more broadly that consumer has a higher expectation about what that feels like and looks like. We continue to invest in the brand and we're getting really good traction there. It\u2019s been very well received. ","Technology used to be a lot about the back office and middle office and we're seeing the need to make further investments on the very front end. So you'll see us making announcements around digital technology, machine learning, artificial intelligence to help us do a better job, servicing customers and running the business. And then, Jim mentioned, I know when he\u2019s been on the road recently about the expansion of some of our sales operations around the world. ","Again, we look at that as a good investment for today that pays off in the future. And then the last thing I would just draw your attention to is the shifting demands of consumers away from 40 Act funds and even CITs and a strong interest in exchange traded funds, ETFs, in that franchise, Jim is adding resources, talent, platforms and all things necessary. So it\u2019s that sort of pent-up views that I have on, of course we have to align our expenses with revenues. We want to be mindful of that, but those are the kinds of expenses I'm thinking about for the balance of the year and into \u201818.","Operator","The next question will come from Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo Securities.","Sean Dargan","Following up on Seth\u2019s question about RIS-Fee. The revenue growth in RIS-Spread is running far ahead of the guidance for the year. Should we expect that to, a, what's driving that? Is that pension risk transfer? And b, should we expect that to drop off over the back half of the year?","Deanna Strable","Sure. So to Dan\u2019s comments, certainly that pension risk transfer business is absolutely helping us drive both top line and bottom line. So we're seeing that strong operating earnings growth in margins through the first half of the year, driven by all of the underlying products of spread, but in particular that pension risk transfer business. So we're going to continue to, let me back up, we've called out with regard to variable investment income as you can see from the slide, we've called out 7 million pretax for 2Q. ","In addition to that, we've had a -- in 2Q, we've had a mortality experience gain at a similar amount about $7 million pre-tax as part of that pension risk transfer business. We don't necessarily expect that to repeat. So as you call those two things, as you think about those two things separately and readjusting and back those out, we're still expecting to be at the top of our outlook ranges, both with regard to net revenue growth, 10% being the top end of that range and with regard to margins. So attractive opportunities continuing in that opportunistic business of ours, pension risk transfer helping drive the top end of those ranges.","Sean Dargan","Yeah. I mean you're kind of far above the top end of those ranges now, but we'll see. Then, I have a question for Amy about the quarterly spread of the specialty benefits business. In the past, Principal said that about 20% of the earnings come in the first quarter, 25% each in the second and third and 30% in the fourth quarter. Is that pattern going to hold true this year?","Amy Friedrich","Yeah. I mean, there's lots of things that can happen with the business. And so when I think of 45% first half and 55% second half, I think that's a good representation of that seasonality that\u2019s in the business. That seasonality is going to come from our dental line and some sales related expenses. So I think that's a good marker. If you're looking at kind of the ranges we've given, we are running towards kind of the mid to upper half on those ranges for growth and margin and then the lower half on the loss ratio range, which is obviously a good combination.","Dan Houston","Does that help, Sean?","Sean Dargan","Yes.","Operator","The next question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","I had a question about Brazil. There was a slowdown, some in the quarter, I know Dan, you talked about expecting a pick up back in the second half of the year, but just hoping for some more color on what you're seeing in that market?","Dan Houston","Yeah. Sure. And I\u2019ll have Luis do that. Brazil is an interesting market, because it has been so successful for so long in terms of dominating that local position with our joint venture partner, Banco do Brasil. And even as I mentioned in my prepared comments, when you think about getting 37% of the flows, it tells you just how successful they've been. So I think what we're dealing with is a modest setback on still a very, very strong franchise, but Luis, you want to go and build on that.","Luis Valdes","Yes. Ryan, again, this is Luis. We have to put in perspective that in our pension business in Brazil, we delivered $1 billion in net customer cash flows in second quarter. As Dan said and mentioned, this represent 37% of market share in that industry. We have had some slowdown in our deposit, nothing in our withdrawals that you could see in our supplement and the reason is simply one, Banco, our partner, they have been much more focused on their in-house banking products in the first part of the year rather than in other financial services product related like pensions and insurance. ","So we are expecting that our partner is starting to shifting their attention in the later part of this year into other related financial products, but anyway, the $1 billion that we put together in the second quarter has also been a stellar performance for a pension company in Brazil. We do expect some improvements, but it is -- again, Brazil continues to be the leader in that industry.","Ryan Krueger","And then for Jim, performance fees were fairly I think modest in the current quarter. What are you thinking for the, I guess, the back half of the year, at this point?","Jim McCaughan","On performance fees, we did indicate back when we did the guidance last December that this would be a pretty lean year, not because of bad performance, but because of incidents, because remember a large part of our performance fees are based on real estate funds with three, five maybe even longer year periods and sometimes dependent on the time that the asset gets realized. The outflow then leads to a performance fee. This year is a bit lean on that. ","We're expecting some pick up in 2018, but not much in the second half of the year. I'm actually pretty pleased though that the first half, we've seen revenues almost make up for what last year was a pretty good second quarter in performance fees. So -- and that's very sustainable, that\u2019s management fees, which in the end will also be a sign that performance fees longer term could be positive. ","Just lastly on performance fees for the remainder of the year, I think the main element there may well be the year end performance fees on hedge funds and some of the other performance fee clients. I think that's very difficult to tell at the moment of what that will look like, but there will be almost for sure a number there in the fourth quarter. You can see from the past though that it\u2019s fluctuated quite a lot.","Operator","The next question will come from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","I was hoping that you could provide more color on the PGI pipeline, both of new business opportunities, but also of potential at risk cases. And also, I was hoping you can quantify maybe the average fee rate differential between mandates that have been leaving as well as new business coming on in recent quarters?","Dan Houston","Yeah. The one comment I would make here, Erik and I think you just touched on it, which is a reminder to all of us. Our franchise has passive hybrid active alternatives, it has hedge funds and I think if you go back five and ten years ago, you saw a strong correlation between AUMs and the corresponding revenues. That has now been effectively separated. It is no longer -- it\u2019s highly correlated, especially when we think about all the different structures, ETFs, 40 Act funds, CIT. So we\u2019re going to have to be thinking about year end and communicating to you as we provide you with better outlook and guidance on what we can expect, because not every AUM today carries anywhere near the same revenue. It's so broad and what that, I\u2019ll ask Jim to add answer your similar specific questions.","Jim McCaughan","Firstly, the range that Dan talks about, it goes from 3 basis points to 2.20. So there is a very wide range, maybe ten years ago, our range was a lot narrower than that. It didn't go as high because we didn't have so many alternatives, it didn't go so low because there were less in the more commoditized index products. Secondly, the two clients who took away the large mandates, I should emphasize are still clients and are still buying added value capabilities from us. ","But to give the specific numbers on the large mandates that were mentioned, the 3.3 billion in two large mandates that were lost in the second quarter was on 7 basis points. If I look at the average for the deposits in the second quarter of 4.5 billion, the average was 42 basis points. So in other words, those assets are much heavier in their impact on revenue than the ones we lost. And actually if you will trade $1 billion account for $200 million higher added value on for the same client, the flows look terrible, but you\u2019re ahead in terms of the quality of the business. The pipeline is strong. ","We do regularly review the pipeline and I would actually say just subjectively without a lot of numbers, it's probably the strongest it's been and I think it demonstrates that with our capabilities in specialty strategies, in multi-asset strategies the ability to add value, we are in a pretty good place to grow the revenue. So if you like, I\u2019m a lot more confident that we\u2019ll continue to produce above industry revenue growth than I am about the fee -- the flows in any given quarter. ","Lastly, on cases at risk, yes, those got to be cases at risk because things change and the hedging has been a source of some difficulty, both when we had dollar strength last year and then when we had increasing hedging costs on the Japanese yen this year. So there are cases that are at risk, not anything extraordinary though, not anything that makes the clients unhappy and we're certainly confident that it won\u2019t be a matter of losing clients, it's more a matter of shifting balances on particular clients. So I'm really just trying to portray that we're managing this business more for revenue than for flows, but obviously the flows is an indicator you need to look out.","Erik Bass","And one follow-up just on the investment performance and the one year numbers continue to face some pressure and I was hoping for a little bit more color there on what's driving it now, as we move into the back half of the year, how you see that changing as kind of, I think the second half of last year was a bit challenging.","Dan Houston","Yeah. You just hit on it too and Jim can elaborate, what was a rough third and fourth quarter year ago.","Jim McCaughan","Yeah. And the annual numbers should look a little bit better as those rough quarters that Dan mentioned roll off, hopefully we\u2019ll do better in the second half of this year. But it's also, there is a bit of noise around the performance numbers and I\u2019ll give you a couple of statistics that may help here. If I look at our year-to-date results, how we're doing in 2017, 53% by number of our funds are above median. That doesn't sound great. That sounds almost random. But if I cut out the funds that are either indexed or predominantly indexed and remember this is a period when active management has paid off. ","Excluding those, we are 67% above median year-to-date. I think that shows that we're still on track with our very focused multi boutique strategy, leading to very tightly focused investment teams that can outperform. So I remain confident that we've got plenty of good stuff for our sales people to use versus clients. We mentioned 56^ by number had four and five star in the US mutual funds. It\u2019s actually 69% by assets, which I think really shows that our sales people have a lot to work with. So that's kind of underlying my continuing confidence, which is, as I said, more on revenues than on flows.","Operator","The next question will come from Jimmy Bhullar Peeler with JP Morgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","I had a question for Luis on just the Chilean business. Like what's really driving the outflows there and do you see it more as being systemic or is it more of an aberration? And then relatedly, we've seen one of your competitors cut fees by a decent amount, MetLife subsidiary in Chile. Are you planning on any reductions in your fees in the market?","Dan Houston","Thanks, Jimmy for the question. Oftentimes, you reflect back on certain deals that you did and how you feel about the country in total. And as we go back and still interrogate our decisions around starting in the voluntary business, nearly 10 years ago and certainly the mandatory business within the last five years, we\u2019re reassured we're in the right markets. Some things challenge you from time to time on the political front, but I'll ask Luis to delve right into your questions related to the flows and what our outlook is. Luis?","Luis Valdes","Yes. Jimmy, thanks for your question and probably you remember a couple of quarters ago that I mentioned to you that the main reasons for those outflows are two. The first reason is more customers are anticipating their retirement decisions and Cuprum is an accumulator and at the same time, we\u2019ve paid programmers withdraw. So there is a source of, I\u2019d say, outflows and the second reason for these outflows is about market aggressiveness. And we have been in a kind of an interesting environment, but if you\u2019re looking in our supplement, our deposits, our ability in order to put deposits remains intact. ","So my comment about that is that the discussions about pension reforms and movements in that market is making us our inflows a little choppy, but I like to go back with Cuprum and I want to try to qualify my answer is, we are managing today more money in Cuprum than at any given point on its history. That\u2019s number one. Number two, Cuprum is still in this kind of environment, a very resilient company and we are reporting in a normalized base, more earnings and revenues and they\u2019re slightly apt in a TTM and also in quarter over quarter and in a sequential quarter. ","So even having those negative net customer cash flows again, I\u2019m saying that we are very pleased and with Cuprum and Cuprum, we have improved that very resilient organization and business. The discussion about the pension reform, which is driving all this kind of noise that you have mentioned, it is a very interesting one, but we\u2019ve remained very optimistic about the future of the pension industry in Chile and in particular about Cuprum, but Chileans are not saving enough, and that\u2019s a main reason for the market adequacy that we do have there. So this is actually where we\u2019re working, paying a lot of attention about asset retention, claim retentions. We have seen improvements in May, June and July in our net customer cash flows so we remain optimistic going forward.","Jimmy Bhullar","I had a follow-up for just for Dan. As you\u2019re looking at your sort of global footprint in the international business and also just your capabilities on the asset management side, are you still interested in acquisitions and if so, what specific markets or asset classes and all the environment in those markets for deals.","Dan Houston","So I guess a couple of points I would make. First, from a geographical perspective, when you think about the countries we're in and we face those off against, our projections for kind of 2025 and 2050 and where we think the emerging markets are going to grow in developing middle classes that would likely be candidates for buying these sorts of products and services, it is Chile, it is India, it is Brazil, it is India, it is in those markets where we've planted seeds and been there for a long time. So in terms of geography, I feel really, really good about where we are operating today and again, a lot of credit goes to Barry and Larry over the years for making sure we got into the right markets. ","The second thing I would say as it relates to products and services, it's been amazing to me Jimmy how much they've evolved to look a lot the same around the world and both in terms of structures and asset classes. And I know both Jim and Luis have talked on many occasions that it's really local investing, regional investing and then global investing. I think what's changed to me is the pace of play, it\u2019s just evolving more quickly. So we do have to continue to be nimble, we have PI and PGI working very closely together to make sure that we're as efficient as we can be in building our products and solutions, investment solutions locally. Having said that, we'd still like to do more infrastructure. ","We think that that's an asset class that\u2019s very interesting. European real estate and more, other markets where we can leverage our real estate capabilities from the United States would be good. And I think again, you're witnessing the advantage of the boutique model with the uncorrelated investment result. CCI has struggled in some of their strategies while we have other mid small and large cap capabilities and other boutiques that have performed quite well, but we have shopping list, we have very active pipeline; Tim Dunbar, Lou Flori and team just do a terrific job of sorting through it, but we feel again good about the countries, we feel good about the shopping list relative to where we could add capabilities and in some extreme instances, scale.","Operator","The next question will come from Suneet Kamath with Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Just a follow up to Jimmy\u2019s line of questioning on the capital deployment, just kind of given how the stock has had a nice move so far this year and more multiples are, is the thought that maybe capital deployment would skew a little bit more towards M&A over the next couple or quarters or do you think buybacks at this level are still attractive?","Dan Houston","You phrased the question around line of questioning, it sounds more like a deposition, but I appreciate that Suneet and all kidding aside. So a couple of thoughts. The first where we want to focus is on organic growth. We think that that's good value for our shareholders and building scale, building capabilities. The spread business that you\u2019ve seen, nice growth in here in the last couple of years with again things we're getting properly -- investors are being properly rewarded with good returns there. The targeted payout ratio was a high priority to get to that 40%. So you've seen us increase the dividend. ","There has been a lot of work in the last 12 months on the repositioning of debt ladder to make sure that that was in good order, so that we didn\u2019t experience something as we did back in 2008 and 2009 when we had some debt maturing that was short term in nature. And then of course, as I mentioned earlier, we feel good about our pipeline for M&A. And against selectively purchasing our shares, but I have a lot of confidence that we\u2019ll hit that 800 million to 1.1 billion of capital deployment for the full year 2017.","Suneet Kamath","Obviously, stock price is a good problem to have. Just on China, following up on Humphrey\u2019s question, could that be an opportunity for you guys to deploy capital going forward?","Dan Houston","Yeah. It absolutely does represented a good opportunity. It\u2019s a big market. If you look at CCB pension, they\u2019ve already grown to be over $100 billion in a short period of time that they've been in business. They're adding a lot of scale and capability. It will take investment there to fully build out what\u2019s going to be necessary, but I would definitely say that as we think about gaining more momentum, more capabilities in Brazil, in Southeast Asia with our joint venture partner, CIMB as well as in China, there will be an ample opportunity to deploy capital quite wisely to help build on the prior success.","Operator","The final question is from John Nadel with Credit Suisse.","John Nadel","I guess a question on RIS spread and I sort of talked about this I think last quarter too. I'm looking at -- I know you've talked about a couple of adjustments that we should think about for the pre-tax operating income there, mostly variable investment income, but also some mortality gains. If I make those adjustments and I look at the growth on a year-to-date basis versus the first half of \u201917, account value growth is up I think about 11% year-over-year on average, but your core pre-tax operating income is up about 28% year-over-year. Can you help us understand a little bit better, is there a significant mix shift going on in the account values that's driving the margin higher here or was the first half of \u201916 just lower than normal level of earnings and thus we're recovering, just a little help there would be, I\u2018d like to hear some commentary there?","Dan Houston","John, you\u2019re hitting on some good topics there. And variable investment income certainly has been a nice tailwind to enjoy in prepays and those sorts of things, but I\u2019ll ask Nora to pile on here with some additional thoughts on what that might look like going forward?","Nora Everett","Yeah. So, John, you\u2019ve hit on some of the delta, the higher, obviously higher VII, higher mortality experience gains, lower expenses, but there are -- to your point, there's also some higher course spread and when you talk about product mix, it's as much about the opportunities we've had in those opportunistic businesses. So you think about the pension risk transfer business, you think about investment only. We certainly have gained around some of that core spread, but with that said, we still take you back to those outlook ranges and the high end of those outlook ranges, because as you take out some of those items that I identified, yes, it brings you to the high end or slightly over the range. But there's a mix -- there's a product mix there, but it's a combination of those drivers. So we're just wanting you to take a balanced approach as you look through to what's driving this first half of the year relative to the second half.","Dan Houston","Well, it\u2019s been kind of interesting to me to see the demand for income and retirement, whether it's by individual or corporations trying to get out from underneath these liabilities associated with their defined benefit plan and that places where we\u2019ve played is, you\u2019ve been in a relatively small end of that marketplace, and we\u2019re getting good pricing relative to what historically you would have thought. We would have had, so again, we look at that, it\u2019s not only opportunistic, but it\u2019s certainly been opportunistic in our favor within the last few years.","John Nadel","Well, that\u2019s I guess sort of the point that I'm trying to get at right is that, this is, I mean, you guys call the segment RIS spread. So spread based earnings in a difficult spread environment and you're, even if I make those adjustments for higher variable investment income and other things, you're outpacing your account value growth, earnings growth is outpacing account value growth by almost 3 times in a tough spread environment. So it has to be a mix shift, no?","Deanna Strable","Yeah. I think the other comment I would make, John, is we have shown very strong sales over the last two years in this segment and it takes a while for those sales to actually translate into earnings. And so again, you did kind of a point-to-point account value growth, but obviously some of the emergence of those earnings do take some time. And so I think it's important to look at the increase in earnings, but probably more importantly to look at kind of what we're earning today and what we think that run rate is going forward, which I think if you normalize for the variable investment income and the mortality gain is really a good earnings to kind of build on going forward. And so I think that emergence of earnings relative to the growth is probably the other piece that's important to think about as well.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Houston, your closing comments please?","Dan Houston","Yeah. Just maybe three very quick comments. The first of which is from our vantage point, we believe the fundamentals of these businesses are very much intact. Secondly, we're going to continue to focus and find that delicate balance between growth and profitability. And the third is, we\u2019re going to put a lot of emphasis on understanding the needs of our customers. That is our highest priority to make sure that we remain relevant to our customers and we all know that it's a very dynamic and shifting market, but we look forward to seeing you on the road.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Principal Financial Group's fourth quarter earnings conference call. As always, our earnings release, financial supplement and slides related to today's call are available on our website at www.principal.com\/investor.","Following a reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO, Larry Zimpleman; COO, Dan Houston; and CFO, Terry Lillis, will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A are Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors; Luis Valdes, Principal International; and Tim Dunbar, our Chief Investment Officer.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The company does not revise or update them to reflect new information, subsequent events or changes in strategy.","Risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Before we get to the prepared remarks, I'd like to remind you of an upcoming investor event in Santiago, Chile on March 10 and 11. Executives from our Latin American business will provide an update. This is a great opportunity to learn more about these businesses, and we hope you can make it. Information can be found on our Investor Relations website.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Larry.","Larry Zimpleman","Thanks, John, and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning, I'll comment on three areas; first, I'll discuss 2014 results; second, I'll provide an update on the execution of our strategy; and I'll close with some comments on capital management. I'll then turn the call over to our newly appointed President and Chief Operating Officer, Dan Houston, for some comments on key growth metrics for 2014, followed by Terry with his normal CFO report.","2014 was an outstanding year for The Principal, with record total company operating earnings of $1.3 billion, a 24% increase over full year 2013 results. Full year net income was $1.1 billion, a 26% increase over 2013. Perhaps even more impressive than the record total company operating earnings is that each of our four operating segments had record earnings for the year.","Our ability to achieve these strong results, while still facing continued macroeconomic volatility, reflects our scale in each business segment, the strength of our diversified business model and the ongoing momentum in our businesses. Since 2009, we've grown earnings per share at a compounded annual growth rate of 15%.","We've done that predominantly through operating earnings growth, which drives a long-term increase in shareholder value and not relying on share buybacks to increase earnings per share, which can only have an impact for few years. In addition, two-thirds of our earnings are now generated from our fee-based businesses compared to roughly half five years ago. Our strong financial position has created a great foundation from which to grow for years to come.","Total company net cash flows of $18 billion for the year contributed to record assets under management of $519 billion, which increased 7% over 2013, despite a $14 billion negative impact from foreign exchange rates. These outstanding results position us going into 2015 with a much higher asset base from which to continue to grow revenue and operating earnings even during periods of macroeconomic volatility.","Next, I'll comment briefly on the long-term power of our strategy and some positive developments we see contributing to our growing momentum. Though we refined and evolved our strategy overtime to remain competitive and take advantage of long-term growth opportunities, we've never wavered from our core goal of helping individuals around the world achieve financial security.","Our strategy was built around three core trends that today are more relevant than ever. First, aging populations around the world; second, financially constrained employers, who want to provide affordable and attractive benefits to attract and retain global talent, and finally financially constrained governments that can no longer support government provider retirement programs, causing individuals to look to their own resources for financial security. Across the globe, we have achieved a market leadership position that enables us to meet the needs of individuals looking to save, invest and protect their assets over the long-term.","Improving macroeconomic and employment conditions in the U.S. are making it easier for individuals to take control of their financial futures with help from the Principal. As the employment picture improves, move individuals can save for retirement and participate in benefit programs that protect their income.","We're seeing this trend in Full Service Accumulation, with a number people making a deferral increased 7% compared to a year ago, and Specialty Benefits had the highest ever full year in-group growth of 1.5% in 2014.","Principal Funds continues to have great success executing on a strategy focused on asset allocation, multi-manager funds that address risk, inflation, and income needs. Principal Funds is now the 16th largest advisor sold firm up from 17 in 2013.","In 2014, we launched seven new funds, as we continue to expand on our outcome-based solutions. Many of you had the opportunity to hear from several executives from Principal Global Investors at our investor event in November. Jim and his team discussed the increasing demand for tailored solutions among retirement, retail and institutional investors. Our diverse group of specialized investment boutiques coupled with multi-asset expertise, positions us to customize solutions and capitalize on this trend.","Principal International's recent announcement of our planned acquisition of AXA's pension business in Hong Kong is one of eight strategic acquisitions we've done since 2008, totaling over $2.5 billion in capital deployed. The acquisition, which we expect to close in the second half of 2015, will add scale to our current business, making us the fifth largest mandatory pension provider in Hong Kong.","Importantly, the deal also includes a 15-year exclusive distribution agreement with AXA, which has 4,500 agents in Hong Kong. This gives us additional opportunities to grow market share, as the mandatory and voluntary pension markets continue to grow.","Finally, I'll provide an update on capital management for 2015. Our fee-based business model allows us to generate free cash flow and strategically deploy it to create long-term value for shareholders. We remain well-positioned to deploy capital through a variety of options in addition to supporting organic growth.","In 2015, we expect to deploy $800 million to $1 billion of capital, beyond the capital needed for organic growth, including the $335 million already announced for the AXA acquisition. Last night, we announced a $0.36 per share common stock dividend payable in the first quarter, which is a 6% increase over the dividend paid in fourth quarter 2014. As a reminder, our 2014 common stock dividend was up 31% over 2013.","Additionally, the merger and acquisition pipeline remains active with opportunities to further enhance our global retirement and investment management platform. We will continue to look for strategic acquisitions as a good way to build long-term value for shareholders.","In closing, I remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth in 2015 and beyond. The Principal is in a strong competitive position with proven success and a unique business model that positions us to provide long-term value for our customers and our shareholders.","Now, I will turn the call over to Dan Houston. Dan's 30-year carrier and proven leadership give him a clear view of where the company will go in the future. I look forward to working with him in his new capacity. Dan?","Daniel Houston","Thanks, Larry. I'm excited about my expanded role and look forward to working with the teams on continued implementation of our strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and we continue to build on our leading positions, providing continued momentum going forward.","Following are some of the key growth metrics that contributed to the outstanding results in 2014. Full Service Accumulation full year sales were $8.7 billion. We continue to focus on striking the right balance of growth and profitability in this business. We had fewer large planned sales in 2014 than we've had in previous years, which led to a decrease in transfer deposits and net cash flows for the full year.","To demonstrate that point, net cash flows from our small-to-mid size markets were 2% of beginning year account values in that space, in line with our expectations. With strong investment performance and key differentiators like Principal Total Retirement Suite, we remain confident in our ongoing competitiveness of the Full Service Accumulation business.","Principal Funds had record sales of $20 billion in 2014, and the fourth quarter was the 20th consecutive quarter of positive net cash flows. At 8% of beginning year account values, Principal Funds' full year net cash flows were more than 3x the industry average.","Principal Global Investors had record total assets under management of $314 billion as of yearend, driven by continuous strong investment performance and full year total net cash flows of $2.4 billion.","Principal International reported assets under management of $115 billion at yearend. Record full year net cash flows of $13 billion were up 54% over 2013 and 68% on a local currency basis. We continue to see momentum build in our Asian businesses with 15% of full year net cash flows from this region, up from 6% in 2014. We're also executing on our full product suite strategy in Chile, with full year voluntary net cash flows doubling from 2013.","In Individual Life, the business market strategy continues to be a differentiator for us, with 2014 being the second highest year of non-qualified deferred compensation sales. Specialty Benefits had record full year sales of nearly $300 million, up 10% over 2013. These strong sales combined with strong persistency drove premium and fees up 7% over 2013. Our solutions remain very attractive in the small and midsized employer market.","With a competitive environment that is constantly changing, we remain laser focused on meeting evolving customer needs and demand in ways that differentiate us in the marketplace.","Top tier investment performance is clearly critical. 71% of our rated mutual funds have a four or five-star Morningstar rating. And as Slide 5 shows at least 85% of Principal's investment options were in the top half of Morningstar rankings on a one, three and five-year basis at quarter-end. Additionally, two of our mandatory provident funds in Hong Kong were recently awarded the Gold rating by the MPF rating agency.","Exceptional service matters as well. In 2014, we retained 95% of Full Service Accumulation customers, our second best year on record. And Specialty Benefits division retention rate in 2014 were the highest they've been since 2006.","In addition, we continue to garner recognition for our Latin American businesses. Cuprum recovered customer satisfaction and investment performance recognition from the Chilean pension regulator throughout 2014. And Brasilprev, our joint venture with Banco do Brasil was once again recognized as the most admired private pension company in Brazil.","The last point I'll highlight is the importance of attracting and retaining best-in-class employees, who have specialized expertise. During the fourth quarter, the Principal earned the top spot in it's category in Pensions & Investments' annual survey of the best places to work in money management for the third year in a row. We view this as a significant accomplishment and one that evidences our ability to attract and retain top investment talent. Terry?","Terrance Lillis","Thanks Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year, net income including performance on the investment portfolio and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. The fourth quarter was a strong end to an outstanding year. Total company operating earnings were $324 million, up 13% over the prior-year quarter. Operating earnings per share of $1.09 were a 14% increase over fourth quarter 2013 results.","Moving to Slide 6, you'll see that we normalized fourth quarter 2014 earnings by $0.02 or one-time tax items in our Corporate segment. On a normalized basis, earnings per share were $1.07, up 11% over a year-ago quarter. We also removed the one month lag from reporting of Cuprum results during the quarter. The earnings from the additional month were reduced by lower than expected encaje returns and additional investments in the business to support future growth.","For the year, return on equity excluding AOCI was 14.2%. This is a 210 basis points improvement from a year ago. Organic growth contributed 150 basis points of the increase, as operating earnings growth outpaced mean equity growth of 6%.","Our current return on equity excluding AOCI includes exchange rate movements in earnings, but not in the equity calculations. If similar to other companies with large international operations, we adjusted the average equity for the exchange rate movements, the return on equity would be 15.1%.","Now, I'll discuss business unit results, starting on Slide 7, with the accumulation businesses within Retirement and Investor Services. Operating earnings of $168 million were up 12% over the adjusted fourth quarter 2013 results. Net revenue was up 5% over the prior-year quarter and up 10% for the year. Full year pre-tax return on net revenue improved to 34%.","Full Service Accumulation operating earnings were $106 million, a 14% increase over the year-ago quarter. For the year net revenue grew 9% and the pre-tax return on net revenue was 35%. As previously discussed, we expect margins to come down in 2015 due to expense growth outpacing net revenue growth, primarily due to investments in the business. In addition, 2014 benefited from higher than expected variable investment income. Full Service Accumulation had net outflows for the quarter of $850 million.","Quarterly results can be lumpy, so it's important to focus on the longer term. For the full year, while dollars of lapses were up 6% in 2014 due to account value growth, the withdrawal rate was 100 basis points lower than the prior year. Importantly, as we look at all key metrics for Full Service Accumulation, it's clear that business remain strong and competitive. Recurring deposits grew 7% in 2014 and we added nearly 1,000 net new plans and 135,000 net new participants.","In addition, as a result of strong investment performance, customers and advisors directed approximately 75% of the 2014 new sale asset into Principal branded investments. Principal Funds fourth quarter operating earnings were up 20% from the year-ago quarter to $26 million. For the full year, operating earnings surpassed $100 million for the first time, up 30% over 2013. Principal Fund sales were the second highest quarterly result ever at $5.6 billion.","Individual Annuity operating earnings were $29 million for the quarter. Increased fee revenue on our variable annuity business due to market appreciation continues to offset spread compression in our fixed deferred block of business.","Slide 8 highlights the guaranteed businesses within Retirement and Investor Services. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $27 million were up 4% over fourth quarter 2013 results.","Net revenue was up 3% over the prior-year quarter and up 8% for the year. The 2014 pre-tax return on net revenue improved to 82%. Full Service Payout forth quarter sales of $464 million were higher than full year 2013 sales, as we continue to see opportunities in the small to midsized pension close-out market.","Turning to Slide 9, Principal Global Investors' quarterly operating earnings were a record $36 million. Earnings benefited this quarter from seasonal performance fees, and an increased stake in Columbus Circle Investors. The full year pre-tax margin increased to 26.5% as we continue to improve margins by gaining scale and providing investment on options that are in demand.","As a reminder, earnings in Principal Global Investors are impacted by seasonality with first quarter typically the lowest due to timing of certain expenses and fourth quarter typically the highest due to performance fees.","Slide 10 shows quarterly operating earnings for Principal International of $63 million. As I mentioned earlier, we removed the month reporting lag for Cuprum, which was reduced by lower than expected encaje returns as well as additional marketing related expenses.","Principal International continues to perform well on a local basis. Operating earnings were up 16% over the prior-year quarter, after adjusting for foreign exchange rates. For the year, combined net revenue was up 14% on a reported basis and up 24% on a local currency basis. Combined pre-tax return on net revenue was 51% for the year.","As shown on Slide 11, Individual Life operating earnings were $28 million for the quarter. Claims experienced for the quarter was in line with expectations. We mentioned on our previous call that we were doing an in-depth review of the recent elevated claims experience. The analysis has reinforced our ongoing belief that the elevated claims experience in recent quarters was random fluctuation associated with risk-based business and not a systemic issue.","Moving to Slide 12, Specialty Benefits operating earnings of $28 million were up 3% from the year-ago quarter. The overall loss ratio for the quarter remained favorable at 65%, better than our expected range. For the full year, premium and fees were up 7% and full year pre-tax operating margin was 11%. Seasonality also impacts operating earnings in U.S. Insurance Solutions with the highest results typically in the fourth quarter and the lowest in the first quarter.","The Corporate segment reported operating losses for the quarter of $26 million, better than our forecasted range of $32 million to $37 million of operating losses. Results this quarter benefited from some one-time tax adjustments in the Corporate segment.","For the quarter, total company net income was $270 million, including realized capital losses of $53 million. Net credit-related losses of $8 million were a strong result, improving 67% from the year-ago quarter. Net income was negatively impacted by $44 million, due to the impairment of Liongate, our hedge fund of funds boutique, during the quarter.","Full year credit-related losses were $56 million, a 33% improvement over 2013 results. Unrealized gains were $2.9 billion at quarter-end. Due to our asset liability management expertise and strong liquidity, changes in unrealized gains or losses due to interest rate movements do not result in forced assets sales in periods of stress. In addition, our predominantly fee-based business model limits our sensitivity to interest rate movement.","As outlined in Slide 13, our approach to capital deployment is balanced and focused on increasing long-term value for shareholders. We deployed $855 million of capital in 2014. This is more than three-fourth of our net income for the year, demonstrating our ability to generate capital and strategically deploy it.","The full year common stock dividend was $1.28. This is a 31% increase over full year 2013, and we continue to increase our payout ratio. Our capital deployment in 2014 also included $200 million of share repurchase, $100 million surplus note redemption and $180 million increase in our ownership percentage of Columbus Circle Investors. In 2015, we expect to deploy $800 million to $1 billion of capital in a strategic and balanced manner.","In closing, while macroeconomic factors such as the strengthening U.S. dollar and low interest rates are providing near-term pressure, we remain confident that our diversified business model positions us well for future growth across various macroeconomic environments. This concludes our prepared remarks.","Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan","Terry, I have a question about Slide 6 and the normalized items. If I add back $0.02 per share for tax adjustments, that still implies a tax rate in the high-teens, which is below your 2015 guidance of 21% to 23%. Can you just discuss what was going on with the tax rate and if the 2015 guidance still stands?","Larry Zimpleman","I'll just have Terry take that.","Terrance Lillis","You're absolutely right. It's a little bit lower than what we had anticipated in our outlook call. We still think that that 20% to 22% is a good effective tax rate for the overall organization. However, if you look at what happened at the early part of this year, we had some true-ups in the prior year. So if you were to adjust for that, you'd be around closer to 20% for the year. So we still think that that's a very good rate, taken into consideration the adjustments that we had in the fourth quarter in the Corporate segment.","Sean Dargan","And then if I could just ask one follow-up about Liongate. I'm just wondering what the thought process and impairingness was? And considering that you seem committed to doing further M&A to deploying capital in that manner, how can we have confidence that we're not going to see more impairments in these acquisitions you're making?","Larry Zimpleman","Sean, I'll make a couple of general comments and then have Jim comment specifically as it relates to Liongate. First of all, again if you go back and look over the longer course of history, I think that our success with our asset management boutique acquisitions has been really second to none.","For example, we mentioned last quarter, the additional purchase of an interest from 70% to 95% in Columbus Circle Investors and that's the boutique that we've grown from under $4 billion to $16 billion over the point in time that we've had it. I could give you similar statistics around Spectrum and other asset management boutiques.","So the challenge as it relates to goodwill often is actually in the early years after you acquire a boutique, because if the macro environment changes, the way accounting rules work, you run closer to the edge so to speak, and in fact the hedge fund of funds business has been a bit of a troubled space in recent months as there's been a lot of volatility and kind of a lot of churning around in the hedge fund space.","So again, my emphasis here, Sean, would be to say that I think Jim and his team have done outstanding job over the longer term and Liongate is actually more of the one-off circumstance. So I'll ask Jim to cover that for you now.","James McCaughan","Yes. Sean, as Larry said, this is a portfolio and the IRR on the portfolio of boutiques ranges almost all of them from low-teens to high-teens. So it's been one of the best ways of deploying capital that we have had available to us.","The hedge fund of fund space has had headwinds as Larry described, and that together with some performance glitches in 2013, which since have been fixed, the performance since then is pretty strong, led to some losses of assets and revenues, and that's what led us to impair this particular asset.","In terms of the process of impairment, thinking of how this might affect other boutiques, this one is, it's just over 50% stake, and so was accounted for on the equity method rather than consolidated, that means from an impairment it's looked at legal entity level, and that was really the background to the impairment we had on Liongate.","With the growth in all the other boutiques and with the only other equity method boutique being Finisterre, which actually has grown very strongly, has almost doubled in assets in the three years we've been associated with them. So I think I'm pretty confident that the strategy remains sound and we don't see any other impairments on the horizon on the evidence at the moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar","Want to go back to the comments on withdrawals and sales in FSA, and maybe get a little more color as to what's driving, what seems to be a little bit of weakness there, at least seasonally speaking. I understand there is more pressure from the large case market, but at the end of the day I thought that pressure was already there in the last few quarters, so was little surprised to see numbers maybe a little bit below expectations.","Larry Zimpleman","I'll make a few comments, and again, I'm sure Dan will want to add. So first of all, as it relates to fourth quarter, recognize that sales results in fourth quarter for FSA were actually quite good. They were at $2.8 billion bringing the year-to-date $8.7 billion. Now, while that $8.7 billion is a little bit below what we might have expected going into the year, I would also say that there has been, as a general perspective, there has been a little less money moving in the marketplace.","And I can tell you as somebody who has been involved in the Full Service Accumulation business for more than 30 years, we'll just leave at that, this is something that you always see. When you have a very strong equity market like we had in 2013, there will be fewer assets in motion. It just inevitably turns out that way. I think that's more of a psychological factor among plan sponsors and advisors than anything else.","So on the flip side, our 2014 was a second best year for retention of existing Full Service Accumulation cases that we've ever had. So you do have sort of parallel dynamics that have been kind of going on within the FSA market.","I think it's my judgment and Dan can offer his opinion here in sec. It's my judgment that actually that kind of competitive environment and that kind of pricing environment has actually been more rational in 2014 than it has been in prior periods. I think in prior periods, coming out of the financial crisis, everybody was sort of scrambling given the depth and pain of the financial crisis. Everybody was kind of scrambling to rebuild their retirement business, and frankly, we were part of that as well.","But I think post 2013 and 2014 things have now sort of settled down and the dynamics of the Full Service Accumulation business have sort of gone back to normal. We are seeing salary growth. We are seeing new participants added. We are seeing increased deferral rates. So the normal factors that drive FSA revenue increases are more solidly in place. So I wouldn't want you to get too distracted by a quarter or a year. I think as we said in our comments, all the elements of health are very, very strong in FSA.","So with that, I'll ask Dan to comment.","Yaron Kinar","And maybe just before that, just to clarify, when I talked about weak sales, I'm talking for the fourth quarter, not relative to other quarters of the year, so seasonally adjusted.","Daniel Houston","I would say the fourth quarter sales are actually relatively strong compared to a year ago. I think you can identify a couple of areas. One is that, for the full year we ended up having 11 large plans over $100 million a year ago versus six this year, so again disciplined underwriting on those plans. The other area where we saw some withdrawals was relative to large M&A where we may have had a smaller piece of the pie, the acquiring company was maybe two or three times our size.","Larry spoke specifically to the issue of second best retention year ever; reoccurring deposit of 10%, we had good matching contributions, strong profit sharing contributions, new hires are in that mix. Whenever you can hold withdrawals to 6% on a 12% increase in account values and still retain your in force business and be more selective on choosing new plans, I think it speaks to the strength of the product line.","And lastly, as we said in the script, we did have net cash flow for that SMB market right at 2%, well within the range. And that where the shortfall really falls is in that large $100 million market, which we know is volatile.","Last comment I would make is, you could sell two or three large plans in the fourth quarter of this year and we probably wouldn't be sitting here today having the conversation about sales or net cash flow. And so it really does boil down to being selective and more particular about the plans we want underwrite. Hopefully that helps.","Yaron Kinar","And then my second question probably is best for Terry. So looking at the 10-year yields-to-date, about 100 basis points below of the yearend assumption that you came out at the time the outlook, and I realized during the prepared commentaries that overall the fee business is less sensitive to rates, but at the end of day there is some sensitivity. Maybe you can help us think about this sensitivity both the balance sheet and income statement?","Larry Zimpleman","Terry, you want to make some comments?","Terrance Lillis","As we talked about in the past, the sensitivity that the Principal has to the lower interest rate environment is probably a little bit less than what we've seen in some of our insurance peers, because of the strong asset liability management. As you said our fee-based businesses are 60% to 65% of our earnings, albeit there are some businesses that are affected by this, life business, our spread businesses.","It does have a little bit of drag as the interest rate environment goes down, what we are seeing on the 10-year treasury. Although the 10-year treasury is not necessarily the only point that we look at. It's across the yield curve, and so as that yield curve flattens out it will have some other impact on us as well. So I guess, we can say that the drag that we'd have from our current interest rate environment maybe had a little less than 1% or so in terms of earnings for next year in 2015.","Now that being said, the other part of that is the impact that it would have on sales. As you can see, we could have some drag on future sales and the fixed deferred annuity area, which we've considered somewhat opportunistic. But one of the things that's been counter to that is our Full Service Payout business that taking over that closeout business.","We actually have our highest quarter ever in the fourth quarter with $464 million of earnings. And so that's an interest-sensitive business as well. So we do see that the lower interest rate environment will have an impact on us, albeit it will a little bit lower than what you've seen in some of our insurance peers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","First on FSA, I was hoping to clarify one thing. It looked like the rate of transferred deposits relative to sales was lower than normal. Was there some aspect of timing where some sales didn't hit transfer deposits that you'd normally expect this quarter?","Larry Zimpleman","This is Larry. There was. So I'll have Dan cover that.","Daniel Houston","Yes, Ryan, good catch. We did have a sale that was reported late in the fourth quarter of 2014 here, it will fund in 2015. So as you point out, it's just a little bit lumpy. It's just a matter of which quarter it fell into.","Ryan Krueger","Can you quantify how big that sale was?","Daniel Houston","I'd probably just not try to quantify that at this point in time. But it was a decent size plan, well in excess of $100 million.","Larry Zimpleman","I think, again, when you're interpreting, therefore when people kind of try to interpret into some degree over-interpret the net cash flow in a business like Full Service Accumulation. I mean literally it can be the decision on planned sponsors, do I send Principal their money on -- the transfer deposit on December 28 versus January 2. And that can be the difference in whether net cash flow is negative or positive.","So that's why again, the real way to think about this business is to look at in on sort of either a trailing 12-month basis or some sort of calendar-year basis, and not try to assess whether some trend in a particular quarter represents a new trend. I would caution anyone again trying to do that for this kind of a business.","Ryan Krueger","And then I wanted to revisit the preferred stock that you can call in mid-2015, which seems to pretty likely to be a good economic decision to do that. But curious how you're thinking about the potential funding for doing that?","Larry Zimpleman","I'll maybe ask Tim. Tim not only oversees the investment portfolio, but also heads up capital markets and works with Terry around all of our capital structure. So I'm going to have Tim cover that for you.","Timothy Dunbar","Yes, right now we are reviewing plans for the preferred securities that, as you said, are open to prepayment or open to payment in mid-year. We look at that just in terms of what the after-tax cost to the organization is in different ways that we can fund that. But we haven't made our plans specifically for those yet. We are looking at that and view that we have a fair amount of flexibility. We don't need to call them, but we certainly can, if we want to.","Ryan Krueger","And am I correct that in your outlook guidance that that did not contemplate doing anything with those?","Timothy Dunbar","That is correct. It did not contemplate paying those off.","Larry Zimpleman","Just to add a really quick comment to that. Again, the existence of preferred stock on our capital structure is, it really goes back again to the days when we were far more of an insurance company than this sort of investment management company that we are today. And I think when you look at capital structures from those that are asset management or investment management, you typically wouldn't see preferred stock in their capital structure. So that's just to note that. And that's another part of our thinking, as we have that opportunity to take those out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss","My question is for Dan, and you commented about the strong fund flows in Principal Funds three times industry average, I believe, for 2014. How long do you think that pace could continue for in terms of outperformance that is?","Larry Zimpleman","Again, I'm sure Dan want to add some comments. Again, the job that has been done by our team around the mutual fund business over the time since we bought Washington Mutual in 2007 has been really, really extraordinary. And I think we're now in our 20 quarter, maybe it's our 22 quarter of positive net cash flows. And what's really been interesting is to see that we've actually been, maybe not only continuing to outperform, but maybe increasing the level of outperformance.","And it's a combination of really two things. One is, I think its great product development. And in general, again, we've commented on our outcome based strategy for our retail funds. And secondly, of course, it's based on having outstanding investment performance, which is predominately to the credit of Principal Global Investors.","So we do have a number of new product launches. We launched seven new products in 2014. We're going to launch a number of new products in 2015. So I would have a full expectation for sales in 2015 that we're going to see at least a decent increase in sales, albeit when you get to the level of $20 billion in sales, sometimes it can be a little difficult to put up big increases against that. But I certainly have every expectation that we're going to continue to see very strong flows there. And having put enough pressure on Dan, I'll let him comment.","Daniel Houston","Yes, I share you enthusiasm, Larry. We'll have a strong lineup. And as Larry pointed out, we did have a very strong year for net cash flow, that is 20 consecutive quarters. What's probably most exciting to me about the success we enjoyed this past year, it wasn't one fund, it wasn't any one asset class, so it was collectively across the board with real estate, fixed income, equities, asset allocations and the hybrids, and adds with the existing portfolio.","And again, Nora Everett and her team have worked very closely with Jim and his team to develop this outcomes-oriented strategy, solving for problems related to income and growth and waiting in the wings inflation solutions. This is very popular among advisors. They look at this as being very favorable in terms on bringing to their customers, which is why you noticed that we moved up one notch among the advisors sold funds.","As Larry pointed out, we've got seven new products rolled out throughout 2014 across real estate, emerging market, credit opportunities, additional lifetime hybrid as well as small company stocks, again across the whole range of asset classes. And so I remain very enthusiastic about our ability to grow our funds business.","Larry Zimpleman","Yes, and I know Jim wants to add a comment too.","James McCaughan","This is really just a comment about what happens next, since you are asking why have we been so strong and where does it go next. I would point out that in the last year or two the market has had very little appetite for active equity strategies in general. We have in that time developed what I would argue as one of the best ranges of active equity strategies in the industry.","So as appetite changes, perhaps towards emerging equities at some point or towards small and mid-cap equities, I think we have a very good range to actually pickup the momentum rather than lose it, as client attitudes and preferences shift.","Larry Zimpleman","I hope that helps.","Seth Weiss","And if I could just ask one question, on the expense side of FSA, margins likely to come down in FSA, as expense growth outpaces net revenue growth. Can you give any granularity on that? And if this should be a little bit of a multi-year phenomenon or if we should just expect '15 to be a higher expense year and then level-off from there?","Larry Zimpleman","Again, I think we spoke to that a little bit certainly in the outlook call, and I will have Dan comment in a minute. I want to again just take a step back and kind of remind everybody on the call about the high level of performance that is already embedded, if we're talking about a sort of 30% to 32% kind of a pre-tax return on revenue. That is in and of itself a really outstanding result when you think about it. I mean that's again the equivalent.","If you were to put that in ROE, return on equity terms, I mean that's an ROE that's in that mid-to-high 30% range. And there is an upper limit, as to how far you can drive margin. So I think that any of our shareholders would be very, very happy, if we have a five, 10, 15, 20-year period, where we can demonstrate a 30% to 32% return on net revenue over that period of time. That is simply outstanding performance that probably can't be really matched by any other type of business within financial services. So that's just sort of a background comment.","And again, looking at trends from 2014 to 2015 or whatever, whatever, we're going to be influenced by DAC and other things that are a bit variable and non-recurring. So again, don't read too much into that. Think broadly and more longer term about the return that is coming out of that business. So, Dan, you want to comment?","Daniel Houston","When I think about FSA, I think it's probably one of our strongest areas for process improvement and driving cost out of the business, and at the same time maintaining strong customer service scores by both our advisors' participants and planned sponsors.","Fourth quarter was a little bit lumpy. It had some expenses in there. When you parse it out, you find out, if you take for the quarter comp and other less management fees, we're actually down by about 2%. So again, good expense management. When you look at the one-offs here, and again I do not view these as a systemic, it's around some of the true ups around DAC, some commission, printing, postage, security benefit, sales comp.","We rolled out a new mobile application and promoted that. We had a new landing page for participant education, both launched in the latter half of 2014, which showed up as a little bit higher expense. But overall, as Larry points out, very, very expense minded and disciplined about making sure that we manage these very aggressively.","We'll always have some higher variable costs, as sales increase. You saw that in the mutual fund line. You also saw that in Specialty Benefits, where you don't have the DAC incapabilities that we do in most of our Full Service Accumulation. Hopefully that helps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","So first question on the PGI business. The unaffiliated flows I think were negative this quarter and part of that might have been Columbus Circle, but maybe if just Jim could give us a little bit more detail on that. And then secondly on share buybacks, you outlined the $800 million to $1 billion in deployment goal, and I think your dividend is based on the present rate are going to be close to $430 million or so this year than the AXA deal's $335 million.","So it implies that what's left for deals and share buybacks is less than $250 million, and then you've got the preferred stock potentially being called. And also, my question was you didn't buyback any stock in the fourth quarter, is it possible that you don't do any buybacks in 2015, if you do find additional deals and\/or if you retire the preferred stock?","Larry Zimpleman","So I'll try to give you a little bit of insight on the first one. And I'll have Jim cover the unaffiliated, and then if Terry wants to or Tim wants to add something, they can certainly to do that.","First of all, I think on your second one, Jimmy, I mean, I think certainly first of all I agree with all of your math. And so I think what you would expect for share buybacks, if that's the specific question for 2015; generally speaking, I think what you would expect would be, and we've said this many, many, many times, our first priority in terms of share buybacks is to try to make sure we cover the anti-dilutive portion. So we would do share buybacks generally speaking with the idea that it would at least keep our share count flat. And we gave outlook in early December on what we expected the share count to be.","As I said in my comment, Jimmy, we are seeing, have been and continue to see more opportunities for the kind of M&A that we like, either within the asset management space, maybe within the international space, maybe within the retirement space. We're actually seeing more of that than we have seen in a very long-time. And again, a lot of that is coming from the restructuring that is having to go on by some very, very large financial services companies, as they sort of remake their strategy, post the financial crisis.","So I think it's in the interest of building long-term shareholder value for us to make sure that we're looking at every one of those opportunities. And when we can make very nice accretive acquisitions, like we think we will do with the AXA Hong Kong acquisition, we remain very, very interested in that. So I would expect again kind of limited share buyback. Certainly want to do the anti-dilutive, whether we do anything beyond that, probably really will depend on our success kind of in the M&A space. And so with that, I'll let Jim comment on unaffiliated.","James McCaughan","In the quarter the main negative on the unaffiliated flow was in our equity boutique. If you add up Columbus Circle or it in Principal Global equities, you had a net outflow of a bit over $1.5 billion. Most of that is client allocation away from active equity strategies, and particularly active core equity strategies.","There was one particular piece, which you allude to in Columbus Circle, where about half of Columbus Circles' lost assets were related to a portfolio manager departure, in fact our hedge fund portfolio manager. The clients were taking some really quite big profits that they've made over the last two or three years. Some times you get a few hundred million flowing out with a big profit, and it's hard to say that that's bad for the clients. They are locking in profits. Our challenge is to find the next idea to make clients money worth. So that's the outflows.","In terms of the inflows, I am delighted with, for example, Finisterre Capital, who just this week got an award in London from the industry for the best emerging market hedge fund of the year. They're in emerging debt and are seeing quite strong growth. Other high-yielding strategies, including Spectrum with preferreds post with high yield. Real estate has been a very much in-demand area. So it's a balance of some pretty big outflows on the active equity side and some inflows elsewhere.","I think if I were to sum up the year as a whole though, I would say that I am very pleased with our new sales that were once again over $16 billion in these active specialty strategies for the non-affiliate business, very similar to the previous year. So sales are not the issue. I am a little disappointed or somewhat disappointed in our retention. It's fair that the clients take the money out of these particularly active core strategies.","Our challenge and our management is very much on it and to make sure that those same clients look at our high added value specialties. So we are making vigorous efforts to improve the net flows. And really the focus is on retention and making sure that those clients are coming out active core strategies and see the interesting stuff and the high performing things we're doing.","Jimmy Bhullar","And Larry, just following up on your optimism about the M&A pipeline. Can you just briefly discuss the businesses and regions that you're targeting and where you see the most opportunity?","Larry Zimpleman","Well, again, as I said, I think that there is opportunity in the U.S., but I think we are seeing more opportunity in asset management and in international. And the other thing that I would say, and by the way within international, I think it is a little bit at the moment, I think, the trends has been it's a little bit more in Asia.","And again, this is often times coming much like the AXA acquisition, Jimmy, this is coming more from European financial services companies who are, as I said earlier, still sort of recrafting their strategy, post the financial crisis. And again, often from the standpoint of pressure from regulators, trying to kind of simplify their business model, which can be a benefit for us.","So again, that's going to continue to be an opportunity and we're going to continue to prioritize that. The last thing I'll say is, there is also of course the opportunity, Jimmy, that we can much as we did with Columbus Circle in terms of buying a bigger percentage of an asset management boutique, we also have potentially the same opportunity with some of our other international joint ventures as well.","So that's another one that some times we don't mention as much. But that's a great opportunity, because these are already high-performing, highly-profitable companies, where the incremental return on capital is very, very high. So we also continue to look at that opportunity.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Nadel with Sterne, Agee.","John Nadel","I had one quick follow-up for Terry. There was a question about the tax rate. And just thinking about the 21% to 23% range that I think you provided in your outlook for 2015, I believe you mentioned in response, 20% to 22%. I just want to make sure that that was a 2014 comment or has the outlook changed a little bit for the better?","Terrance Lillis","No, John, I think the 20% to 22% now is probably the run rate that we would see for '14 as well as going into '15. As you take in effective tax rate, a federal rate of 35% to get down there, you have a benefit from some dividends we receive. We also have equity method of accounting that has a play on that. We have tax favored investment. We also have foreign tax credit as well. And then the redeemable non-controlling interest impact on our business. So that last one is what drove down that 1% from that 21% to 23%, and that's somewhat volatile as we go into the year.","Now, as we talk about effective tax rate, first quarter of each year we have to true-up for what happens in the prior year and that goes positive and negative adjustment to taxes, but we do adjust our accruals. So to the point that we were making earlier, the lower effective tax rate that we're seeing at this point in time, in large part is due to a true-up, a positive lower tax rate impact on from 2013 that we reflected in 2014. Hopefully that helps.","John Nadel","And then looking at Principal International, if I just look at the combined net revenue in 4Q, and I don't want to get overly focused on a single quarter to your point, Larry, earlier about trends, but that combined net revenue is only up 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And that's despite, I'm guessing, there is some benefit from that extra month of Cuprum in that number. That's a huge decline in terms of the growth rate from the first nine months, which I think was up 17% or 18% year-over-year. So can you give us some sense for what drove that? Is it really just primarily currency? And how should we think about that relative to your outlook, I think which was for 8% to 10% growth in 2015?","Larry Zimpleman","I think there is two factors at work. I think there's two factors at work there in the current quarter. One is FX, which you mentioned. The other one that is at work there is encaje return, which were certainly more challenging in fourth quarter than they were in third quarter. So again, as I said before, trying to judge net revenue growth in any sort of one quarter is a little bit difficult.","Having said that, if you asked us kind of normalizing for everything, adjusting for local currency, adjusting for encaje, adjusting for everything else kind of what's the underlying growth and run rate of the business, our answer would be in that 15%, 16% range on a local currency basis and adjusting for encaje. So I hope that helps.","John Nadel","And then the last one I've got for you, real quick, if I can sneak in and it's a bigger picture question. Over the last several years there's been a lot of talk, obviously with oil down where it's at about, how big a driver of employment growth in United States effectively the energy sector has been.","And I guess, now with oil down where it's at and a lot of capital investment getting cut, likelihood that there is going to be some -- well, it's already started, but likelihood that there will be more employment cuts. I guess, I am thinking bigger picture. Have you guys thought about this, how big of a contribution has, that energy revolution, if you will, in the U.S. played toward your growth in the last four or five years, and thus how big of a potential pressure point might it be if this plays out?","Larry Zimpleman","Well, there is lot backed in there, John. So let me make a few comments. Jim, I know would want to comment as well. I have been a little bit surprised as I sort of watch the market press and other things commenting on the drop in oil prices, the extent to which it's taken on an overly negative term. I actually have little doubt that on the net-net basis, the decline in oil and energy prices is a positive thing for the U.S. economy.","Now, if you are in the oil business or in the energy business, it could be very painful to you. And to your point there are going to be layoffs and other actions taken within the oil and energy sector, but if you think about how pervasive falling oil prices are in terms of helping consumers have more money in their pocket, which helps all retail companies.","If you think about the reduction in cost for manufacturing and then you think about all of the manufacturing entities there are throughout the United States. Again, I have little doubt that net-net it actually will help to stimulate in some way a job growth in the United States.","So I think some of the decline in oil price is kind of secular, but certainly I don't necessarily think we're going to be looking at $45 oil for the next 10 years. So oil will find its natural sort of landing spot somewhere between the $100 and the $45 and that will happen over time. So there is going to be adjustments in the energy sector, adjustments in the oil sector, but I think there will be more than compensating adjustments in other portions of the economy.","And with that, I'll turn it over to somebody who knows a lot more about it than I do, which is Jim McCaughan.","John Nadel","First, I'd just want to say, I appreciate that commentary, Larry, very much. Thank you.","James McCaughan","Thanks Larry. You're too kind. I would point out that we are very diversified across the whole economy by industry and by location. So the stimulus that Larry mentions will be important and probably a pretty big majority of the areas where we have business. So our sensitivity to jobs is not something that would cause us too much concern at the moment.","Indeed, I'd point to a piece of research that's been mentioned fairly widely that was done by our economics area and came out about two weeks ago, which was really about the tightness of the labor market and where pay rises are within all the data for over 3 million plan participants that we regularly see.","And that was suggesting that within that small midsize business area there is better pay growth than there is in the economy as a whole. And we think that's actually a very optimistic sign that not only are those clients in general are doing pretty well, but the labor market is tightening in that area, and that will be good for the kind of businesses we have.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.","Steven Schwartz","Larry, I'd like to go quickly in a different direction. The administration presumably in support of the DOL recently published the letter talking about fiduciary responsibilities and qualified plans. They did point to potential issues that they saw in 410k and other defined plans. I was wondering if you can maybe comment on regulatory issues out there.","Larry Zimpleman","I can, because I can tell you that both Dan and I along with Greg Burrows and our government relations' team in Washington spend a lot of time on this. Also as you know, I am the 2014 Chairman of the Financial Services Round Table, which is one of the trade organizations that works very hard on this issue and many other issues. The issue, the specific one, Steven, that you mentioned relative to the Department of Labor considering whether additional kind of rules are necessary around how advisors and pension providers interact with plan participants.","Again, as you know, but others may not on the call, this has been an issue that's been sort of bubbling for a number of years. I think bubbling for a three or four or maybe even five years. And lately, there has been perhaps a belief as a result of memo that was written inside the Whitehouse by National Economic Council and made its way into the public sector that the administration and the Department of Labor maybe thinking about taking some action here.","I would say that from my more detailed conversations and they include a conversation outside and inside the Whitehouse that I have had on this topic, I really believe the primary area, Steven, that they are looking at is in the area when participants terminate or retire and they move out of the 401k plan into a rollover IRA. There is some focus on the question about how you provide information and education to plan participants inside the 401k, but the primary focus, I think they have is on the rollover IRA situation.","Again, we feel strong, and I think the industry feel strongly that participants need access to good information and good education in order to help them make the right decision when they come to benefit of end time. And I think the devil again is going to be in the details of how those rules, if it does go forward, how those rules would be crafted, because the worst result would be to not allow financial advisors to be able to Council with planned participants determination retirement to figure out what is a good choice for them in terms of benefit of event.","So we're going to continue to work on the issue. The industry is very united across this. There are a number of trade organizations that are working on it. And I would, just as a last point say, when we ask or when I have been in these meetings and I ask examples, because if there is bad behavior going on out there, it's in our collective interest to make sure that that doesn't happen. We take as some very significant responsibility to work with our plan participants.","And when we ask for examples, we can better understand the problem. I will say specifics tend to not be very forthcoming around where the examples are, so we can help to fix them on our own. So more to come, appreciate you raising it, we're very focused on it. This is a important issue for America. It's an important issue for the baby boom generation. It's a very important issue for principal and our customers.","Steven Schwartz","Larry just a follow-up. The letter also concentrated on revenue sharing. Is that a factor in your business?","Larry Zimpleman","Well, in a way, Steven, I think that issue has been sort of wedded and dealt with. And I think for the better, because I think today the disclosure that is out there today around revenue sharing is pretty complete. And we've always believe and we definitely believe that transparency is the best medicine, if you will.","So we've always had a lot of transparency around all things, revenue sharing, and I think now the industry is in that mode as well. So I think while there maybe sort of some questions or comments in that particular treatise on that. I don't think that's really the focus for the DOL. I think it's more in the relationship between financial advisors and plan participants.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Zimpleman, your closing comments please.","End of Q&A","Larry Zimpleman","Well, thanks everybody for joining us today. When I just say that again we look at our 2014 results and we're very, very pleased overall with the year and we're very, very pleased that 2014 was a year that we had not only record earnings for the company, but record earnings for each of our business segments.","We do see momentum has been very strong behind every one of our businesses, that again as a result of great investment performance and very good day-to-day execution by our team. So again, thanks for your interest. We look forward to seeing many of you on the road in the near future.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

And welcome to everyone on the call. As this is my first earnings call as CEO, I would like to take a brief moment to thank our Chairman, Larry Zimpleman, for his many contributions throughout his 44 years at The Principal and especially as CEO. He not only had led us through the financial crisis, but and also helped us evolve from a domestic employee benefits company to a global leader in retirement and investment management. I am proud to lead our company in executing on the strategy firmly established during Larry's tenure and will continue to focus the company on delivering sustainable, profitable growth. Larry remains Chairman of our Board and we'll continue to benefit from his guidance and tremendous breadth and depth of knowledge.","I would also like to welcome Nora Everett, President of Retirement and Investor Services; and Deanna Strable, President of U.S. Insurance Solutions to today's call. They will be available to answer questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. I am incredibly proud of the strength and commitment of our leadership team who are all industry experts in their respective fields.","Now, I'll provide some comments about our results. As John mentioned, there are slides related to today's call on our website. The key themes for the quarter are outlined on slide 4. The businesses delivered solid results in the third quarter, especially given strong macroeconomic headwinds from market and interest rate volatility and the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The results generated this quarter demonstrate the revenue and earnings stability that our diversified business mix provides in a variety of market conditions. Strong fundamentals and focused execution across our businesses resulted in total company operating earnings of $317 million in the third quarter, driving the year-to-date total to $967 million. Year-to-date net income is strong at nearly $1 billion. Our continued ability to generate growth enables us to increase long-term value for shareholders through capital deployment.","Last night, we announced a fourth quarter common stock dividend of $0.38 per share and our Board authorized a new share repurchase program. These actions signal our confidence and our ability to grow earnings in 2016 and beyond. Terry will provide additional details on third quarter financials including normalizing items that impacted results.","Despite unusual items this quarter, our businesses continued to achieve solid underlying growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, total company net cash flows were $25 billion and we ended third quarter with $516 billion in assets under management. Strong investment performance continues to be a differentiator and is a foundation for future operating earnings growth. 45 of the rated mutual funds, or 78%, have a four-star or five-star Morningstar rating. Additionally, as slide 5 shows, at quarter end, 86% of Principal's investment options were in the top two quartiles of Morningstar rankings on a one-year basis and 91% in the top two quartiles on a three-year and five-year basis.","Finally, 100% of our Target Date Funds were once again on the top two quartiles of Morningstar rankings across all time periods at quarter end, further enabling us to help more customers achieve financial success. This performance translated into strong flows across our retail, retirement and institutional platforms. Principal Global Investors ended the third quarter with total assets under management of $324 billion, including $120 billion of unaffiliated assets under management.","Third quarter unaffiliated net cash flows of $2 billion were a large portion of Principal Global Investors' third quarter net cash flows of $3 billion. Success across multiple asset classes along with our global distribution footprint have helped us build scale and drive strong growth.","Principal Funds had its 23rd consecutive quarter of positive net cash flows. The combination of strong and diversified distribution channel and a broad mix of investment options aimed at solving for favorable outcomes drove strong sales of $5 billion for the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal Funds sales were up 22% and both our equity and fixed income flows were four times the industry average versus the same period a year ago. Third quarter 2015 marked Principal International's 28th consecutive quarter of positive net cash flows. On a trailing 12-month basis, net cash flows were $12 billion.","Highlighting the negative impact foreign exchange has had on our results, reported assets under management of $106 billion for Principal International included a $34 billion negative impact from foreign exchange rates over the last 12 months.","More than a decade ago, we focused Principal International's strategy to serve the retirement and long-term saving needs of the rapidly growing middle classes in select emerging markets. We knew that emerging markets would have volatile time periods. That's the nature of emerging markets. However, our consistently strong growth metrics in Principal International demonstrate that the long-term growth opportunities outweigh bouts volatility. Despite the recent volatility in these markets, tremendous growth opportunities remain and we're just as confident as we've always been about our ability to capture market share and continue to grow over the long-term.","The success we have achieved in Principal International is driven by two key advantages: our expertise in providing the savings solutions customers seek and our partnership with marquee distribution networks, which is critical for success in international markets. For example, our long-term exclusive distribution partnership with Banco do Brasil, the largest bank in Latin America, provides us access to their large customer base where to date we've reached just 3% of their customer base. As a state-owned bank with a quality reputation, customers in Brazil view Banco do Brasil as a safe haven, particularly during volatile periods. Our tax advantaged individual retirement products remain in favor, garnering Brasilprev $1.2 billion of net cash flow in the third quarter. This strengthened its position as the number one private retirement provider in terms of net cash flow and assets. In addition, during the quarter, Brasilprev received multiple awards including recognition as one of the most innovative companies in the Brazil pension industry.","Additionally, our partnership with China Construction Bank, the second largest bank in the world, has generated $26 billion of net cash flows in China on a trailing 12-month basis. The continued growth in China makes us a formidable player in this market. As other pension and other long-term savings opportunities materialize in China, we're well positioned to capitalize on those opportunities in this long-term strategic market.","Another key focus is on enhancing and expanding distribution. A main driver of growth in Principal International has been our successful implementation of strategic acquisitions, such as Cuprum in Chile and HSBC in Mexico. We've closed on the acquisition of AXA's pension business in Hong Kong on September 1 and the transition is proceeding smoothly. The acquisition adds $3 billion of assets under management to our current business, making us the fifth largest mandatory pension provider in Hong Kong. Importantly, the deal includes a 15-year exclusive distribution agreement with AXA's network of some 4,400 agents. This provides additional opportunities to grow our market share as the mandatory and voluntary pension markets grow in Hong Kong.","Turning to Principal Funds, our ongoing advisor development efforts have driven double-digit growth year-to-date and a number of advisors selling our funds to 52,000. Principal Funds is the 16th largest advisor-sold fund family in the U.S., and we continue to grow our market share. Our advisor centered distribution strategy provides us a competitive advantage for our U.S. retirement business as well. Year-to-date, alliance channels accounted for more than 75% of our Full Service Accumulation sales. Third quarter sales of $1.5 billion were largely driven by sales in the small and medium size business market. This market has been a long-term focus for Principal, as it's historically been underserved.","Additionally, we continue to grow the number of plans in the large market, as plan sponsors of all sizes seek our retirement benefit solutions for their employees. In addition to building strong distribution partnerships, we've built our leadership position in the retirement industry by providing solutions from hire through retire, and we continue to successfully execute on that strategy.","The underlying growth metrics in Full Service Accumulation remain strong, with third quarter recurring deposits up 7% for the quarter and year-to-date. Plan count and active participants continue to increase as well. This growth reflects our efforts to continue to expand participation and deferral rates through innovative plan design features in addition to improved employment trends. The U.S. is still the largest retirement market in the world, and there's still a lot of work to be done as people are not yet saving enough for a comfortable retirement.","As a leader in the industry, we remain actively engaged in working with others to ensure the proposed regulations from the Department of Labor protect efforts to help Americans achieve a secure retirement. Providing protection solutions in addition to retirement and long-term savings options is important to our strategy of helping customers achieve financial success. And Specialty Benefits, our competitive benefit solutions, and strong distribution networks helped drive an 8% increase in year-to-date normalized premiums and fees.","We continue to see in-plan growth quarter-over-quarter and the loss ratio remains favorable at the low end of our targeted range. Business market sales in Individual Life remained strong and made up nearly 60% of sales in third quarter. These plans help small and medium size business owners with the business continuity strategies as well as enhance our total retirement suite through robust non-qualified plans.","In closing, I'm excited about the tremendous long-term growth opportunities ahead. I remain optimistic about our future despite continued global macroeconomic volatility. I'm proud of our dedicated employees who continuously demonstrate their ability to execute on our strategy. It's their commitment to meeting the needs of our customers that will continue to successfully drive the company forward.","Terry?","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter, net income including performance of the investment portfolio, and an update on capital deployment. Third quarter continued to build on the momentum from the first half of 2015 as the fundamentals of our business remained strong. However, results were masked by ongoing macroeconomic headwinds.","Operating earnings for the quarter were negatively impacted by the combination of the strengthening U.S. dollar, negative equity markets, and lower interest rates. The impact was partially offset by our annual actuarial model and assumption review. In addition, on a total company basis, variable investment income was down compared to the prior year period due to lower than expected prepayments on U.S. investments. Total company reported operating earnings were $317 million, or $1.06 per share.","Slide 6 shows the normalizing items for the quarter. As we typically do in the third quarter, we completed our annual review of actuarial models and assumptions. The review resulted in a net benefit to operating earnings of $0.11 per share. Notable impacts of the review include reducing interest rate assumptions, other assumption updates, and model refinements. Other normalizing items for the quarter include a $0.06 negative impact from additional expense recognition in Full Service Accumulation and Individual Annuities due to market declines, as well as lower variable investment income in Individual Annuities, and a net $0.03 negative impact to Principal International's earnings per share due to lower than expected encaje returns and an impairment resulting from the review of specific intangibles associated with our 2012 purchase of Claritas, our Brazilian mutual fund operation.","These were partially offset by higher than expected Latin American inflation and variable investment income in Chile. On a normalized basis, earnings per share were $1.04, down $0.01 from the normalized third quarter 2014. After adjusting for foreign exchange, third quarter earnings per share grew 6% over the year ago quarter. Additional detail about the actuarial review and intangible asset impairment is outlined on slide 7. At the end of the third quarter, return on equity, excluding AOCI, was 13.2%. When we adjust the average equity for exchange rate movements, the return on equity was 14.5%.","Now, I'll discuss business unit results. The accumulation businesses within Retirement and Investor Services reported operating earnings of $143 million. On a normalized basis, operating earnings were $180 million for the third quarter 2015, flat compared to the year ago quarter. Slide 8 shows that quarterly net revenue was up 1% compared to third quarter 2014, and up 4% on a trailing 12-month basis. Adjusting for the actuarial assumption review, trailing 12-months pre-tax return on net revenue was 32%. This margin remains attractive and is within our guided range.","Normalized Full Service Accumulation operating earnings were $110 million, down 3% from the year ago quarter due to lower revenue and slightly higher expenses. Net cash flows for Full Service Accumulation were slightly negative for the quarter as we continued to balance growth and profitability. Year-to-date flows were a positive $2 billion, and we're still on track to end 2015 within our targeted 1% to 3% of beginning year account values.","Principal Funds third quarter operating earnings were a record $30 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year. The trailing 12-month pre-tax return on revenue continues to improve as we grow scale. Strong investment performance and flows contributed to account values of $122 billion at quarter end for the total Principal Funds complex. Individual Annuities normalized operating earnings were $33 million for the quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year quarter. We continue to believe that the run rate for this business is in the $32 million to $36 million range in normal operating conditions.","Looking at slide 9, operating earnings for the guaranteed businesses within Retirement and Investor Services were $21 million. Full Service Payout had adverse mortality in the quarter that was within our expected range of fluctuations. In the third quarter, we had almost $700 million of Full Service Payout sales, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.5 billion. We continue to approach our guaranteed businesses opportunistically.","Turning to slide 10, Principal Global Investors quarterly operating earnings were $30 million, a 20% increase over the year ago quarter. Trailing 12-month pre-tax margin was 27%, an increase of 190 basis points over the same period a year ago. Net cash flows of $2.9 billion during the quarter highlight the confidence investors have in our diversified solutions. The net cash flows have been driven by our yield-oriented products and are a direct result of our investment in our global distribution platform. Assets under management for Principal Global Investors increased 6% over the prior year quarter to $324 billion. Unaffiliated assets under management ended the quarter at $120 billion, also a 6% increase over the year ago quarter.","Slide 11 shows normalized quarterly operating earnings for Principal International of $54 million. Third quarter operating earnings were negatively impacted by $18 million due to foreign exchange on a quarter-over-quarter comparison. On a local currency basis, Principal International drove year-over-year growth in the mid-teens. Included in the normalization is the $11 million impairment of intangibles in Claritas, our mutual fund operation in Brazil. The impairment recognizes the loss of some specific assets under management and distribution in force at the time of our 2012 acquisition, as investors' sentiment shifted to less volatile fixed income investments. Claritas has largely maintained its assets under management by continuing to develop market-driven investment solutions, often leveraging The Principal's global asset management capabilities. This global synergy is becoming a strong competitive advantage given recent regulatory changes allowing more Brazilians access to overseas investments.","We remain committed to offering a broad lineup of appropriate long-term investments to our customers and Claritas remains a critical piece of our Latin American strategy. As shown on slide 12, Individual Life reported $73 million of operating earnings in the third quarter, reflecting a benefit from the actuarial assumption review and model enhancements. The adjustments better reflect actual experience and are predominantly prior year experience adjustments. Normalized Individual Life operating earnings were $31 million for the quarter, a 33% increase over a normalized prior year period helped by favorable claims experience. On a trailing 12-month basis, the normalized operating margin was within our targeted range.","Moving to slide 13, Specialty Benefits reported operating earnings were $42 million, reflecting the benefit of the actuarial model enhancements. Normalized quarterly operating earnings were a record $34 million, an 8% increase over the prior year quarter. The normalized loss ratio for the quarter was 64%, well within our expected range. The normalized trailing 12-month pre-tax operating margin remains strong and within our targeted range.","Corporate operating losses were $37 million. This includes expenses associated with the closing of the acquisition of AXA's pension business in Hong Kong. We still anticipate full-year 2015 Corporate operating losses to be in the previously announced range of $130 million to $150 million.","For the quarter, total company net income was $300 million, a strong result reflecting the benefit of our diversified business model. Net credit related losses were $6 million for the quarter and continue to be below our long-term expectations. Our capital deployment strategy remains balanced as we leverage multiple options to increase long-term value for shareholders.","Slide 14 shows that year-to-date we have deployed $885 million of excess capital. In the third quarter, we closed on the AXA acquisition, paid a $0.38 common stock dividend and opportunistically repurchased 2.2 million of our shares. Yesterday, we announced a $0.38 common stock dividend payable in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year common stock dividend to $1.50 per share, a 17% increase over the full-year 2014 common stock dividend. With the fourth quarter dividend, our 2015 capital deployment amount will be nearly $1 billion.","Additionally, yesterday, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $150 million share repurchase program. With the recent completion of our previously $150 million authorization, this new authorization is an acceleration of our 2016 capital deployment plan and allows us to continue to repurchase shares opportunistically.","In closing, this quarter demonstrates that our diversified business model positions us well for future growth in various economic environments. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operators, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from John Nadel from Piper Jaffray.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good morning, everybody. Dan, I guess a question to start. With the change in management, recognizing that there's likely very little, if any, change in strategy, just a question for you about capital deployment. I realize that the longer term track record here on the acquisition side remains very sound, but given the recent intangible impairments, when you look at Liongate and Claritas, I am curious whether you might have a different view about the method of deploying free cash flow and capital as we look forward?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, John, thank you for the question. Just a couple of comments, and I've got to appreciate your perspective, but our capital strategy will remain the same. It's going to be a very balanced approach. Increasingly, we become more driven by our fee businesses, which, gives us, frankly, more flexibility. We can demonstrate through a lot of Jim's operations, when I think about WM Funds and Morley and Spectrum and Origin and Finisterre, HSBC Mexico, these are really, really strong results. When I look at the Luis' Cuprum, AXA, Brasilprev and the exclusive distribution agreement that was added to, we've got actually a very strong track record of executing on successfully integrating companies that we've acquired, supplementing our organic growth strategies. Having said that, in the case of Liongate that you cited, Liongate, I think, is a one-off. It was an asset class that our timing wasn't good. The performance was underwhelming and caused us to lose a lot of the assets. We recognized that, we did our due diligence, we did our look back, and certainly understand perhaps how we could go about acquiring an asset like that in the future.","And frankly, I would even put Claritas in the same category. That's a different sort of impairment on an intangible. And maybe with that, I'll ask Terry to provide some additional comments. But again, I would say, John, we remain quite confident about our ability to successfully execute our capital strategy. Terry?","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, John, it's Terry.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","No, I \u2013 sorry, Terry. Yeah.","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, this is Terry. As you know, each quarter we take a look at all of our assumptions. But in the third quarter of each year, we do a thorough review of the intangibles, the goodwill as well for each of our businesses. And that's similar to the actuarial model and assumption review that we also do. And we look at all the tangibles as well as intangibles whether they're finite lived or infinite lived. And in this case, in particular, with Claritas, we reviewed it this quarter and we looked at the particular fund at the time of the purchase when we acquired Claritas. And the macroeconomic conditions have really changed and become much more challenging for the mutual fund business within Brazil, and as a result, associated with this one particular fund that went out of favor, and we had to impair the intangibles that were associated with it. These were related to the investment management contract that we had, the value of the customers in the fund, the distribution agreements. These all moved away from us. And so we had to impair those specific impairments associated with that.","And we had to impact in the current quarter. Now that's about $23 million for the 100% of which we had 60% of that impairment. Now, because of the timing of this, we also looked at it in terms of the goodwill associated with Claritas. And we did not impair that, which is probably more important to us in terms of the long-term. As Dan noted, it's a significant player in our Latin American strategy both on the asset management side as well as on Principal International. And they've proven themselves. They've actually replaced much of the assets under management by developing some other market driven investment solutions that have been very strong by leveraging, as I mentioned earlier in the call, Principal Global asset management capabilities. And so, it still has a competitive advantage for our product. So we didn't feel that there was an impairment there. Now that being said, and where the question would go is, are there other impairments out there of goodwill or of an intangible? But we do, as we do with actuarial review and assumptions, we do a thorough scrubbing of the goodwill and we're seeing a strong cushion on all the remaining intangibles as well as goodwill. Hopefully that helps.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","John, did you have a follow-up question?","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","I appreciate that. Yeah, I wanted to ask a question about Principal International. In particular, I guess, I wanted to focus on Latin America. Obviously, flows remain positive, but net flows slowed down. And I don't think that's that surprising. But I was wondering if we could get an update on conditions locally, particularly in areas such as Brazil, Chile, and maybe even Mexico where clearly the economies are weaker. And in the case of Brazil in particular, there's been a lot of press about the very worried state of the pension market there and what a mess that is economically for the country. And I'm wondering what you think it might mean for Principal's opportunities.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, really good question, John. So I appreciate that. And I'll make a couple of overarching comments and then flip it over to Luis to add some color. It's an important driver for PFG, it represents roughly 25% of our earnings, and I would just remind everyone on the call, we've got 28 consecutive quarters of positive net cash flow that are being driven by Principal International. And I'd also say that we have tremendous partners. I think about China Construction Bank and Banco do Brasil who are very much entrenched in these local markets and add enormous firepower to our ability to distribute our products. And when we do our look back on places like China and India and Brazil and Mexico and Chile, some things haven't changed. They're still a very significant, emerging class growing. These are middle income investors and people who will save for retirement. Aging, the demographics are even more severe than they are here in the U.S., so they need these products, they need these solutions. We know government is not in a position to take over these responsibilities in any of these countries, and we know that to date they've embraced very much a private sector approach to solving the problems.","But with that, let me throw it over to Luis to add some additional color, John, on those specific countries you cited.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you, Dan.","Luis Vald\u00e9s - President-Principal International","Thanks, Dan. John, a very good question, indeed, particularly talking about Mexico, Brazil and Chile and where they are at. Three different countries, three different problems, totally different. In Brazil, essentially what we have, we have a country which is certainly fixable that the political crisis is obstructing the economy's recovery. And meanwhile, we're going to live within this economic \u2013 political turmoil. It's going to be very difficult that the fiscal adjustment that is really needed is going to go through. So probably we're going to have another year, year and a half that we're going to see this political turmoil that certainly the Brazilians are going to be able to fix this. Whatever is going to be that solution if the Minister of Finance currently, Levy, he knows very well what they have to do but politically speaking, he has to be unleash in order to fix the problem. As I am saying, Brazil is fixable.","What Dan said is very important. The fundamentals in Brazil there will remain and the proof of that is that that strong and big and large middle class is the one that is keeping our net customer cash flows in a very positive environment month after month and quarter after quarter. And we continue growing. And if you are looking our results coming from Brazil, and you particularly are paying attention, Brasilprev is putting in nominal terms and in U.S. terms, it's demonstrating a flat result year-over-year in the nine months period ended. It means it has been able to grow at 30% plus year-over-year.","The situation for Mexico is a little bit different. The situation is a much more stable economy, very tied to the U.S. economy. So we have to pay a lot of attention about what is going to happen to the U.S. economy and then we're going to have some conclusions about Mexico. Unfortunately, they went through very important reforms, particularly the energy reform, the most important reform, wrong timing. But we will see what is going to happen, but Mexico, we are not \u2013 Mexico is in a total different stage.","Chile, they have to readjust their economy a little bit. They are highly dependent on the commodity cycle. They have to readjust their macroeconomics, but Chile is still a double A minus country, so they have the highest rating among the emerging countries in Latin America. So our strategy \u2013 we remain very clear with our strategy is the right combination between voluntary money and compulsory money and has been proved that is a very solid and sound and successful strategy. And we see that we don't have any reason to start changing our strategy and we remain very confident about the future of our operations in Latin America.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Very good. Thanks, John, for your question.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Really, really appreciate the color. Thank you so much.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Very good.","Operator","Your next question is from Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First, just a separate follow-up on the international business. It looked like China earnings were up pretty significantly. I was just hoping you could give a little bit of an update on what's going on there and if that's sustainable.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Ryan, thank you. And, yeah, you're right. This is a quarter that we've called that out. It has increasingly become significant, both from a profitability perspective, net cash flow as well as sales. And so, Luis, you want to go ahead and provide some additional color?","Luis Vald\u00e9s - President-Principal International","Yes, absolutely. Ryan, I mean \u2013 and again, this is the result of our own strategy. As we have said, we're very much more patient oriented, long-term saving oriented, so our offering and value proposition in all of those markets is in that sense. So as long as we start having this kind of choppy road in China and very volatile market, essentially what is happening is customers are flying into \u2013 they fly to quality and they are looking for a safe harbor. And that is exactly what we're offering there.","So we're perceived in our JV attached to the CCB, which is the second largest bank in China, we are perceived as a safe harbor. And we have had this tremendous amount of net customer cash flow. So that in essence, in one year, we doubled the size of our company. So we're running a company with $41 billion in total AUMs, and we think that we're going to continue looking and facing that kind of reality.","So all these kind of things that happened in China, the wealth management products, and the shadow banking system, it seems to me that money is playing away from that kind of solutions and looking for very serious managers and partners like we are in China.","Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Yeah, very helpful. Thank you. And just shifting to FSA, can you talk about the pipeline as well as just generally what you're seeing in terms of plan sponsors and proposal activity and retention levels?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, very good. I'll make a couple overarching comments and then throw that over to Nora Everett to answer some questions. I was reflecting on this in preparation of the call. Just a couple of weeks ago, we hosted roughly 130 of our clients down in Florida. This would have been larger clients, and it's an opportunity to sit down face to face with our client council. It also is an opportunity to spend a couple of days just getting to know them better and to hear their candid views. And I walked away with a few.","One was they value what we do significantly. We are making a difference. They increasingly look at us as an outsourced partner to handle matters related to their benefits and in particular as it relates to the retirement plan. I was reminded about how much the relationships matter in this. They are very close to their relationship managers, and we have a long-tenured group of professionals out there that work with our clients every day.","Then I also couldn't help but notice during our session regarding investment choice and performance, Jim was there and presented along with other peers or his contemporaries to present our platform. And as you know, we have very strong investment performance which is well received by our clients. And then lastly, it seems like most of the conversation isn't around the funds and fees. It was around what can we help them with as it relates to plan design to get to better outcomes. And maybe with that, I'll just throw it over to Nora to help answer specific questions on the pipeline and outlook for FSA.","Nora Mary Everett - President-Retirement & Investor Services","Sure. Good morning, Ryan. We're actually really pleased with the growth and momentum in our pipeline. As you know, we don't give sales guidance, but we're seeing double digit increase in that pipeline. Now, remember, the lifecycle, the sales cycle here can be rather long, so a lot of that we'll see impact in 2016. But we're particularly happy to see that our core SMB and the core SMB space, we're seeing that pipeline build. And we expect typically over half of our new sales AV, account values, to be in that SMB space. So continued success with our alliance firms, continued success with our TPA channel.","And in particular, this total retirement suite differentiator of ours, we see that on the sales front and continue to see pretty significant build around that TRS suite. So even though we're not giving sales guidance, I would point you to net cash flow. We expect to meet the guidance we've given between 1% and 3% beginning of the year account value. I would say that, given what we see today, it will likely be the lower end of that range. And there's always the caveat in our business that one or two plan decisions, whether it's timing or something else, can shift that number a bit. So we're always a little bit careful about trying to predict. But with that said, we're really pleased with the growth and momentum in that sales pipeline.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ryan, thanks for your question.","Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. First question is on the actuarial review and the 50 basis point reduction in interest rates. Can you comment on the long end of the curve, where does that put you from an absolute standpoint? What is the absolute rate assumption that you're now using? That's question number one.","And then just relatedly, can you talk about the mechanics that resulted in no net charge and the fact that it was favorable overall? What were the other offsets within the assumptions that more than offset the negative impact of interest rates?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Very good. Thanks, Tom, for those questions. I'll just have Terry go ahead and respond.","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Tom, this is Terry. On the long end of the interest rates, we look at the 30 years out plus. And as you can do with any actuarial reserve, we try to make our current best estimate of what's going to happen in the future. And none of us have a clear, crystal ball in it, but what we do is we look out and see what the trends are and then make some adjustments. Back in 2012, we looked at the long-term interest rate and lowered it as well and also changed the trajectory of it. But now we're seeing that that interest rate environment is staying longer and longer out into the future. So we looked out 30 years and we lowered our long-term rate by 50 basis points.","Now, that is meaningful probably most for the life insurance business. The other businesses have a shorter duration, so when we look at the trajectory to get to that longer term rate, we also took an impact on that and smoothed out or reduced that short-term rate. So the impact that we saw was probably closer in that $25 million to $50 million range. Offsetting that, though, as I mentioned before, we have to look at our current best estimate on all the actuarial balances: reserve, DAC. We have to look at what else is out there in terms of other refinements on how we recognize reinsurance premium, mortality improvement. We looked at revenues, et cetera, and so \u2013 and margin out into the future, anything that might affect EGP. So there were more than positive offsets that we have reflected to our experience on the business that we've written in the past and predominantly in the life area. Most of that has been due to prior year experiences.","So the current guidance, current GAAP guidance that we're utilizing is to come up with our best estimate where we think it'll be in the future. And as a result, we took a reduction in long-term interest rate, but we backed up these others. So it created a huge amount of noise this quarter, and it varied by different business units, but in large part the lower interest rate environment was a negative, more than offset by our experience adjustments in terms of mortality and other model enhancements. Hopefully, that helps.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That was helpful, Terry. So after making the 50 basis point reduction and I heard you on the Life Insurance side that was the most impacted business, what is the actual level you are now at when you look at the very long duration interest rate assumption? What is the absolute level right now?","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, the absolute level, we probably \u2013 we're not going to share that in terms of the absolute level, because there's multiple parts to it. There is the risk free rate. We could use a 10-year Treasury as an example of that. We also look at the spreads that we would price for and what we're getting on our investments, default rates, credit analysis, et cetera. So, there is a lot of things that come into it which we're not going to share in terms of what we think were the absolute rate would be. But just to give you a little bit of color, little color, as I mentioned earlier, the longer term end of the curve that probably affects the life business the most, some of our other businesses have shorter durations. So the shape of the yield curve is very important as well. So if you were to say right now, we would say and just used as a risk-free rate of return for our businesses just as a proxy, but you have to look all along the yield curve, use the 10-year Treasury where it currently is right now. And a 10-year Treasury is around that 2% range. At what we look out into the future is over the next 30 years, it would grade up to probably maybe 25 basis points a year for the next 10 years?","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right.","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And your guess is as good as ours. And then it probably remains flat thereafter. So that kind of gives you an idea where we're looking out 10 years, but then on top of that, you have to put our pricing assumptions or spreads that we're getting, et cetera. So that gives you a little bit of a basis point. Was that helpful?","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Okay, thanks. And then just \u2013 and just one follow-up question. Just on Hong Kong, I saw earnings came down a bit. And I know you have the acquisition going on there. But I believe you mentioned the restructuring or costs associated with integration were flowing through Corporate other. So can you give a little help on the earnings progression that we're going to see from AXA Hong Kong and timing around that? How that's going to earn in from an earnings contribution standpoint?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, very good. Luis can give you some color on that.","Luis Vald\u00e9s - President-Principal International","Okay, Tom. Essentially meanwhile we are going through the integration of AXA for the next quarter. AXA is going to be neutral, if not a little bit negative for Hong Kong. Next year, we're expecting something in the range of $7 million to $7.5 million total impact in our after-tax OE for Hong Kong. Does that help?","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes, thank you.","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Tom, this is Terry. I'm going to add just a little bit. You mentioned in the Corporate segment this quarter, we only included the closing costs associated with that. And then the rest of it in the future will come through Principal International.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got you. Thank you.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, thanks for calling in, Tom.","Operator","Our next question is from Sean Dargan from Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks and good morning. I have a question about your capital deployment strategy. Last year, we saw three different dividend raises over the course of the calendar year. It's been flat at $0.38 over the four quarters this year. You've talked about getting to a 40% payout ratio, I'm just wondering if anything's changed in your thinking?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, not at all, Sean. And again, thanks for calling in this morning. Our commitment still remains the same relative to our dividend payout. If you look at it over a trailing 12-month basis, it's up 17%. The targeted payout still is right at 40%. I think if you did your math, it's somewhere around 36% today. So it's right well within the range. And that over the course of the next couple of years, we would expect to have the dividend securely at that 40%, absent something dramatic happening. So, hopefully that helps.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","It does. Thanks. And coming back to Principal International, the underlying trends have been okay, I guess, considering what's been going on in the local markets, but the U.S. GAAP results are obviously being obfuscated by the FX headwinds. Have you given any thought to hedging the income statement impact of FX, or is it just too expensive now?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, with that, maybe I'll have Terry go ahead and tackle that question.","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sean, this is Terry. As we look at this, we see this as more of a translation issue. The revenue that's generated in the international companies also has expense associated with it at the same currency rate. And so we're really translating it back to the U.S. So if we were to try to hedge this, first off, it would be very expensive because we're in multiple countries. Second, we wouldn't get hedge accounting treatment, so we'd just create some additional volatility. We just see that this is a translation, so that's why we provide the information on a local currency basis as well as try to give the impact of what it would be in terms of mid-teen growth rate. We're probably mid to upper teen growth rate in terms of this business on a local currency basis. Now, that's translation. But when it comes to an economic impact where we actually are moving capital from one jurisdiction to another, we'll make a call and actually hedge that flows so that we do not lose the value at the time that the earnings are generated. So we do make a call in terms of hedging money, but as you've seen, we've generated a lot of earnings outside the U.S. And an example of it is in the Latin America, as you pointed out or as pointed out before, and doing the AXA acquisition in Hong Kong, the money never even got back to the U.S. So we'll make sure that the capital gets appropriately hedged as it goes from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. But in terms of operating earnings, we're just trying to provide a little bit more clarity on a local currency basis and not incur the additional cost for the translation. I hope that helps.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","It does, Terry. Thank you.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sean, we do spend a lot of time internally modeling these sorts of potential ideas to either hedge or not to hedge. It's not by accident or lack of a lot of thought that gets us to where we're at with our current policies and strategies. And if the dollar should ever weaken and we should see these foreign currencies gain some strength, there is certainly some upside and some tailwind, so thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs.","Mike E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just wondering, given the multiples that we've seen come down in asset managers across the board, how does this change any sort of opportunities that you might see for future M&A?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, very good and I appreciate that. Let me make a couple of comments, then flip it to Jim. We do keep a very active list of those asset classes that we think that could be complementary to our existing platform. We look for potential strategies that would be uncorrelated, that would support our global platform, whether that's for retail or retirement or institutional investors. And again, I think our track record speaks for itself as it relates to our ability to leverage that into either separate accounts or mutual funds, institutionally managed accounts, separately managed accounts, collective investment trust. And so, with that maybe, Jim, you could provide some color on valuations of these properties and where you're going.","James P. McCaughan - President, Global Asset Management & Chief Executive Officer, Principal Global Investors","Yes, Michael, you are right that multiples on many of the transactions over the last few years have been very high. And if you'd asked me three years ago about the balance between organic and growth by acquisitions, I would have thought three years ago, we'd have done more acquisitions. But in fact, with the high multiples, we have been extremely focused on organic growth and hopefully that will continue to come through the numbers. As regards to one or two recent transactions that lower multiples and the talk of lower multiples, yes, that's something we'll be watching. I would say, though, that the lower multiples have tended to be on firms that don't really have the kind of growth edge that we're looking for in an acquisition. We're looking, as Dan said, for complementary capabilities that we can really work with our clients to use, whichever clients you're talking about, whether it's insurance, full service, the mutual fund company, the international distribution, and we're not seeing that a lot in the companies that are coming through at cheaper multiples. So I don't think it's a step change, but we'll be watching it. And I think on balance, the next three years could see a bit more acquisition opportunities in asset management than the last three did, but I don't feel that it's necessary for us to grow. I think our organic story is sufficiently strong on its own.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Michael, hopefully, you'll be able to join us on our investor workshop on November 6. Jim will probably get into some of those details with more depth and understanding. And some of the obvious questions are, how are you able to maintain such positive net cash flow in an environment where so many of the dollars are going to passive? And I think it has a lot to do with the strategies that were created within the funds business and with Jim's institutional asset management business to work the edges as opposed to going right down the middle on some of these large cap strategies that are tending to migrate towards passive. So again, hopefully, you can join us for that meeting on the 6th of November.","Mike E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, great. Looking forward to that.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you, Michael, for the call.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erik Bass from Citigroup.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. I just had a couple of follow-up questions on Principal International. First, on the AXA acquisition, I just want to make sure I followed on Luis' comment correctly about the earnings expectations for next year. Was that $7 million to $7.5 million after tax the expectation for the full year or on a quarterly run rate? And thinking that you're putting up about $335 million of capital, if that's the full year impact, it seems like a relatively low ROE.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, thanks, Erik. Luis?","Luis Vald\u00e9s - President-Principal International","Yes, Erik. That's a good question. Next year, we're not going to be able to enjoy all the synergies that we're going to enjoy, particularly in 2017. And this is due to many contracts that are tied to the AXA block of business, particularly with best serve and other asset managers. So we're going to transition that block of business in the very first six months of 2016. So in essence, my answer for you is that we're going to enjoy just 50% of those synergies in the first year and full synergies in 2017, Erik.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you. That helps. And then, Terry, just wanted to follow up on your comments around the impairments. So I think, were you speaking specifically about Claritas of no future impairments that you see on the horizon, or was that about all international acquisitions broadly? And one thing to just clarify there, I'm assuming when you do your test, it's all based on local currency results and currency is not a factor, is that correct?","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, that's correct, Erik. This is Terry. The impairments that we did, we look at all the intangibles and goodwill across all of our entities, not just Claritas. Claritas is the one where we actually found an impairment this quarter. But we've looked at every one of them. We scrub every one of them. And we do scrub them on a local currency basis as well, as you pointed out, but across all of our goodwill, all of our intangibles, we found that we have a significant cushion that we are not looking to impair any of those other entities across them. That goes back to entities that we acquired many years ago.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you. And just a final thing, just following up on the good response to Sean's question, how much of the 65% to 70% of earnings that you talk about is deployable capital? How much of that is contributed from the international business at this point? I guess thinking about it, how much of the cash flow actually gets to the holding company?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Terry, you want to...","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, yeah. If I look at Principal International, it goes to different holding companies. We have a UK holding company. We also have a U.S. holding company. And most of the earnings that are generated out of Principal International come up through that UK holding company or entities there. So for example, the earnings that are generated in the $250 million or above, we'll use some of that for organic growth within those businesses. And we also have a large portion of it available for acquisitions to fund their own acquisitions within Principal International.","So, I'd say that it mirrors \u2013 the international business mirrors the total company's position in terms of available capital in that two-thirds of the earnings associated with it. The rest is supporting the organic growth that's going on in the different entities, member companies. Hopefully, that helps.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. It does. Thank you very much.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Erik, thanks for calling in.","Operator","Your next question is from Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Suneet.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hey, good morning, guys. So, Terry, I just want to get back to your $1.04 normalized number. Just a couple of things kind of jumped out at me as I was sort of trying to think through the baseline for model projection going forward. It looked like in FSA, the tax rate was once again negative, even if I make the adjustments for the actuarial review and then the market driven expenses. And I thought on the last call, you had kind of guided to more of a 5% to 7% tax rate. So as we think about kind of trending this, I guess, how should we be thinking about getting back to that 5% to 7%, over what sort of period of time?","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, thanks, Suneet. First off, I want to say what you need to do in terms of a tax rate, you need to look at the total company. That's where we really focus our attentions, and it's really over a longer period of time than just simply some quarter by quarter distortions that may occur. Now, that being said, the total company effective tax rate is in that 20% to 22% range as we talked about before.","But if you go down to one of the biggest reasons for that drop is the dividend benefit that we receive. Now, most of that is concentrated within the Full Service Accumulation line. In this quarter there was a significant negative effective tax rate, as you pointed out. However, if you look at it over a period of time and you adjust for the unlocking, as you said before, the true-ups in the prior year, you're still at a negative rate on a year-to-date basis, albeit it's much lower than \u2013 it's just barely negative in terms of an effective tax rate for the full year. So look at it over a longer period of time.","Now, that being said, one of the reasons it's negative right now is because you've seen some higher growth, or faster growth, in the dividend received benefit that we get in Full Service Accumulation than on a pre-tax earnings basis. Now, there's a lot of adjustments that you can make in order to get the earnings growth on a pre-tax basis. In 2014, we saw a significant benefit for variable investment income that was at a much higher rate than what we're currently seeing this year. Now why is that? Well, in large part, you look at what was the sentiment back in 2013, that was a rising interest rate environment. So you saw a lot of prepayment activity going on in 2014 that we're not seeing in 2015. So therefore, the pre-tax earnings basis isn't growing as fast as the dividend received basis.","Now, as you go into the future, you tell me what's going to happen in terms of the economic environment, in terms of the equity market that's down on a total return basis of \u2013 down about 9%. Excuse me, down 1% where we would have expected it to be up 8%. So you've got a good point that we've got a negative effective tax rate at this point in time, albeit I think that it can turn around very quickly and get into that 5% to 7%. So again, we take a longer look at it, don't let the current periods distort it, and then that 5% to 10% is probably still a pretty good number for FSA.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Got it.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Terry, and thank you, Suneet, for the question.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","I had one follow-up if you have a second.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh, please. Go ahead.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Again, on the normalizing numbers, I just want to make sure we're kind of keeping score consistently here. Because if I think about that $0.06 that you're sort of adding back from weak markets, when I go back and look at prior periods where you had favorable markets, I would have thought we would have seen an adjustment going the other way. And based on the way that we track this, I didn't see it. So is there something unusual in this quarter that the reason that you're calling out those two? Or in periods of prior strong equity markets, did you have an expense adjustment kind of going the other way that maybe wasn't called out?","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, exactly. Suneet, this is Terry again. You're absolutely right. One of the things that we try to do in terms of what we call out is we try to get the end number to what we believe is the appropriate run rate for that business given a more normal environment. There will be periods where we'll have higher variable investment income because of positive markets, and there will be higher expenses that offset that. So we try not to get quite granular as we did this quarter with all the different noise items. This is probably the most adjustments that I've been associated with in any one particular quarter. But we do try to keep that total run rate where we're trying to net to get to an appropriate number.","Now, to the point that you made about this quarter being highly unusual, well, we saw the S&P as a proxy for the market being down nearly 7% this quarter. That had an adverse impact on the DAC amortization for both the individual annuity area as well as the Full Service Accumulation area. The Full Service Accumulation is a little bit more abnormal than what we would have normally seen because we've been having volatility in that business, albeit it's not been the magnitude that we saw this quarter. And in large part that is one of the model enhancements that we actually have made at the DAC model on a go-forward basis that had an impact \u2013 more than normal adverse impact in this quarter in terms of a reversion to more of a mean rate over a longer period of time. So, yeah, there was some unusual higher than expected, but I would not expect to see that kind of volatility on the Full Service Accumulation line in the future.","Now that said, for the individual annuity line with the variable annuity, which is still a relatively small block of business, out of the $516 billion of assets under management, we're talking maybe a $9 billion of variable annuity. There is some volatility associated with that that will continue. But net-net-net, we're trying to get you back to a number that we think whether we can agree to disagree on this, what we think is the appropriate run rate for the business in a particular quarter given the economic environment that we're seeing and where we would expect future quarters to evolve \u2013 come from.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Suneet, what I would just say is, in closing here, running out of time, is that the 7% negative performance in the quarter for the S&P 500, when we would have anticipated a plus 2%, that's a delta of 9%. We think that's worth calling out. I do think we've tried to bring that out in previous calls, but we'll try to be more consistent for you in doing that where we see outperformance that really does fall out of a significant range. And so we'll tighten that up for you in the future. So again, thank you for the call.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Much appreciated. Thanks.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd just like to thank everyone for joining us today on the call and appreciate your good questions and your interest and support. We still remain very optimistic about the growth and the strategy here at Principal. We remain confident that the strategy that we have around retirement, investment management and protection will serve our long-term shareholders for many years to come. Hopefully, we'll see many of you at the Investor Day event in New York City on November 6.

Welcome to Principal Financial Group\u2019s first quarter conference call. As always, materials related to today\u2019s call are available on our website at principal.com\/investor.","I will start by mentioning a change to our first quarter financial supplement in the PGI AUM by boutique table on the top of Page 16. Effective January 1, 2018, the EDGE Asset Management fixed income team joined Principal Global Fixed Income to better align capabilities and resources as a result approximately $11 billion of AUM move from Edge to the Principal Global Fixed Income boutique.","Following the reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO, Dan Houston and CFO, Deanna Strable will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions.

The company does not revise or update them to reflect new information, subsequent events or changes in strategy. Risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent report on Form 10-K filed by the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure maybe found in our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Houston","Thanks, John and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning, I will share some performance highlights and accomplishments that positioned us for continued growth. Deanna will follow with details on our financial results and capital deployment. First quarter was a good start to the year for Principal. We continued to deliver strong growth, execute our customer focused solutions oriented strategy, balanced investments in our business with expense discipline and be good stewards of shareholder capital. At $409 million, we delivered record non-GAAP operating earnings, a 10% increase compared to first quarter 2017. This reflects good underlying growth across our businesses and lower effective tax rate due to the U.S. tax law reform.","On a trailing 12-month basis, non-GAAP operating earnings exceeded $1.5 billion demonstrating our strength and leadership in the U.S. retirement and long-term savings, group benefits and protection markets, retirement and long-term savings in Latin America and Asia, and global asset management. Compared to a year ago, reported assets under management, or AUM is up $54 billion or 9% to a record $674 billion. Over the same period, we also increased AUM in our joint venture in China. That is not included in the report of AUM by $48 billion or 50% to a record $144 billion. This provides a solid foundation for revenue and earnings growth and it underscores not only the diversification of our asset management franchise by investor type, asset class and geography, but also strong integration across business units.","As I reflect on the strong recent traction in China specifically, it\u2019s a great reminder of the benefit of continuously making investments to drive long-term growth. As additional color on our asset management franchise, we again received some noteworthy third-party recognition during the quarter. Principal Funds ranked eighth on Barron\u2019s list of best fund families in 2017. Additionally, we received best fund awards in more than 10 countries from organizations, including Bloomberg, Morningstar and Lipper. Our investment performance remains very strong. At quarter end, for our Morningstar rated funds, 69% of fund level AUM had a 4 or 5-star rating. And as shown on slide 5, 86% of Principal mutual funds, exchange traded funds or ETFs, separate accounts and collective investment trust or CITs were above median for the 5-year performance, 72% above median for 3-year performance and 80% above median for 1-year performance.","Moving to net cash flows, we are pleased with the first quarter results for Principal international and retirement and income solutions. PI delivered $2.3 billion of net cash flow, its 38 consecutive positive quarter including record flows in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. And RIS delivered $1 billion of positive net cash flow. RIS flow rebounded nicely from fourth quarter softness despite $1 billion of outflows from the loss of a single client as we discussed on the fourth quarter call. Despite these positive results total company net cash flow was a negative $1.5 billion for the quarter, primarily reflecting elevated institutional withdrawals in Principal Global Investors as well as lower deposits resulting from some delayed fundings due to market volatility. A single client accounted for over half of PGI\u2019s total net outflows for the quarter due to rise in currency hedging cost declined withdrew over $3 billion, representing different investment grade credit mandates awarded to us over multiple time periods. And to be transparent there is another $3 billion in the same investment grade strategy at risk of leaving in the next year.","That said, we continue to manage another $6 billion of assets for the same client and other strategies where the cost of hedging can be more easily absorbed. And they awarded us a new mandate during the quarter. While the new mandate is less than 10% of the assets they withdrew, it offsets more than 40% of the annual revenue from the larger investment grade mandate. Quarterly volatility and currency hedging cost aside PGI institutional flows have been under pressure for several quarters now. As such I will provide some color on what we are saying and what we are doing to improve future flows and continue revenue growth as well as our outlook going forward. We have seen demand for lower cost investment options become even more pronounced in the institutional space in recent quarters. This has impacted withdrawals and made deposit growth challenging. We expect this trend to continue, but real opportunities remain for managers that can consistently deliver strong investment performance and demonstrate value to the marketplace. We are doing both. We delivered at least $1.5 billion of positive flows over the last 3 years in seven of our boutiques.","We continue to see strong interest in our specialty solution and alternative investment capabilities as we help clients diversify, build wealth, generate income, protect against downside risk and address inflation. Assets in these mandates tend to be smaller, but with higher fees. Consistent with previous discussions the divergence between asset growth and revenue growth is increasing. 2017 Boston Consulting Group report projects the passive AUM will grow faster than any other product type through 2021. However, they also project that 90% of industry revenue growth over this period will come from alternatives, active specialties and solutions. This is where we compete and excel.","Distribution and product development remains heavily focused on income and other outcomes based solutions, real estate and other alternative investments and our international retail platform to capitalize on emerging markets experiencing strong wealth creation. The build out of our ETF and CIT platforms is providing lower cost investment options to compete with pure passive options and complement our more traditional active mutual fund strategies. As communicated last quarter, PGI is gaining traction with its double in platform as well as its SMA, CIT and ETF platforms helping to offset some of the institutional pressure.","I will now share some key execution highlights starting with our investment platform. In the first quarter we launched more than a dozen new funds in total across Southeast Asia, China and Latin America responding to increasing local retail and institutional demand for multi-asset and income generating solutions. Importantly, we continue to make progress leveraging our mutual fund and ETF platforms across borders, delivering our global investment capabilities to meet the needs of local clients. In April we launched the Principal investment grade corporate active ETF adding to our suite of income oriented solutions on our U.S. platform. After surpassing the $1 billion and $2 billion milestones in 2017 our ETF franchise surpassed $3 billion in the first quarter of 2018 placing us on the top 25 on the ETF league tables at quarter end.","In the bank loan market, we priced our first collateralized loan obligation at Post Advisory Group in April. This marks the beginning of a product build that provides an efficient way for investors to have access to an attractive asset class. We also made additional progress towards the quarter on the digital front. We launched enhanced digital experience to help guide customers through their retirement savings options when they change jobs or retire. Additionally, we launched a first of its kind ESOP website to address the needs for succession planning among U.S. business owners and help advisors discuss the potential benefits of ESOPs to business owners and their employees and driving retirement readiness. Our digital efforts are being recognized with the top 5 ranking on DALBAR\u2019s Mobile InSIGHT Report in the life and annuity industry and outstanding MPF mobile app award in Hong Kong in the wealth and investment management category, more to come as we drive towards digital solutions that reduce barriers to action and eliminate pain points for customers and advisors.","Moving to distribution, we continue to advance our multi-channel multi-product approach and we earned more than 20 total placements during the quarter getting more than a dozen different funds on 15 different third-party platforms with success across the asset classes. CCB Principal Asset Management, our joint venture with China Construction Bank was selected midyear in 2017 to offer mutual funds on the Ant Financial platform, Ali Baba\u2019s payment affiliate. As of mid-April, we surpassed two key milestones, $6 billion of AUM and 3 million customers. While the revenue and earnings impact is currently modest, we expect both to become more meaningful over time. Clearly a key benefit today is brand exposure to Ant\u2019s 0.5 billion platform users.","As one final distribution highlight, our recent acquisition of MetLife\u2019s Afore business in Mexico increases our sales force competing in the private retirement market by more than 75%. While Deanna will cover this in more detail, I want to comment on our balanced approach to capital deployment. In addition to our ongoing investment and organic growth and our accelerated investments in digital business strategies, we returned more than $325 million to investors through our share buybacks and common stock dividends and we committed more than $80 million to M&A activities.","Before closing, a quick update on the DOL fiduciary rule. As you know on March 15, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals delivered a ruling in validating all elements of the DOL fiduciary rule, including the broad definition of the fiduciary investment advice and best interest contract exemption. Until the Fifth Circuit Court enters its order as final which we expect could happen as early as May, the fiduciary rule remains in effect and we will continue to operate in accordance. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners continue to work on the best interest standard proposals for their respective areas of jurisdiction. We and the industry in general believe a workable, uniform, best interest standard is beneficial and should be pursued. I will also share some additional recognition for the quarter.","For the eighth time, Ethisphere Institute named Principal as one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies, one of just five companies in financial services to make the list. Forbes named Principal as one of America\u2019s best employers for diversity ranking sixth out of 250 companies recognized. Lastly, for the 17th time, the National Association of Female Executives named Principal one of the top companies for executive women. We are one of just 10 companies in its Hall of Fame reflecting our longstanding commitment to women\u2019s advancement into leadership positions. These speak volumes about who we are as a company and why we will be successful long-term.","In closing, again first quarter was very good start to the year for Principal. It was a period of continued progress helping customers and clients achieve financial success. I look for us to continue to build on that momentum throughout 2018 and for that momentum to translate into long-term value for shareholders and each of our stakeholders. Deanna?","Deanna Strable","Thanks, Dan. Good morning and thank you for participating in our call. Today, I will discuss key contributors to our first quarter financial results and I will provide an update on capital deployment. The first quarter was a strong start to 2018 with net income attributable to Principal of $397 million, an increase of 14% from the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were a record $409 million in first quarter or a record $1.40 per diluted share and increased 10% over the prior year quarter. Reflecting the benefits of U.S. tax reform, our non-GAAP operating earnings effective tax rate was 17.7% for the first quarter. This was at the lower end of our 2018 guided range of 18% to 21% primarily due to the impact of stock-based compensation and state income tax treatment.","While there maybe some volatility in the effective tax rate quarter-to-quarter, we still expect to be within the guidance range for the full year. ROE, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustment, was 13.9% on a reported basis for the first quarter. Excluding the impact from the 2017 actuarial review, ROE was 14.3% and improved 20 basis points from year end. The only significant variance in the first quarter 2018 was $10 million pretax of lower than expected encaje performance in Principal International. As a reminder, first quarter 2017 significant variances included a total of $23 million from higher than expected variable investment income and higher than expected encaje performance, partially offset by an assessment associated with the Penn Treaty liquidation. Excluding these significant variances, total company non-GAAP operating earnings increased 17% over the year ago quarter. This reflects underlying growth and some favorable experience in our spread and risk businesses which I will discuss shortly.","Looking at macroeconomic factors, market volatility returned in the first quarter. While the S&P 500 daily average increased 5% during the quarter, the open to close decreased 1%. As prospective this is the first quarterly decline for the index since first quarter of 2016. The U.S. 10-year treasury yield increased 34 basis points during the quarter, a positive development. However, it takes some time for the higher rates to have a noticeable impact on portfolio yields and thus financial results. Additionally, positive impacts from foreign currency exchange rates during the quarter were offset by the negative impact of significantly lower interest rates in Brazil and lower inflation in Latin America. Favorable mortality and morbidity contributed to strong first quarter results and RIS spread and specialty benefits, benefiting each business by approximately $10 million pretax.","Specific to specialty benefits and extremely low and unsustainable loss ratio for individual disability benefited first quarter results. As a reminder, group life claims were elevated in the year ago quarter negatively impacting results by nearly $10 million. The specialty benefits business is a key growth driver for Principal as our focus on small to medium sized businesses continues to differentiate us in the marketplace. In individual life, mortality experience was within our expectations during the quarter. Total company operating expenses returned to expected levels in the first quarter from an elevated fourth quarter. Our accelerated investment in digital business strategies is on track. Total company operating expenses returned to expected levels in the first quarter from an elevated fourth quarter. Our accelerated investment in digital business strategies is on track. As previously discussed, these digital investments will impact business unit margins throughout the year with benefits beginning to emerge in 2019.","In my following comments on business unit results, I will exclude the significant variances from both periods in my comparisons. Individual life and Principal International pretax operating earnings were in line with our expectations for the quarter. RIS spread and specialty benefits pretax operating earnings were also in line with our expectations after taking into account the favorable mortality and morbidity experience. For RIS spread, opportunities in the pension risk transfer business remain compelling with a very robust sales pipeline. As shown on Slide 6, RIS fees pretax operating earnings were $131 million, down 5% from the prior year quarter. Net revenue increased 4% on a 6% increase in fee revenue, offset by higher operating expenses including investment in the business and higher DAC amortization.","In 2018 we expect DAC amortization run rate of $20 million to $25 million per quarter in RIS fee. This is higher than our previous run rate due to the adoption of revenue recognition guidance and the impacts from the third quarter actuarial review. Importantly, RIS fees underlying business fundamentals remain strong. Compared to a year ago, sales are up 9%, recurring deposits grew 7%, defined contribution plan count increased 2.5% or almost 900 plans and participant count increased 4% with over 190,000 new participants.","Moving to Slide 8, PGI\u2019s pretax operating earnings increased 10% from the prior year period to $110 million reflecting an 8% growth in management fees and disciplined expense management, partially offset by investment in the business. At $42 million, corporate pre-tax operating losses were lower than our expected run-rate. Corporate losses can be volatile in any given quarter and we expect to be within our guided range of $190 million to $210 million for the full year. Our estimated risk-based capital ratio remains above our targeted range of $415 million to $425 million and is slightly higher than our RBC ratio at year end. We intend to keep our ratio elevated until the NAC provides guidance on changes to the RBC formula to reflect U.S. tax reform.","We are currently estimating a negative 40 to 50 percentage point impact to our ratio from this change. During the quarter, we entered into $750 million of contingent capital funding arrangements split between 10 and 30-year tranches. These provide us financial flexibility and access to funds regardless of the economic environment and will not impact our leverage ratio unless drawn upon. The initial and ongoing financing costs are reflected in corporate and were included in our 2018 guidance for corporate pre-tax operating losses. Additionally, Standard & Poor\u2019s recently upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings from triple BBB+ to A-. S&P noted increased access to unregulated dividends from changes in our legal structure.","As shown on Slide 12, we deployed $410 million of capital during the quarter, including $179 million in share repurchases and $147 million in common stock dividends. We also committed $84 million to two planned transactions during the quarter to increase our ownership to 60% in our asset management joint ventures with CIMB and Southeast Asia and to take full ownership of the Principal Punjab National Bank Asset Management Company in India. Both transactions are slated to close in the coming months. On February 20, we closed our acquisition of MetLife\u2019s Afore business. This transaction makes Principal the fifth largest Afore in Mexico in terms of AUM. Integration is on track and progressing as planned. The acquisition will be accretive to earnings in 2018. That said, we are anticipating integration expenses of approximately $6 million to $8 million in the second quarter that will negatively impact PI\u2019s pre-tax margin and pre-tax operating earnings.","On April 16, we closed our acquisition of Internos, which expands our global real estate capabilities. Internos has been renamed Principal Real Estate Europe and will benefit from Principal\u2019s resources and scale. Last night, we announced a $0.52 common stock dividend payable in the second quarter, a 13% increase from a year ago as we continue to target a 40% dividend payout ratio. This is our ninth consecutive quarterly dividend increase reflecting our strong financial position and commitment to increasing long-term shareholder value.","We remain confident in our ability to deploy $900 million to $1.3 billion of capital in 2018. Importantly, we continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth. Excluding the impacts from actuarial reviews, over the last 5 years, we have delivered an 11% compounded annual growth rate and non-GAAP operating earnings well within our long-term target of 9% to 12%.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. So I had a few questions. First on the PGI business, it seems like your fee income and overall earnings were weaker than we would have assumed, I think fees were flat sequentially, they were up on a year-over-year basis, but less than the increase in the market our asset growth would have suggested. So I just wanted to see if you had any comments on that? And then secondly, go ahead actually.","Dan Houston","No, no, no please go ahead and finish your second question, Jimmy.","Jimmy Bhullar","So the other question was on share buyback, so I think you ended up buying back more stock this quarter than you have on a quarterly basis in the last several years. So not sure if you did that because last quarter you didn\u2019t buyback anything or was it because the stock price declined and you wanted to be more proactive and if that is the reason then should we assume that if the price stays beaten down you would be more active with the buybacks than you have been in the recent years?","Dan Houston","So let me pick up on your second question first and then I will throw it to Jim to weigh in on the PGI fee income. Like you would expect Jimmy we always look at all the options on how we go about deploying our capital and where we stand with the potential acquisitions in the queue. And I would say that again on a very deliberate basis looking at all of our options we felt because we have the authorization for the share buyback. It was a good opportunity for us to do so as you might expect. That still \u2013 there is still some remaining for the second and third quarter, obviously that we have to complete that. And we have got a Board meeting coming up here in May, which will have continued conversations with the Board on next steps relative to share buybacks. But again the dividend having increased, good deployment of capital, good organic growth, nice acquisitions, all tuck-ins, so we feel like again we have got really balanced approach to capital deployment. With that, I will throw it Jim to hit on your PGI fee income question. Jim?","Jim McCaughan","Thank you the question Jimmy. Just as contact, the first thing to point out is the risk quite a lot of seasonality in our quarter-to-quarter numbers. As the guideline for profitability typically 22% to 23% of the year comes in the first quarter and 27% to 28% comes in the fourth quarter. And one of the reasons for this seasonality on revenues, partly driven by the U.S. tax year, driven also by accounting years in decision making process. The first quarter tends to be a bit low on transaction fees. It tends to be very low on incentive fees, which tend to be clustered in the fourth quarter. So I would argue that the 10% or 10.4% increase in profits, over 8% increase in management fees from the year ago quarter is a better measure and more appropriate measure of the progress we have made, because that takes out the effect of seasonal adjustment. The other thing of course is that the expenses are seasonal, but you didn\u2019t go into that, but if anyone wants me to I can. But I don\u2019t think that this was at all a disappointing first quarter and its well aligned with what we have said in the past in guidance.","Dan Houston","Is that helpful Jimmy?","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Yes. And then maybe one more, I am not sure if Luis is on the call, but it seems like the environment in the Chilean business has gotten a little the better with the election and talk of sort of drastic pension reform subsiding, so is that your view as well and then what you will reduced fees in the business, I think they are going into effect in 3Q, how should we expect that to impact your results in the second half versus your\u2026?","Dan Houston","Thank you. You might just squeezed in three and four questions there, but Luis is here and they are really relevant questions and certainly prepared respond. But as you pointed out Chile is rebounding and it\u2019s we remain optimistic, but Luis?","Luis Valdes","Yes. Good morning, Jimmy. A fair question about Chilean pension reform, which is pending, since March 11 we have a new administration there, we value the birth and the death of its new cabinet. Good names, very professional, very technical, so the discussion is heading in the right direction. I would say they always said a working group that has been created with very good names as well, very \u2013 I would say professional people, very dedicated, good in patience in this discussion. So we are very optimistic about the kind of the outcome that we might have, only possible factor that might be very little of these discussions when the new bill is going to have the Congress. The current administration [indiscernible] may redeem both chambers, so fairly it\u2019s sort of a kind of [indiscernible] might happen there. So we have to be a lot of extremely involved in that process Jimmy. So, we are paying a lot of attention about that, but as you have said the positive and better environment in order to have this discussion in Chile. Above the fee reduction [indiscernible] essentially the result of our gains in productivity and efficiency that allows us to transfer that benefit to our customers. We continue keeping our value proposition there to our clients and customer service, financial advice and investment performance. So we are going to continue being a very competitive a fee there. And as you said this new fee rate is going to be in place on July 1. And certainly you can think about that as a very subtle fee adjustment in Chile.","Dan Houston","Thanks for your question.","Jimmy Bhullar","And that was part of your guidance? It was a part of your guidance, the fee adjustment.","Luis Valdes","Yes, sir.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay.","Luis Valdes","We are expecting that this reaction is not going to impact our margins neither in Chile nor in [indiscernible].","Jimmy Bhullar","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just the questions related to expenses, especially in RIS fees, so I understand that this sort of initiative is supposed to pose a kind of 2% earnings impact in 2018 on a pre-tax reform basis. So, I would assume that\u2019s probably closer to $50 million on a pre-tax basis. So, you talked about you have accelerated some of the additional investments in the fourth quarter and then there is going to be some ongoing expenses in the first quarter. But I was just trying to figure out like where you stand in terms of these investments in RIS fees? And then on top of it that there seems to be some moving pieces in the expenses line in this quarter and I was just wondering if you can provide some additional color in terms of where do you think the expenses will be kind of for the rest of the year?","Dan Houston","Yes, Humphrey, so thank you for that. I am going to \u2013 the broad comment I am going to make before thrown into Deanna is that we are actually incredibly enthusiastic about these investments in digital. We are getting some traction. We are seeing it materialize here with \u2013 as you know, we started in the fourth quarter. We are well into it in the first quarter here and we are starting to see progress made and I am frankly very excited about that, but with regards to the specifics, let me throw it to Deanna.","Deanna Strable","Thanks, Humphrey. I think what would work best is if I talk about our expenses in total for the company and then Nora could add a few comments specifically to RIS fee. And so the first thing I would say is when I have dug into our first quarter expenses for the company in total, they were not significantly different than what we expected. We have always talked about a goal to align the growth in expenses to our growth in revenue, but as we have also discussed, it\u2019s very critical that we balanced that with investments in the business, because those investment has served us well up to this point and will continue to serve us well on driving long-term growth. I think it\u2019s also important to recognize that there is seasonality to expenses. Some of that Jim just talked about fourth quarter is always our highest expense quarter and first quarter tends to be our second highest quarter due to items such as PGI payroll taxes and overall variable compensation tends to be a little bit higher in the first quarter as well. If you would go back to first quarter of \u201817 we did state that expenses were light in that quarter primarily due to timing. And this quarter as you mentioned we did include \u2013 our total expenses does include the impact of those digital investments. And so given that you would have expected this quarter to see a slightly higher increase in expenses again due to low in first quarter of \u201817 and the additional investments this quarter. I tend to look at kind of growth in expenses in revenue over a longer time period, but even if you just look at first quarter \u201818 versus first quarter \u201817 our comp and other was up 4.9%, that\u2019s in line with our net revenue growth on a reported basis, but if you actually adjust net revenue for [indiscernible], that compares to an 8% increase in net revenue.","Specific to digital, we did have some digital in fourth quarter, but much more significant in the first quarter. As you mentioned, we said on the outlook call that would impact our pre-tax operating earnings growth about 2% and you did a very accurate calculation to get to a dollar amount of expenses that we might expect in 2018. Our first quarter spend was very aligned with that and we don\u2019t expect anything different for the full year different than what we told you on that outlook call. The spend is spread throughout all of the segments and benefits will begin to emerge in 2019. So, I think bottom line it feels like our expenses in the first quarter are aligned with what we have talked about in the past and I will pivot to Nora to see if she has any additional comments specific to RIS fee.","Nora Everett","Yes. So, Deanna has covered very well both RIS fee and at the PFG level, so I won\u2019t repeat that, but just to give you a little flavor for the investments that we are making in to Deanna\u2019s point really excited about in RIS fee. We are not just talking about technology, but we are also talking about customer experience and that\u2019s at the planned sponsor employer level, that\u2019s at the planned participant level. That\u2019s a digital experience that we want to have with our advisors. So, we are really looking at this when we say digital or when you say technology. We have a number of really critical audiences that we are investing and building that digital experience around, so really excited about that for the long haul. And in addition to that we have really looked our game around our marketing and marketing spend, so those things are investments back in the business. They give us the confidence that we are going to continue to lead, have the leading franchiser here with regard to both top line and bottom line growth.","Dan Houston","Thanks Nora. Humphrey, did you have a follow-up?","Humphrey Lee","Yes, I do. So kind of shifting gear to PGI a little bit, so when I am actually looking at the management fee pass-through, we are kind of looking at the kind of year-over-year basis is definitely showing some improvement as well as on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I suspect that\u2019s because some of the mix shift going on within PGI, but I was just wondering if Jim can talk about a little bit more on the fees of that you are getting from the inflows versus the outflows and kind of how we should think about the fee rate improvement as the underlying earnings driver as opposed to the AUM growth in for PGI?","Dan Houston","Yes. Very much depends on those asset classes and there was a good story there, Jim.","Jim McCaughan","Yes, thank you, Humphrey. And this links back to some of the comments Dan made in his remarks about us being well aligned with the places where revenue growth is happening. If you look at the asset management industry, there is a lot of money flowing into passive and active core players. But they are seeing declining revenue, that\u2019s really being hit very hard by the demand for lower pricing. And as you know that\u2019s not the area we are primarily in. We are in active specialties alternatives and multi-asset class solutions and so far we feel confident about revenue growth. And it\u2019s interesting I know it\u2019s in the back of people\u2019s mind how bad can this hedging effect get. I would point back to the second quarter of last year when we had a similar outflow because of hedging costs. In that case it was both euro and yen hedging costs. And I did remark in that call that I felt much more confident about revenues than I did about future flows at that point. I still feel that way because we are in areas where probably the average basis points can go up because of the change of mix. And this is things like real estate, like high yield, like small cap and emerging markets. Those are areas where we are really quite strong and have actually even in a fairly tough first quarter decent flows. So yes, Jimmy I think the main \u2013 sorry Humphrey, I think the main point here I would make is that we are well placed to continue that revenue growth. Almost, we are not quite regardless with the flows, the flows will turn positive again. I have a little doubt about that given our execution and our performance. But having said that I think the mix is a very important attribute that we have to be a growing revenue earner in the asset management business.","Dan Houston","Humphrey thanks for your questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Bass of Autonomous Research.","Eric Bass","Hi. Thank you. I guess to start maybe just follow-up on Humphrey\u2019s questions on the revenue picture for PGI and obviously the fee pressures you have mentioned that institutional may the actions you are taking to deal with those, I mean are those all contemplated in the kind of 4% to 8% revenue target for 2018 and the 5% to 8% long-term growth outlook, so do you think those targets are still achievable?","Dan Houston","We actually do. We think they are still well in those range, we don\u2019t reaffirm. But I would say that we anticipate these things in advance and I feel comfortable that 4% to 8%.","Jim McCaughan","Yes. The industry is seeing very heavy disruption. The very difficult environment for passive and active core players is playing out almost exactly as we expected, so no need to change the guidance for that.","Eric Bass","Got it. Thank you. And then maybe moving to RIS fee, you could just talk about the impact of equity markets on your margins there and I know you commented specifically on the DAC I think in the prepared remarks, but should we think about the midpoint of the 30% to 34% guidance range for the year being based on the 8% equity market return assumption or is this too simplistic?","Dan Houston","I don\u2019t think that\u2019s overly simplistic and this was kind of a wild quarter because of the right to think that again the way we get compensated on the revenues are as on a daily basis. And we saw that was roughly up 5%, while if you look at the point to point it was minus one, which does have an impact on the DAC line. But I think the assumptions that you are using are our spot-on. Nora, would you like to add to that at all?","Nora Everett","Yes. And so if you look at our fee revenue line, the vast majority of that fee is based on account value and clearly given our portfolio, we are going to lift and fall based on the equity markets, but with the assumption baked in, we are absolutely confident with regard to that margin guidance.","Dan Houston","Did you have a follow-up?","Eric Bass","No, that\u2019s helpful. So just it\u2019s right sort of the midpoint as to where that 8% would fallout?","Dan Houston","Right. Exactly.","Eric Bass","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Dan Houston","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Barnidge of Sandler O'Neill.","John Barnidge","Thank you. There have been a thought that post-tax reform, there would be a wave of wage inflation and some benefits inflation in the U.S. employment for us. Given your small to middle market positioning the thought that you could benefit, it seems like the defined contribution number of plans has ticked up, specialty benefit sales are strong, can you possibly talk about how you are seeing that in your various different businesses so far this year?","Dan Houston","Yes. So, maybe I will have both Amy and Nora weigh in on that, but to your point, there is also a second element of that and that is what\u2019s the impact on Principal itself from wage inflation and the impact it might have on our expenses? And what I would say is I again think we have \u2013 we start from a very credible place from wage base. We have always tried to maintain that positioning. And it\u2019s true with our benefit \u2013 it\u2019s true with our wages and it\u2019s true in trying to create the right environment, which probably changed the most for us is the need to go out and recruit talent that tends to be at the higher end of the spectrum. So more hiring of people with data scientist backgrounds and some of our digital efforts will come with talent that has a higher wage and if that\u2019s impacting Principal, I have to believe other firms are running into that same sort of situation. Well, with that, let me throw to Amy for some additional comments.","Amy Friedrich","Sure, hi, John. Let me give you a couple of perspectives on this. First perspective is, I think we have said before and we are still seeing it happen there is employment growth that is particularly pronounced and positive in the small markets. So, when we isolate out those cases that are in that smaller market for us, maybe employers who employ less than 200 people were seeing a trailing 12-month kind of employment number go up to about 2.3% in terms of that in-group growth, so very healthy metric and that has stayed healthy even post-tax reform. One of the interesting things we are seeing in the marketplace post-tax reform is that we are a market that is near kind of full employment. And so we see small employers asking us about interesting new benefits more than they have even in the past. So leaning into those ancillary benefits with the secondary benefits asking questions about short-term disability and long-term disability when they previously maybe hadn\u2019t looked at some of those coverages before. Certainly, there is also interest in accident and critical illness. In the other pieces of the portfolio that can be a really interesting add-on that can attract a workforce. So, Dan talked about that workforce piece. That\u2019s really what we are seeing as well is they are trying to get an attractive benefits package out there for that extended workforce that is really competitive right now.","Dan Houston","Nora, some additional comments?","Amy Friedrich","Yes. So, certainly, we are benefiting from those \u2013 from the job and the wage growth in RIS fee in our full service retirement business in particular, which is why you see those strong recurring deposit growth, up 7% quarter-over-quarter, why you see this growth not just in participants, up 4%, but also participants with account value. We see employers lifting their match both including the match for the first time and lifting the match, so you see as the positives happen with job and wage growth, we see it coming in through that fundamental growth in our business, which lifts all boats.","Dan Houston","Jim, I think you have some perspective here.","Jim McCaughan","Yes, John. Just to comment from the economics point of view, we have been looking for the last 2 or 3 years of the aggregate data for our customers are small and midsized business customers. And I would tell you very much aligned with your question about a year or two ago, we saw the wage rates in that area going up faster than the economy as a whole. I think that shows partly the phenomenon you are talking about rescaling, upscaling labor shortage I think it also shows a very good proof statement on the fundamental strength of the small and midsized growing business segment.","Dan Houston","Yes, last comment John before I say if you have a follow-up. When I think about Amy\u2019s business around the business owner executive solutions and nonqualified deferred compensation again an area where it was disrupted by tax reform, it actually has been disrupted in a positive way and we are seeing nice growth there too. So any follow-up questions John?","John Barnidge","Sure, that would be great. Could you talk about the pipeline and market environment for PRT transactions in the last several months since the MetLife material weakness charge and what you are hearing or seeing from a regulatory perspective as well in that market? Thank you very much for your answers.","Dan Houston","Thank you so much. Nora?","Nora Everett","Sure. So in our pension risk transfer business, 1Q was a little light on sales, but we are extremely confident with regard to the pipeline that we see both in the industry, I mean the industry as you probably know is expecting close to $20 billion to $25 billion of opportunity this year. I mean certainly in our pipeline we see that opportunity. So where last year we had record sales of $2.8 billion, we would expect to be looking at that same type of number this year even with that little softer first quarter, because of that industry volume and in particular our opportunities within that $5 million to $500 million space. With regard you asked about from a regulatory perspective, we don\u2019t have concerns from that perspective. We talked about that on the last call. We are confident that we are reserved, appropriately reserved and certainly we have significant processes and oversight around lost policyholders. So from that perspective, we will continue to monitor expectations. But from that perspective we are highly confident that we have both the reserve in place and the process in place.","John Barnidge","Thanks Nora.","Dan Houston","Great. Thank you.","Operator","So our next question comes from Ryan Krueger of KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question was can you give a sense for how much AUM you have in these currency affected fixed income strategies with lower basis point yields at this point?","Dan Houston","Yes. Jim please?","Jim McCaughan","Yes. The direct number is dominated by the point that Dan made about being a few billion still with the client that we lost money for in the first quarter. I think that\u2019s in terms of what we really know, just about the extent of it. What you don\u2019t know is how to choose to currency hedging can evolve with institution. And as you know we have very broad range of clients in 85 countries. Some of those countries will definitely see rising or indeed falling hedging costs. The problem has been that yen and euro interest rates are pinned to zero at he same time as the U.S. rates is rising. That\u2019s really the differential that\u2019s determined for hedging cost. So what I would say is it\u2019s really in the near-term doesn\u2019t look like a big problem, but longer term we have to be wary about our foreign investors are investing in U.S. securities and choose to hedge it. There comes a time when either for their economics or for their accounting that begins to look like advantageous to buy U.S. securities. But I think there are natural tensions that will stop the interest rates getting massively out of line. So I don\u2019t feel particularly concerned about that beyond the large client that Dan referred to in the script.","Dan Houston","Sure, Ryan the comment in my comments earlier were roughly $3 billion. And again we don\u2019t think there is a lot outside of that egg to a hedging strategy. Hopefully, that\u2019s helpful?","Ryan Krueger","It is. Thanks. And then other question was can you give some more color on Southeast Asia flows that picked up materially and what\u2019s driving that?","Dan Houston","Yes. It really did and we are really excited about that. Luis, do you want to provide some additional insights.","Luis Valdes","Yes. Thanks Ryan for your questions. Certainly our activity in Asia is doing much, much better and we are very pleased about that, flows in Southeast Asia, $800 million in Thailand, in particular clearly for mandates. So we are very pleased about that and certainly a very strong activity in Malaysia, so that\u2019s the reason of why. But it\u2019s a very consistent about what we have been planning Southeast Asia and very consistent with our plans for 2018 in fact.","Dan Houston","Thank you, Ryan.","Ryan Krueger","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Nadel of UBS.","John Nadel","Hey, good morning everybody. I have a couple of questions, the first one Dan or Deanna, the total capital deployment range for this year, I know it\u2019s not really that different from prior years, but the range is still kind of wide, so if I think about what are the external factors or maybe even internal factors that you see are most critical that would move you from the lower end of that deployment range to the upper end?","Dan Houston","Sure. Happy to take first shot at that and then turn it to Deanna that $900 million to $1.3 billion is again you start off at the beginning of the year, you want to leave yourself a bit of light burst we have been on the record to say that the 40% payout of net income which we know has some variability would certainly impact the funding level and have an impact on where it hits within that range. I think the organic growth, we can get pretty close on that one in terms of how we are going to deploy the capital there, but again in that pension risk transfer business, you can use up additional capital. I would say that in the area of acquisitions again, would it make sense and it\u2019s accretive and we can be opportunistic around capabilities and scale. We want to go after that. That\u2019s probably the largest variable here and of course as we all know the one way we can fill in at the end is relative to share buyback if the opportunity is there and it really fits with our internal model. So, I think it\u2019s purposely a bit wide to give us a bit more flexibility for making good decisions, but Deanna, additional thoughts?","Deanna Strable","Yes. I think Dan hit it on. I think you know the dividend piece is probably pretty easy for you to estimate and the two that would tend to be more volatile and could end up different than maybe what we thought at the beginning of the year would be around M&A and share buyback. Obviously, share buyback is going to be dependent as we have said on other deployment opportunities as well as valuation. But I think we have a long history of being within or above really what we have stated going into the year, obviously first quarter is a great start relative to that. But those would be the two of the items that would tend to cause us to be at different places within that range.","Dan Houston","John, do you have a follow-up?","John Nadel","Yes, I do. Thank you for the answers to that. I am curious thinking about the group insurance business than going back to the days where tax reform was sort of first discussed or floated. I think Principal was probably one of the first to actually stay pretty specifically that there is an expectation that, that would pass through to the through sales and premium rates pretty quickly such that after-tax margins before reform and after reform would probably look pretty similar. I guess I am curious given the beginning of the year is such a critical part for sales in the group insurance business whether you are already seeing that come through or is it just a little bit too soon?","Dan Houston","What\u2019s your take on that, Amy?","Amy Friedrich","Yes. It\u2019s a little bit too soon. And really why I think I am so comfortable kind of talking about this unique to Principal is because when you look at our group benefits business so much of the business we have is on a 1 year rate guarantee. So compared to a lot of our competitors when we are really actively re-pricing every single year and looking at the health of our business and doing the appropriate studies every quarter and every year we tend to really move things into our block, maybe even a bit more quickly than some of our peer competitors. So, I think their answers can be accurate, but again it\u2019s given their own block. So, a little bit early, but again, we have a high percentage of our block that is annually renewable.","Deanna Strable","John, the other thing I would mention is there is obviously two impacts on pricing relative to tax reform. I think the one that you are focused on is obviously the lowering of the effective tax rate and group benefits and PGI are likely are two businesses within the complex that benefited the most from that. But the other thing it can ignore is that our NAC is contemplating a change in capital requirements that would increase the capital that is needed to back our businesses. And so really as we think about pricing, we need to take into account both of those. I still agree with Amy\u2019s comment that for group benefits this is probably likely a net positive, but we got to make sure we are understanding both of those impacts not just the effective tax rate change.","Dan Houston","Thanks for your questions, John.","John Nadel","Yes, very much appreciate that. Thank you.","Dan Houston","Very good.","Operator","Your next question comes from Suneet Kamath of Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Good morning. Just on RIS fee, can you give us a sense of what percentage of the account value is in passive options at this point and then how that compares to kind of the new deposits that you are getting? Is there a big difference between those two?","Dan Houston","Yes, that\u2019s a good question. Nora, you got those specifics?","Nora Everett","Yes. And I don\u2019t have the specifics, but generally, we have a meaningful portion of that portfolio that has been \u2013 has always been in path. So \u2013 and as we have flows into our CIT Hybrid, the percentage of passive will go up on a relative basis? And what was your second question, Suneet.","Suneet Kamath","It was the comparison of the new business versus before and if we can follow-up if you don\u2019t have that information?","Nora Everett","Sure. Yes, we can follow-up with specifics, but directionally because of their really strong flows into our target dates we \u2013 and extremely strong flows into the hybrid product within the target dates we will see an increase in the underlying account value with regard to passive options, so we will give you the specifics on that.","Dan Houston","Yes. Suneet just as a franchise if we will look at for example as a representative sample of customer global investors about 85% of the assets under management are active, 15% are passive. If you look at the revenues it\u2019s 97% of the revenues coming from, the active 3% coming from the passive. And I think maybe to reorient your question just a little bit and Nora touched on it, it is necessarily a pure passive target date strategies they are looking for. They are looking for a lower cost strategy and that\u2019s where the CITs that are being manufactured by PGI have become sort of the primary vehicle for providing active management at a lower cost. And as you know from our performance numbers, they are very competitive in the marketplace. So that\u2019s really become our work horse as opposed to a passive option like an S&P 500 simply being available on the platform because those target date strategies are going to capture work from third to half while those flows into the plans in the first place. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful.","Suneet Kamath","Yes. It really does. And then I guess my second question might be a little bit strategic, but as I think about your RIS fee business, it\u2019s I think almost entirely 401(k) at different employer sizes and when I look across at some of your competitors there seems to be a blend of the 401(k), 457, 403(b) and I guess I am just curious why is it that you guys haven\u2019t participated in some of those tax-exempt markets where I think the returns might be a little higher on the ROE basis, is that that you are just not setup that way or is there some reason why you haven\u2019t taken advantage of that part of the market?","Dan Houston","Good question. Nora, do you want to take that one?","Nora Everett","Yes. Actually Suneet, we are quite active in the 403(b) market, the tax exempt market, if \u2013 it\u2019s a priority for us from a strategic perspective. But we play in that space in particular in the employer sponsored plans versus the legacy chassis around an individual annuity model. So that is not part of our strategy. But we certainly, if you think about our total retirement suite, both with the DB and the non-qual or a tax exempt organization, we bring the entire suite to them. So we are a meaningful player and you can call it the 403(b) space, but it\u2019s actually the tax exempt market where we bring 403(b) as one of the tools, but in addition to that bring the DB and non-qual etcetera. As far as the 457 market that\u2019s a pretty unique market and that is not a focus for us under our current strategy. But for sure we are in the tax exempt market in a meaningful way.","Dan Houston","Just a couple, just a quick, I have one there for just a couple of moments. The 457 also tends to be quite large. These are generally municipalities always owe to bid if you will. The kind of low bid gets the deal. And I am not talking about investment options there I am talking about all the other record keeping services. And if you think about how we have oriented our investments around digital, the customer experience is to really try to help employers attract or retain talent or it\u2019s really state-of-the-art solutions. And that may not be quite as recognized by the buyers in the 457. In that 403(b) market that Nora was describing it\u2019s based upon individual annuities, but sometimes can come up a little bit higher price, some of that is driven by the fact that a lot of those assets tend to get driven into a guaranteed account which speaks to the higher revenue rates that you are referring to in your comments. Did you have a follow-up?","Suneet Kamath","No, it\u2019s alright. Thanks.","Dan Houston","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning, first one for Jim, just on flows for PGI, I know you have highlighted the $3 billion currency overlay mandate being at risk, but can you comment I guess just a little more broadly how you see things playing out for the next couple of quarters here, the $6 billion of outflows was kind of startling from just because we haven\u2019t really seen that level of net outflows at PGI before, do you think we would hit a high watermark there and I realized some of those are low fee, but just from an absolute standpoint do you think \u2013 how do you see that looking over the next few quarters?","Dan Houston","Please go ahead Jim.","Jim McCaughan","Yes. Thanks for the question Tom. First thing to say is that we do see a pretty strong pipeline and it\u2019s a pipeline including some quite good rich revenue mandates. Also incidentally, if you think longer term, some of them with promote structures are multiyear carriers which definitely builds up the value of the business for the longer term. So, on that piece, I feel really confident. I think we are positioned very effectively. I think the performance should make us confident on our retail platforms. Our retail platforms last year between 40 Act ETFs, CITs, uses an SMA and others had a very substantial, very steady $4 million and change last year of inflows and remained positive in the first quarter. So, that\u2019s sort of building up business by gradual flows and I feel very good about that.","Dan Houston","I don\u2019t want to go, come down and make a very tight prediction about what happens as a result of currency hedging, particularly in the developed world. I think that there is still risk and that is the risk for all large asset managers. But I take some comfort from the fact that even in those hedged markets, we have things like real estate debt, we have high yields, we have REITs, we have income biased strategies, which have a high enough expected return to absorb the current hedging costs or even any likely hedging cost. So, I feel cautiously optimistic, but I don\u2019t want to promise you that this is going to be our only bad quarter foreclosed.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, that\u2019s good. Yes, thanks Dan. So, I guess my follow-ups Nora, can you talk a bit about fee compression in 401(k), I guess your revenue yield was down a little bit this quarter, but how do you see and I think every 1Q you see a little bit of that I presume maybe that\u2019s just simple re-pricing and I know \u2013 I think there is a fewer one less fee day in the quarter. But can you talk more broadly about what\u2019s going on there? I think you mentioned the vast majority of your fees are based on AUM, can you quantify it all? How much are actually based on non-AUM factors like per participant and is that changing at all?","Deanna Strable","Sure. So, Tom, we have got the vast majority of our full service business is tied to account value, very small amount which would not be tied to account value, so that\u2019s number one. Number two to your point on a sequential we definitely saw the impact of some re-pricing 1:1 around our investment portfolio so that sequential drop was fewer days, but also some re-pricing. But to your prior question and we talked about this before, we certainly and this is industry not just Principal, but there has been a longstanding trend, where we expect to see this gap between account value growth and revenue growth and we have generally talked 4% to 8%, sometimes it will be more, sometimes it will be less quarter-to-quarter can be noisy, because of revenue timing, but if you look at overall product mix, if you look at overall asset mix, if you look at competitive pricing, that is certainly impacting this gap, which is the discussion we have been having. So, there are no surprises here to us with regard to the results. The underlying growth of the business is extremely strong. So, what you see there \u2013 when you see that lift in recurring deposits, when you see the lift that we have talked about planned count, participant count, etcetera that is extremely strong and that is what\u2019s going to drive the growth of this business.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks.","Dan Houston","Thank you.

Welcome to Principal Financial Group's second quarter conference call. As always, materials related to today's call are available on our website at principal.com\/investor. Following the reading of the Safe Harbor provision CEO, Dan Houston and CFO, Deanna Strable will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A session include Renee Schaaf, Retirement and Income Solutions, Tim Dunbar, Global Asset Management, Luis Valdes, Principal International, and Amy Friedrich, U.S. Insurance Solutions.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Dan?","Dan Houston","Thanks, John and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning, I'll share some performance highlights and accomplishments that position us for continued growth. Deanna will follow with details on our financial results and capital deployment. In the second quarter, we delivered $427 million of non-GAAP operating earnings, an increase of 9% compared to a year ago quarter. This brings non-GAAP operating earnings to $827 million through six months. As I reflect on the first half of the year, we continue to demonstrate strong business fundamentals, balance investments in our businesses with expense discipline, and be good stewards of shareholder capital.","Importantly, we continue to execute our customer-focused solutions oriented strategy as we expanded our global distribution network an array of retirement, investment, and protection solutions. And advance our digital business strategies creating a better customer experience, while gaining operational efficiencies. Compared to a year ago, total company reported assets under management or AUM, increased $30 billion or 4% to a record $696 billion. As a reminder, China isn't included in our reported AUM. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, AUM in our China joint venture is up 2% compared to a year ago with $147 billion at midyear.","This increase is despite $7 billion of negative net cash flow in the current quarter, as investor demand has shifted towards equities. As previously discussed, the vast majority of our AUM in China is in the money market funds. Under our total company basis, we had $2 billion of negative net cash flow in the second quarter as positive net cash flow for the Retirement and Income Solutions in Principal International was more than offset by withdrawals from Principal Global Investors.","Excluding the large withdrawal in PGI previously communicated, total company net cash flow would have been positive. RIS delivered $2 billion of net cash flow, its sixth consecutive positive quarter. This was driven by continued strong sales, retention, and reoccurring deposit growth in our ISP. And record second quarter pension risk transfer sales in RIS spread.","Over the trailing 12 months RIS has delivered over $9 billion of positive net cash flow, an increase of more than 250% compared to the same period a year ago. Principal International generated $600 million of net cash flow. Its 43rd consecutive positive quarter. Primarily driven by improving flows in Brazil. Net cash flow is being pressured in most of the countries in which we operate. But we remain confident in our opportunities for growth, with our involvement in the private pension reform discussions around the world, we see increasing recognition by governments of the importance of voluntary savings, and the benefit of using asset managers to improve long-term returns.","Moving to PGI, source net cash flow was negative $4.3 billion. As discussed last quarter, we had a single international client withdrawal $3.2 billion during the second quarter. The client has continued to award and fund additional mandates with us reflecting the ongoing strength of this relationship.","Slide 5 highlights the continued recent improvement in our investment performance. At the end of the second quarter for our Morningstar rated funds 88% of the fund level AUM had a four or five star rating. And 83% of our Principal actively managed mutual funds, ETFs, separate accounts and collective investment trusts, were above median for the five year performance.","While the asset management industry and PGI continues to experience pressure, we're pleased with our headway on multiple fronts to drive sales growth and improved retention, particularly in the areas of distribution and new product development. We continue to add key distribution resources and we're building out our business intelligence to help inform our sales process, positioning us for increasing success in key institutional, and retail markets.","Other progress in the second quarter included the launch of more than a dozen new investment strategies across our U.S and international platforms. Of particular note, Principal Global Investors continue to expand its leading suite of income oriented investments. We launched our first interval fund, the Principal diversified select real asset Fund, which primarily invest in private real estate, infrastructure, and natural resources. The launch reflects principles commitment to addressing growing client demand for access to private assets, the line with longer-term investment goals, as well as offers potential for enhanced risk-adjusted returns and Income through various market cycles.","Additionally, during the quarter, the Education Trust Board of New Mexico, selected Principal Global Investors to provide investment management services for its scholars Edge 529 plan. This demonstrates our ability to leverage our retirement and investment expertise to help participants achieve their educational savings goals. Funding is expected to occur in the fourth quarter 2019, and we will manage the majority of the assets in the plan.","This along with a strong pipeline, gives us confidence in delivering strong net cash flow in PGI in the second half of the year. Through mid-year we've earned more than 50 total placements, with more than 30 different offerings on more than 20 different platforms. This reflects continued strong interest in our specially, solution-oriented and alternative capabilities, and our continued success in getting these investment options added to third party distribution platforms recommended list, and model portfolios. I'll now share some additional execution highlights. Starting with our acquisition of Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement & Trust businesses or IRT, which closed on July 1.","As a reminder, as of the end of 2018. This business had more than $825 billion of assets under administration, across several retirement and non-retirement products including defined contribution, defined benefit, non-qualified executive benefits, trust in custody, and institutional asset advisory. The acquisition again is clearly strategic, further enabling us to capitalize on one of the largest opportunities in financial services.","The US retirement savings and retirement income markets, it doubles the size of our U.S retirement businesses. But more importantly, it improves our ability to serve customers, reinforces our commitment to the retirement industry, and enables us to create new value in the marketplace by combining the strengths of both business models, technology platforms, and teams clearly will benefit from adding scale, and from new complementary capabilities such as non-retirement trust in custody. We'll also benefit from accessing the highly talented Wells Fargo IRT team, and their strong relationships with intermediaries. As announced in June, we've established a unified leadership team to drive the business forward.","We've also established a transition services agreement designed to help us drive strong retention by minimizing disruption to clients by keeping all services the same on day one, thoughtfully and collaboratively, identifying the best products, services and platforms within both business models, as well as providing ample notice to customers of planned enhancements over time. The acquisition has been received positively by the Wells Fargo IRT employees and clients as well as by the consultant and adviser communities. We welcome and look forward to serving our new customers, and working with our new employees, advisors, and consultants.","We'll continue to provide progress updates throughout this multi-year integration. As additional highlights in our U.S Retirement business, we launched impact 401k during the quarter to deliver best in class resources at a competitive price, and drive positive retirement outcomes for small and medium-sized businesses and their employees. We also launched enrolling educate, our first of its kind self service educational model co-designed in partnership with our clients.","And we launched health savings account integration with Healthy Equity and Optum bank to give customers a more holistic picture of their retirement outlook, and make it easier for participants to manage their financial goals. In our protection businesses while we've had strong performance, we've continued to invest in our initiatives that make us easier to do business with.","During the quarter, we announced a digital collaboration with Limelight Health to streamline the quoting, rating, and renewal processes for group employee benefits. This technology will help us better serve brokers, and employers, and reach more employers and employees, in the small to medium-sized business market. Lastly, I'll share some key developments outside the U.S that demonstrates our focus on providing a better customer experience.","In Mexico, we launched a digital on boarding solution for mutual fund customers to simplify the process, and enabled us to deliver a personalized Retirement recommendation. In Chile, we launched a new app and a website for our customers, providing a more consistent experience, gold-based functionality, and access to a broader set of products. The Cuprum App reached 80,000 downloads in just 60 days, and is highly rated in the AFP marketplace. In India, we now have a fully digital end-to-end experience enabling customers to make smaller, but more frequent mutual fund investments. This aligns with our direct to consumer strategy in India, and reflects our commitment to make saving for retirement easier.","During the second quarter as part of our growing commitment to Southeast Asia, we rebranded our joint venture asset management operations in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore. We're proud of our long-term alliance with CIMB, and excited to help even more people in the region, and around the world achieved financial security and success.","Deanna will cover in a more detail, but I want to again emphasize our balanced approach to capital deployment. In addition to ongoing investment in organic growth, through mid-year, we've deployed more than $1.6 billion of capital in total. We've committed $1.2 billion to the Wells Fargo IRT acquisition, and we returned $430 million to investors through common stock dividends and share buybacks. I also share some noteworthy third party recognition for the quarter.","In our global asset management franchise, Principal Hong Kong was recognized by Lipper, with the best Hong Kong MPF over three-year award for the Principal China equity fund. In Chile, we were recognized by Morningstar as the best Equity Fund Manager 2018, and the best Latin American Equity Fund 2018.","Additionally, Forbes named Principal, one of America's best large employers, Forbes also ranked Principal number five overall in their list of Best Employers for women, and number one within the banking and financial services category, along with the first quarter recognition for our commitment to diversity, inclusion, and ethical behavior, this speaks volumes about our culture. A quick thank you to our customers as we celebrate our 140th anniversary this month, and to our employees, and retirees for living the core values that remains foundational to our success.","In closing, second quarter was a period of continued progress, helping customers and clients achieve financial security and success. I look for us to continue to build momentum in the second half of 2019, and for that momentum to translate into long-term value for our shareholders and stakeholders. Deanna?","Deanna Strable","Thanks, Dan. Good morning and thank you for participating on our call. Today, I'll discuss key contributors to our second quarter financial results, and provide an update on capital deployment. Net income attributable to Principal was $386 million for the second quarter including credit impairments of $13 million. Net income is $70 million lower than the prior year quarter, which benefited $100 million from the sale of an equity method investment. Reported non-GAAP operating earnings were $427 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, an increase of 13% from second quarter 2018.","Our non-GAAP operating earnings effective tax rate was 17% for the second quarter within our 2019 guided range of 16% to 20%. We continue to expect to be within the guided range for the full year. ROE excluding AOCI, other than foreign currency translation adjustment, was 13.6% on a reported basis. Second quarter non-GAAP pretax operating earnings included four significant variances resulting in a net benefit of $27 million. This includes $25 million of higher than expected variable investment income.","Higher prepayment fees and real estate returns were partially offset by lower returns from alternative. Impacts by business unit include $15 million in RIS-Spread, $5 million in specialty benefits, $3 million in individual life, and $2 million in RIS-Fee. A $7 million net benefit in Principal International with $10 million of higher than expected [indiscernible] performance, partially offset by $3 million of lower than expected inflation both in Latin America.","A $6 million benefit in RIS-Fee, from lower DAC amortization from favorable point-to-point equity market performance. And $11 million of elevated compensation and other expenses, including $9 million in corporate, primarily Wells Fargo IRT transaction costs and $2 million of integration costs in RIS-Fee. Looking at macroeconomic factors, the positive momentum we saw in the equity markets during the first quarter continued in the second quarter.","The S&P 500 index increased nearly 4% during the quarter, and the daily average increased 6% compared to both first quarter 2019, and the prior year quarter. Foreign currency exchange rates were a headwind for Principal International, with a negative $7 million impact to pre-tax operating earnings versus the prior year quarter, and a negative $2 million impact compared to first quarter 2019.","Mortality experience in RIS-Spread and individual life, was in line with our expectations in the second quarter. Specialty benefits pre-tax operating earnings benefited by approximately $9 million due to a very favorable claims experience in group life. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impacts of the annual assumption review and foreign currency exchange, our revenue growth measures for RIS-Spread, Principal International, specialty benefits, and individual life, are within or above our 2019 guided ranges. Excluding the impact of the annual assumption review and the large PGI performance fee in the third quarter 2018, the trailing 12-month revenue growth measures in RIS-Fee and PGI are slightly below our 2019 guided ranges.","At the time 2019 guidance we set, we did not anticipate the significant decline in the equity market in December 2018. These metrics have been trending higher in the first half of the year as the equity market has rebounded. As anticipated in our 2019 guidance, RIS-Fee is experiencing a 1% to 2% drag on net revenue growth as planned sponsors move from commissions to fee arrangements. This shift results in both lower revenue, and lower commission expense with no impact on pretax operating earnings.","On a trailing 12 month basis excluding the annual assumption review, pre-tax margins for all business units were within or above the 2019 guided ranges. These strong margins reflect the balance of disciplined expense management and continued investments in our businesses. As expected some benefits of our accelerated digital investments are starting to emerge.","The following comments on business unit results exclude significant variances from both periods. Pretax operating earnings for all businesses with the exception of corporate were in line with or better than our expectations for the quarter. At $90 million corporate pre-tax operating losses were higher than expected. This was driven by higher security benefit expenses, as well as increased interest expense from the $500 million of debt we issued in early May to finance a portion of the Wells Fargo IRT acquisition.","We continue to expect corporate losses to be above the high end of our 2019 guided range of $300 million to $320 million for the full year. RIS-fee's underlying business fundamentals continue to be strong. Sales were $4.1 billion in the second quarter, bringing the first half of the year to nearly $9.5 billion, an increase of 32% from the first half of 2018.","Second quarter net cash flow of $1.4 billion was driven by strong sales, growth in recurring deposits, and low contract lapses. We continue to expect full year net cash flow to be within 1% to 3% of beginning of year account values, and defined contribution plan count increased 3% or nearly 1100 plans over the prior year quarter. During the quarter RIS-Spread had $2 billion of sales, driven by nearly $900 million of pension risk transfer sales a record for second quarter.","That said, we've seen a slowdown in fixed annuity sales as interest rates have declined. Despite this, third quarter pension risk transfer sales are off to a good start and the pipeline remained strong. At $160 million PGI's pre-tax operating earnings declined 11% from the prior-year period, driven by investments in the business, lower performance fees, and mix of business. With the second straight quarter of strong asset appreciation, PGI's pre-tax operating earnings improved 15% on a sequential basis.","While specialty benefits first quarter earnings were at the low end of expectations, favorable claims benefited second quarter earnings, and strengthened results through the first half of the year. That said, we expect pre-tax operating earnings for the first half of the year to be slightly more than the typical 45% of full year earnings.","As shown on Slide 12, we committed and deployed $1.4 billion of capital during the quarter, including $1.2 billion committed to the acquisition of the Wells Fargo IRT business and $150 million deployed for common stock dividends. As discussed first quarter, we have suspended share repurchases and expect to resume them no later than first quarter of 2020. With capital deployment of $1.6 billion in the first half of 2019, we've already exceeded our $1 billion to $1.4 billion guided range for 2019.","Last night, we announced a $0.01 increase in our common stock dividend payable in the third quarter to $0.55, a 4% increase from a year ago. Our dividend yield is approximately 4% and on a trailing 12-month basis, we're at our targeted 40% net income payout ratio. With the recent interest rate headlines, I wanted to address some potential impacts to Principal. During the second quarter at 3.9%, our new money yield was nearly the same as the overall portfolio yield excluding variable investment income.","While low rates are ideal for some of our businesses, the level of spread compression won't be as pronounced as in previous periods when the portfolio yield was much higher than the new money yield. While declining interest rates negatively impact general account returns and insurance related revenue that impact is partially offset by higher fixed income AUM, and revenue in PGI.","As a reminder, a majority of our operating earnings are generated by fee-based businesses, making us less sensitive to interest rate movements than many of our peers. An immediate 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, is estimated to reduce total company pre-tax operating earnings by less than 1% on an annual basis, excluding the impact of any potential unlocking of our DAC asset and other actuarial balances. In addition, we've always taken a disciplined approach to managing our liabilities by limiting or not offering certain products, and managing risk through pricing, distribution, and product design.","We'll complete our annual assumption review in the 3rd quarter, as we have in prior years. We'll update the starting point for interest rates to reflect the actual movements in rates over the past year. Additionally, we will review our models experience and macroeconomic assumptions, including among many other items long-term interest rates.","Finally, as mentioned earlier, we closed on the Wells Fargo IRT acquisition, and the economics of the business transferred to Principal on July 1st. Keep in mind that it's going to take some time to transfer the business, employees, and relationships to Principal. The earnings from this business will be reported in RIS-Fee starting in the third quarter. However, we continue to evaluate options for the best financial reporting structure over the long term.","Excluding transaction and integration costs, the acquisition is still anticipated to have an immaterial impact to 2019 non-GAAP operating earnings per diluted share, and is expected to be slightly accretive in 2020. The integration is off to a great start and as Dan said, the acquisition is being received positively by the Wells Fargo IRT employees, and clients, as well as by the consultant and adviser communities.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] And the first question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a couple of questions on the Wells deal. I guess one in terms of the comment on slightly accretive in 2020. Was that including or excluding the transaction cost?","Dan Houston","Yeah. Good question, Ryan appreciate it, and good morning. With that, I'll just have Deanna help out on some of the accounting questions here.","Deanna Strable","Yeah. So when we say neutral in the second half of '19, and slightly positive in 2020 that does exclude one-time transaction costs and integration costs. But it does include the earnings impact from any amortization of intangibles, as well as the additional debt expense that will reside in corporate.","Ryan Krueger","Got it, thanks. And then can you I guess give any color on what you're seeing so far in terms of shock lapses, I know it's early, and maybe how it's comparing to what you had assumed?","Dan Houston","It's not only early, it's way early. But I will tell you this, and I'm going to flip it to Renee and have her maybe expand on your question a little bit Ryan. But frankly from our perspective, the conversations with Wells Fargo clients, their consultants, the advisors, the employees have gone exceedingly well. They understand the rationale behind the transaction.","I think we've been able to get employees comfortable with the idea that these locations are going to remain open, and those jobs remain there and the other thing we find out is that you're going find out so much during due diligence, but we've been in front of a lot of clients now, and there is a very strong relationship between the relationship manager in the home office counterparts with these large clients. And so we feel very good about where we're at. But I would like to have Renee maybe expand a little bit on that. You've been out talking to so many of these clients Renee, you and Jerry Anderson.","Renee Schaaf","Absolutely, Ryan. Thank you for your call, and your question. When we take a look at where we're at with this integration as Dan mentioned, we are really pleased with the progress that we've made so far and the warm reception that we've received from Wells Fargo IRT employees, the clients, advisors and consultants. And I think it really starts with the strong collaboration that we have between the Wells Fargo IRT team, and the Principal team.","Joe Ready, representing the Wells Fargo IRT team and Jerry Patterson, leading the charge on the Principal team have really created a tone of teamwork and collaboration right off at the start. And what that allows us to do is to come out to the marketplace in a very cohesive fashion. And one of the things that really helps us with this transition is the fact that we have a relatively long transition period baked into this deal.","So we anticipate being able to transition clients, and employees in a very thoughtful, and planned way over the course of the next 18 months. And as we consider this integration, were really looking towards four guiding principles. First is to make sure that we provide seamless customer service, and minimize any disruption to clients. And in order to do that, of course, as Dan mentioned, it's critical that we take care of the talent, and welcoming the Wells Fargo IRT employees to our team is central to that.","As Dan mentioned, we have committed to key locations that Wells Fargo IRT employees are currently working from and we've also integrated the leadership team. So now we have a very good representation of Wells Fargo IRT, and Principal both leading the charge . What that allows us to do then is to identify what are the best features of both their business models and to integrate those thoughtfully so that when we come to the marketplace we have capabilities that surpass either organization prior to this acquisition. So we're very optimistic, we're very confident in our ability to integrate this well, and we look forward to strengthening our growth and meeting customer needs in the future.","Dan Houston","Ryan. Thanks for those questions.","Operator","The next question will come from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman","Hey, good morning. Question: In the press release, in this section on RSV, you mentioned as there has been pressure on net revenues. You said there were competitive pressures. Could you elaborate on that a bit?","Dan Houston","Yeah, I'll make a couple of quick comments. I think those pressures Andrew are probably not that different than what we've had for years. And as you can also see from the expense line, we're doing a good job managing our expenses, while at the same time creating new capabilities. Renee will get into some of the accounting, but the contra-revenue issues is part of the explanation.","The other part of it of course is a change in investment line up. Some of the lineups generate less revenue. And then lastly, it's so that nagging issue there is a lot of capacity today in this record keeping business, and of course one of the reasons, and the rationale behind the acquisition of Wells Fargo IRT business was to help with issues around scaling. But Renee, can you help with this one?","Renee Schaaf","Yeah, absolutely. So, Andrew if you look at current quarter over prior year quarter, and you look at the net revenue line, and you make all the adjustments for the significant variances that we've called out, you will see that fees are generally down about $4 million and that creates a -- if you compare the net revenue growth to about the 8% average account value growth, you do see a gap there. And that gap is running between 8% to 9% depending on the period that you're looking at. That's a fairly typical gap that we see.","About 1% to 2% is going to be as a result of commissions going to fee based agreements. And in fact if you look on a quarter over prior year quarter basis, that pressure is about 1.5% the remainder of the gap then is exactly what Dan identified and it's not a typical from what we've seen in previous quarters. It represents fee pressures coming from a very competitive environment, coming from open architecture, passive investments, and sheer mix of business that we have. And so there is nothing that surprising there and concerning. And as Dan mentioned, we've done a very thoughtful and careful job of managing expenses as a result. So nothing that's surprising there, and we feel good about this quarter.","Andrew Kligerman","I see. So that makes a lot of sense. So maybe just drilling that into more of the numbers. So as I measure fees as a percent of that average assets, they were in 2017 about 66 basis points, in 2018, 63, and then in the first two quarters they were 58 basis points and 57 basis points. Could you give any sense of what we could expect on those ratios maybe looking out a year or two? And how will Wells Fargo affect that?","Renee Schaaf","Yeah. So if you look at -- you're absolutely right. If you look at what has been happening on the fees as a percentage, or as a basis point -- expressed as a basis points, you do see about a one basis point drop per quarter. And again that's very consistent with the conversations in the past. We do believe that the trends that we see in the marketplace will continue for the foreseeable future.","What will happen though is adding the Wells Fargo IRT business to the next helps us with scale. And it not only helps us with scale, and gives us the ability to reinvest in our business, to make us more competitive, and to do even a better job of meeting, plan, sponsor and participant needs. But it also rounds out our capabilities, particularly in the non-retirement trust and custody lines, and again, giving us access to a really, really talented group of staff. So I think we -- we're confident about our future, but the industry pressure is there, certainly, but the acquisition helps on a great deal to position us for growth and profitability in the future.","Dan Houston","Andrew, hopefully that helps.","Andrew Kligerman","Absolutely. Thank you.","Dan Houston","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Just to follow up on IRS fees, I think in Dan's remark and also Deana kind of mentioned that some of the accelerated digital investments starting to yield results. Should we think about kind of the ongoing investments by now is largely offset by the benefits coming through as well as the expense management? How should we think about the overall expenses running through the segments in near-term?","Dan Houston","Yeah, yeah. I love your optimism but you're probably a couple of quarters ahead of us in your analysis. But Deanna do want help frame that?","Deanna Strable","Yeah, I'll take you back to what we talked about at both the Investor Day and outlook call at the end of last year. If you remember when we announced the digital investment, we said from '17 to '18 we would have about a 2% drag on our earnings growth. What we said as we came into 2019, was the net impact to earnings would be very similar in '18 versus '19.","Our investment actually goes up, but that increase in investment is actually offset by the beginning of the benefits. So benefit some of them do run through the expense line. But some of them run through the revenue line. And so again on the dollar amount of earnings, the impact in '18 and '19, are very similar, how they -- how it comprises by segment may be a little bit different, but from a percentage growth perspective pretty neutral between '18 and '19.","Dan Houston","Equally as important to the financials, I would also tell you Humphrey, that we are very much on track with where we thought these initiatives would be in terms of their development in particular around improving the customer experience, tools related to helping the equity managers analyze stock opportunities better, and that's being tested with very favorable results. Tim could be happy to get into that if you'd like. And then lastly, the ability to better data -- manage our data and put it into the proper perspective to help us better serve the customer. So it is an investment worth making and equally as important. We're on track with where we thought we would be.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. And then shifting gears to PGI I feel, based on your prepared remarks, it sounds like there is a lot of kind of positive momentum coming through in the second half. Maybe a question for Tim or Pat, are they still confident that PGI net flows would be positive in the second half of the year? And if so, how should we think about the trend, is it more like breakeven in Q3 and then may be ramping up in Q4? Like, any color would be helpful.","Dan Houston","Thanks Humphrey, and I'll throw that over to Tim. I would tell you that, and he will get into the numbers, but we've really Tim and Pat Halter just done a terrific job getting the right people in the right roles including sales and distribution. Performance has started to turn around and the level of optimism we have is quite good. But Tim, you want to go ahead and provide some details?","Tim Dunbar","Sure, thanks Humphrey for the question. And I think there are a number of reasons why we're optimistic about the second half of the year. And as Dan said it does really start with producing the right investment performance, and providing the right solutions to our clients. I think we talked quite a lot about really trying to change our approach and develop a strong relationship, make sure that we have solutions for the client in our macro environment.","I think that's really starting to take hold. I'd say as well we talked about some of the changes we've made to the distribution structure. So new leadership, really trying to align incentives when our customers win and when we win, making sure that we have the right talent. And so we've actually brought in a fair amount of talent from the outside.","And what we're starting to see us some really positive results of that. And what that's meant is that it's really starting to build in terms of our pipeline. So if we look at our mandates one, but not yet funding that pipeline is really strong. If we look at placements of our products on platforms, that pipeline is really strong. And then just behind that, we're seeing really a lot of interest across a large number of our strategies. So we're feeling really good about that. Now I'd tell you that it's difficult to call exactly how mandates come in, and how they fund. The 529 plan Dan mentioned will come in the fourth quarter. But we do believe that through the end of the year we will be positive in net cash flow.","Work -- more work to do, we have a lot of initiatives related to retention, and we're going to continue to focus on that as well. But again, pretty optimistic about second half of the year.","Dan Houston","Humphrey, I appreciate you being on the call and your question.","Operator","The next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions, first on the asset management business and just your optimism on flows in the second half. To what extent -- the New Mexico 529 mandate, because I think that will bring in maybe close to $2 billion potentially, do you think your flows will be positive, excluding that as well or is that a big part of your assumption about positive flows?","Dan Houston","Yeah, I can assure you, Jimmy, our enthusiasm for the second half of the year's isn't just relying on one particular plan as Tim was framing. The pipeline is good of commitments, and again remember PGI gets fed by a lot of the other businesses here within the organization. So again, our optimism is coming from more than just -- more than just the New Mexico plan. As for trying to speculate exactly what that number would be that probably wouldn't be the wisest thing for me to do on this call.","Jimmy Bhullar","Yeah. And then on the -- just if you could talk about the competitive environment in the Latin pension market and specifically Brazil there has been a lot of talk about pension reform. How do you see that working out, whether it's a plus or a negative for you? And then your flows in Chile were pretty weak this quarter, what's driving that? And any comments on how you see that market unfolding over the next year or so?","Dan Houston","Yeah, I'm really glad you asked that question, Jimmy, because that's top of mind for us to. And before I throw it over to Luis, I would just say this, we've got a very diverse set of businesses between fee spread, and risk, and certainly geographic diversity as well. On any given time, some of these markets will outperform or underperform, and there certainly some political pressures, and economic pressures, that are impacting the Latin American businesses. But no better person to handle the question and dive into the details than Luis Valdes. Luis?","Luis Valdes","Okay, thanks. Hi, Jimmy. Let me start to put in some comments about Brazil and their pension reform. They're making progress. First time ever, there were making insurance program. The Congress, they do have a pension deal under discussion for approval at the Congress level. That pension bill has been approved by some of the most important committees at the lower chamber, so they -- they are making important improvements in that sense.","Most of that pension bill is related in order to reshape their pillar or one, their social security system, very compulsory of their story. If the pension bill is going to be approved as it is, I would say that the immediate impact is that is going to reinforce and to accelerate the growth of the voluntary pension business, second pillar, and third pillar in Brazil. So I wouldn't say that even though that pension bill is not addressing any particular issue for the voluntary market, that it's going to reinforce the idea that Brazilians, they have to save more, because essentially the benefits out of the Pillar one are going to be lower going forward.","So the good news for Brazil, good news for the pension industry. In general terms, that is about Brazil. And let me comment, our net customer cash growth in general terms about Chile. If you let me start saying that picture with conventional continue having the formidable and well-diversified portfolio. And as you have heard we have just reported 43 consecutive quarter of positive net customer cash flows. And the total of those AUMs is $76 billion in all those years. Among these countries Chile and particularly Cuprum, has effectively reported negative net customer cash flows, and the reasons are essentially three.","So the number one is that we are facing some short-term lower investment performance relative to some of our peers. And that is affecting our commercial activities and is putting some pressure on our ability to retain some assets and clients. This is a very competitive environment, Jimmy, and it is very important to keep in mind that -- to clarify also that we're not an outlier in Europe net investment performance, and with most of our funds, the difference in terms of performance between us, and the top performers is no more than 50 up to 60 basis points out of -- and the average investor return up to more than 7% as of today.","So we're working on that. The problem is fixable and judging with Team Dapper and Pigam we're putting a lot of effort and resources to work on that. The second thing those affecting the competitive environment there, is that we have more fits on the streets. As long as the industry has increased the number of salespeople in 14% relative to a year ago.","Our sales force remained constant and we're working on that in order to refine, you know the size of our sales force today. the third each of that we are implementing some changes in our sales and commercial areas. But in the short term for a good reason sometimes is affecting our Cuprum sales productivity in some areas of -- in Chile. In all of those are the three areas, we are working and panel innovation 52:50 in order to move Cuprum and it positive terrain. if you allow me, it's important to say something about Chile.","Chile is in this particular quarter, in local currency, reporting, the highest total AUMs that we have had historically in Chile for Cuprum and for our voluntary business. So from historical stand point of view, we are today managing more assets for our clients than at any given point of our history. That fact in particular is keeping us very optimistic about the gross from prospect for Chile.","Dan Houston","Thanks for that question, Jimmy. The other thing I would just want to say, in addition to Luis's comments is that asset is still performing well within our guidelines of the acquisition, which is now coming in on six years Luis?","Luis Valdes","Yes, since 2012, '13. Yeah.","Dan Houston","Yeah. So again it's hitting our financial expectations. So thank you for the question.","Operator","The next question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Bass","Hi, thank you. I also had a question on international, I mean just looking over the past 12 months. Net revenues are flat on a reported basis and the adjusted earnings declined this quarter and certainly FX has been a headwind. But I was hoping you could talk about some of the other drivers holding back growth given the growth in AUM in the positive cash flows that you've seen?","Dan Houston","Yeah, thank you for the question. And certainly currency plays a role at that. But Luis, you want to go and take that?","Luis Valdes","Yeah, thanks for your question Eric. And if you're looking now, we are trailing 12 month basis. What we have reported, it looks like a minus 1%, the greatest was zero, if you're adding some FX. But if you are just adding the actual assumption changes and FX, immediately you're going in a positive to bring a 7% growth in our TTM basis for our net combined net revenues, which is pretty much more in line about our guidance.","Eric Bass","Got it. Thank you. So, that number was an adjusting for the actuarial review?","Luis Valdes","Neither for FX. I mean, FX is the most important part of, you know, there is a kind of a comparison in the reported basis. In the FX in place $65 million negative in the trailing 12 months for PI.","Dan Houston","We had a good 10-year run where FX was a just a great tailwind to these businesses. And obviously in the last six, seven, eight years, it's been just the opposite, It has been quite a headwind. The good news is the fundamentals, the underlying growth, in participants and what we're building is still quite good. But certainly currency can be vaccine to demonstrating a good solid financial results from these markets. Did you have a follow-up, Eric?","Eric Bass","I did. Actually if I could just switch gears to pension risk transfer, where your sales have been quite strong year-to-date. And I was just curious if you think this is a pull forward of activity just to being early and -- earlier in the year than normal or does the pipeline remain robust for the second half of the year.","Dan Houston","And yeah, so I'll have Renee pile on. But I would just say that of the $900 million in sales for the quarter, t isn't any one large plan and the pipeline still looks good. And it's -- although it's a competitive market, we still like the returns we're getting on the business. Few comments on PRT?","Renee Schaaf","Absolutely. So if you look at the -- If you look at 2018 and you look at the number of opportunities or the size of the opportunities as they came to the market. It was about $27 billion market, our industry-wide. We think we're actually seeing that there is a possibility we may be on pace for that, or maybe slightly more as an industry, or as a total market in 2019. And we're fully prepared to take advantage of the opportunities. We'll remain very selective.","You'll see us be very disciplined on the risk that we take, and the way that we approach these opportunities. But the pipeline is strong, our position is good and we remain focused in the $5 million to $1 billion range of opportunities. And as Dan mentioned, our success to date is not heavy weighted towards any one transaction. It's a very nice basket of sales that are right in our niche, right in our target market. So we're very pleased with the results.","Operator","The next question is from Suneet Kamat with Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamat","Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to go back to investment performance, noting the quarter-over-quarter modest improvement you're still down quite a bit year-over-year in terms of the one-year numbers. Just want to get some thoughts there. And at what point do you think that might impact the assets that you manage perhaps for the RIT business?","Dan Houston","Yeah, clearly the outlier for that that one year number was the fourth quarter of this past year, and obviously it hunts enhance that one year performance. The good news is most all of the decision-making as I look at the tools that are being used to assess whether not to direct investment options to Principal, for example, in the Retirement Division. The weighting is on the three and the five. But again, I'll have Tim help maybe provide some better understandings to steps being taken, and any concerns you might have. Tim?","Tim Dunbar","Yeah, I know. Thanks Suneet. I think investment performance we've seen continue to improve throughout 2019. So as Dan mentioned, the fourth quarter was a tough quarter for us. And you saw the investment performance debt. But I do think that what we're producing our asset management solutions that are for the longer term.","So for the most part, our clients are looking at those long-term numbers and both the three year numbers, the 66% of the solutions, and AUM in the second and first quartile. And then 83% for five years, we think is really good investment performance. And again like I said before, we think it's resonating with our -- with our clients and we're providing the right solutions and the right performance to them.","Dan Houston","Just one of the thing I pile on Suneet. The other data point is that 88% of our retail mutual funds have either a four or five star ranking. So again that's -- that's where the flows are going and we're in good stead there. Did you have a follow-up?","Suneet Kamat","Yes, I did. We talked about this on the Wells call as well, but I wanted to revisit now that you've had a little bit more time with it. Any thought to maybe adding more of your PGI funds onto the platforms of the Wells accounts? It seems to me that potentially a big opportunity for you guys. But we haven't really spent much time talking about it.","Dan Houston","Yeah. And that's exactly right. I think the big takeaway is we want to make sure that Wells Fargo clients, and their consultants if they're happy with what they currently have we want to honor and respect that. But I will tell you that in working closely with the relationship managers, they are incredibly enthusiastic about some of the investment options that are available, starting with real estate.","Some of these are options that weren't otherwise readily available. So we will continue the knowledge transfer to the relationship managers, and the sales professionals, and those prospective clients, and consultants, on the capabilities and skills that we have in these investment areas. And so we remain optimistic, just like we do in our existing value proposition to our clients, that we have great skills and capabilities across a number of these asset classes, and we'll be having those conversations. But by no means, will they have to move over. It will be simply discussion, and presenting these options to these prospective clients.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott","Hi. First question I had was just on RIS-Spread. I guess -- when I was looking at the net investment income performance this quarter, I even asked, I think some of the prepays and so forth you're calling out. It looks like a pretty strong pickup in NII base yield, which was a little surprising, just in light of the declining rate environment. So I was just interested in any commentary you have there. Is this kind of new level more sustainable, I think it was around 70 bps increase quarter-over-quarter? So, any color there would be great.","Dan Houston","Yeah, you've got it down well. Deanna?","Deanna Strable","Yeah, thanks for the question. I think we did hear last night, and your question says that people thought our net investment income looked a little higher whether it being spread or within all of the US businesses. But actually, when -- I actually think it holds together pretty well. Once you adjust for variable investment income and you take into the account the growth we've seen in the general account or the spread business from a year ago.","So our spread average JV is up 11% on a trailing 12 month basis, 12% from a year ago. And actually if you look at our variable investment income, it's up maybe 15% quarter-over-quarter, but 12% on a trailing 12 month basis. So it's not that significant, we off of the growth in that business. I like to look at that on a longer period of time, as any one quarter can have some anomalies in it.","For example, last quarter we did say that variable investment income was slightly below our expectations, but not enough to call out in any one period. So I think that is influencing that as well. Going forward, there could be some slight pressure on the amount of net investment income that we have if interest rates stay at the current lower level. But I think once you adjust for variable investment income, the growth in net investment income is tracking pretty darn close to the growth in the business.","Dan Houston","That help, Alex?","Alex Scott","Yeah, that is helpful. And maybe just a follow up. When I think about since the outlook you guys provided about a year ago. The 10 years, dropped about 100 basis points. When I think about that kind of a move, I know PFGs maybe a little less rate sensitive than some peers. But how should I think about the way that you'd expect that the impact the EPS, whether it's this year, thinking about next year? And what are some of the levers that you can maybe pull to offset some of that pressure?","Dan Houston","Yes. actually a little bit longer than a year ago, and it's been quite a roller coaster ride if you think about where we were at, where we went to, and where we've returned. And the good news is we don't take a lot of interest rate risk. But Deanna, do you want to help frame that for Alex?","Deanna Strable","Yeah, I'll actually take you back to our rules of thumb that we have talked about and it was actually included in the slide deck that we put out there. And so that rule of thumb on earnings is a 100 basis point decline in rates has less than a 1% impact on our overall earnings.","Obviously, that could be more significant in the spread business and the Life business, but because of our mix of business, it's less than 1%. The other thing I would say that I think it's really critical, and we said it in our prepared remarks, if you look at our new money yield today, it's pretty darn close to what our portfolio yield is. And so that's going to have less pressure on our overall earnings impact than if there was a big differential between that portfolio rate, and that new money rates. I think it's very, very manageable. You could see some impact, but I think relative to our peers that impact is muted.","Dan Houston","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","The final question is from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Joshua Shanker","Yeah, thank you for the meeting today.","Dan Houston","Thank you.","Joshua Shanker","Thank you. So if we look at -- like, you know, I read so you had this large mandate outflow in your new mandates coming in. Can we talk a little bit about the impact on AUM, on PGI, from blocking and tackling growing assets versus mandates. Are these mandates lower margin in the rest of the business? Are they higher margin if we think five years ahead? Do we want to win more of these mandates? Of course we do, but they also have a -- they're less margin attractive then growing the business. How should we think about the evolution, I guess, of the AUM trend and what it means for margins overall?","Dan Houston","Well, you know, when I think about the evolution of our asset management company, it starts with the fact that we have so many asset raising capabilities embedded within the organization, whether it's the life company, or the mutual fund a capabilities, annuities, retirement, etc. We deliberately have gone out within the last 20 years to build an institutional asset management business, which by its very nature tends to be a little bit more lumpy larger mandates.","What I have found frankly the most refreshing over that period of time is how independently fixed income, equities, real estate alternatives, both domestic, international, have grown and are appealing to all of those client types of that I just mentioned. And maybe with that Tim, you can help us explain the lumpy nature of mandates versus these other opportunities are more consistently flowing in.","Tim Dunbar","Sure. I would say each mandate is quite different and it depends on the asset class that it comes in to. So the big mandate that went out, was an investment grade fixed income mandate. Obviously, those are going to be lower fees. The new mandate coming in on the 529, actually most of the assets will flow into the mutual funds. And so you would see those coming in at similarly attractive fees. I think within our investment management franchise as Dan said, we have a very diverse portfolio of capabilities. And so what we see our pressure in some areas, like with active equities.","And certainly, there has been some pressure on fees coming down in the move to passive. But we have some specialty capabilities as well. So think about our real estate capabilities, think about our preferred security capabilities, high yield. We're still seeing good fee levels on those.","And so, in any given quarter, in any given year, those are going to be a bit lumpy and change. And I think one thing that we'll do going forward is to try to give you more color on what those big mandates and big flows look like, and how you should think about the revenue coming in off of those both on the way in, but also on the way out.","Dan Houston","And to that point some of the stated maturities. And that's been some of the lumpiness the last couple of years where it was expected and was going to expire. Did you have a quick follow-up? Okay.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A session. Mr. Houston, your closing comments please.","Dan Houston","Thank you. Josh, I apologize if you did have a follow-up, gives a call. We'll make sure to get to you. I appreciate everyone taking the time today. We do very much like the way we've gone out capital deployment. These last 12 months we are very bullish as you can take from this call. On the Wells Fargo IRT business, we really are as enthusiastic today as we were when we first started working on the opportunity.","Expense discipline is a big part of what we have done in the past. We'll continue to stay focused on that. I'm very excited about talking in more detail in the future about these digital initiatives, and how they're helping our customers. And then lastly, as you could pick up from the tone of the divisional presidents, latter half of the year for us looks quite good and we like the pipeline, we like the growth in the economy, and where these businesses going. So again thank you for your confidence in the organization. Look forward to seeing you on the road soon. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference.

Welcome to Principal Financial Group's second quarter conference call. As always, materials related to today's call are available on our website at principal.com\/investor. Following a reading of the safe harbor provision, CEO, Dan Houston; and CFO, Deanna Strable will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A session include Nora Everett, Retirement and Income Solutions; Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors; Luis Vald\u00e9s, Principal International; Amy Friedrich, U.S. Insurance Solutions; and Dennis Menken, our Chief Investment Officer for Principal Life Insurance Company.","Some of the comments made during the conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed by the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","Additionally, some of the comments made during this conference call may refer to non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures may be found in our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I want to extend an invitation to two upcoming events. We're hosting an investor event in Tokyo, Japan, the morning of Friday, September 28, highlighting our global asset management and retirement strategies and opportunities for growth in Asia. Our 2018 Investor Day will be held on Thursday, November 15 in New York City. Our leadership team will discuss future opportunities in our businesses as well as details on our accelerated investments in digital and the expected impacts to our businesses. Additional details to follow. Dan?","Daniel Houston","Thanks, John, and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning, I'll share some performance highlights and accomplishments that position us for continued growth. Deanna will follow up with details on our financial results and capital deployment.","In the second quarter, we delivered $391 million of non-GAAP operating earnings, bringing non-GAAP operating earnings to $800 million through 6 months. This was an increase of 6% compared to the first half of 2017. While we're benefiting from the underlying growth of our businesses and U.S. tax reform, growth year-to-date has been muted by several items, including lower variable investment income, our accelerated investment in digital business strategies, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and transaction and integration costs associated with our recent acquisitions.","As I reflect on the first half of the year and overall, we continue to demonstrate strong business fundamentals, balanced investments in our businesses with expense discipline and be good stewards of shareholder capital. Most importantly, we continue to execute our customer-focused solutions-oriented strategy to help people achieve financial security and success. On a trailing 12-month basis, non-GAAP operating earnings exceeded $1.5 billion, demonstrating our continued strength and leadership in retirement and long-term savings, group benefits and protection in the U.S., retirement and long-term savings in Latin America and Asia and global asset management. Compared to a year ago, reported assets under management, or AUM, is up $37 billion or 6% to $667 billion. The effect of foreign exchange rates reduced AUM by $10 billion during the period, primarily driven by weakening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. AUM growth has also been dampened by recent market performance. In addition, we've increased AUM in our joint venture in China, which is not included in the reported AUM, by $59 billion or 61% over the trailing 12 months to a record $155 billion. This strong growth underscores the magnitude of the opportunity in China and the value of our long-term relationship with China Construction Bank.","Our AUM provides a solid foundation for future revenue and earnings growth, and it highlights the diversification of our asset management franchise by investor type, asset class and geography and strong integration across our businesses. We again received the multiple best fund awards during the quarter, including recognition in China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia and Malaysia. And CCB-Principal Asset Management was recognized by Ant Financial, winning their best investor education content award.","We also continue to deliver very strong investment performance. At midyear, for the Morningstar-rated funds, 63% of the fund-level AUM had a 4- or 5-star rating. And as shown on Slide 5, 86% of the Principal actively managed mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, separate accounts and collective investment trusts were above median for the 5-year performance, 70% above the median for the three-year performance and 83% above median for the one-year performance.","Moving to total company net cash flows at $2.3 billion in the second quarter, we were pleased with the sequential rebound. RIS delivered $2.2 billion of positive net cash flow in the second quarter on strong sales and retention for both fee and spread, bringing 6 months flows to $3.2 billion for the segment.","PI delivered $1.4 billion of net cash flow in the second quarter, its 39th consecutive positive quarter and $3.7 billion through 6 months despite relative softness in Brazil. As context, pension deposits in Brazil were down nearly 30% across the industry through May, reflecting meaningful changes to Brazil's investment landscape as well as current political and economic uncertainty. We anticipate continued pressure on flows. But long term, we remain optimistic about the pension and savings market in Brazil and confident in our joint venture's ongoing ability to capture leading market share.","Flows from our joint venture in China, which are not in the reported net cash flow, continued to be strong at $12 billion in the second quarter and $27 billion through six months.","In terms of assets sourced by Principal Global Investors, however, we had negative net cash flow of $1.4 billion in the second quarter. This result does not include the $3 billion investment-grade credit strategies that we described to be at risk during the first quarter call. Consistent with the industry, PGI's net cash flow has now been under pressure for several quarters. In recent quarters, we've seen demand for lower-cost investment options become even more pronounced. That said, we'll continue to see strong interest in our active investment capabilities as we help institutional and retail clients diversify, build wealth, generate income, protect against downside risk and address inflation. From an institutional perspective, these mandates tend to be smaller in terms of assets but with higher revenue rates. In response to growing demand, distribution and product development remain heavily focused on income and other outcomes-based solutions, real estate and other alternative investments and our international retail platform to capitalize on emerging markets experiencing strong wealth creation; further, the build-out of our ETF and CIT platforms, creating lower cost investments to compete with pure passive options and complement our active mutual fund strategies.","I'll now share some key execution highlights, starting with our investment platform. In the second quarter, we launched 8 new funds in Asia and Latin America, responding to increasing retail and institutional demand for multi-asset and income-generating solutions. We continue to make progress leveraging our mutual fund and ETF platforms across borders, delivering our global investment capabilities to meet the needs of local clients. We also launched the Principal Investment Grade Corporate Active ETF during the quarter, adding to our suite of income-oriented solutions on our U.S. platform. At $3.4 billion of AUM at midyear, we now rank 24th on the ETF League Tables.","During the quarter, we entered into a partnership with MUFG Union Bank to launch a lending platform focused on originating loans and securitizing them in CMBS deals, with Principal acting as a primary loan servicer and MUFG providing warehouse line funding. ","Turning to our recent acquisitions in mid-April. We closed acquisition of Internos, also known today as Principal Real Estate Europe, adding significant European real estate investment capabilities. This will allow us to offer investment solutions across key European jurisdictions and expand our leadership in the key asset class. This transaction has been favorably received by both the consultant and client communities. Principal now manages or sub-advises more than $80 billion of real estate assets globally.","In late May, we closed on a transaction for our Southeast Asia joint ventures with CIMB that increased our ownership to 60%. Also, at the end of May, we announced plans to acquire a majority stake in RobustWealth, and the acquisition closed in early July. The transaction is the culmination of an 18-month relationship and a major development expanding and enhancing our digital capabilities. RobustWealth brings a suite of solutions for investment advisors, including a digital advice platform, goal-based investment tools and efficient client onboarding.","In addition to serving advisors, we plan to leverage the RobustWealth platform in a number of ways to better serve existing and former retirement plan participants needing innovative IRA rollover solutions to enhance our managed account offering with a more technology-enabled and personalized solution as an additional avenue for investment product and asset allocation model delivery and to advance digital sales across the suite of Principal investment and protection products.","We look forward to sharing more details as we continue to enhance our digital solutions that reduce barriers to action and eliminate pain points for our customers and advisors.","Moving to distribution. We continue to advance our multichannel, multiproduct approach. We earned two dozen total placements during the quarter, getting more than a dozen different funds on 14 different third-party platforms with success across asset classes. As you may recall, in June of 2017, CCB-Principal Asset Management, our joint venture with China Construction Bank, was selected to offer mutual funds on the Ant Financial platform. As of midyear, we had more than $6 billion in AUM and 3 million investors on this platform. As another important platform development in China, CCB-Principal Asset Management was selected to offer mutual funds on the Tencent platform this quarter. While the revenue and the operating earnings impact from these platforms is currently modest, we expect them to become more meaningful over time. Importantly, combined, these platforms provide our joint venture exposure to millions of users. ","While Deanna will cover this in more detail, I also want to say how pleased I am with our capital deployment through midyear. In addition to our ongoing investment in organic growth and our accelerated investment in digital business solutions, we returned $671 million to investors through share buybacks and common stock dividends and committed $130 million to acquisitions.","Before closing, I'll share 2 pieces of recognition for the quarter. In May, Forbes Magazine named Principal as one of America's best employers, ranking us fourth out of 500 large companies recognized. And earlier this week, we earned the top spot on the Forbes first-ever list of America's Best Employers for Women, reflecting our commitment to equality, flexibility and women's advancement. Along with first quarter recognition for our commitment to diversity, inclusion and ethical behavior, this speaks volumes about our culture and why we'll be successful long term. ","Second quarter was a period of continued progress, helping customers and clients achieve financial success. Despite some macroeconomic pressures, I look for us to continue to build on the momentum in the second half of 2018 and for that momentum to translate into long-term value for our shareholders and each of our stakeholders. Deanna?","Deanna Strable","Thanks, Dan. Good morning, and thanks for participating on our call. Today, I'll discuss key contributors to our second quarter financial results, and I'll provide an update on capital deployment. Net income attributable to Principal was $457 million for second quarter 2018. This included net realized capital gains of $65 million, reflecting $100 million after-tax gains from the sale of a minority stake in a benefits administration technology provider. We had an opportunity to monetize our investment as the company was looking to expand and recapitalize.","Non-GAAP operating earnings were $391 million in the second quarter or $1.35 per diluted share, a 3% increase over the prior year quarter. Year-over-year earnings growth was suppressed by volatile macroeconomic conditions and our accelerated investment in digital but benefited from strong underlying business fundamentals and tax reform.","Our non-GAAP operating earnings effective tax rate was 19.4% for the second quarter, and we continue to expect the full year to be within our previously guided range of 18% to 21%.","ROE, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustment, was 13.9% on a reported basis for the second quarter. Excluding the impact from the 2017 actuarial review, ROE was 14.3%, in line with the first quarter.","We had 3 significant variances during second quarter that negatively impacted reported non-GAAP pretax operating earnings by a total of $23 million. Impacts included $13 million of lower-than-expected variable investment income. Lower prepayment fees and real estate returns were partially offset by higher returns from alternatives. Impacts to the business units included $6 million in RIS-Fee, $4 million in RIS-Spread and $3 million in Specialty Benefits. Principal International had $6 million of lower-than-expected encaje performance and $4 million of integration costs from the Mexico Afore acquisition. This was lower than the $6 million to $8 million range we communicated on our first quarter call.","Excluding significant variances in both periods, total company non-GAAP operating earnings increased 4% on a pretax basis and nearly 8% on an after-tax basis over the year ago quarter.","Our accelerated investments in digital business strategy remains on track and in line with the impact communicated at last year's outlook call. We plan to provide additional details on our digital investments at our upcoming Investor Day on November 15. ","Macroeconomic conditions were mixed but created a net headwind during second quarter 2018, with volatile equity market performance, including a 1% decline in the S&P 500 daily average. This negatively impacted our U.S. fee-based businesses despite a point-to-point increase in the S&P 500 during the quarter. And a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Brazil, negatively impacted Principal International by about $4 million compared to first quarter 2018.","When we made the strategic decision to expand into emerging markets over 20 years ago, we knew that attractive growth came with additional volatility. Fluctuations in foreign currency, global equity markets, inflation and interest rates as well as political uncertainty can cause volatility quarter-to-quarter. We'll continue to execute our strategy, and we remain confident in our growth prospects in these countries.","Despite the macroeconomic noise during the quarter, our businesses continued to demonstrate strong fundamentals. In RIS-Fee, recurring deposits increased 11% from the prior year period and 7% on a trailing 12-month basis, very strong results reflecting employment growth, increased deferral rates and double-digit growth in employer matches. ","In group benefits, on a trailing 12-month basis, in group growth, or lives covered and existing cases, increased a record 1.8%. This has a positive impact on both premiums and pretax operating earnings. And this metric is even stronger when we look at it for our target market of small- to medium-sized businesses. We provide products to help business owners protect their business, transition ownership and save for retirement. Our Individual Life business market sales increased from a year ago and represented 65% of total sales in the quarter, another reflection of the increasing strength and confidence of small- to medium-sized business owners. Positive employment and participant trends are contributing to strong underlying growth across our U.S. businesses.","Turning to the key drivers for the businesses. On a trailing 12-month basis and excluding the impacts of the annual assumption review, the revenue growth and margins for PGI, Specialty Benefits and Individual Life are all within the 2018 guided ranges. It's important to note that the significant variances caused by variable investment income were $86 million lower in second quarter 2018 on a trailing 12-month basis compared to the year ago quarter. We don't typically exclude variable investment income when looking at trailing 12-month metrics as it tends to even out over longer periods of time. However, this variance is certainly impacting the current trailing 12-month revenue and pretax operating earnings growth rates in RIS and U.S. Insurance Solutions. ","While margins in both RIS-Fee and RIS-Spread were within our guided ranges, net revenue growth in both businesses was below the guided ranges. This is due to lower variable investment income as well as spread compression in RIS-Spread.","Excluding the impacts of the annual assumption review and encaje performance, Principal International's pretax return on combined net revenue was below our guided range, primarily due to headwinds from macroeconomic factors. PI's net revenue growth remains within our guided range.","In my following comments on business unit results for the quarter, I'll exclude the significant variances we've called out in both periods in my comparisons. Pretax operating earnings for RIS-Fee, Principal Global Investors, Specialty Benefits, Individual Life and Corporate were all in line with or exceeded our expectations for second quarter. Principal International's pretax operating earnings were also in line, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.","As shown on Slide 7, RIS-Spread pretax operating earnings of $85 million were slightly below our expectations. While we had $1.5 billion of fixed annuity sales in the quarter, pension risk transfer sales and MTN issuance have been light in the first half of the year. We continue to view these businesses as opportunistic and remain disciplined in our pricing. Lower-than-expected variable investment income as well as the timing and level of sales throughout the year is anticipated to cause RIS-Spread full year 2018 net revenue growth to be at\/or below the low end of our guided range. That said, we expect an increase in pension risk transfer sales in the second half of the year and believe full year sales will meet or exceed 2017 sales of $2.8 billion.","Moving to capital deployment on Slide 12. We deployed $391 million of capital during the second quarter, including $196 million in share repurchases, $149 million in common stock dividends, $46 million on announced M&A and increased ownership in a PGI boutique. This brings our year-to-date capital deployment to $801 million. We expect full year deployment will be at the high end of our $900 million to $1.3 billion range.","As we evaluate our capital deployment options, we currently find share repurchases to be a compelling opportunity. The $375 million we deployed through share repurchases in the first half of the year was almost twice as much as all of 2017. Last night, we announced a $0.53 common stock dividend payable in the third quarter, the 10th consecutive increase in our dividend. This is a $0.01 increase from the second quarter 2018 dividend and a 13% increase from the prior year period. We continue to target a 40% dividend payout ratio. And going forward, our dividend growth will be more aligned with the rate of net income growth. ","M&A is important in supplementing organic growth and has contributed to our above-industry earnings growth over the long term. We recently closed on 4 acquisitions. The Mexico Afore acquisition integration is complete and going better than expected. We estimate $0.02 of additional EPS for the full year 2018. Our increased stake in Southeast Asia through our joint venture with CIMB is also expected to produce immediate returns, contributing $0.01 to $0.02 of EPS accretion in 2018. And Principal Real Estate Europe, formerly Internos, is also expected to be accretive to earnings in the second half of 2018. RobustWealth, our most recent acquisition, is expected to be slightly dilutive for the next several quarters as we continue to expand our investment in the business. Given the benefits across the entire organization, RobustWealth will be reported in corporate. Even with this impact, we expect corporate operating losses will be within the previously guided range of $190 million to $210 million for 2018.","Our estimated risk-based capital ratio remains well above our targeted range of 415% to 425%, which puts us in a very strong position to absorb the NAIC's change to the RBC formula to reflect tax reform. We continue to estimate a negative 40 to 50 percentage point impact to our ratio from this change.","As we start the second half of 2018, our capital and liquidity position is the strongest it's ever been. We ended the second quarter with over $1 billion at the holding company, nearly $450 million of capital in excess of a 420% RBC ratio and more than $350 million of available cash in our subsidiaries. In addition, a low leverage ratio and no debt maturities until 2022 gives us financial flexibility.","We are excited about our prospects as we enter the second half of 2018 and remain confident that our diversified business model and ongoing investments position us well for the future.","Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.","Taylor Scott","First question I have is just on the digital investment. When I think about the RobustWealth acquisition, I mean, how much of it is related to sort of synergies with investment that you are planning to make? And should we think about that sort of reducing the amount of acceleration in the investment? Or is there still a lot of investment to kind of do on the back of making that acquisition?","Daniel Houston","Yes. Thanks, Alex. This is Dan. I'll take that. The bottom line is we consider this acquisition separate and apart from our previously discussed digital investment. This really is about acquiring an entity that not only brings a nice professional staff of technologists, but they come with an investment background. That's their orientation. And there's a lot of work to be done on this digital platform for digital advice. There's also a lot of upside -- we work with a lot of independent advisors to look for these kinds of solutions to be their back office, so in other words, white labeling an asset allocation solution for them. So it's really quite additive to the other six initiatives that we've talked about relative to our investment in digital. Is that helpful?","Taylor Scott","Yes, it is. And then another question, it's a bit unrelated. I guess, just this retirement bill that's being considered in Congress that could make some changes to, I guess, tax incentives and 401(k) as well as, I think, motivate group annuities. I mean, is there any color you can provide on what you're seeing and hearing there and how you think that would sort of impact your business?","Daniel Houston","Yes, the Retirement Enhancement Security Act and better known as RESA. I have had an opportunity to spend a fair amount of time on Capitol Hill talking about this. You can forget how frequent we actually do have legislation that tries to promote retirement savings. I would say for the most part, we find this one to be a comprehensive bill that is additive and net positive for the industry. And with that, let me ask Nora to go ahead and add some additional detail.","Nora Everett","Sure. So there's a couple of things happening. You probably also heard about tax 2.0 that the House Ways and Means Committee Chair Brady released, I think, within the last couple of days, yes, on July 24. So in combination -- and what Brady is -- there's a speculation that Brady will actually take RESA, that bill, and potentially attack the 2 together. We are certainly proponents of RESA. You're talking about open MEPs that would help address coverage gaps. You're talking about a safe harbor for in-plan annuity options, to your point. There's a lot of opportunity with that particular piece of legislation to both address some of the coverage gap but obviously also positive to our business and our business model, so very much in favor of moving that piece of legislation forward. Tax 2.0 is interesting. So what Brady is outlining, and it's just an outline at this point, is a new savings vehicle called universal savings account. And that would be an individual account with after-tax dollars potentially up to $5,500 investment tax-free with less restriction around withdrawals. And the interesting thing about that account is, from our perspective, we want to make sure if this legislation moves forward, that there's a good balance between continuing to incent long-term savings and obviously addressing some of the, what I call, a rainy day fund issue. So we are absolutely in favor of anything that's going to enhance that long-term savings piece of the equation and certainly a proponent for addressing the coverage gap.","Operator","The next question will come from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","A question for Deanna. You talked about on the capital deployment side you expect to be towards the high end of your guided range. If I think about the $800 million year-to-date, plus probably another $300 million of dividends in the second half, that would put you at $1.1 billion. So for that remaining $200 million, how should we think about the balance between share repurchases and potential additional M&A opportunities?","Daniel Houston","Deanna, please?","Deanna Strable","Yes. Thanks, Humphrey, for the question. Obviously, I think we'll continue to have a very balanced and disciplined approach from capital deployment. And you pointed out, we've done that thus far this year, with the added amount really going to share buyback, really, given the attractive, compelling opportunity there with the current stock price. The first thing I would say is that $1.3 billion is not a hard cap. As we've -- if you go back over last 5 to 7 years, you've seen times we've been within our guided range and other times where we've been above that guided range. And so we'll continue to look at opportunities, evaluate them relative to each other. We do sit in here today have a $200 million board authorization remaining. So share buyback will be part of what we'll consider as we go forward, in addition to those M&A pipeline as well. As we've specifically think about share buyback, really we look at that opportunistically. It's based on valuation of the stock. It's based on our capital position at the time. And it's also, as mentioned, very much dependent on other deployment opportunities. And so all of those are somewhat hard to predict for the remainder of the year. But again, we feel good that we'll be at\/or above the high end of that range, and we'll continue to be very balanced and disciplined in our approach.","Daniel Houston","Humphrey, do you have a follow-up?","Humphrey Lee","Yes. So in terms of RIS-Fee, I think in your prepared remarks, the recurring deposit is definitely a good story there. You talked about there's greater deferral and then also greater matching. But I was just wondering if you can share that a little more, can you talk about some of the dynamics that's happening within the recurring deposits in RIS-Fee?","Daniel Houston","Yes, I'd be happy to do that. Just at a very high level, you're right, this 11%, 12% increase in reoccurring deposits is really helping. I think it gives you an indication just how strong the overall economy is. This is pay increases. This is larger bonuses, profit sharing. So American workers are certainly benefiting from the economy growing, which is very positive for our business. But Nora do you want to add some additional color?","Nora Everett","Sure. So to your question, there are multiple factors that are feeding in, and Dan's identified some of them. Certainly, a big factor is we continue to grow the number of plans we work with. We continue to grow the number of participants we work with, the number of participants with account values. So you've got the macro piece and you also have the fundamental business piece where we continue to grow the business. I would focus on the trailing 12-month as well because quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see some noise, whether that's ESOP, whether that's defined benefit. But even that trailing 12-month growth number at 7% is a really healthy trailing 12 months over trailing 12 months. So we look forward, we see these accelerants with regard to the number of plans, the number of participants, the economics around both wage growth and the fact that folks are increasing their deferrals and their employees are increasing their match, so a lot of positive momentum with those underlying fundamentals.","Daniel Houston","Just one other thing I'll add there, Humphrey. If look back at kind of the low point of what the average deferral, it was kind of in the mid-6%. Now it's north of 8%. And that percentage difference is quite significant when you think about just overall deposits coming into these plans. So I think the message around increasing your savings commitment to retirement is important and it's out there, and we're seeing it in our stats. So thanks for your questions.","Operator","The next question will come from John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill.","John Barnidge","I know you've talked quite a lot about -- at length about how outflows seen in PGI were lower fee generating and some of the flows coming in were higher fee generating. And then fees as a percent of AUM in 2Q '18 was its highest level since 4Q '16, so it seems like that's happening. Can you expound a little bit more about what you're seeing from the fee level side from new assets in PGI and maybe a little bit on your outlook for flows?","Daniel Houston","Yes. So it's a great question. I'll just look to Jim to respond accordingly, John.","James McCaughan","Yes. Thank you, John. In terms of the pipeline, we see a lot of assets in the specialties we've talked about in the past, whether it's real estate; high yield; small cap; emerging markets, both debt and equity, although those are out of favor at the moment but still in the pipeline because institutions will often buy out-of-favor assets. So in other words, our pipeline is very much added-value products, which our clients seek for higher return. And that's really the explanation of your point about our basis points fees creeping up over time. We're seeing in the industry what I'd describe it as a decoupling between flows and revenues. Firms that have very big inflows maybe doing it for almost nothing, and therefore, not so much growing revenues. We're at the other end of it.","And so our flows may have suffered, but the revenues continue to grow. A year ago, at the equivalent call, I said I was much more confident for the near future about revenue growth than I was about flows. It has worked out that way. Having said all that, I think there are signs that we're maybe on a bit of a better patch here. First point -- first number I would point to is global institutional distribution, where our sales in the first half were $8.2 billion, which is up 35% on the year before. That reflects the build we've made and the enhancements we've made in global institutional distribution. And I think that's well aligned with the strong performing and specialty capabilities we have. So in institutional, I feel pretty positive around the sales. Of course, as you know, there were reasons for outflows over the last 12 months.","There were funds that were started for a fixed term. There were the performance issues two years ago at Columbus Circle. And there was the increased cost of hedging that was causing, particularly Japanese and European clients, at the margin to withdraw. You still see the first and last of those to some extent, but I do expect that we'll be in a much better position since the worst appears to be over in those sort of high level impacts on our flows. Columbus Circle, I spent some time there earlier this week, and I'm hopeful we'll be growing by 2019. The performance has come around very strongly. So if I add it all up, I'm pretty confident that the institutional flows can improve. On retail, something we did, which I think was only important as a good fiduciary, is a soft close on our very well-recognized mid-cap and SMid income strategies. We did that bringing on stream some other attractive products where our retail flows have been low. I have to say on the second quarter, we had an outflow on the 40 Act funds of about $850 million. That was a result of those attractive products picking up a bit slower than we wanted. And the soft close obviously is to conserve capacity and continue doing a good job for our existing customers. So the answer really is to try and sum it up, we're confident in the pipeline we're seeing. We think the strong performances of most of our strategies give us a lot to work with. But there are factors somewhat beyond our control that could make the flows a bit lumpy. But I do believe that this quarter was pretty representative of some good efforts by the team.","Daniel Houston","John, do you have a follow-up?","John Barnidge","I've taken enough time with that question.","Operator","The next question will come from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder Bhullar","First, just had a question for Jim on PGI flows. And if you could give us any mandates -- any update on the Japan mandates that you think might be at risk and what the assets associated with those mandates are?","Daniel Houston","Sure. Jim, please?","James McCaughan","Yes. On the Japan mandate we talked about at the last quarter's call as being at risk, it's at risk because of increased hedging costs. The hedging cost has gone from perhaps 50 basis points when the mandate started to well over 200 basis points. And when you're an investment grade, that's not enough to cover the spread. That mandate has not gone. It remains at risk for economic reasons, though the client relationship is very strong. We're working with that client and other Japanese clients on different ways to manage money. I wouldn't want to make a judgment as to whether our next flows in Japan will be positive or negative, but there is still a risk from the heightened cost of hedging.","Jamminder Bhullar","And what's the amount associated with that? I think you had mentioned maybe $3 billion to $4 billion or something in that range before?","James McCaughan","Yes. The remaining investment-grade hedge piece is $3 billion.","Jamminder Bhullar","Okay. And then if Luis is there, if he could talk about just the environment in Brazil. It seems like the entire sort of pension industry is troubling there. And what needs to happen for that to improve?","Daniel Houston","Just a quick comment before Luis gets into that, Jimmy. I mentioned in my prepared comments -- we've had a lot of conversations around Europe for a long time. We identify emerging markets as a place that you want to do business. You have to accept a lot of the conditions that are in place, one of which, of course, is typically more politically volatile, although I say that somewhat hesitantly with the backdrop here in the U.S. and some of our policies. Secondly and perhaps more importantly, it's just the volatility in the local economic markets, whether you're measuring currency, you're measure economic output. But I think Luis and his team have just done an outstanding job identifying the right markets for us to be in. Brazil certainly falls under that category. I couldn't feel more confident about that management team's ability to manage their way through this rough patch in Brazil. But with that, I'll turn it over to Luis to answer your question very specifically.","Luis Vald\u00e9s","Okay. Thanks, Dan. Jimmy, let me first start saying that we certainly remain optimistic on Brazil and its economic recovery. And also, the second quarter slowed down or a speed bump that we have, we think that is effectively behind us today. With that, let me say that because of the economic downturn that Brazil has had, the entire industry -- the pension industry has seen a 30% decrease in their deposit year-to-date. Despite of that, Brasilprev has generated net customer cash flows of $4.6 billion in a TTM basis, which is a very commendable 7% over beginning of a period AUM. So we continue performing extremely well. You have to remember that probably 3 years ago, we have 50% of the total net customer cash flows of that industry. Certainly, we were first mover. We were very aggressive. And we have plenty of conveyors there, so we do have today more than 20% of that market share, which is very commendable as well. I will say that if you're looking at our net customer cash flows and its evolution in Page #18 of our supplement, you will see that our withdrawals, they really performed very stable. It's pretty much more the softness in new deposits that's driving down a little bit our net customer cash flows, even having -- so that's $300 million positive for the second quarter, having that sort of a hiccup in the economy in Brazil is very commendable. So a very strong business, a very resilient strategy, and certainly, we do have a great company there.","Jamminder Bhullar","Just a question on the group benefits business. Your results have been consistently better than expected there and, I think, overall, generally better than competitors' results as well. So what is that you feel is helping you, especially on the margin side? And then also, is your outlook now for the business a little more upbeat than it would have been maybe 6 months or a year ago?","Daniel Houston","I suspect Amy might say it's all about leadership. But we'll see what her actual answer is. Amy?","Amy Friedrich","Sure, thanks for the question. I think the way you kind of asked the question is that the results have been better than expected. And I guess, what I'd just give you some insight into is when we really made the commitment years ago to dig deep into the small- to medium-sized business market, we expected results like this. So our technology investments that we've been making, the investments that we've -- and tools we've put in the hands of the brokers and advisors who serve this market and then the great products that we're building behind it, things like the great dental network, sitting with great dental and vision products, have really started to pay off. And again, when we do business in one piece of business or 100 pieces of business that are employer who have 40 lives or 50 lives or 60 lives of people that they provide these benefits to, you sometimes don't make the headlines. But what I would say is we feel very strongly this is the right market to be in. Small business owners need and value our help. They reward you with loyalty. And it means that some of the things that you run into in the larger case market with price pressures simply aren't present in the small case marketplace. So we feel very good about our competitive position in that marketplace, and we feel good that our outlook, to the extent we've given you outlook on this business, is still appropriate. We certainly revisit that on an annual basis, and so you'll hear more from us on that.","Operator","The next question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","I was actually hoping Luis might be able to speak a little bit more broadly about the international business outside of just Brazil. And just as we see some of the macro and political noise, where are you seeing or which markets are most exposed to kind of disruption in emerging markets? And how are you seeing the underlying growth dynamics in other countries?","Daniel Houston","It's a good question, Erik, and I appreciate that. Just a quick comment. I was actually in China just last week visiting with a lot of senior government officials and, of course, our very close friends at China Construction Bank, of which we, as you know, have an open MOU as we continue to explore expanding that relationship. And I would tell you that in spite of a lot of the rhetoric that we're hearing about in terms of trade, and it is a topic of discussion, I don't believe that those issues are standing in our way of advancing our relationships in Southeast Asia or Latin America for that matter. But with that, I'll turn it over to Luis.","Luis Vald\u00e9s","Okay. Thanks, Erik, for your question. And let me start giving you a fact that probably is going to help you in order to have a better picture about our countries in emerging markets. If you're putting Brazil aside and its currency, and if you're looking what has been the volatility for all our currencies, the relationship and correlation with the euro is almost 1. So the volatility, in particular, for FX is a global thing and theme. It's not just related to the emerging market. Even if you're looking at the correlation with the Malaysian ringgit or the Chilean peso, it's almost 1. So it's very, very correlated. So that's number one. Number two, certainly, we have had some additional volatility and some kind of global and geopolitical issues that are under discussion. But if you're looking at our portfolio and how our portfolio has evolved in the last 3 to 4 years, we're in much better shape than we were three years ago.","So we're less exposed to countries like Brazil, and we have a much more balanced portfolio than we used to have. If you're looking at our portfolio in terms of net customer cash flows, we have generated TTM, in the last 12 months, $8.3 billion in net customer cash flows from $6.7 billion a year ago. So that is a 24% increase in our net customer cash flows TTM in the last period. And if you're looking to the supplement, a very important part of that net customer cash flows are coming from our subsidiaries in Asia. So having said that, I would say that in terms of volatility, we're very much more well prepared in order to weather any particular situation going forward. Our portfolio is much more well diversified. Our production is much more well diversified and operating earnings. In particular, the country that is being the outlier has been Brazil. But as I said before, we remain confident. We're going to have some volatility going forward. We are facing presidential elections on October 7. August is going to be a very interesting month to pay attention to because the presidential candidates are going to be defined. So more to come, Erik.","Daniel Houston","Erik, did you have a follow-up?","Erik Bass","Yes. Just a follow-up for Jim on the institutional pipeline. And some comments we've heard from other asset managers is that there's been a slowdown in the funding of some institutional mandates given moves in interest rates and spreads, particularly around things like core fixed income or high yield. Just curious if that's a dynamic that you're seeing at all.","Daniel Houston","You have some color, Jim?","James McCaughan","Yes. Not really, Erik. If you look at institutional mandates, there are always some of them were they say, great news, you've got the fund, and the money funds 12 months later. That can happen. But I don't see that really changed a lot. That may be a function of some of the specialty asset classes we're in. So that's an excuse I wouldn't make.","Operator","The next question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Maybe a follow-up, Dan. You've made a comment about progress on the China MOU. I guess, what are your thoughts on potential timing of that happening? And then how should we think about, if that does happen, I guess, the capital that you'd potentially put into that new structure?","Daniel Houston","Yes. So good question. The first thing I would say is these things, as you know, are very difficult to predict. There's a lot of people that have to make decisions, including regulators, when you have a foreign buyer coming in to take a minority share. We have had a very healthy dialogue with the appropriate government officials who would ultimately have to approve our purchasing a piece of an existing retirement company that is owned by China Construction Bank. We've had very healthy dialogues at the most senior levels of the bank. We've also had those same conversations within the subsidiary company that manage these assets.","The MOU, as you know, is already underway in terms of already exploring the use of our technology, the capabilities and expertise that we can bring to the table. But I'd like to think that sometime in the next sort of 6 to 9 months, we can bring resolution. In terms of capital, that's an item that has not been completely quantified at this point in time. It's a manageable number. We would have a minority stake. And as those details become more clear, we'll be sure and share those with you. But again, I don't look at it as a -- in a magnitude of our balance sheet as being a disruptive sort of number to gain access to the retirement market. In terms of its impact, once we do buy in, it's a little bit like all these other businesses that Luis and Jim have built over the years, which is it doesn't happen the first couple of years, but you find that will -- flying as time goes on and generating strong profits down the road. So again, we want to be there. We can see the economic upside of doing so and feel good about our chances of getting there.","Ryan Krueger","That's great. And then on the RBC ratio, once the tax reform impact comes due, do you anticipate changing your 415% to 425% target?","Daniel Houston","Yes. Let me ask Deanna to make a quick comment there.","Deanna Strable","Yes. Ryan, good question. That's something we're going to probably continue to evaluate. What I would say here, and I've mentioned it before, we feel in a really strong position relative to our ability to absorb that change and still have a risk-based capital that is at a level that we feel very good about. So we're sitting here today above our targeted range. We've estimated the impact to be about 45 percentage points. And when you put those 2 together, I'm confident we will still have a risk-based capital range that will be at\/or just slightly below our current target. And then what we'll do is continue to watch the industry, watch our competitors and obviously react to rating agency reaction and evaluate whether that 415% to 425% remains a good target going forward.","Operator","The next question will come from John Nadel with UBS.","John Nadel","I guess, I didn't quite realize that variable investment income on a trailing 12-month basis was that much below your target. I think you had mentioned $86 million. Although that may just be $86 million lower than the prior trailing 12 months, which I don't know if that was elevated. So can you just give us a sense, how do things compare to a normalized level? Like what is that normalized level? It does appear that it's affecting revenue comps.","Daniel Houston","Yes. Thanks, John. Deanna?","Deanna Strable","Yes. The $86 million that I referred to on my prepared remarks or what you heard earlier today is not the shortfall in the current trailing month period. It's really comparing the fact that we had pretty positive impacts that we called out in the prior trailing 12. And so the delta between the 2 is $86 million. How we go about that is going into a year, obviously, we've embedded into our guidance a certain amount of variable investment income. And a portion -- and some of that is just hard to predict. And so what we'll call out in a given quarter, some of it is hard to predict, some of it is lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and we'll be consistent both on the plus end and the negative end, calling out when the current quarter is different than what we've expected. I'd say that the positives that we saw in the trailing 12-month period, we saw some good prepays during that period. We also saw some good benefits from real estate. I'd say if you look at the more recent quarters, prepays have become much more difficult and real estate has just been lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And so again, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on that. If you want to go into more detail, we can do that offline. But it does, as you mentioned, have some impacts on the OE -- reported OE and revenue growth quarter-to-quarter.","John Nadel","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just a follow-up to Jim on the fee rate in Principal Global. Was there any impact in this current quarter, 2Q, from performance fees? Because I'm with John Barnidge on the -- it really did jump. And I recognize what you've been saying for a while is coming through in terms of the shift, the sort of barbell approach year, but it seems pretty significant in a single period of time.","Daniel Houston","Yes. Yes, please, Jim, go ahead.","James McCaughan","To quantify that, John, performance fees in the second quarter totaled $6.8 million. Typically, 1\/3 to 1\/2 of performance fees come through to profits. So there was a boost but not a very large one. The comment I'd make on performance fees is, as you know, 2017 and the first half of 2018 have been much lower than the previous 2 years in performance fees. We had some really good harvesting of performance fees on real estate in the earlier couple of years, in 2015, 2016. I think long term, the average of performance fees will be somewhere between the heightened experience of the previous two years and the rather meager experience of the last 1.5 years. The reason I say it'll be a little lower is absolute return prospects and investments are going to be constrained by relatively low interest rates. But as you know, having said that, hope you -- I hope it's helpful to give you the exact quantification of performance fees. And I think that long term, they're going to be a material contributor even if not in every quarter to the way we show our results.","Operator","The final question is from Suneet Kamath with Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Just want to ask on the competitive environment. I mean, when we look at the RIS-Fee business and we calculate the fee rate, it looks like that continues to come down. And I know there's different ways to calculate it, and your internal view may be different than what we're seeing externally. So I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on what you're seeing in terms of competition on the fee side. And has there been any progress or momentum on the side of your charging fees based on headcount as opposed to AUM in the small case market?","Daniel Houston","Sure, and I'll let Nora jump right into this. But if I could, just kind of at a macro level, Suneet, something to think about here is the fact that this has always been a competitive space for as long as I can remember. We actually are a bit unique in that we've got quite a different mix between small, medium and large, all of which generate different revenue flows. We've also been fortunate over the years to have a disproportionate larger percentage of the assets go to proprietary investment options. And as we migrate towards more open architecture, there is pressure there. But having said all of that, the sales organization and Nora and her team have done a really good job meeting the needs of the marketplace, while at the same time, maintaining really good margins, and at the same time, making huge investments in the business. So Nora, do you want to go and add to that, please?","Nora Everett","Sure. So Suneet, we've talked about this before. And this quarter, it actually was masked a little bit by the lower net investment income. But if you look even quarter-over-quarter, our fee revenue growth is up 4%, up $12.7 million. And that is actually as expected, and we've talked about this before. We look at -- and this is an industry trend as well, as you look at that average account value going up and relate that to revenue growth, you're going to see, we all are going to see that gap. It's a longstanding industry trend.","We tend to see it between 4% and 8%, the gap between average account value growth and revenue growth. Sometimes it's going to be more. Sometimes it's going to be less. It's noisy quarter-over-quarter, so we take a longer-term view. But certainly, all the things you mentioned are captured in that gap. There is -- and to Dan's point, it has been competitive for many, many years. And within that gap, not only you're going to see competitive pricing, but you're going to see product mix changes, you're going to see investment lineup changes. So all of that is captured.","So certainly, no new news here. What I like to refocus on is just how important that makes that underlying fundamental growth around plan growth, participant growth, account value growth, winning our fair share and oftentimes more with regard to this very, very successful retirement investment platform that we have, especially in that target date suite, just very significant success there in our ability as we move through that suite. Today, our CIT hybrid, that combination of active and passive is still very successful. So that combination of the work that Jim and his team are doing from an asset management perspective and my team is doing from a distribution and service perspective continues to resonate in the market, and we continue to win more than our fair share.","Daniel Houston","Thanks, Nora. Suneet, did you have a real quick follow-up?","Suneet Kamath","Yes. Just wanted to quickly follow up on PRT. We have been hearing from some other companies that maybe pricing there is getting more competitive. Just want to get a sense of what you're seeing. It sounds like you're optimistic about growth on the back half of the year.","Daniel Houston","Yes. It is a good question. And maybe just because we're out of time here, I'll take this one real quickly. And the fact of the matter is this has been a sweet spot for us for a long time. We tend to play at the smaller to medium-sized end of the spectrum. We view the business as being very optimistic. We're very disciplined at how we go about the pension risk transfer business. Although the first half of the year was a little bit light here, we anticipate making it up in the second half of the year. We like it. It's core to our strategy. And again, of all things I worry about, that's frankly just not one of them. So thank you for the questions, Suneet.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Houston, your closing comments, please.","Daniel Houston","Yes. Just to be very brief here, my quick observations are the following, and that is it was a -- from our perspective, a good quarter and a very good half to the first start of the year. We have taken a very balanced approach with capital deployment. You heard Deanna specifically frame the acquisitions that we have made and that they are accretive, which we feel good about. Also, I want to reemphasize, we're going to continue to invest in this business. For long-term shareholder value, we must continue to make those investments. And the fact that -- and I thought Luis and Jim did a really nice job here covering the emerging markets. By their very nature, they're going to be volatile. But we need to be there, where there's a lot of upside growth for shareholders.","Just as a reminder to what John had shared at the beginning of the conversation, we are going to have an investor meeting in Tokyo on September 28. We'd love to have you join us and also again in November 15 in New York City. So again, thank you for your interest in the company, and look forward to seeing you on the road here in the next few months. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

Welcome to the Principal Financial Group's first quarter conference call. As always, our earnings release, financial supplement and slides related to today's call are available on our website at principal.com\/investor. Following the reading of the Safe Harbor Provision, CEO, Dan Houston, and CFO, Terry Lillis, will deliver some prepared remarks, then we will open up the call for questions.

This morning, I'll provide some high-level comments on the quarter. I'll also then give an update on how we continue to execute on our strategy, with a focus on long-term growth and generating value for our shareholders. I'll also provide some color on the Department of Labor's final fiduciary regulation, and the opportunities and the impact on our business. I'll then turn the call over to Terry, who will provide additional details on financial results. As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are available on our website. The key themes are outlined on slide four.","Principal had a solid start to the year, as we continue to focus on meeting the needs of our customers. Our first quarter results were impacted by volatile equity markets, low-interest rates and unfavorable currency exchange. Once again, our diversified business model, by product offering, by geography, and by asset class, helped stabilize earnings and grow assets under management. Despite challenging operating conditions on a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $1.2 billion of after-tax operating earnings and increased assets under management to a record $548 billion.","These results demonstrate our ability to focus on the things within our control, like delivering outcomes-based solutions to customers around the world, and maintaining industry-leading margins in a competitive environment. Importantly, the fundamentals of the business remain strong. As slide five shows, more than 90% of our investment options were in the top two Morningstar quartiles, on a three year and five year basis.","Additionally, we received several third-party recognitions for performance in the first quarter, as shown on slide six. Barron's Magazine recognized Principal as the sixth best mutual fund manager, based on a five-year period, and as a top five municipal manager. CIMB-Principal won the award for the best Asia Pacific Equity Fund at the 2016 Morningstar awards, and won six 2016 Edge-Lipper Fund awards, including Best Overall Group. Hong Kong was awarded the MPF Scheme of the Year, in 2016 MPF awards. Mexico was awarded the Best Balance Fund, in 2015, by Morningstar.","Outstanding investment performance, coupled with our broad multi-channel distribution network, enabled us to generate more than $3 billion in total company net cash flows for the quarter, and $17 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, while many in the industry experienced outflows. The Retirement and Income Solutions fee business had $3 billion of quarterly net cash flows, due to strong sales and planned level retention in the quarter. Principal Global Investors had a single large, passively-managed currency overlay mandate lapse in the first quarter.","Equity and fixed-income net cash flows were $3 billion in total, as our distinctive active strategies and outcome-based solutions continue to resonate with investors. And Principal International had its 30th consecutive quarter of positive reported net cash flows.","Next, I'll provide some examples of how we continue to strengthen our competitive position. I'll start with a comment on our global brand launch, followed by ways we're enhancing our solution set, expanding distribution, and improving customer outcomes. One of the more notable achievements for the quarter was the roll-out of our refreshed global brand. Our new brand better represents how we help people in all life stages achieve financial success. The brand underscores our commitment to the underserved markets, including small and medium sized businesses in the U.S., and emerging markets with growing middle class populations in Latin America and Asia, and it reflects our intensified focus on making it easier for everyone, individuals, business owners, advisors, and institutional clients to do business with us.","In March, we planted another important seed in Asia. We signed a memorandum of understanding with China Construction Bank, the second largest bank in the world, to develop a new asset management and pension partnership. Principal and China Construction Bank jointly created CCB Principal Asset Management Company in 2005, and it has become a leading fund management company in China. This new agreement enhances our existing long-term successful relationship and is a key to creating future opportunities for Principal to participate in the significant pension and asset management opportunities in China.","Also in the quarter, we purchased the remaining stake in Claritas. With the leading asset manager in Brazil, we are well-positioned to capture the growing opportunity as investors seek to diversify their portfolio by geography and asset class. Claritas also provides a mutual fund distribution platform in Brazil for several funds managed by Principal Global Investors, further expanding the synergies of our business. Despite political and economic volatility, Brazil continues to generate positive cash flows and remains a very important market for us with excellent long-term growth opportunities.","Moving to our solution set, we further expanded our investment and distribution platform in the first quarter, launching two new ETF's, the Price Setters Index ETF and the Shareholder Yield Index ETF. Our Target Date Collective Investment Trust, or CITs, are gaining significant traction in the retirement space, including the defined contribution investment only channel due to strong investment performance. At the end of the first quarter, eight out of 12 of the funds in our Target Date CIT series were in the top decile on a three-year and five-year basis. The demand for our Target Date investment options remain high among retirement plan clients, as we provide broad, diversified choices with our multi-manager options, including both active and passive strategies.","In addition to expanding our investment platform, we continue to invest in innovative customer solutions to drive further growth. Following are examples of recent initiatives to help people get on the path to financial security and improve customer outcomes.","We recently launched Principal Pension Builder, which gives participants the opportunity to purchase an in-plan annuity, giving them easy access to guaranteed income through their retirement. We continue our efforts to aggressively promote PlanWorks, our suite of best-in-class plan designs that include features like automatic enrollment and automatic deferral increases. These plan designs are resulting in higher participation and higher savings rates versus traditional opt-in plan designs. Additionally, we recently introduced My Virtual Coach, which is driving outcomes, as well. This innovative, virtual assisted, interactive enrollment and education tool makes it easier than ever for 401(k) plan participants to save for retirement and appeals to a new generation of investors.","On the protection side, we're also using technology to improve the customer experience when buying life and disability insurance. Recently we launched the first phase of a digital sales solution for these products on principal.com. The solution delivers tools to help potential customers assess their coverage needs, get a price quote, and obtain assistance to complete the process.","Turning to slide seven, I'll close with comments on the final fiduciary rule released by the Department of Labor on April 6. Though we're still thoroughly reviewing the nearly 1000 page document, I have some overall comments to make. As we've said before, we remain concerned that some individuals will receive less help in the future than they do today. That said, we remain hopeful we can work with the Department of Labor towards the end goal of helping Americans adequately prepare for retirement. Implementation is clearly top of mind, and we continue to work with the industry and distribution firms to clarify this complex rule and design responsive business models to serve clients, regardless of size. There will certainly be transition cost and higher ongoing compliance cost, but we don't expect a significant increase in our run rate expenses.","Importantly, based on our review of the final rule, we'll still be able to help small businesses with their retirement plans and our affiliated distribution channels will still be able to sell proprietary products. We'll continue to lead the industry by creating sustainable solutions that meet the needs of the market by managing assets appropriate for retirement and other long-term strategies and by providing a diversified portfolio of in-plan offerings and systematic withdrawal solutions.","Despite the challenges, we believe we'll continue to gain market share as distribution firms potentially limit who they work with to a smaller number of providers that can help them manage and comply with the revised rules. We'll also gain market share as we accelerate growth of our defined contribution investment-only business and experience higher retention rates of retirees.","In closing, I remain optimistic about the remainder of 2016 and beyond. The fundamentals of the business are strong and we'll continue to strengthen our competitive position, despite an operating environment that remains challenging. Terry?","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Dan. This morning I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter, net income, including performance of the investment portfolio, and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. As Dan said, we viewed first quarter results as a solid start to 2016. Despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, we see the strength of the underlying fundamentals of our business and signs that some headwinds experienced for some time might be weakening.","Total company after-tax operating earnings for the first quarter were $286 million, a 12% decline versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting a continued volatile operating environment. An important proxy for our fee revenue is the S&P 500 daily average, which was down approximately 5% compared to both the first and fourth quarters of 2015. This negatively impacted the daily average revenue from our fee businesses, the primary driver of earnings. This is the first time since third quarter of 2009 that the S&P 500 daily average declined compared to the prior-year period.","Additionally, foreign currency translation negatively impacted current quarter earnings, compared to the prior year quarter. Operating earnings are translated using the average currency exchange rates; however, for the first time since second quarter 2014, the U.S. dollar spot rate weakened versus all three of our Latin American currencies during the quarter. This was a benefit to assets under management, as foreign exchange for assets under management is translated on a spot rate basis. Over the long-term, we continued to align revenue and expense growth to strike the right balance of growth and profitability. Expense initiatives started in the first quarter, will benefit earnings in the second half of the year and beyond.","As shown on slide eight, reported earnings per share were $0.97 for first quarter 2016, an 8% decline compared to the normalized year-ago quarter, reflecting the impact of the exchange rate and volatile equity markets. At the end of the first quarter, return-on-equity excluding AOCI, other than foreign currency translation adjustment was 13.4%. The 160 basis point decline from first quarter 2015 is predominantly due to the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar and lower prepayment fees.","Now, I'll discuss business unit results, starting on slide nine with retirement income solutions, or RIS Fee businesses. First quarter pre-tax operating earnings of $114 million were down 17% from the normalized year-ago quarter. Quarterly net revenue decreased 6% from the prior year normalized quarter, driven by unfavorable equity market conditions. On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pre-tax return on net revenue was 30%. After normalizing for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, pre-tax return on net revenue was 32%. Given normal market conditions, we are confident our industry-leading margin will continue to be within our previously stated range of 28% to 32% throughout 2016.","RIS Fee had strong net cash flow of $3 billion in the first quarter. For full year 2016, we still expect net cash flows to be in our stated 1% to 3% range as we continue to strike the right balance of growth and profitability. The balance of strong sales and retention, combined with expected equity market returns and continued expense alignment, should drive a stronger finish to 2016.","Turning to slide 10, RIS Spread quarterly pre-tax operating earnings were $67 million, a 10% increase over the year-ago quarter. The rise in earnings, which is in-line with the 10% growth in the RIS Spread average account values, was driven by strong sales of all Spread products. On a trailing 12-month basis, the normalized pre-tax return on net revenue was 55%, and within our guided range. RIS Spread continues to perform well, as the market volatility has created opportunities, as clients welcome guaranteed solutions, even in the low-interest rate environment. The pipeline remains strong, and we continue to approach the pension closeout and investment-only businesses opportunistically.","Turning to slide 11. Principal Global Investors reported pre-tax operating earnings of $80 million in the first quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by volatile market performance, as well as lower performance and transaction fees in first quarter 2016. The low performance and transaction fees in the first quarter were a result of timing differences, as we see good visibility for more normal levels in the remainder of 2016. While these performance and transactions fees fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the best measure of our ongoing development in asset management is management fees. These increased slightly from a year-ago quarter, and increased more than 6% on a trailing 12-month basis, in-spite of the severe industry headwinds. On a trailing 12-month basis, the pre-tax return on adjusted revenue was 33%, and within our expected range.","Quarterly net cash flows were a positive $700 million, despite the lapse of a $3.3 billion passively-managed, low-fee currency overlay mandate. The new business pipeline remains strong.","Slide 12 shows quarterly pre-tax operating earnings for Principal International of $68 million. On a constant currency basis and adjusting for encaje performance, Principal International continues to have mid-teens growth in operating earnings. First quarter 2016 encaje performance was $4 million pre-tax lower than expected, while the year-ago quarter benefited $5 million pre-tax from better than expected encaje performance.","We're continuing to build traction in China. Quarterly pre-tax operating earnings in China more than tripled over the prior-year quarter, providing further diversification within Principal International. We continue to work with our joint venture partner, China Construction Bank, to develop a diversified product portfolio and provide investment solutions for long-term savings. Compared to the prior-year quarter, the strengthening U.S. dollar suppressed Principal International pre-tax operating earnings by $16 million.","Over the trailing 12-months, foreign exchange has reduced Principal International assets under management by $9 billion. However, strengthening Latin American currencies in the latter part of the first quarter 2016 had a favorable $8 billion impact on assets under management in the quarter. If sustained, this improved exchange rate could provide a tailwind to next quarter's operating earnings.","Moving to slide 13. Specialty Benefits quarterly pre-tax operating earnings were $39 million. First quarter 2015 was positively impacted by the recovery of reinsurance premiums, partially offset by higher expenses. After normalizing prior-year results, pre-tax operating earnings decreased 5%. Growth in the block of business was offset by higher individual disability claims compared to the prior period, which can be volatile in any one quarter. The overall loss ratio for the first quarter was within the targeted range.","The underlying fundamentals of the business remain strong, with record sales and retention, and normalized premium and fee growth of 8%, as well as double-digit increase in trailing 12-month pre-tax operating earnings. As a reminder, Specialty Benefits operating earnings are seasonally impacted by higher first quarter dental and vision claims, and higher first quarter non-deferred sales-related expenses. Typically, distribution of annual earnings in this business is 20% in the first quarter, 25% in the second and third quarters, and 30% in the fourth quarter.","As shown on slide 14, individual life pre-tax operating earnings were $42 million for the quarter. An increase of 19% from the prior-year period. This was a strong result, leading to pre-tax margin of 16%, which is at the higher end of our range. Results of this quarter were driven by higher interest margins, as well as favorable mortality on a growing block of business. Business market sales remained strong at 56% of total sales in the first quarter.","Corporate pre-tax operating losses of $53 million were lower than expected, due to timing of some of our funded initiatives. We anticipate full-year 2016 corporate pre-tax operating losses to be at the lower end of our previously announced range of $235 million to $265 million. For the quarter, total company net income was $368 million, including net-realized capital gains of $82 million. Lower interest rates led to gains of $112 million in our derivative portfolio, partially offset by $30 million of credit-related losses. Our investment portfolio continues to perform in-line with expectations, as credit stress was isolated to the energy and basic industry sectors. We remain confident in our diversified, high-quality investment portfolio. Again, due to our disciplined asset liability management, we're not forced sellers in stressed times.","As outlined on slide 15, we continue to target $800 million to $1 billion of capital deployment in 2016. In first quarter 2016, we paid a $0.38 common stock dividend. A strong dividend yield in the current low-interest rate environment. Last night, we announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $0.39 per share, payable in the second quarter, as we continue to increase our dividend payout ratio.","In addition, we repurchased $86 million worth of common stock in the first quarter, completing the remainder of our 2015 authorization. In February, our board of directors authorized an additional $400 million share repurchase program. $389 million of that authorization remained outstanding at the end of the first quarter.","We continue to have a balanced approach to capital deployment, and consider all options, including dividends, acquisitions, share repurchase, and reducing our leverage ratio. In the current environment, we view share repurchase as an effective way to increase long-term value for shareholders. Despite the volatile operating environment, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we will continue to focus on things within our control to drive growth and profitability for the long term.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Jim, I was wondering if you could talk about the factors that pressured PGI margins this quarter? I know there are a couple of timing items on fees and other things. And what your outlook is, going forward? And how you think about balancing margins with investing for growth, particularly if markets remain choppy?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, good morning, Erik. This is Dan. Thanks for the question. And you're right, let's get right to it and have Jim delve into some of those details. Jim?","James Patrick McCaughan - President, Global Asset Management and Chief Executive Officer, Principal Global Investors","Yeah, thank you, Erik. You all have seen from page three of the supplement that management fee revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, we show that in this thing called other revenue. The two biggest parts of other revenue are borrower fees on commercial mortgage origination and incentive fees on various strategies from hedge funds to real estate funds to various institutional accounts that have an incentive fee. So those are shown in other revenues. And you'll see, if you look back at the trailing 12-months, that's been typically, give or take, 20% to 25% of our total revenues at PGI. It's been pretty steady.","What's happened during the first quarter is that borrowers on commercial mortgages delayed closing because of market instability, and it so happened \u2013 this is partly random, actually, that the incentive fees were actually basically zero in the first quarter. Now the incentive fees can be on a one-year cycle, a three-year cycle, or be dependent on the realization of the underlying asset. Those are really the three ways they tend to operate.","And most quarters we get some, they're as you know, back-end loaded to the fourth quarter, which is partly why we show trailing 12-months in the supplement. But this preamble is really a build up to a couple of numbers I can give you, if I can identify them here in my notes. If you look at the quarter, the year-ago quarter, just for example, was a typical 20% other-revenue quarter. We had $264.2 million of management fees and $64.7 million of other revenue. The quarter just ended that we're reporting on had $265.4 million of management fees, so actually up slightly on the year-ago quarter, but only $44.2 million of other revenue, as all the phenomenon I mentioned were slowing client activities.","We have done a pretty thorough bottom-up analysis of what other revenues will look like during the rest of the year. And we are basically anticipating that the year will be much more typical over the last two years or three years, and that really what has happened is a little bit random, but more important, the client activities will pick up again. So we remain pretty perky about what the year as a whole will look like.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. That's helpful. And then, so I guess two things. So it sounds like you're still comfortable with what your margin targets that you've laid out for the full year. And then secondly, just on the thoughts around balancing investment for growth, with maintaining margins in the short-term?","James Patrick McCaughan - President, Global Asset Management and Chief Executive Officer, Principal Global Investors","Yeah thank you, Erik. Yeah, absolutely. The slight depression of margins taking the first quarter on its own was simply due to a relatively low, an anomalously low revenues for the reasons I described. We're pretty confident that the 33% to 36% range that we mentioned for return on net revenue in the guidance call in December, that remains a pretty good guide to how we'll look for the year on all current indications.","In terms of investment for growth, as you know, we're one of the few global asset managers who's actually growing revenues at the moment. There's a lot of rather vicious industry headwinds. The volumes in new business we're taking on are definitely leading to elevated costs, both the costs of taking the business on in terms of commission and set-up expenses, but also developing our sales force and our ability to serve clients, whether it's new share classes in mutual funds or new offices internationally, those are all expansionary things we're doing, but they're all costing money. And that's why 33% to 36% remains our guideline, not higher. There are asset managers with higher margins, there's a few, but they are mostly firms who are not growing, or even in some cases shrinking. I would rather have our balance. But I hope that answers the question, Erik.","Operator","Your next question -","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Very good. Thanks, Jim. And, Erik, just one other comment I'll make relative to PGI, that gives me a lot of confidence about, Jim's recovering on the revenue line there, we still have very strong investment performance. Those three-year and five-year numbers are very strong, and if you look across the asset classes, again, whether it's fixed income, alternatives, real estate or equities, very strong performance in each one of those. And very broad distribution, both proprietary distribution, as well as third-party distribution. So a lot of very positive momentum behind Principal Global Investors to work with the rest of the organization. With that, we'll take the next question, operator.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess I have, also, an expense question, but more for the overall company. It seemed like you held down expenses pretty well in the first quarter, in a tough revenue environment. Can you talk a little bit about expectations for the rest of the year? And if you've been doing anything specific to cut back on expenses, given the choppiness out there?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Ryan, I think what we want to do is be very smart about how we manage our expenses relative to our ability to increase revenues, do away with products and services customers are no longer willing to pay for. And then also ensure that we're making those proper investments, as Jim was describing, with that as a backdrop, I'll have Terry add some additional detail.","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, thanks, Ryan for the question. As we talked about in the past, we look at the relationship between our growth in our revenue and our growth in our expenses. We've always tried to have this 1% to 2% differential, i.e. the revenue growing faster than expenses. But when you look back to 2014 as part of the trailing 12-months, and as always, we try to look at it over a longer period of time because of some volatility that could occur in any one particular period. 2014 was a pretty tough comparison because of the strong revenue growth, as well as the expenses that we had.","So, looking at it in terms of more of a sequential basis, you've seen a pretty significant reduction in our expense growth from fourth quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. It's down approximately 5% or $44 million. Now, we think that as you go forward, we're going to continue to align our expenses and revenue. And as Jim talked about, his look into the future of PGI, we also look across all of our organizations, and we feel more comfortable about the growth rate for the entire year. If you look at 2016, compared to 2015, we'll see that 1% differential in our revenue growth. We think that 2015 is probably a more comparable year, and if you look at expenses in the first quarter of 2016, I'd say that that's probably more comparable to what you'll see in the rest of the year than what we saw in the fourth quarter this (sic) [last] (31:36) year.","So, again, we look at the growth rate of expenses and try to make sure that we get that good comparison with the growth rate of revenues. And any one particular quarter, it is tough to do. As you saw in the first quarter, a significant decline in the equity markets having an impact on our revenue, on a short-term basis. Our expenses will catch up with that for the rest of the year. I hope that helps.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","That's helpful. So the best way to think about it is, based on what you can control, you'll ratchet up and down the expenses, and try to be within 1% or 2% of revenue. And that's your expectation for this year, is that the right way to think about it?","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Exactly. That's the way we've looked at it in the past, and that's the way we'll continue to look at it in the future.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. A couple on the DOL. First, could you discuss maybe affiliated distribution? How their payments might change under the final rule, from what currently exists?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, be happy to do that. And I got to tell you, Steven, I just want to make a couple more comments on DOL more broadly, just to set the tone, in addition to my earlier prepared comments.","We just can't, as a country, lose the fact that we've amassed $15 trillion in roll-over IRA's, 401(k)s. Another $7 trillion in defined benefit. There's $22 trillion in this country, which arguably would make it the most successful retirement system anywhere in the world. Secondly, the DOL, I believe their intentions are good. When I think about the intent of the law, it's to protect the interest of the U.S. retirement savers. It's about creating transparency around cost and benefits and value. It's also about making sure we have access to the competitive marketplace.","There are some unintended consequences, and it's what Deanna will respond to in just a minute, relative to working with advisors. There's a view that the robo-solution solves all problems for small account balance holders. That's just not the case. And so, we have some more work to do there. The second is, we want to make sure that we're not creating barriers that reduce the number of advisors that have in the past, and will in the future, provide important education to individuals and to savers. And then, we also want to make sure that we don't limit the number of individualized solutions that we can present to planned participants. They're very dependent on that enroller, if you will. So with that as a backdrop, I'll ask Deanna to weigh in on the implications on Principal Advisor Network, and how we might have to do things slightly differently.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Dan, thank you.","Deanna D. Strable-Soethout - President-US Insurance Solutions","Yeah, thanks. Just a couple of comments. And first of all, I want to put into kind of context, the impact on our affiliated distribution. And so, first, I think it's important to point out that our advisors sell and service across the entire range of product offerings, including many products within Principal that are not impacted by the DOL regulation. In fact, the majority of that system's revenue comes from transactions that aren't impacted by the proposal.","Having said that, I think there's a couple of points that I think is important to keep in mind, as we think about even those products that do fall under the regulation. First of all, as Dan mentioned in his opening remarks, the final regs did allow for a path forward on proprietary products, and that applies to both funds within a retirement plan, as well as retail products sold at the time of either retirement or when participants change jobs.","I think the other thing to keep in mind is, our affiliated advisors already today have choice. We have both proprietary and non-proprietary products and solutions. And our proprietary offerings will have to continue to compete on items such as investment performance and service, as they do today. So, we will have some business model changes for that channel. That'll come in the realm of compensation changes, like you mentioned, compliance. But I think we're very confident that our business model can adjust, and feel good about our ability to comply, as well as continue to stay focused on meeting the needs of those customers that we serve.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Deanna, if I remember correctly, the affiliated distribution does get paid more on proprietary. My understanding is that you could still do proprietary, but if you're going to use the BIC, that has to go away? Is that right?","Deanna D. Strable-Soethout - President-US Insurance Solutions","Yeah, and those are things that we are looking at. In some of the places, we already have some comp leveling already in place, and other places, we will have to adjust. But I think it comes back to, our advisors already tried to do what's in the best interest of those clients. And, ultimately, we have great investment performance, we have great product features and good solutions, that we continue to feel that we'll have the ability to service our customers and sell both our products and the non-proprietary products within the platform, going forward.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, levelized commissions have been in place, Steven, for a long time. This is Dan. Levelized commissions have been in place for a long time. And I think it's only on the margin that we've had any additional sort of compensation, and that's going to be rationalized across the entire industry. And so, again, I don't see that as an impediment to the Principal Advisor Networks to continue going about doing what they do today, which is taking care of the customers and the participants.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And on the independent side of distribution, do you have distribution in which you will be considered the financial institution?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that is on a very limited basis. And the way I would describe that is, already within our call centers, we are providing information, we're providing some education, and we're not dispensing advice. As you know, our wholesalers work with independent third-party administrators. They work with wire houses, and all of our alliance partners to distribute our product. We don't sell these plans on a direct basis. It's the advisor who would be acting in the capacity of the fiduciary, in order to help them pick and choose the investments in these plans, so...","Go ahead.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Well, Dan, that's what I'm asking. What I'm asking is, you have a situation over in West Des Moines here, where the insurance company deals with independent agents, and would be considered a financial institution, under the BIC. And the question is, how can they be the financial institution, have the liability, and still be able to manage independent people who are going to do what they're going to do?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Good question. Let me add \u2013 Nora, is going to weigh in here and provide some additional color for you on that specific question.","Nora Mary Everett - President of Retirement and Investor Services and Chairman of Principal Funds","Yeah, Steven, that's not our model. They've got a different model than we have. And if you're talking about the retirement business that Dan was addressing.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah.","Nora Mary Everett - President of Retirement and Investor Services and Chairman of Principal Funds","Our model, as Dan said, is we're going to \u2013 we'll have a wholesaler who is working with that independent advisor, but to that point, that independent advisor in their firm would take on the obligations under the new DOL rule.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, All right, thank you. That's what I wanted to know, Nora. Thanks.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thank you. Appreciate it, Steven.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if, Dan, you had any update on the board's thoughts of the CFO search?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Sean, thanks for the question this morning. Terry's a tough guy to replace. We all know that. And we do have a search going on for both internal and external candidates. There is a, what I would consider to be a really good pool of candidates out there.","We'll have a board meeting later in May, at which I'll provide an update to the board on progress that we're making towards that end. But Terry's committed to staying on board as long as it takes, in order to get the new person appropriately aligned and on board here at Principal.","So, again, we feel very good about where we're at today in that search process.","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sean, this is Terry. Thanks for the question. Appreciate it.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","You're a hard man to replace, Terry. Given the $400 million authorization you got during the quarter, and where your shares were trading, I'm just wondering why \u2013 or if you can share with us your thoughts on why you didn't put the, I guess, the pedal to the floor and buy more stock when it was down at those levels?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the first thing I would say is you never know what level the stock is ever going to trade at. And so, again, we're very disciplined on how we go about executing on the share repurchase. Remember that we had an older share authorization that had been in place, which we completed, and so that was roughly $86 million --","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","$75 million.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","$75 million. And so good progress was made in closing out the previous authorization. We still have a lot of dry powder from here. But with that, I'll throw it over to Terry to add some additional color.","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Sean, as we looked at, and as we have looked at capital deployment, we've always looked at it in terms of a very balanced long-term view. We were looking for that \u2013 what will enhance the shareholders' value. Now, buying back shares is one of the options, but we look at all kinds of different things, in terms of to enhance shareholder value as well as distribute that value as it's created. If you look at over the last several years, you'd see we've done a pretty good job of balancing it between our organic growth and accusations in order to create shareholder value. And then increasing our dividend payout ratio as we just increased the dividend again as we march towards that 40% of net income. And then buybacks is just another part of the program here.","And so we've talked about in 2016, $800 million to $1 billion. And we're on track to do that. And we think that, as you mentioned, though, that the share buyback program is a very important part of that so far. So through the first quarter we had $86 million. As of yesterday, we added another $26 million in the program. So we're over $100 million now. We're looking at it over the long term. We do have a program that gets accelerated as the share price goes lower. Hopefully, we won't have to worry about that in the near future. But as we look into the second half of the year, we've got options. We've got opportunities to continue to pay out our dividend and increase it towards that 40% payout ratio. We're also looking at acquisition activity for the remainder of the year.","And as we've talked about in the past, we've looked at increasing our share of some PGI boutiques, and so we'll look at that as well. We'll also think about the share buyback, so as I mentioned, we've continued to build that out, and so we've got over $360 million yet in our authorization. So that is a very integral part of the share buyback \u2013 excuse me \u2013 of capital deployment strategy in this environment.","And then, we're also going to continue to look at opportunities to change our capital structure and reduce our debt leverage because we do have some high-coupon debt out there that we could, if the opportunity presents itself, use that for that. So we're going to continue very balanced, disciplined, long-term approach to our capital deployment strategy, and I think we're well on our way to distributing that $800 million to $1 billion. Hope that helps.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Terry.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to go to the FSA business. You talked about hitting the 1% to 3% beginning of period, in terms of sales or blows in (44:40). I think in that commentary, there was some talk about balancing growth and discipline. So can you just give some color on what you're seeing in the pricing market in the 401(k) business?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Suneet. Appreciate that. I'll make a couple of comments and throw it over to Nora. Clearly, there is a lot of questions being asked today in the qualified retirement plan market, with all of the DOL overhang, that's starting to consume, I think, a lot of people's time as they advise their clients on what's transpiring. Because this, as you know, has hit mainstream media in terms of the issues. We did an outstanding job in the current quarter retaining clients. We did a nice job acquiring clients. Strong investment performance certainly helped contribute to that success. Having said that, again, net cash flow was healthy for us, but these are things that are a little bit lumpy. And I'll have Nora kind of weigh in now and talk about some of that lumpiness and her views broadly on the FSA line.","Nora Mary Everett - President of Retirement and Investor Services and Chairman of Principal Funds","Sure, thanks, Suneet. Good question. We certainly believe we're striking the right balance, and we think we have the proof points for it. With the kind of plan retention we're seeing, with the kind of sales we're seeing, we're always looking at \u2013 obviously, we've got a competitive market we're dealing in. But one of the things that we're seeing is, in particular in that small-to-medium, that core segment of our market, we're seeing just a tremendous opportunity for us as we move in that space. And what we've seen is, as we look at that growth both in our sales and retention that that's the piece of it that is really outperforming for us.","The lumpiness that we talk about or the volatility we talk about comes when one or two larger cases, so you think in terms of $500 million, or north of $500 million. Now, oftentimes when we talk about the discipline between growth and profitability, it's with those larger cases and making a decision that we're not willing to race to the bottom on pricing.","So that's the kind of lumpiness you'll see, and that's why we'll have quarters like we had this quarter with a $3 billion really outstanding net cash flow, but we don't want to get over our skis extrapolating that because we will have one or two large plan decisions over the year that will move that number, which is why we continue to reaffirm the guidance that if we look at a full year rather than quarter-to-quarter, if we look at a full year, we're confident, given what we see today, that we're going to be well within that 1% to 3% of beginning of year account value.","But the caveat that we always throw out is because our core business is small and medium businesses, when you have one or two of those larger cases moving in or out, that can swing the numbers, which is why we tend to look full year rather than quarter-to-quarter.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","That makes sense. But just to come back to the large account side, can you just give some quantum, in terms of how much pricing has changed, maybe year-over-year, in that large case market? Acknowledging that that's opportunistic for you?","Nora Mary Everett - President of Retirement and Investor Services and Chairman of Principal Funds","Yeah. It some \u2013 there hasn't been in, from what we see it's not a year-over-year comparison. That large-case market has been extremely competitive for many, many years. And where we compete in that large-case market is one, investment performance, and Dan and Jim have talked about that, especially in that key asset class of Target Date. We have a tremendous amount of choice there, we've got extremely strong investment performance. So we compete in that space very well with regard to that suite, those key asset classes.","In addition, on the service side, because of our scale, we're able to move up and down, whether it's a small business, a medium business, or a large business. And we've scaled our service platform to the point where that is seamless for us. So we compete very well in that space, both on the investment side and the service side, but, again, we're going to always be disciplined around this growth and profitability axis.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Suneet, this is Dan. Just a couple of comments. The TRS, the total retirement suite still is a very, very powerful tool for the Principal that can differentiate value from pure 401(k) players. And so that again is a differentiator \u2013 frozen defined benefits, deferred compensation, ESOP had a nice quarter here. So that is a nice differentiator.","The other point I'd make is, because it was this generalization of large-case pricing, there are so many components that go into the pricing of a large plan. How many payroll centers, what is the current penetration rate relative to participant involvement, what is the customized communications package. All of those variables go into it. So when we lose a plan or win a plan, it's because we've done the homework behind the scenes to understand exactly what kind of resources are going to have to be deployed against that plan.","So that's why at any given time you could lose a plan or win a plan. But, again, we like the model that we have. We think it resonates in the marketplace, and our retention rates would imply that those large plans appreciate it. Hopefully that helps.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","No, it definitely does. One last quick one \u2013 or maybe not so quick. But as we think about the DOL, I think we all know there's been some fee pressure in the 401(k) business just for years. But do we think, or should we think, that the DOL rule could accelerate some of that pressure?","Terrance J. Lillis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't \u2013 well, I think, as you pointed out very appropriately. And frankly, it's not limited to just this industry, it's all industries, where there's constant pressure. It's one of the advantages for being a leader in an industry, having critical mass and scale and capability, and having great partners out there. I would not anticipate there to be any pressure coming off fee structures because of DOL. Could it cause some additional discussion? It should, because it's really around transparency and making sure that people understand what they're paying and what they're getting for their money. So, again, I think on a marginal basis, I think we'll continue to have a lot of dialogue around cost and pricing. And Nora wanted to make one more comment here.","Nora Mary Everett - President of Retirement and Investor Services and Chairman of Principal Funds","Yeah, Suneet, I think the one phenomenon that we expect is that when you look at the complexity of this reg, when you look at compliance cost, you really need to be a player that's at scale. You need to be a player that can come to the market, not just at scale, but with the kind of expertise to deal with this ERISA fiduciary duty. And when you think about that, the logical conclusion is you're going to have subscale players or folks that don't have this as their core business, having a moment in time here where they may be moving out of the market.","So we see it as an opportunity around consolidation. And I think that goes back to your question about pricing. I think the irony here is that those of us who are at scale that have the expertise are going to stay in the market, and I think there will be a number of players who will take this as their opportunity to exit the market.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Suneet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Piper Jaffray.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hi, good morning, everybody. I guess Dan, one maybe bigger picture question, as it relates to DOL. Do you think it has any impact on the pace of the rollover market?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good question. So good morning, again, John, to you.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Good morning.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think what it's going to cause is at the inflection point of a job changer or retiree. They're going to call into a call center like they always have, because that's the typical sort of process. And they're going to be having a conversation with a person providing education and guidance. And they're going to disclose what the pricing is in the current plan structure, in a qualified retirement plan, and it could be a larger plan. And there's going to be a certain price. And they're also, as they always have in the past, disclosed to them that there are other options for them to consider. They could move that money to a rollover IRA with the Principal, or they could rollover that money to a third-party, and the names are common. You would know all of those.","And the burden that now falls on the advisor is that the participant has a very clear understanding that they're moving from one product to another. And they have to look at it on a couple of different dimensions. One dimension, of course, is the investment lineup. Is it same or is it different? Another dimension is what's the underlying performance of those investment options? The third dimension is on the price. What am I paying, and what am I getting in exchange for that? And it doesn't have to be the same price, but there has to be a thorough understanding and explanation on why there is a difference for the price being paid.","That action, unto itself, is going to take a longer conversation for fully vetting that opportunity. It ties back to my earlier statements that small account balance holders could find that there are fewer advisors willing to invest the time and the energy to vet every one of those situations. So I think there is a likelihood that 401(k) service providers could end up almost by default retaining maybe more of those smaller account balances after they've had that discussion with that phone counselor. I think on the larger account balances, there are advisors that are going to be spending the time to help vet the opportunity.","And the last comment I would make is, remember, that we are a significant player in the rollover business for defined contribution, investment only, where Jim McCaughan's PGI investment products not only find themselves on the platform of many 401(k) chassis, but also they find themselves on rollover IRA chassis. And again, with strong performance and investment options that solve needs for long-term savers, I think that's a net plus. So, hopefully that's not too long-winded of an answer, John. Do you have a follow-up?","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","No, that's very helpful. I do have a follow-up, just on a separate topic. I appreciate, for sure, that Principal International continues to generate positive net flows now for 30 straight quarters. But in the last several quarters, those net flows have certainly declined. And I'm just curious, as you think about the outlook and some of the economic issues, particularly in a few of the Latin American countries, whether you think there's a chance that we could see that string of positive net flows actually come to an end here soon?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, again, I'll have Luis clean this up. We're benefited because we operate not only in Latin America, but we also operate in Asia, and we're leveraging much of what Tim or Jim brings, relative to institutional asset management to those PI countries. I'm also encouraged by some of the recovery that's happening in some of the countries like Brazil, where you see their equity markets in the first quarter recovering by almost 12%, or up 15%, and the currency has recovered by approximately 12%.","So I think there are some signs that these emerging countries are going through the process. Although they still show negative GDP in some cases, there is some sign that there is new capital being infused in those countries, and things are bouncing back. But to your specific question on net cash flow, I'll defer to Luis to answer that.","Luis Vald\u00e9s - President-Principal International","Okay. Thanks, Dan. John, this is a very good question. Let me tell you what is our view about this. It seems to me that we were able to solve the rock bottom cycle of the emerging markets, very much more around January. If you're looking at the equities index, FX, confidence indexes, and commodity prices, even interest rates are showing a much better picture for emerging markets today. Oil price is about $46, $48 today. Copper price is in $2.28. FX going in the right direction.","So, what happened with our net customer cash flows? You could see our financial supplement, trailing 12-months, we are flying at $9.3 billion in trailing 12-months. We put in $900 million net customer cash flows in the first quarter. If you're looking at the train that we have had during 2015, first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter, in the first part of the year, average per quarter, $2.5 billion, $3 billion in net customer cash flows. Average in the second part of the year, $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion, and then we had $1 billion. But if you're going into the first quarter, I would say that, January, February, March, they had a very positive, I would say, behavior. February was pretty much more flat. Better February and much better March.","So I would say that the $900 million that we do have in the first quarter is not an indication of what is our real run rate that we are looking forward during 2016.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. So \u2013 and I get that some of these markets have rebounded, and some of the commodity data points and a few other data points have certainly improved. And so, I would absolutely expect that we'd see investment performance pick up. I was more concerned about GDP and employment levels, as it relates to some of the net flows. But it sounds like you expect improvement there, too.","Luis Vald\u00e9s - President-Principal International","That is correct, John. And, again, we have a much better kind of idea about what is going to happen. And, certainly, if you're looking, even unemployment levels, even in a country like Brazil, certainly the unemployment is kind of going a little bit up. But surely, Brazil, in particular, continues being very solid. The net customer cash flows out of Brazil was $1 billion in the first quarter. And trailing 12-months is $6 billion. And we certainly, for second quarter, as I've been saying, we have a much better idea about that those net customer cash flows are going to be very much more in line about what has been our run rate in the past.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Appreciate that.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","John, one thing that gives me a little bit of comfort about the net cash flows in emerging markets is, they are still that. In the U.S., some of this negative cash flow pressure comes from paying out benefits. It's why we're in the business. And if you look at Latin America and Asia, they just don't have the same level of payouts occurring, as it relates to generating retirement income. So, we've got a lot of emerging markets, with a lot of upside for middle class growth in the accumulation phase here in the next decade or so.","With that, we'll take the next question.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Yeah, that point is well-taken. Thanks, Dan.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kovac with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. One more on international here, actually. Looking at China, which was actually very strong growth in the quarter, on a flows basis and an operating income basis. How sustainable do you think that is, both in terms of, obviously, very rapid growth, but also in terms of the persistency of the assets that are coming in?","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. That's a great question, and frankly, Mike, we're really enthusiastic about China. You heard our earlier comments around reaching an agreement with the memorandum of understanding with China Construction Bank for now 11 years. It's just been a terrific partner for Principal. We were over there recently, and celebrated our 10-year anniversary. It's important to recognize those sorts of milestones. And as you point out, the flows and the earnings are now starting to be generated after a long incubation period. But with that I'll ask Luis to make some additional comments.","Luis Vald\u00e9s - President-Principal International","Yes, Mike, this is a pretty interesting question, as well. Net customer cash flows, as you could see in our supplement, we're reporting $17 billion just for China in the first quarter, trailing 12-months about $20 billion. So there has been a very impressive performance. I would say that we think that China is going to be very more much \u2013 its path and \u2013 it's going to be very much more in-line about what you can see in our trailing 12-month expectation, right? And what really happened in the first quarter of 2016.","Having said that, we have been very focused on certain things like asset retention, about the products that we're putting ahead. And the thing that is important to keep in mind is that our joint venture has been perceived as a safe harbor in China. And also we have been perceived as a much more conservative asset manager and mutual fund company. So we have been benefit for the kind of noise in China, but certainly, we think that our run rate is going to be very much more in-line about the numbers that you could see in the trailing 12-months, right? And what really happened in the very last quarter in China.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Is that helpful, Mike?","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, it is.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, thank you for the call.","Operator","And we have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Houston, your closing comments, please.","Daniel Joseph Houston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. I'd just like to say, thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. Our growth opportunities remain strong and our strategies firmly in place. We'll continue to focus on managing our capital, we'll focus on the DOL implementation, we'll focus on running the businesses for the benefit of our customers and our shareholders, and certainly appreciate your commitment to continue to have confidence in the Principal Financial Group.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference call over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Principal Financial Group\u2019s fourth quarter conference call. As always our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation related to today\u2019s call are available on our website at principal.com\/investor.","Following a reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO, Dan Houston; and CFO, Terry Lillis will deliver some prepared remarks then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A session include Nora Everett, Retirement and Income Solutions; Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors; Luis Valdes, Principal International; Deanna Strable, U.S. Insurance Solutions; and Tim Dunbar, our Chief Investment Officer.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure maybe found also in our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Houston","Thanks, John, and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning I\u2019ll share some share some highlights for the year and key accomplishments that position us for continued growth. Then Terry will provide more details on our financial results and cover capital deployment. 2016 was a very good year for Principal. We delivered very strong results. We balanced investments and growth with the needs for expense discipline and we continue to be good stewards of shareholder capital.","At over $1.3 billion, we delivered record after-tax operating earnings in 2016 and double-digit growth compared to 2015, excluding the impacts from the actuarial assumption reviews in both years. I see this is particular compelling given a challenging start to the year with strong headwinds from equity markets and foreign currency, low interest rates and volatility and uncertainty associated with Brexit, regulatory changes and the U.S. presidential election. We grew assets under management or AUM by $64 billion from year-end 2015 or 12% to $592 billion a year-end 2016.","Although down sequentially due to impact of rising interest rates on our fixed income investments and the impact of weakness in the yen and euro on client currency hedging. This base gives us a strong foundation for revenue earnings growth in 2017. And we continue to earn important recognition for our asset management franchise.","In the fourth quarter, Willis Towers Watson released research on a world\u2019s largest asset managers. We again improved our rankings moving up to number 38. And we were the 10th fastest growing firm in the top 50 based on AUM growth from 2010 through 2015.","Other 2016 recognition include pension investments best places to work in money management. Our 5th consecutive year on the list, Baron\u2019s 6th best mutual fund company in the U.S. and Asia\u2019s investors best fund house in Malaysia. We also received multiple best fund awards including, Best Moderate Balanced Funds in Chile, Best Asia-Pacific Equity Fund and Best Fixed Income Fund in Indonesia and Best Balanced Fund in Mexico.","As shown on Slide 5, our longer-term Morningstar investment performance remains among the best in the industry. At year-end 2016, 76% of Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trusts were above median for three years performance, and 86% were above median for five year performance. Our one year performance with 51% above median is down from a year ago. We continue to watch this closely, but see this is no more than the normal ebbs and flow in performance.","Over the past 20 quarters on average 76% of our investments have been above median for one year performance, 86% have been above median for three year performance, and 80% have been above median for five year performance. The strength and consistency of this result is notable and boils down to conviction \u2013 conviction in our investment teams, global research platform and investment process, and conviction in diversification and non-correlation benefits of our multi-asset, multi- manager, multi-boutique model. I remain confident in our ongoing ability to stand out among active managers in terms of both investment performance and net cash flow generation.","2016 was in fact our 7th consecutive year of positive total company net cash flows reflecting competitive performance and multiple sources of demand for our investment solutions. Over the seven year period, we generated net cash flows totaling $115 billion. In 2016, Principal delivered more than $19 billion of positive total company net cash flow, a very strong result in an industry in outflows. Our track record underscores the benefit of strong diversification by investor type, asset class and geography, and strong integration of our businesses enabling us to meet investor needs as they transition from accumulation into retirement.","I was particularly pleased with the net cash flow for the year in three areas. In Brazil, we generated nearly $9 billion of net cash flows, an increase of 26% from 2015. This helped BrasilPrev, our pension and long-term savings joint venture with Banco do Brasil achieve an important milestone in December and an industry first BRL200 billion and assets under management. RIS generated $7 billion of net cash flows in 2016, nearly four times our 2015 results. RIS-Fee increased total deposits by 13% reflecting strong underlying growth in the businesses and 95% contract level retention for retirement business.","For RIS-Spread, record full service payout sales, as well as strong fixed annuity sales and opportunities in the investment only business, drove a 53% increase in deposits over the prior year. PGI institutional net cash flows were $3 billion in 2016, more than 80% of the boutiques delivered positive flows for the year. Our multi-manager target date suite, including mutual funds, collective investment trust, and separate accounts, saw positive net cash flows in the fourth quarter, as well as a full year 2016 highlighting the strength and diversification of our offering.","Before moving on, I\u2019ll comment on two pockets of negative net cash flow in the fourth quarter. As expected and signaled in our last call, we experienced outflows of short-term funds in China. Despite the outflows we had a $65 billion of positive net flows in China for the year, including solid flows in our longer-term retail funds. As reminder China is not included and reported AUM.","In Chile, we experienced outflows given turmoil in the Chilean pension system. Importantly, our fundamentals remain strong. In October, we received multiple awards from El Mercurio [ph] and their rankings of the best mutual funds in Chile. In November, we were recognized by Praxis, as the number one Chilean pension service provider, our 5th consecutive number one ranking. And in December the Superintendent of Pensions reaffirmed the merger of our legal entities in Chile.","I\u2019ll now share a few execution highlights, starting with our efforts to expand and enhance our solution set. In 2016, we launched 10 new investment strategies in the U.S. and two on our offshore platform as we continue to build out our suite of outcomes based funds with a particular focus on income solutions; our alternative investment platform to enhance diversification and manage downside risk; our international retail platform to capitalize on tremendous opportunities in Latin America, Asia and Europe; and our ETF and CIT platforms to provide cost effective alternatives to pure passive management.","We also remain highly focused on digital solutions that are simpler and faster, address how future generations will buy financial services and reduce barriers to action and eliminate pain points for customers and advisers. Throughout 2016, I shared some early successes. Here is an update on two of them. In its first full year, we saw strong results from our interactive retirement education enrollment resource. People enrolling through My Virtual Coach saved at a rate that is 3 percentage points higher than those using traditional enrollment and were nearly 5 times as likely to elect automatic annual savings rate increases.","We\u2019re having similar success with Easyelect, our new group voluntary enrollment experience for specialty benefits. Participation is up more than 10% over traditional enrollment in particular, employers are purchasing higher amounts of life insurance coverage.","Moving to distribution, we continue to advance our multi-channel, multi-product approach. In 2016, we increased the number of firms producing at least $1 billion in sales from seven to nine, including five firms producing at least $2 billion in sales for the year. And we continue to make strong progress towards getting our funds added to recommended list and model portfolios. In 2016, we earned nearly 60 total placements getting more than 30 different firms on 22 different third-party platforms with success across asset classes.","I\u2019d also like to highlight promising early results for the online insurance purchasing portal. We converted more than 25% of our digital life insurance lead into sales in 2016, including nearly $140 million in face-amount sold. I\u2019ll close with some thoughts on the future. We go forward from position of strength with excellent fundamentals and the benefit of broad diversification. Regarding the impact of the new administration on the DOL Fiduciary Rule, while there is speculation around potential delays, we\u2019re still prepared for an April 2017 applicability date.","Importantly, we\u2019ll go forward with strong relationships because of our efforts to help distributors work through the implementation process. While competitive and environmental challenges clearly remain, we\u2019re seeing certain headwinds beginning to abate and certain opportunities further materialized. While rising interest rates will continue to negatively impact fixed income AUM, we expect to benefit from additional pension close out and fixed annuity sales opportunities and from higher new money yields.","We continue to see signs of recovery in Brazil. In 2016, with Ibovespa index improving 39% throughout the year, and the Brazilian Real strengthening 22% relative to the U.S. dollar. We also continue to make strides in China with our partner China Construction Bank. Our existing mutual fund joint venture moved up two spots in 2016. Becoming the six largest fund company in China based on year-end AUM, and we\u2019re making meaningful progress in our efforts to develop a new pension and asset management partnership.","I\u2019d be remiss, if I didn\u2019t comment on our upcoming CFO succession. As announced in February of last year, Terry Lillis is retiring in the coming months after 35 years of service. On behalf of the Principal, I want to thank Terry, for the strong contributions he made throughout his career. And in particular, for the instrumental role he played and guiding us through difficult times and positioning in Principal for a long and successful future.","I also want to welcome Deanna Strable, to the CFO role, since she joined in the company in 1990, Deanna has held positions of increasing responsibility, including most recently President of U.S. Insurance Solutions. Deanna brings not only strong financial expertise, but importantly experience running one of the Company\u2019s most successful businesses, clearly we remain in good hands.","2016 was again a year of strong progress. I look for us to continue to build momentum in 2017 and for that momentum to translate into long-term value for our shareholders. Terry?","Terry Lillis","Thanks, Dan. This morning I\u2019ll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year. Net income including performance of the investment portfolio and I\u2019ll close with an update on capital deployment. The fourth quarter was a very strong finish to a record setting year. Total company reported a record $372 million of after-tax operating earnings in fourth quarter 2016, up 23% over the year ago quarter.","Our diversified business model again demonstrates that it will grow profitability through an ever volatile macroeconomic environment. Reported fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share was a $1.27 compared to the fourth quarter 2015 earnings per share of $1.02 up 24%.","However, in fourth quarter 2016, we had two substantially offsetting variances, higher variable investment income and lower than expected encaje returns. For the full year 2016, we delivered a record $1.3 billion in both total company after-tax operating earnings and net income, compared to 2015 on a reported basis, operating earnings were up 5% and net income increased 8%.","Excluding the negative impact of the 2016 actuarial review and the positive impact of the 2015 actuarial review, operating earnings were up over 11%, and net income was up nearly 15% and ROE improved more than 80 basis points. These strong results reflected good growth in the business, disciplined expense management, favorable variable investment income, and balance capital deployment.","While variable investment income was more favorable than our expectations for the year, it was predominantly due to real estate sales and prepayment fees that were back-end loaded in the last half of the year. Throughout 2016, the volatility in the domestic and international equity markets, as well as the fixed income market impacted our AUM. The daily average S&P 500 Index was up 1.6% from full year, depressed due to the drop in the equity market in the first quarter of 2016.","The rise in interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year offset the drop in interest rates through the first three quarters, but negatively impacted our fourth quarter fixed income AUM. As Dan mentioned, AUM was up over 12% in 2016 and will contribute to future earnings growth. As always aligning growth and expenses with growth in revenue was top of mind throughout 2016, as we focused on balancing growth and profitability, while still investing in our businesses. Disciplined expense management will continue to be a focus in 2017.","Now, I\u2019ll discuss the business unit results starting on Slide 6. With a fee based earnings of retirement and income solutions or RIS-Fee. Fourth quarter reported pretax operating earnings of $124 million were flat when compared to the year ago quarter. Higher variable investment income was offset by higher amortization expense. Quarterly net revenues increased 3% from the prior year quarter driven by growth in the business and higher variable investment income. Full year 2016, pretax operating earnings were flat relative to 2015 levels driven by an increase in net revenue and strong expense disciplined.","Additionally, excluding the actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue of 33% ended the year above our 2016 guided range of 28% to 32%. RIS-Fee\u2019s full year net cash flows was $4.2 billion or 2.4% of beginning of your account values reflecting strong sales and retention, as well as solid growth in recurring deposits.","Net cash flow was slightly negative in fourth quarter 2016, due to a few large contract lapses, despite strong sales of $2.9 billion during the quarter. In 2016, recurring deposits increased 6% and we added nearly 1,000 net new defined contribution plans over the prior year, as differentiators like plan works and total retirement suite continue to resonate with clients. As we look forward to 2017, we remain optimistic as the fundamentals of the business remain strong.","Turning to Slide 7, RIS-Spread reported pretax operating earrings of $88 million for fourth quarter 2016. Excluding $12 million of higher variable investment income during the quarter, pretax operating earnings were $76 million. This was a 21% increase over the year ago quarter, driven by growth in the business. We delivered a record $2 billion of pension risk transfer sales and capitalized on attractive opportunities investment only in 2016, coupled with strong fixed annuity sales account values increased 13% over the prior year.","In the pension risk transfer business, our niche focus on plans under $500 million in assets and our ability to handle complex cases differentiates us in the industry. In 2016, the spread business capitalized on the growing demand for guaranteed income in retirement. The rising interest rate environment is fueling a strong pipeline and additional opportunities for sales growth in 2017. On a trailing 12-month basis, an excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review pretax return on net revenue was 62%. This is above our guided range, due in large part to the high level of variable investment income and continued expense discipline in 2016.","Slide 8 shows Principal Global Investors\u2019 fourth quarter record pretax operating earnings of $134 million, up 31% increase over the prior quarter. This growth in earnings was driven by higher revenue across the board. Management fees driven by growth in AUM, large performance fees primarily from real estate and transaction and borrower fees, as well as continued discipline in expense management.","2016 pretax return on operating revenue less pass-through commissions increased to 37% on a trailing 12-month basis. This reflects continued demand for our outcomes oriented solutions, our success in high added-value niche strategies and our strong expense discipline. As Jim mentioned in our 2017 outlook call, Principal Global Investors anticipates overall growth and management fees, as well as transaction and borrower fees.","However, we do anticipate lower levels of performance fees in 2017, strictly due to fewer incidents of multi-year performance fees. Additionally, we want to remind you of the seasonality in PGI\u2019s earnings. The fourth quarter is typically the highest, due to timing of year-end performance fees, and first quarter is usually the lowest, due to elevated payroll taxes. As we look forward to 2017, the institutional pipeline remains very strong.","As shown on Slide 9, excluding $11 million of unfavorable encaje performance in fourth quarter 2016, pretax operating earnings for Principal International were $77 million, a 15% increase over the year-ago quarter. In addition, relative to the prior year quarter, Principal International fourth quarter pretax earnings benefited from foreign currency tailwinds, but was more than offset by the impact of lower inflation. Excluding the impacts of encaje and the actuarial assumption review, Principal International\u2019s 2016 combined pretax return on net revenue was 38% within our guided range.","Other highlights for the quarter included record quarterly pretax earnings of $18 million from our Asian operation. BrasilPrev maintained its leadership position in terms of market share, and captured over 50% of industry net deposits in 2016. Principal International plays an advocacy role in many of these emerging retirement markets, and there will be periods of disruption, as shown in Chile. That said, we have a diverse group of businesses, and we will remain on track to meet our guidance as we outlined in our 2017 outlook call.","On Slide 10, Specialty Benefits\u2019 fourth quarter reported pretax operating earnings were $72 million. Excluding $5 million of higher variable investment income during the quarter, pretax operating earnings were $67 million, up 18% over the year-ago quarter. The growth in earnings was driven by benefits of scale and underlying growth in the business. As a reminder, there is seasonality in Specialty Benefits\u2019 earnings. Dental and vision claims are highest in the first quarter, and lowest in the fourth quarter. As a rule of thumb, typically 20% of full year pretax operating earnings occur in the first quarter, 25% in the second and third quarters, and 30% in the fourth quarter.","On a trailing 12-month basis, the Specialty Benefits loss ratio of 64% is at the lower end of our guided range, driven by our disciplined underwriting and our focus on the smaller end of the market. Strong sales and persistency have driven in-force coverages up 9%, to nearly 150,000 in 2016. Pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was 13% on a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review. This is a 90 basis point increase from our prior year period, reflecting the benefits of scale and favorable loss ratios.","As shown on Slide 11, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $35 million for the quarter, up 17% from the prior year quarter, reflecting effective expense management on a growing block of business. The trailing 12 months pretax return on premium and fees increased to 15% or 40 basis points from the prior year period. Both Specialty Benefits and Individual Life Insurance are growing faster than their respective industries, due to our focus on the small to medium-sized business market, and service differentiators.","Specialty Benefits continues to drive significant top-line growth, while expanding margins. Individual Life continues to have in-line mortality, as well as success with its differentiating capabilities in the business market. Corporate\u2019s 2016 pretax operating losses of $219 million were more favorable than our guided range, driven by expense management. Additionally, 2017 will benefit from our 2016 debt refinancing, with lower interest expense of $19 million. For the quarter, total company net income was $318 million, including net realized capital losses of $2 million, which included $19 million of credit-related losses. Total credit losses continued to be below our pricing expectations in 2016. We expect this trend to continue in 2017.","Included in other after-tax adjustments for the quarter was a $52 million loss due to the prepayment penalty associated with a very successful refinancing of our debt and capital restructure. In conjunction with the rise in interest rates during the quarter, net unrealized gains in the U.S. investment operations fixed maturity portfolio fell to $1.3 billion at the end of 2016. This represents a large drop from third quarter 2016, but is higher than the $1.1 billion net unrealized gain at year-end 2015.","As a reminder, we have a disciplined approach to asset liability management, regardless of the interest rate environment. Our investment portfolio reflects characteristics of our liabilities. It is high quality and diversified by industry, geography, property type and individual credit exposures. As a result of our disciplined approach to asset liability management, we are not forced-sellers in times of distress.","As outlined on Slide 12, we used a balanced approach when weighing our capital deployment options, to enhance long-term value for shareholders. Our goal is to deploy between 65% to 70% of net income in any one year, with variability in any given period. In 2016, we deployed $856 million of capital, or 65% of net income. Deployments include $465 million in common stock dividends, $257 million in share repurchases, $94 million in debt reduction with our fourth quarter 2016 debt refinancing, and $40 million in increased ownership in our investment boutiques.","In both 2014 and 2015, we were above our capital deployment guidance. In 2016, we were within our guided range. While we didn\u2019t find the right M&A opportunity in 2016, the pipeline looks strong going into 2017. We proactively issued debt in the fourth quarter to refinance near-term maturities. And as a result, we extended our maturity profile while lowering ongoing interest expense. Additionally, we completed a tender offer during the quarter that reduced balance sheet debt and lowered our leverage ratio. This adds to our financial flexibility and better-positions us for future opportunities.","As shared in our 2017 outlook call, we plan to deploy $800 million to $1.1 billion of capital in a strategic and balanced manner to enhance long-term value for shareholders. The full year common stock dividend was $1.61 per share. This is a 7% increase over full year 2015, as we continue to increase our payout ratio towards our 40% target. Additionally, last night we announced a $0.45 per share common stock dividend, payable in first quarter 2017. This represents a $0.02 increase above the previous quarter\u2019s dividend, and is an 11% increase on a trailing 12-month basis.","Despite the volatility that we experienced in 2016, our diversified and integrated business model continues to perform well under many different economic scenarios. This is my last earnings call, and it has a significantly better feel than my first few calls in 2008 and 2009. This management team executes, and with Deanna transitioning into the CFO role in the coming weeks, I\u2019m very excited about the possibility this Company has heading into 2017. And I believe Principal is well-positioned for continued profitable growth well-beyond 2017.","I have appreciated my time meeting with everyone, and being given the opportunity to tell the Principal story to anyone who will listen. I will miss our interactions most of them, anyway. Thanks for making my time as Principal\u2019s CFO very enjoyable and memorable. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of John Barnidge with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","John Barnidge","Firstly, congrats Terry on your retirement and I hope you enjoy watching the Lady Bulldogs Basketball team.","Terry Lillis","Thanks, John.","John Barnidge","Couple questions, firstly and then I\u2019ll have a follow-up. Net revenue grew nicely in RIS-Spread in the fourth quarter in 2016. How much of that is sustainable and did you see like a tick-up post elections from companies feeling more comfortable having more clarity?","Dan Houston","Okay. Second question, John?","John Barnidge","Yes, yes, yes. And then your benefit from the dividend received deduction in full year 2016, was that and can you talk about the corporate tax reform kind of in that context.","Dan Houston","Sure, be happy to. And just a couple of quick comments on Full Service Accumulation. I\u2019ll ask that Nora answer your question specifically on the net revenue sustainability in the fourth quarter. This franchise is incredibly strong franchise for Full Service Accumulation. Net new growth and the number of plans there this year was 1,000. We saw 120,000 new participants. We had net cash flow fall well within the range we had outlined for you this past fall. So I would just tell you on a trailing 12-month basis, look at that business for last five years, this just continues to perform to our satisfaction on a number of different metrics and certainly fourth quarter revenue is something that we can \u2013 we chat about briefly.","Nora Everett","So, John you asked about spread and let\u2019s talk a little bit about the net revenue growth there, because there is a significant amount that\u2019s being driven by the business. So if you look at quarter-over-quarter on RIS-Spread, net revenues up about 23%, $25 million, OE up about 40%, $25 million.","If you look at the breakdown on that Delta, the net revenue growth driven by the higher variable investment income is about $12 million of that and then the growth in the business is really driving the balance. So when you look at main account value and you look at the increase quarter-over-quarter that\u2019s about a 13% increase.","And it\u2019s strong growth that\u2019s been driven across the product lines, we mentioned that pension risk transfer business, but we also have the investment only business in there, as well as our retail annuities. And so we\u2019re seeing growth in each of those underlying line items significant growth that\u2019s driving this double digit increase in account value in, net revenue and then operating earnings.","John Barnidge","Thanks, Nora. Terry, you want to tackle the tax question.","Terry Lillis","Yes, John. Let\u2019s focus on tax and when we talk about tax in particular for Principal, you want to look at it over a longer period of time, you don\u2019t want to look at any volatility that could happen in any one particular quarter. As we talked about the different effective tax rates for Principal, we gave guidance at the beginning of the year that would be within that 20% to 22% range.","Now, when you look at it, we\u2019ve reported an effective tax rate of just over 20% this quarter. However, because of the annual actuarial review in the third quarter, if you looked at that and adjusted for that review in the third quarter. If you look at that it \u2013 and adjusted for that it would be right in that 21% range. And so, the number\u2019s in line with what we have said.","Now, as you commented, there are some permanent differences that we get a benefit from and the DRD is one of those. That has an impact of about anywhere from 8%, 9%, 10% of that reduction in that federal 35% tax rate. So, it\u2019s about in line with what we\u2019ve seen in 2015, up slightly, but one of the things that we\u2019re seeing the reasons for that \u2013 increase in that DRD benefit is because of the domestic equity performance that we\u2019ve seen that\u2019s been very, very strong. And that\u2019s where we get our benefit.","The target date funds with the positive flows that we\u2019ve had there and the strong performance that we\u2019ve had, as well as investments that individuals as well as advisors are directing their funds to our Principal branded investments and higher dividends. People are simply paying \u2013 companies are paying higher dividends. So that is expected to continue into the future. However, as we\u2019ve given the guidance for 2017, we think the effective tax rate will go up into that 21%, 23% range, because pretax earnings are going to grow of faster than those permanent differences. And in particular, we think that will grow faster than the DRD. I hope that helps.","John Barnidge","It does. Thank you very much.","Terry Lillis","Thanks for the question, John.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Nadel with Credit Suisse.","John Nadel","Thanks. Good morning everybody and Terry I wish you all the best.","Terry Lillis","Thanks, John.","John Nadel","I guess a couple of questions, in PGI, can you quantify for us how much the performance fees and real estate gains contributed to the quarter and \u2013 because it seems to he me that that was a pretty significant contributor. I know 1Q is relatively weak for maybe some different reasons. But if you can just comment on that, that would be helpful. And then in RIS-Fee, I hate to sort of get down and dirty into the details, but can we talk about what the right or normalized level of net DAC amortization you expect going forward? That\u2019s been swinging a lot.","Dan Houston","Yes, good question. And as you asked that question, John, I was reflecting back to when we really saw a lot of volatility in that number and you know we took some steps. It\u2019s been probably, Terry, within the last couple of years to narrow that down. But there remains some volatility, John, on the PGI, quantifying that I\u2019ll just ask Jim to respond accordingly. Jim?","Jim McCaughan","Thank you, John. If it had been a totally normal quarter, if there is such a thing, we might have had pretax $4 million or $5 million less. I think that\u2019s about the extent of it. We didn\u2019t call it out because if you look in the supplement on page 3, other revenue is the line that includes performance fees and transaction fees. For the 12 months as a whole that was 24% of management fee revenue. The previous two trailing 12 months were the previous two calendar years it was 23% and 26%.","In other words, performance fees plus transaction fees was at a normal level in 2016 compared with the previous two years and relative to our business structure. So I don\u2019t think it was an unusual year for performance fees and the quarter was maybe $4 million or $5 million better than it would have been totally normal on that particular basis. But you know, looking forward, we have called out that the incidence of real estate performance fees, which are mostly multiyear, and 2017 will be a bit lower than it was in the last three years.","Picking up in 2018 and 2019, by the way. Since these are multi-year, we already have multiyear, we already have quite a lot of visibility into the three-year outlook. So 2017 looks like looks like the outlier when you take the two or three years either side of it. That\u2019s why in the guidance call as Terry mentioned, we talked about 4% to 8% growth in revenues for PGI 2017 over 2016. That is a lower number than long-term we expect and that is because of the fact that we\u2019ve had a decent and normal couple of years for incentive fees and 2017 maybe a little bit below trend.","Dan Houston","I was thinking about that in the context of the first quarter we were light and you had a lot of confidence about Q2, Q3 and Q4 and it\u2019s really developed as we really had planned and expected. So there\u2019s some level of predictability in these.","Jim McCaughan","Yes, there is. Actually the first quarter last year was down because the transaction fees were small.","Dan Houston","That\u2019s right.","Jim McCaughan","Because of activity and we\u2019re not seeing that at the moment.","Dan Houston","Nora, you want talk a little bit about the DAC moving around here.","Nora Everett","Sure. So, John, yes, certainly this 4Q and 3Q, we saw bounce around quite a bit and we\u2019re always going to see it bounce around a bit. Remember in RIS-Fee we have both that full service retirement business and our VA business. But we still expect a range if there\u2019s a normal range, we would still expect that range to be somewhere between $15 million and $20 million per quarter. What you saw in 4Q at $23.7 million, the reason we called it out as high is it was outside that range, $6 million to $7 million or so higher amort, resulting from a couple of things, primarily what we see in that point to point actuarial exercises because of the interest rate jump, because of our fixed income portfolio getting that unfavorable reaction there in the interest rate increase and also our international equity performance.","So that unfavorable performance drove some of that excess DAC, as well as just some timing issues as part of that normal quarterly roll-forward. So, yes, it will bounce around but both 4Q and 3Q tended to be outside the range which is why we called it out. We\u2019re still looking at an expected rage 15 and 20.","John Nadel","And just as a quick follow up. I think you guys mentioned that in RIS-Fee that higher variable investment income was offset by this or offset this higher DAC amortization. Is that \u2013 do I have that right? So variable investment income was maybe about that same level.","Nora Everett","Right, so higher of variable investment income. So in that $6 million to $7 million range correct.","John Nadel","Got it. Thank you so much.","Jim McCaughan","Thanks John for the question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","Terry, I\u2019d like to wish you happy retirement as well. I had a few questions, first on PGI, obviously this is just one quarter and but for the year your flows were pretty strong. But to what extent have you seen an impact on your flows and client activity just from the weaker short-term performance that you\u2019ve seen recently and in terms of investment performance. And then second if you could talk about trends in the Chilean business, what you\u2019re seeing in the market and what your outlook is for the business given everything that\u2019s going on there.","Terry Lillis","Just one quick comment, Jimmy. The PGI has just had an extraordinary run. As I looked to the last decade, strong growth, strong performance, our products. Jim\u2019s done a great job assimilating a nice group of boutiques. And I think about four out of five of those boutiques having positive net cash flow. It leaves you with one in five of those boutiques, that\u2019s the one reason or another are not performing at the same level. But with that sort of backdrop, I\u2019ll have Jim address your specific question.","Jimmy Bhullar","Sure.","Jim McCaughan","Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you, Jimmy. The reason that the fourth quarter was an unusually negative one in flows is almost entirely to do with foreign clients who hedge their international primarily dollar balances back into their home currency. The biggest piece of that is Japanese clients. Where we have $20 billion of Japanese clients who hedge back into the yen, the yen was weak by 15% in the quarter against the U.S. dollar. That\u2019s a straight impact on assets under management of about $3 billion just from the Japanese clients.","There was more from Europe. The euro was not as weak as the Japanese yen during the quarter but it still led to some losses from hedging, which is you\u2019ll realize is actually client driven. They want something that\u2019s hedged back into their home currency. In round numbers, there was about a $4 billion diminution of AUM from the foreign currency hedging directed by clients about half of that comes through the line flows. And so you\u2019ll see that \u2013 without that, we would have been positive. Maybes there\u2019s hope on this one, Jimmy, because the dollars has weakened again in January, which is actually through the hedge mechanism bringing in some assets from those Japanese and European clients.","So I think that\u2019s the main point to make. Clearly, in terms of investment performance, we are not the standout winner in 2016 that we were for many years. We\u2019re in the middle of the pack. If you look at the supplement on Page 14 it shows boutique by boutique the AUM numbers. Only two of our boutiques are down in the year. That\u2019s Columbus Circle, which is a growth equity manager, it\u2019s been a tough year for them, and Macro Currency Group, where we had the large passive mandate that went out in the first quarter. That by the way had pretty well no revenues. It was very low revenues being passive.","So those are the only two boutiques and the only one where there\u2019s any impact of revenues Columbus Circle. I would point out that our other equity boutiques are generally still growing. Aligned and Edge both have strategies that beat the benchmark as well as the peer group last year. Principal Global Equities and Origin were middle of the pack, which in their description is struggling, but it\u2019s not that it\u2019s an outlier and they were certainly gaining assets as they kept client confidence and as they did constructive things in a difficult market.","So I would put a pretty brave and pretty positive outlook on this. Our equity boutiques in general are in very, very good shape. The sub-advised was down a bit in assets if you see the assets under management by boutique. Some of our non-affiliate sub-advisers had performance issues. But I think that the PGI array of boutiques, the diversification shows up well, and we\u2019re in very good shape looking forward. The pipeline is as strong as it\u2019s ever been right now with interest in our niche strategies.","Dan Houston","Jimmy one of my big takeaways clearly around doing in business internationally whether it\u2019s China or India or Chile or Brazil. In these emerging markets there is some degree of volatility. The good news about Chile to me is that Luis has a very strong team, whether you\u2019re talking about the annuity business, the accumulation business on both the FDA as well as the voluntary. But I\u2019ll have Luis speak specifically at the heart of some of his take on Chile and the future and what that means for Principal going forward","Luis Valdes","Okay. Good morning, Jimmy. This is Luis. As a reminder, and this is very important to keep in mind, Jimmy, one thing that\u2019s gone on in Chile is the pension discussion, pension reform, by the way in the 10 countries that we\u2019re in, this is a common theme everywhere. So we are very active not just in Chile. If you are paying a pension about other countries like Brazil, Mexico, even Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, the pension thing and the pension issue is something that is going to remain as a high and hot topics going forward and we\u2019re very, very emboldened in that kind of discussion, not just with the countries but with Lawmakers, think tanks, war bank, IMF and OECD.","So this is going to be a trend in topics for the next three years if not more. Have you said that two things and as a follow-up about what I have said in the last earnings call, we have faced some negative outflows in our portfolio, but it\u2019s important to qualify this, Jimmy. We have had an one line which is our transfer out, that line has been negative. But in the mandatory business, our net customer cash flows in total including in recurring contributions transfer and others remain positive. Our voluntary net customary cash flows remain barely positive, but positive. And the main line which is also affecting our total net customer cash flows, is about what we call pension, is all about income solutions.","Something that is we have to keep in mind. We paid in 2016 more than $1.4 billion and what we call income solutions. It might be programmic withdrawals, or money which has been transferred to life insurance companies like the one that we do have in Chile. So the point I\u2019m trying to make here is two main things were affecting our transfers. The main factor was the whole discussion about the pension system and the second subject was about the merger. That second factor we\u2019re putting behind us the merger discussion. In mid-December, the superintendency, for the third time and for the final time, they put a resolution in which they confirmed the legality of our merger.","More than that, last week, the comptroller general in Chile, they reversed them, and they closed the case, saying that they confirm that our merger was fully in compliance and completely legal. More than that we\u2019re going to \u2013 this was an issue that was affecting us for two years in a row. And it\u2019s important to say that we\u2019re working on that, and certainly their competitors are not going to be able to use that argument against us anymore.","Three things and three aspects in order to close my comments about our business in Chile. Three aspects that remains as important fundamentals for our business. Number one, our investment performance. We\u2019re number two and three in five years in a row. We\u2019re number one since inception. That speaks to our long-term investment capabilities in Chile. Second, customer service. For the fifth consecutive year, we\u2019ve ranked number one in terms of customer service, and this is an award given by a third party in Chile. The third thing is, our strong and highly respected branding complements a very and highly resilient Corporation and brand. We made the ranking of the top 100 most reputable companies at the end of 2016. Just one other AFE made that ranking as well.","So we remain very confident, and we\u2019re paying a lot of attention about those volatile customers, that for any given reason they may decide to leave Cuprum. We\u2019re working on that. We\u2019re paying a lot of attention about that. We have been able in order to identify those segments, and we\u2019re working on that in order to increase and to work in that particular segment. So short-term speaking, some volatility is coming. 2017 is an election year for Chile, so presidential elections in November. So the pension discussion is going to be on the table. But on the other hand, we remain very confident about our long term in that business.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Yes.","Dan Houston","Yes, thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss","Hi, good morning. Thanks a lot. Had a question just on the timing of the incentive fees out to 2017. I just want to make sure I\u2019m interpreting this right. You commented that the lower guidance for 2017, that 48%, incorporates that viewpoint there. The 2017 guidance, it\u2019s just that low point that is \u2013 the mid-point is like 0.5% lower. Are we talking in the range of $5 million, that, that\u2019s the impact to top line and bottom line in terms of those yearly incentive fees?","Dan Houston","Go ahead, Jim.","Jim McCaughan","Thanks very much, Seth. No, it\u2019s not \u2013 I can\u2019t really give you that precisely, because there\u2019s so many moving parts to incentive fees. The basic reason that we see 2017 as low, is, many of these incentive fees are multi-year. For example, the biggest one, or one of the biggest ones in the second and third \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the third and fourth quarters of 2016, was on our Green fund, our Green real estate fund that we launched in, I think it was 2008 and 2009. And that fund got to the end of its life. The developments had been done, the real estate sold at a very considerable profit. And that\u2019s where the incentive fees came from.","If I look forward, 2017 is a bit light on these long-term incentive fees. There are some, but there\u2019s not as much as usual. 2018, 2019, we see a lot of resurgence in the seeds we\u2019ve planted in the last few years, that should give us good incentive fees in those years. So that\u2019s really the point. It\u2019s not that I can pin on $4 million or $5 million here or there on incentive fees. Even on say, Finisar, where it\u2019s emerging data and there\u2019s a lot of incentive fee possibility, it\u2019s not possible to be precise. We put ourselves in the way of that opportunity. But in aggregate, you can predict, even if for any one, it\u2019s highly uncertain what the incentive fee will be. And I think the stability of our other revenue line shows that we have a good portfolio of these opportunities. So I hope that helps put it in perspective, Seth.","Seth Weiss","It\u2019s helpful. I mean it sounds from your commentary that you have maybe not a level of precision, but at least a general sense of how much lower they may be in 2017. So I\u2019m just trying to set the baseline of what that is as we try to triangulate our models. So if there\u2019s any number you could give, that would be helpful in terms of not having any surprises?","Jim McCaughan","Yes. It\u2019s in that 4% to 8% overall revenue gain guidance. That\u2019s where it\u2019s encapsulated. Gosh, what would it have been if 2017 was going to be a 2016 all over again? It\u2019s hard to speculate. But it might have been high-single to low-double-digits. So I mean I think that quantifies it.","Dan Houston","Thanks, Seth.","Seth Weiss","Okay. And then, I\u2019m sorry \u2013 if I could follow up one on RIS-Spread?","Jim McCaughan","Yes.","Dan Houston","Yes.","Seth Weiss","You commented earlier on the strong net revenue gains. There\u2019s been a nice tick-up in margins also in the back half of the year. Just curious if that\u2019s sustainable, and what\u2019s driving that? If it\u2019s been stronger interest rates, or if there\u2019s anything seasonal there that\u2019s driving that, that should repeat next year?","Dan Houston","Nora?","Nora Everett","Yes, those margins are likely unsustainable and over and above the guidance that we gave on the 2017 outlook call. And it\u2019s primarily driven by that higher than expected variable investment income. So you can you can connect those two dots, it\u2019s certainly a very attractive business we expect to continue to drive these industry leading margins, but this particular quarter is unsustainable.","Dan Houston","Yes correct. All right, thank you, Seth.","Seth Weiss","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","Thank you. I guess there have been a number of recent lawsuits against 401(k) plan sponsors related to fees and bias in fund selection. What impact do you see this having on plan sponsors and their decisions regarding things like active versus the passive or manager selection?","Dan Houston","Those issues have gone on for a long time, class action lawsuits going after these sorts of issues and it\u2019s frankly one of the reasons why we adopted an open architecture approach over 10 years ago to make sure that advisors working as advisors to their plan sponsors that they would have a full suite of investment options to choose from, whether that was PGI, whether it was where we subsubcontracted.","Because so many of our small to medium-sized employers may not have that level of expertise. But that window for all the other outside retail mutual fund offerings had been wide open for a very long time and as you know even in our target date structure we have an open architecture approach. So if you\u2019re asking a question about Principal and what our exposure is we feel like we\u2019ve done an exceptional job providing lot of choice by manager, by asset class and in particular all the way down to the small size clients.","And even the DOL rules that are currently proposed does not in any continued model to make those investment options broadly available in a variety of different structures. I probably hit that one a bit hard but I\u2019ll look at Nora and see if she has anything else she would like to add onto that response.","Nora Everett","Well said. The only thing I would add is that when you think about a plan sponsor who\u2019s a fiduciary, they need to that \u2013 that fiduciary needs to be looking at many, many things, price being one of them. And one of the things that\u2019s as important as price is the investment strategy in particular for the qualified default. And Dan spoke to it but I think it\u2019s really important to highlight how we\u2019ve addressed that issue and one of the reasons our target date continues to be such \u2013 in such strong demand is with this hybrid approach in particular, allowing in that bundled solution to have both passive and active, passive in those very efficient asset classes, active \u2013 where active is absolutely part of that fiduciary equation.","You can think about different asset classes where you would want active management. So that bundled solution has been very powerful and really resonate, both with plan sponsors, fiduciaries, and also with their advisors. But that\u2019s an example to Dan\u2019s point, we were out ahead both with regard to the multi-manager structure, but also with regard to the hybrid investment structure.","Erik Bass","Jim, did you have a comment on that?","Jim McCaughan","Yes, and if I could just add, Eric, I do think looking forward our broad range of target date solutions, which Nora touched on and Dan did, which includes different legal vehicles, 40 Act funds, insurance separate accounts and collective investment trusts, it includes use of active enhanced passive and passive. We have a very strong range of capabilities. That\u2019s why as was mentioned during the quarter and during the year we\u2019ve seen significant inflows to our target date suite. Furthermore, I think the environment you describe will over the next few years give us opportunities in a defined contribution investment only market for target date funds. So we\u2019re feeling pretty optimistic about all the work we\u2019ve done over the years to position ourselves for growth.","Dan Houston","Erik, did you have a follow-up?","Erik Bass","Thank you, that\u2019s helpful color. And then on the target date funds, maybe if you could quantify what the flows have been? Because obviously it\u2019s been in the news, with TROW last week. And I think also we on the public data for mutual funds, only see sort of a portion of the activity, and you obviously have them in other vehicles as well. So if you could just talk about the overall flow trend and target date that would be helpful.","Dan Houston","Yes, it seems we get A lot of air time in the last couple of weeks and so we\u2019ve done our homework and you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a partial story just to talk about the 40 Act funds. But, Nora, because she lives that retirement franchise is probably in the best position to answer your question.","Nora Everett","Yes, to Dan\u2019s earlier comments, we were positive overall with our target date suite both in 4Q and full year. Full year at about $4.5 billion and in 4Q about $600 million. So that took that total AUM with regard to our target date suite increased from 53.6 at the end of 3Q to 54.2 at the end of 4Q. And again, if you look at that AUM, it includes both retirement plans and retail investors. But the vast majority of that AUM is in our retirement business.","Dan Houston","Of course, the one thing that\u2019s changed over the years is, there\u2019s the 40 Act funds, we have managed accounts, we have separate accounts, we have collective investment trusts. And as you say, the public screens don\u2019t catch all those assets. And at $4.5 billion on a full year basis for target date, that\u2019s a very strong number for Principal.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you very much.","Dan Houston","Thank you. Appreciate the question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo.","Sean Dargan","Thanks. I\u2019d also like to extend my best wishes to Terry. Just following up on RIS-Fee, just have a question about flows. If you had net inflows of $600 million in target date funds, where were the outflows? And how much of that was caused by M&A taking funds away from you?","Nora Everett","Sure.","Dan Houston","No, please.","Nora Everett","The net cash flow with regard to RIS-Fee in the fourth quarter \u2013 and I think Terry mentioned this in his comments \u2013 was really impacted by \u2013 and we\u2019ve talked about this before. A couple of larger cases in our block of business can impact that net cash flow in a particular quarter. Very strong net cash flow full year, up $4.2 billion. In fact, $4 billion increase year-over-year in the full year net cash flow.","So we\u2019re really pleased with the net cash flow. A couple of those cases were absolutely related to M&A. We\u2019re going to win some, we\u2019re going to lose some. We had a couple that, our particular client was the acquired or part of a merger. So we\u2019re going to see that. We saw a little bit of that a year ago, 4Q as well. But we\u2019re really pleased with our overall net cash flow results. And we would expect \u2013 just looking at see in the sales pipeline, we\u2019re optimistic about 2017 as well.","Sean Dargan","Okay. If I could just ask a follow-up about China. You had very strong net cash flows in the first three quarters, and there was a fairly sharp reversal in the fourth quarter. Is there some seasonality in there, or can you give us some color on what happened there?","Dan Houston","I think the reality is, the long-term funds are actually the short-term, what I\u2019ll describe as money market structure, that is most problematic. And very quickly, I\u2019ll have Luis answer that last question.","Luis Valdes","Well, Sean, the real reason about this massive inflows coming from CCB, it was due to a mainstream decision that the central government in China made, which is, they called a lending cap. They tried to deleverage that economy, so they put a lending cap to those banks. So the excess money that they had in timed deposits flows into asset managers. That\u2019s one of the reasons of this massive flow into our Company.","Having said that, we expect that, that particular lending company is going to remain, we don\u2019t know at which level. So that\u2019s telling us that part of the money flew back into CCB. But the most important thing is that they reroute part of the short-term mandates. $11 billion, I\u2019m talking about \u2013 they reroute $11 billion into our retail mutual funds. So even though that we face $23 billion in outflows, our revenues didn\u2019t suffer the matching effect. We are facing an increase about a 2% or 3% an hour revenues in spite of this $23 billion outflow.","Sean Dargan","Thank you.","Dan Houston","Thank you.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Houston, your closing remarks, please.","Dan Houston","Just a couple of quick comments, the first of which I would say is, we feel like we had a very solid 2016. But as Terry iterated, we remain very optimistic about 2017. The demand for products that we provide to small to medium-sized employers, individuals and institutions, has not gone away.","We still see the small to medium-sized business as the growth engine for the U.S. And it seems like tax policy and other policies are going to be supportive of that. These baby boomers are going to need income in retirement. We\u2019re enthusiastic about that. A lot of our digital investments are driving toward a millennial solution, and you heard about some of those today.","Long-term financial security is not going to go away in the U.S., nor in Chile or in China. We feel good about that. And frankly, we feel good about Nora\u2019s businesses, when you talk about that spread business. People want guaranteed income in retirement. We don\u2019t think being a standalone investment manager is the right answer, nor just an accumulation firm.","We think the fact that we can provide a comprehensive approach to retirement long-term protection is very important, in addition to providing, of course, life insurance benefits. But I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t look at Terry Lillis and first say, thank you, and to let Terry Lillis give the very last word of this call today, to all the analysts and investors out there. Terry?","Terry Lillis","Thanks, Dan. It\u2019s been a good run. And I look back and I reflect on it \u2013 we\u2019re in a much stronger position now in terms of our strategy on a go-forward basis, a much stronger position in terms of our capital, and I think we have the best years still ahead of Principal. We take a balanced approach and make sure that we reflect the needs of our customers, our staff and our shareholders. And thank you all very much for the support that you\u2019ve given me over the last several years.","Dan Houston","So thank you.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to John Egan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","John Egan","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Principal Financial Group's second quarter earnings conference call. As always, our earnings release, financial supplement, additional investment portfolio detail and slides related to today's call are available on our website at www.principal.com\/investor.","Following a reading of the Safe Harbor provision, CEO Larry Zimpleman and CFO Terry Lillis will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A are Dan Houston, Retirement, Investor Services and U.S. Insurance Solutions; Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors; Luis Valdez, Principal International; and Julia Lawler, our Chief Investment Officer.","Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","I'd like to take a quick moment to remind you of our upcoming Investor Day on September 21. We look forward to the opportunity to provide you an update on our strategy and long term growth opportunities, as well as a deep dive into our distribution strategy for each of our businesses.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Larry.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Thanks, John, and welcome to everyone on the call. As usual, I'll comment on 3 areas. First, I'll briefly discuss second quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on the continued successful execution of our strategy, then I'll close with some comments on M&A and capital deployment.","As John mentioned, we've provided slides related to today's call. Slide 4 outlines the themes for the quarter.","Second quarter saw a continuation of recent trends with strong momentum in sales and flows, while macroeconomic events impacted operating earnings. Despite a 6% decrease from the year ago quarter, second quarter total company operating earnings were solid at $216 million. Earnings per share were up 1% due to our share repurchases during the past year. The operating earnings result reflects persistent macroeconomic headwinds, including negative equity markets, low interest rates, strengthening of the U.S. dollar and stagnant job growth.","We also had lower variable investment income in the first half of 2012 compared to the prior year period, which Terry will comment on. Despite these macroeconomic headwinds, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and we continue to see sales pipelines grow. We ended the quarter with record assets under management of $367 billion. Second quarter net cash flows were $7.3 billion, which are more than double second quarter 2011 net cash flows. And so far in 2012, we have over $15 billion in net cash flows.","The sequential improvement in operating earnings demonstrates that we remained focused on execution as we strike the right balance between growth and profitability in this challenging environment. Our competitive position remains strong due to our innovative solutions, such as Total Retirement Suite for our retirement clients, voluntary benefit choices for our Specialty Benefits customers and outcome-oriented investment solutions for our mutual fund and institutional asset management clients.","We also continue to deepen and strengthen our relationships with key distribution partners. Key growth metrics from the quarter include Full Service Accumulation sales of $2.3 billion, up 34% compared to second quarter 2011. Net cash flows of $1.9 billion were nearly double that of the year ago quarter and reflect not only great sales momentum but also excellent client retention and growth in recurring deposits. Principal Funds had sales of $3.4 billion, our second highest on record contributing to our second highest quarterly net cash flow on record at $1.1 billion. Principal Global Investors ended the quarter with unaffiliated assets under management of $92.3 billion, a 16% increase over the year ago quarter and unaffiliated net cash flows of $2.1 billion, a strong improvement over second quarter 2011. Reported record assets under management for Principal International were $60.3 billion, up 14% over the year ago quarter and net cash flows of $2.3 billion are up 28% over the same time last year despite foreign currency exchange rate pressures and lower inflation in the second quarter in Latin America which reduces investment income. In U.S. Insurance Solutions, Individual Life sales of $45 million were up 6% over second quarter 2011. Specialty benefits premium and fees grew 5% over the year ago quarter to $361 million.","Our mix of businesses continues to shift with 65% of second quarter earnings coming from our fee-based businesses. This creates increasing amounts of deployable capital and increases financial flexibility due to the absence of long term equity or interest rate guarantees in this business.","Now let me provide comments on the ongoing implementation of our strategy. Our strategy remains the same: To help businesses, individuals and institutional investors save for the long term, invest for growth and protect their assets. At our Investor Day in September, we'll provide greater detail about our investment management plus strategy and discuss how the synergies and interrelationships of our businesses provide an opportunity to be a long term value for our customers, advisers and shareholders, starting with Full Service Accumulation, our Total Retirement Suite platform, an advisor-centric model, position us as a retirement leader, and we continue to gain market share. As the baby-boomer generation continues to move towards retirement, we are focusing on all stages of retirement readiness, from hire through a retire.","We are also seeing increased interest in retirement solutions, including payout annuities. Our year-to-date sales of income annuities is $160 million, nearly double the sales for all of 2011 and does not reflect a $500 million single premium annuity sold in third quarter. The growing demand and limited supply of proven providers for this business creates attractive returns for us. Principal Funds continues to drive strong sales due to demand for investment solutions designed to generate income in a near-0 interest rate world, limit volatility and hedge against inflation. We've had 10 straight quarters of positive net cash flows reflecting our success with many strategies across the platform. Investment performance, a key leading indicator for growth for our Retirement and Investment Management businesses continues to be strong overall in several key investment options, including equity income, large growth and diversified international. These strategies represent asset classes that advisers and clients focus on for retirement and retail solutions. In addition, our Principal Global Diversified Income Fund is now a MorningStar-rated 5-star fund. Principal Global Investors' multi-boutique strategy offers a nimble approach that allows us to meet the changing needs of institutional clients around the world.","A recent report from CREATE-Research and Principal Global Investors identified investor appetite for a more dynamic approach to managing volatility and asset allocation. The study signaled that in prolonged periods of market turbulence, such as the current market, client demand for Principal Global Investors' multi-boutique and value-added strategies increases.","Moving now to Principal International, we are strongly positioned in the emerging markets that continue to experience rapid growth in the middle-class income segment. The acquisition of Claritas, a leading Brazilian mutual fund and asset management company, was announced in the first quarter and closed in April. Entering the Brazilian mutual fund market has been a strategic priority for the Principal. This acquisition is off to a great start, including the launch of a real estate fund that raised $75 million in the second quarter. We anticipate that Claritas will expand beyond the retail mutual fund market to the institutional investor market as that develops over time.","We continue to have traction in emerging markets in Asia as well. Last quarter, we announced that the Malaysian government approved a new employer-based defined contribution system and CIMB-Principal, our joint venture with CIMB was one of 8 companies approved to provide solutions in the new market, which begins later this year. Additionally, Principal won AsianInvestor Magazine's 2012 Investment Performance Award for Hong Kong Mandatory Pension Fund service providers.","Providing risk protection continues to be a key strategic focus for the Principal. For our U.S. Insurance Solutions business, we continue to focus on the business market, with 54% of second quarter sales coming from our business owner and executive solutions market, along with nonqualified deferred compensation. For specialty benefits, we continue to see growing demand for voluntary solutions that plays to our employee enrollment and education capabilities.","Now I'll close with some comments on capital management. We continue to actively deploy excess capital in the second quarter. In the first half of the year, we committed $475 million of excess capital for deployment. During the second quarter, we completed the February $100 million share repurchase authorization, announced the authorization of a $200 million share repurchase and paid $54 million in quarterly dividends to shareholders. We recognize the importance of a quarterly dividend to shareholders and anticipate a pattern of increasing our dividend payout ratio year-over-year as our earnings continue to shift towards fee-based earnings.","We remain on track to deploy $800 million to $900 million of excess capital in 2012. We have an active M&A pipeline with opportunities that provide a strategic fit and complement our existing capabilities. However, we will continue to take a disciplined approach in evaluating these opportunities since we have a strong organic growth capability.","As evidence of the significance of our fee-based earnings, we have recently done some analysis of our capital deployment for the last 4 quarters, relative to our insurance peer companies. Thanks to our growing fee-based businesses, we rank in the upper quartile of capital deployed to shareholders as a percentage of market capitalization. This is validation of our business model being shareholder friendly with increasing amounts of deployable capital.","Excess capital at the end of the second quarter was $1.5 billion, a level that's been pretty consistent over the past year. We have indicated that we intend to hold a higher amount of capital and prior to the financial crisis, but we believe that we will still be reducing our excess capital levels by $300 million to $400 million over the next couple of years.","In closing, the trends that have shaped our investment management strategy are now firmly in place around the world. While we expect ongoing volatility in the markets and macroeconomic headwinds from time to time, we remain optimistic about the long term growth potential of our strategy. Terry?","Terrance J. Lillis","Thanks, Larry. As Larry mentioned, second quarter earnings were solid and our growth metrics continued to show strong business fundamentals. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings and the impact from headwinds, net income including continued solid performance in the investment portfolio and the strength of our capital position and strong balance sheet.","There are several factors that negatively impacted the year-to-date growth of our underlying businesses but I'm going to focus on 3. First, the first half of 2011 benefited from opportunistic real estate sales, which were not repeated in the second half of 2011 or in the first half of 2012. Second, the continued declining interest rate environment has resulted in increased accrued expenses in 2012 of our postretirement benefits, which we call security benefits. Third, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against Latin American currencies has had a negative impact on Principal International's operating earnings in 2012. Adjusting for these factors, year-to-date earnings increased 3% over the prior year on a 7% growth in average assets under management.","Second quarter 2012 operating earnings of $216 million were down $13 million from a year ago quarter, reflecting these same factors. While we expect volatile equity markets, low interest rates and the foreign exchange headwinds to continue to impact 2012, our business fundamentals remain strong as we focus on what we can control. For example, Retirement and Investor Service Accumulation businesses continued to deliver strong sales, client retention and growth in recurring deposits, which will lead to market share gains and future earnings growth. Principal Global Investors will benefit from back-end loaded performance fees and lower expenses. Principal International is expected to continue its strong trends and long term growth despite unfavorable macroeconomics. U.S. Insurance Solutions should benefit from claims seasonality and continued stable loss ratios. And opportunistic real estate sales and expense management will benefit the entire organization.","Now I'll discuss the business unit results. Full Service Accumulation operating earnings at $73 million were down $5 million, primarily due to pressure on fee growth. Pretax return on net revenue was 29% on a trailing 12-month basis.","Let me make a few comments related to Full Service Accumulation margins. Slide 5 summarizes the leading factors impacting the trends in margins. These same trends are continuing in 2012. Year-to-date 2012 Full Service Accumulation net revenue is down 2% compared to year-to-date 2011 due to pressure on asset management fees and lower variable investment income. However, we now expect full year 2012 net revenue to grow between 2% to 4% based on an average S&P 500 index level of 1370. Additionally, we expect to maintain pretax return on net revenue of 30% to 32% for the full year because of improving market performance and variable income.","Full Service Accumulation is a fee-based business that is focused on growing revenues, managing expenses and maintaining profit margins making return on revenue measures a better indicator of the financial performance of the business. The bottom of Slide 6 illustrates our stable track record of driving revenues to the bottom line even as customers' preferences migrate to different asset types. Return on revenue margins are a key focus for us.","The underlying fundamentals within Full Service Accumulation continue to improve. Year-to-date, recurring deposits are growing. The sales pipeline continues to build across market sizes and distribution channels and close ratios continue to improve. We are actively executing on our strategy to win more business and gain market share. Second quarter 2012 Full Service Accumulation sales of $2.3 billion were strong and year-to-date sales were up 49% over the same period a year ago, whereas in 2011, sales and flows were more back-end loaded. In 2012, they're more front-end loaded. That said, we now expect sales growth of approximately 20% to 25% over 2011, and we expect net cash flows to be between 3% to 5% of beginning of year account values.","Operating earnings for our Principal Funds at $12 million for the quarter were down $1 million compared to the year ago quarter. This was due to higher compensation and sales-related expenses as we invest in growing the business. Sales of $3.4 billion and net cash flow of $1.1 billion reflect strength across multiple strategies, including global diversified income fund, preferred securities, midcap blend fund, high yield and target risk allocations.","Investment performance continues to be strong across asset classes and is a leading indicator of future sales and net cash flows. The strong performance includes particular strength in asset allocation, where at quarter end, 90% of our target date and target risk funds were ranked by MorningStar in the top half on a 1-year basis, 100% on a 3-year basis and 73% on a 5-year basis.","Individual annuities operating earnings in second quarter 2012 were $25 million, down $5 million from a year ago quarter due to lower spread and higher DAC amortization. Normalized operating earnings are approximately $27 million, taking into account continued spread compression. Second quarter 2012 earnings for Principal Global Investors were $18 million, down $3 million from a year ago quarter on an 8% increase in average assets under management.","With a focus on growing our global investment management leadership position, we added distribution and investment professionals across select boutiques, which has increased expenses compared to a year ago.","Unaffiliated net cash flows for the quarter were $2.1 billion, driven by positive flows into a variety of asset classes, including currency, stable value, fixed income and real estate. The recent opening of our office in The Netherlands has already generated $158 million of mandates awarded, with $58 million of that funding in the second quarter. Our strategy to invest for the future is working.","Moving to Principal International, operating earnings at $37 million were dampened by roughly $3 million due to one time acquisition expenses from closing to Claritas deal. The underlying growth of the companies on a local basis remains strong. The strengthening dollar has created a headwind of roughly 10% to U.S. dollar reported earnings, which we expect to continue into the second half of the year. As a reminder, our financial supplement now includes foreign exchange rate information used for financial reporting to help you better analyze the impact of exchange rates on Principal International.","Individual Life second quarter operating earnings were $28 million, up $4 million from a year ago quarter due to better mortality experience in the current quarter. Second quarter 2012 results were in line with expectations.","Turning to specialty benefits, second quarter operating earnings were $23 million, down $3 million from a year ago quarter primarily due to stable loss ratios and stronger than normal net investment income in 2011. The increase in sequential earnings is due to normal seasonality in dental claims and sales-related expenses. With the negative impact of seasonality behind us, we would look to see consistent loss ratios, strong retention and growth in premium and fees for the remainder of 2012.","The corporate segment reported an operating loss of $31 million right in line with our expected quarterly result of $30 million to $35 million. For the quarter, total company net income was $173 million. After-tax credit related losses remained steady at $27 million. Our investment-related losses continue to be in line or better than our loss projections and better than market expectations, reflecting sustainable recovery in commercial real estate. This improvement has given us additional financial flexibility.","Moving to our balance sheet, our net unrealized capital gain position of $2.3 billion increased $300 million from first quarter 2012, predominantly due to lower interest rates. As a reminder, because of the strong asset liability management, changes in net unrealized gain or loss due to interest rate movement do not result in an economic impact, and in periods of stress, do not force us to sell assets. The evolution of our business model means we now have a much higher portion of earnings coming from less capital intensive, more fee-based businesses that have limited or no guarantees associated with them.","As the low interest rate environment persists, our earnings will continue to grow but at a slower rate as shown on Slide 7. We view this modest headwind to earnings growth as very manageable, which speaks to the strength of our investment management plus strategy. Although we continuously monitor all assumptions, including the interest rate environment, third quarter is historically when we conduct our periodic review of assumptions and actuarial model enhancements. The persistent low interest rate environment could result in a reduction in the long term interest rate assumption used to model deferred acquisition costs and related actuarial balances. If we were to lower our long term interest rate assumption by 25 basis points for every segment across the company, it may result in an additional one time after-tax reduction of operating earnings of approximately $25 million.","Looking now at capital adequacy, we estimated our second quarter risk-based capital ratio to be 440%. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $1.5 billion of total excess capital, with over $500 million of the excess capital in the holding company. As outlined on Slide 8, so far in 2012 we have allocated $475 million of capital for strategic acquisitions, opportunistic share repurchase, and 2 quarterly common stock dividends. During the quarter, we completed the remaining portion of our $100 million February share buyback authorization and started our $200 million May authorization. So far, we have purchased approximately $125 million worth of the current authorization.","As Larry said, we anticipate a pattern of increasing dividend payout ratio year-over-year. We remain on target to deploy $800 million to $900 million of capital in 2012, with approximately $400 million left to deploy. With our commitment to increasing long term value for shareholders, our focus continues to be on deploying excess capital through quarterly dividends, strategic acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will be prudent as we continued to look for additional opportunities to deploy excess capital.","In closing, we are very pleased with the continued growth and momentum of our businesses throughout the second half of 2012 and beyond.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","The first question comes from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So it -- you covered in prepared remarks a lot of the pressures that we're seeing, but I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about your guidance and perhaps some of the changes in the environment and maybe specifically, quantifying some of them, how that impacts your outlook relative to what you were originally baking into your guidance a few quarters ago. I mean, for instance, your guidance now is assuming the S&P averages I think 1370, that's actually 100 points or about 7% higher than your original guidance assumed, so that -- I would think that's a tailwind. I would think your organic growth is probably better than you were assuming, but obviously some serious headwinds, rates, et cetera. so maybe you could tie that all together for us?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","John, this is Larry. I'll make a few comments and then I'll see if Terry wants to add anything. I'll start by saying, of course, we don't really update guidance. We've provided based on conditions back in December. We gave you our best forward-looking estimate of what we thought 2012 earnings would be. But to try to be responsive to your question, let me just walk through a number of the factors that you mentioned and hopefully, this will provide some help for you. If you take the first 2 quarters, what we know is we've got $1.42 of EPS so far in the first 2 quarters. To your point, we also know we've had a fair number of headwinds that I think we could all sit and speculate for the rest of this call about whether they're going to turn around to become tailwinds, but let me just hit a few of the business fundamentals and how they may act in second quarter as compared to first quarter. For example, we know, generally speaking, in the second half of the year, SPD, Specialty Benefits has positive claims seasonalities. You can sort of look at past practice and see if you can quantify that. We also know, in the past, historically, there have been some performance fees in Principal Global Investors. Again, you can get a sense of what the magnitude of that might be. Relative to Principal International, I would say, again, that's been the one that has been most impacted by macroeconomic conditions. And so I think in the second half, the performance in the local markets is very strong. The question will be, will we see stabilization or maybe even turnaround in FX rates and will we see the return of higher inflation, particularly in Latin America, which would have a positive impact on net investment income. Then, of course, we could talk about whether we're going to see any equity market growth. Again, typically, in our guidance, which we gave last December, we would have assumed 2% per quarter. So we would assume in the second half of the year something like 4% equity market growth. And then finally, what I would say is, the one thing we do know relative to having a tailwind is we should see about a sort of 5% roughly increase in EPS just based on the change in the share repurchase for the share counts that have happened between the start of the year and the end of the year. So you put all that together, you take the $1.42, again, you have to apply your own assumptions, John, as to what you think equity market FX is going to do. But clearly and particularly relative to the second half of 2011, you would think we would see some increase. Again, just for the record, in 2011, in the second half of the year, EPS was $1.27. And again, we're running at about $1.40 right now. So I hope that gives some help.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's really quite helpful. And then, Larry, I've got one more for you and maybe a little bit tougher sort of topic, but I can't recall a 2 quarter or a 1\/2 of the year period where Principal has generated the kind of organic growth that you guys did in the first half of this year. But I look at -- in the face of that, your stock is flat, and the S&P is up 9%, broader financials are up 12%. I'm just curious what you and the management team take away from that relative underperformance at least in your stock price, and whether it causes you and management to think differently about how you deliver value.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Sure. Well, again, those are all great questions and they are questions that we spend a lot of time on as a management team, and we spend a lot of time on them in discussions with the board. That's why, John, we have been trying to communicate. But first of all, let me just speak to sort of relative share price performance. I would say, first of all, while we haven't necessarily significantly outperformed peer companies, if you define them more from the standpoint of your peer set, insurance companies, and we might differ on it a little bit, but if we just take that peer set for a second, what I would say is our performance has been in line or slightly better than sort of has been the average of that peer performance. So the point is, is that all financials, all sort of peer insurance companies continue to be heavily impacted primarily by what is perceived to be the impact of very low interest rates. We have tried to make the point again and again and again and I think it's a point of opportunity for buy-side investors. We have tried to make the point that we are less impacted by low interest rates than many of our peers because 65% of our earnings come from fee-based earnings. In addition to that, you've seen the board, our board be very responsive to the situation by deploying significant amounts of capital primarily through common share dividends. And as I said in my comments, if you actually look at capital deployed, capital deployed adjusted for market capsize, we're in the top quartile and there really are very few companies that have been more active in deploying capital either through increased dividend, share repurchase or M&A than we've been. So I think we're doing all the right things. I think the reason that the share prices had sort of modest relative outperformance is because of interest rates. And probably until the macroeconomic conditions turn around, you're not going to see substantial change. But these sets of conditions aren't going to be around forever. The world is going to go on. These economies are going to grow and our earnings are going to continue to grow. If you take our $2.66, which was our EPS for last year, and again, you take our $1.42 and you can do whatever you want, but I think you can see that we're certainly still on track for some sort of 7% to 10% growth in EPS in a year, John, that quite frankly is very, very challenging. So we're going to be very much in line with our long term belief in EPS and hopefully, investors will see that over time and they'll reward us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just want to hone in a bit on the FSA growth potential there. Can you walk us through how the changes in that market is affecting you broadly and then how that's filtering down to the results?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, Jay, this is Larry. I'll have Dan talk to you a little bit about the competitive environment. I just want to make one, hopefully, helpful comment on the latter part of your question, Jay. And that is that walk through, how all this translates into earnings. I just want to make a quick comment and then have Dan talk about the competitive environment, which, of course, shows that we're performing very well. But if you look at second quarter as an example and you look at the change in the Full Service Accumulation account value during second quarter, that essentially was all done through net cash flow generation and most of that was done through new sales. So essentially, the increase in account value is all coming through new sales. And when you think about, which sources of account value are more lucrative relative to revenue and earnings, the best way to get account value revenue earnings growth is when the market gives it to you. The toughest way to get earnings growth is when you have to go out and sell new plans where you take on acquisition expenses and administration expenses to bring on those new dollars. So frankly, when we look at the performance of Full Service Accumulation, given where the increase in account value came from in second quarter, I think the performance of the business was actually decent. Again, when we get back to a mode where we're seeing more 2% per quarter equity market growth, then you're going to see the revenue increase at a faster rate. You're going to see earnings increase at a faster rate. So with that, let me ask Dan to talk about the competitive environment.","Daniel J. Houston","So from a competitive environment, we still have some of those headwinds that we've talked about in the past and there's a handout in your online, in the Investor section talking about the business mix. We still see migration away from general account. We still see healthy sales and ESOP. There is a movement from proprietary to nonproprietary options that generally increases when you sell larger cases that certainly gives us the window of opportunity to go in and resell those plans on additional investment options provided by Principal Global Investors. The second component from a competitive perspective is there's still -- we're not recovered on the recurring deposits. Those are still weak, relative to historical past although they're improving. It's still one of our main contributors to success. And then as it relates specifically to the competitive environment, we're continuing to win business in the same manner we have in the past. We've done it with Total Retirement Suite, the TPA strategy is working, the alliance strategies are working, the one area that we continue to see pressure on, obviously, is around just the competitive pricing from the competition. And when we look at that, we think back to the pre-crisis mode. There is occasionally some outliers that were aggressive in their pricing. During the crisis, there weren't a lot of movement. I think small and medium-sized employers frankly were more focused on their -- running their businesses and then you had advisors trying to just retain business. In the post-economic crisis environment, the fee disclosure environment and the excess capacity in the industry, there is more pressure on getting revenue growth and that certainly impacts not only new case, but it also impacts your ability to -- on your enforced block and so retaining of that business. So one of the things we did during the crisis was to give our customers choices on pricing, choice pricing as we called it, dialing up and down their services. Today, in the marketplace, with excess capacity, there are competitors that are selling bundled Full Service solutions at discounted prices. We don't know if that's a short term or a long term problem that we'll have to confront. Obviously, we'll take the necessary steps as we historically have to align our expenses with what the revenues are that customers are willing to pay us. But this thing is clearly a mixed bag of a lot of variables, clearly our ability to retain business. Clearly, our ability to attract new business is a sign that they certainly value the local service that we provide, Total Retirement Suite, and again, about 60% of all new sales are tied to a bundled to Total Retirement Suite approach. Hopefully, that helps, Jay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Schwartz of Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple, if I may. The Chilean peso -- not the Chilean peso, but Chilean inflation obviously left a bit of a mark. You've referenced that a couple of times, Terry. Could you possibly put a number on that?","Terrance J. Lillis","Yes, Steven. This is Terry. As you look at the Chilean inflation this quarter, it had about a $2 million impact on the operating earnings. Now, that was this quarter. Last quarter, we actually received a favorable $2 million. So year-to-date, it does -- is volatile and fluctuates quite a bit. So on a year-to-date basis, there's probably no impact, but this quarter, it was about a $2 million reduction.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Larry, I think you referenced a very big SPIA deal, $500 million in the third quarter. Could you talk about maybe what that is?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Well, these are, Steven, these are kind of the traditional single premium, both immediate and deferred annuities that we've been active in this market for 70 years. Our -- we've been one of the top sort of 3, 4, 5 players in the plan termination market. These are essentially defined-benefit type obligations that, for whatever reason, are needing to be wound up. So this particular one was again similar to a couple of the one's that you've seen in the marketplace, a $500 million placement. Credit quality matters here, so your financial strength ratings matter. And so there is, as I said in my comments, Steven, there's kind of a limited supply of proven providers in this marketplace and we feel fortunate that we're one of the ones that's there. So that -- as I said, we have $160 million of sales in the income annuity space in the first 2 quarters, another $500 million sale in the third quarter, so we are seeing more interest there. We'll certainly stay disciplined as we price those particular deals, but we would expect that we'll see more opportunity there and if and when interest rates would ever rise, I think you would see even substantially more growth in that part of the business.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was interested, if it was a termination deal, what kind of return are you pricing for in that?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Well, I mean, normally, what we're looking for is something that's clearly well in the double-digit range and, of course, the thing with a deferred and immediate annuity like that, Steven, is you're not going to really know what you'll get for another 30, 40 or 50 years as far as the return. But certainly our pricing is sort of based on, if you will, a fairly conservative set of future interest rate assumptions. And so we calculate our IRR's against that fairly conservative set of assumptions, so again, you're well into the double-digit range here.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. And then Dan, if I may, one more. So we've been in the new disclosure regime now for all of the month, but I am wondering if any surprises have come out of it.","Daniel J. Houston","Steven, it really hasn't. The call center volume has been muted. Remember that we've gone out with notification to our clients back in November 2011. Requirement was by July 1 it had to be out. And of course, the next step is the participant disclosure and we have no reasonably that that's going to create a huge volume of work for us as we near year end, fourth quarter when those requirements will be in place.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about your bank status and if there are any plans to potentially change.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Chris, this is Larry. I'll make a few comments. The comments I would have today would be I think entirely consistent with the comments that we've said in the past. Again, as I think most of you know, we're a savings and loan holding company, so we are -- after July 1, 2011, we have the Fed now regulating the savings and loan holding company. We continue to have what I would consider to be extremely positive discussions. They are coming up to speed on how to think about a company like Principal Financial Group with primarily fee-based businesses, although many still think about us as an insurance company, but our businesses are mostly fee-based businesses. I think they're -- they've been, in my view, Chris, they've been very thoughtful in our interactions. We consult with them very regularly. I said in my comments that if you look at the last 4 quarters, so those would be exactly the 4 quarters that we've been regulated by the Fed. If you look at the capital that we have deployed, either for common share dividend or share repurchase or for M&A, if you aggregate that and adjust for market cap, we would be within the top 2 or 3 or 4 of our entire competitive peer set in terms of how much capital we've deployed, so that would say, I think, the conclusion there would be that we've not found anything there that is necessarily concerning. I think going forward, the question will be -- that there is a notice of proposed rule-making that is out there relative to it non-bank financials and so that process will go on and we will provide our comments, as well as everyone else and then we'll see where we end up. So this one is near the top of the agenda of things that we're watching and we're investing a lot of time and energy and having them understand our business. But ultimately, the board will make the right decision for shareholders over the long term. So I'd say, again, so far, so good. Great interaction. I think they have great respect for how we've run our businesses, certainly have not been disruptive at all and we'll just have to see where we go going forward.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on inflation that you guys have been talking about in terms of Latin America, and I understand potentially some of the near term earnings headwinds from lower investment income. But doesn't lower inflation really help accelerate your retirement and asset management strategy in that region, so curious how you're thinking about the balancing of these 2 areas?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Well, I'll maybe ask Luis to comment in just a minute, but just for the sake of clarity, Chris, maybe I'll just try to set the stage on sort of what we mean when we talk about inflation. Latin America, as a region, is a region that has been sort of plagued, if you will, with inflation for many, many decades. So unlike the way fixed income markets work here in the U.S., in Latin America, at least particularly Brazil and Chile, not quite so much Mexico, but certainly in Brazil and Chile, it is very common to have inflation-linked securities. So the fixed income return is directly linked to, and in many cases, the product, the crediting rate for products is directly linked to certain inflation indexes. So when inflation is higher than -- investment income is higher and the crediting to the customers is higher. When we talk about the impact of inflation, essentially what we're talking about is the net investment income we're receiving on the, if you will, the surplus that we have invested in those companies, in Latin America. So I hope that's helpful in terms of understanding how inflation impacts and maybe ask Luis if he has any thoughts on what the inflation outlook might be for the second half.","Luis Valdez","Yes, interesting to repeat what Terry said. If you're look at the entire year, first quarter and second quarter, essentially we had a kind of positive environment in the first quarter and a kind of negative one in the second quarter. The whole year 2012 looks kind of washed. But anyway, it's fair to mention also that the second quarter 2012 was the kind of unusual. We had a depreciation of the local currency, normally, when you're having that kind of depreciation of the local currency are coming with higher inflation. This particular quarter, we had the 2 unusual things, the depreciation of the local currency and also this kind of lower inflation. So we think that going forward, those 2 things have to come much more in a kind of by-the-book process going forward. And anyway, we don't have any particular assumption about inflation in Latin America different than in the neighborhood of the 3% and still, those countries are, particularly Mexico and Chile, they are still on track in order to get that kind of inflation for the whole year, 3.0%.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","And maybe Jim McCaughan wants to make a comment here as well.","James Patrick McCaughan","Yes, Chris, I think one of the things that's really going to make longer term difference here is when those Latin countries converge towards a capital market structure that is more like we have seen in the developed world. What I have in mind here is take our very big business in Brazil. The investors there, both by regulation and by preference, have concentrated on Brazilian assets, short term Brazilian government debt and you really can't blame them when the yield on it was 11%. It's hard for international investments to compete. If you look at much lower rates that we're now seeing with the financial and currency recession that Luis described, you were getting to something of a tipping point here where investors based in those countries are likely to see much more attraction in equity investment capabilities and international capabilities. That is going to be a huge opportunity for the next 2 or 3 years for Principal Financial Group. So I think there is good and bad in the lower interest rates and maybe it doesn't affect the quarter-to-quarter but there's a longer term optionality here in terms of providing international services to those investors.","Operator","Your next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I just wanted to clarify the comment on the $25 million reduction relative to 25 basis point kind of decrease in the overall earned rate. I guess that seems like it will be part of the third quarter DAC review and in that 25 basis points reduction, I mean, that's really just the typical portfolio bleed you'd see as you turn over the portfolio in a low rate environment. Are those correct takeaways?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","This is Larry, Randy. I mean, I would say that's generally correct. Let me see if Terry wants to add any additional to that.","Terrance J. Lillis","Yes, Randy, this is Terry. What we talked about in terms of the long term interest rate assumption and the reduction of 25 basis points in that would be the impact that it would have on a reduction on our DAC and actuarial balances. So it would be more of a one time hit to earnings. As you mentioned, in the third quarter, it's typically when we review our assumptions and interest rate will be one of them, as well as look at enhancements to our actuarial models. Now we also look throughout the year, but the third quarter is when we really focus on that and that's what I'm referring to, in the $25 million hit or a 25 basis point reduction in the long term interest rate assumption.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And that would be -- that's 25 after tax?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes.","Terrance J. Lillis","That would be -- yes.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Just one other quick cleanup item. I just want to clarify this kind of -- in the context of the guidance discussion. So if there's a variable income kind of catch-up or a tailwind, if you will, in the back half of '12, would that mostly be from potential CRE sales?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","That's right. It would be mostly from CRE sales. That's, generally speaking, what we're talking about when we talk about variable investment income and I don't -- Julia, would you like to make any further comments?","Julia M. Lawler","No, that's exactly right, Randy. It's coming from our opportunistic portfolio where we purchase value-added -- real estate, and when the market is right, we sell it.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Is the market right for that right now? Is it a good market for that?","Julia M. Lawler","Yes.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","And this is Larry, Randy. Just to give you again a sense, in the first half of 2011 and again I think this is a pretax number, but we had about $22 million in gains on this sort of activity in the first half of 2011. So that just sort of shows you, that was the reason Terry went through the differences and sort of talked about even though reported earnings are down, if you actually kind of strip out the one timers and things, actually there's earnings growth first half 2012 or first half 2011 because we had these front-loaded real estate sales last year.","Julia M. Lawler","And I might just add that since Larry gave the dollar amount last year, that's going to be hard to replace, that size of a sale that was a very large opportunity we sold at a gain that was -- really exceeded our expectations, so I wouldn't expect that kind of opportunistic sale, but we still have opportunities out there, so...","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Is there something more like maybe $0.03 or $0.04, but not as big as first half [ph]2011?","Julia M. Lawler","Probably something lower than that?","Operator","Your next question comes from Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I want to start with a follow-up to the comments that Larry was making in response to Jay's question about it mattering where the growth comes from in FSA, meaning if it comes from the markets, you don't have the acquisition cost and I thought that was a great point. But that leads me to Page 6 of your conference call deck, where I look at the margins, and I'm not talking about ROA, I'm just talking about the pretaxed return and net revenue and the pretax margin. And if I look at 2011 and I compare that to 2015, there's not a whole lot of upside. Meaning, you're kind of right in the range already and I would imagine that this illustration that's sort of based on an assumption that there is sort of normal market growth between now and 2015. So I guess my question is, why aren't we seeing sort of upside in those margins as we move sort of forward in time?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Sure. Let me just make a couple of comments and I'll see -- kind of looking at Dan and Terry. Let me make a couple of comments relative to pretax return on net revenue. As I said before, if you look at a quarter like second quarter and again, we should all be careful to take a quarter and somehow annualize that or assume that, that now reflects a new dynamic going forward because as I said, particularly in second quarter, because of the strong sales, strong net cash flow, I would say it's highly unusual when all of your -- actually, more than the increase in account value all came from net cash flows, meaning the market was negative and it was a net cash flows that grew your account value. In that scenario, again, there's going to be pressure not only on ROA, there's going to be pressure on return on net revenue. That's why you've seen a slight diminution in return on net revenue in this quarter. If you go out to this, 2015 and you say, \"Well, why aren't you going to see more sort of lift in that pretax return on revenue?\" What I would say to that, Suneet, is we'd like to sit here and tell you that there's tremendous operational leverage, but the reality is, think about it, if the reality is, if a $25 million plan becomes a $50 million plan by 2015, they're not going to allow you to charge the same fees when their $50 million plan in 2015 that you charged in their $25 million plan in 2012. So what happens in this business is what would happen in any sort of competitively efficient business, in that you're going to see sort of a paralleling, if you will, between the fees. The fees are going to go down as the plan gets bigger and you're going to have to just kind of reprice that periodically and that's just the new dynamic of the environment we're in. So that's why you hear our comments, talking about aligning expenses, aligning expenses with revenues. And so that's the reality of the business. But we should not be negative about that because again, you talked about a pretax return on net revenue of 30%, that would be one of the highest returns in all of financial services. And if you talk about an ROA, return on assets of 24 to 26 basis points, that's an ROE that's again, in that 25%, 30% range. So these are very, very healthy margins. And again, to assume that we could increase them further I think would be a little bit na\u00efve. So hopefully that helps.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","No, it does. It does. I don't know if Dan wanted to comment.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes, just -- maybe just a couple of quick comments in terms of where you get additional lift as there continues to be pressure on the margins. Obviously, the investment preference, we think it will swing back towards equity. We think there's good upside in some of the emerging market. Again, our investment performance proprietary is very strong. The whole notion of retirement readiness, getting these group of baby boomers ready for retirement, that's going to involve a lot of taking advantage of our work site deployment strategies. The roll-ins come there and we, in essence, will have an excess of $1 billion of roll-ins this year. And the other point I'd make relative to just the pressure we have on Full Service Accum, remember that, with our DCIO strategy, and we have doubled the sales of our mutual fund defined contribution only strategy just here from a year ago, that's getting our investment product on our competitors' 401(k) platforms and their IRA platforms. So again, good growth for overall PFG, although it may not show up in the FSA line. And then as we come out of this very sluggish economy, it's the increase in salary deferrals, it's the increase in participation, that also will contribute to a net growth in these plans in terms of earnings. Hopefully that helps.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It does. I have a quick follow-up in terms of the quarter. I think in the commentary around FSA flows, I mean, I think there was some discussion about the strong client retention, which is obviously a good thing. Just wondering, when we think about the plans that you're retaining, it's particularly the ones that are perhaps up for bid and you keep them, what are the pricing dynamics there? I mean, if you can compare what you're getting on those routine plans today versus perhaps what you got when you originally put them on the books. Is it meaningfully different? And any order of magnitude would be helpful.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes. So the reality is they are different. Of course, it all depends on the size of the plan. You don't see as much pressure on our core small to medium-size. I'll put that as -- in plans of less than say, $10 million. There's always points of discussion, but again, they're looking for very comprehensive services. They value the proposition that we bring. On the larger plans, a lot of registered investment advisors are involved. A lot of the reduction in revenue may very well come from that RIA recommending other investment options for a range of reasons, diversity and to the extent that, that's money that moves away from our general account and moves away from our proprietary separate accounts or mutual funds, that does have a negative impact on the plan. And I would say, the order of magnitude, they all vary. But to retain a large piece of business today might involve reducing pricing and that may be 10% to 12% range, but again it all depends on which investments options they've chosen and what services that they're looking for.","Larry Donald Zimpleman","And Steve, this is Larry. I'd like to just add one comment, which is, that -- one of the reasons that you -- the best way to sort of mitigate the issue that you talked about is really our Total Retirement Suite platform, and that's really why we put so much emphasis on what percentage of our sales are in TRS and we're now again at the point where well over half of the account value inside the Full Service Accumulation, over half the account value is actually tied to some other program. It's tied to a nonqualified plan, it's tied to a DV plan, it's tied to an ESOP or some combination of those and that's really the way because the reality is, it's much harder in the competitive environment. You can't just move -- I mean, the easiest to move is the 401(k) only. It's really difficult to move one if you got a 401(k), a DV and an ESOP, for example. So the whole key to retention here and the key to being able to provide value-added services really is the TRS strategy and that remains our sort of best-in-class platform today.","Operator","And your final question comes from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I had a question back to FSA, on revenues. If I look at kind of net revenue growth year-over-year, it's kind of down 1% to 2%. AUM is up about 6%. I guess my first question is, can you just help explain the delta there is a little surprising to me just the extent of it. I understand the fee pressures, but I guess the delta is a little surprising to me, so help explain that. And then secondly, what gives you the confidence that, that -- what is negative 1% to 2% can shift to 2% to 4% through the year if my numbers are right?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes. Mark, this is Larry. I'll have Dan comment. But this is -- this delta that you're describing again is very much to the point of, is the new account value coming from brand new sales where again, the least profitable part of your life cycle of a 401(k) plan is when you set it up, so -- and most of the new account value comes from new sales. The return on revenue and the delta between account value growth in revenue growth is going to be at its widest. The delta between account value growth and revenue growth is going to be at its narrowest when you see large lift coming from the equity market. So that's really the sort of dynamic that's in play, but I'm sure Dan can add some more to that.","Daniel J. Houston","Yes. The 1% to 2% negative revenue relative to account value growth of 6% is not new information. This has been going on now for the last couple of years and it gets back to it and I won't reiterate all of my previous comments. But certainly, mix of business is contributing to that, investment preference. All of those drivers were still dealing with 8% unemployment out there in the marketplace, so the recurring deposits have not come back. Again, I might -- I'm confident that long term, we'll get back into this 2% to 3%, 4% growth in net revenues, although I suspect we'll be fighting this headwind for the near future. And again, we'll align our expenses ultimately with what it is our customers are willing to pay for. We actually have a -- our institutional client conference coming up here in September. It'll be our 100-plus large institutional clients. We'll have a 2-day discussion with them and that's where we get into a lot of our discussions around retirement readiness, fees, disclosure and understand the mood. And in addition to having record retention, I would tell you, our customers scores, our customer service feedback scores are some of the highest that we've had. So I think we're going to fight through this pressure that we have on getting revenue growth, but it is not as good as it was say 5 and 6 years ago when you pick up 8% from the market, 5% from net cash flow and then operational efficiencies. And so we'll continue to take steps to manage expenses accordingly.","Terrance J. Lillis","Mark, this is Terry. Just to add on to what those 2 have said. We did have some of the variable income that went through the Full Service Accumulation line last year and that had a benefit too and that caused some of the delta.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. I mean, I guess -- but I mean, you have an assumption of 2% to 4% net revenue growth, which I assume is for the full year. In the first half of the year is -- I think by my number, it's negative 1.6%, 1.7%. I guess the question is, is there something specific that you're seeing in the book that is going to have what is actually a fairly sizable shift or is it purely just the assumption around markets improving?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Yes, it's primarily the assumption, Mark, around -- again, our guidance is always based on about 2% per quarter. So we're assuming the second half is going to have some equity market lift, which is going to be the most helpful contributor to sort of getting back to a closer delta between account value growth and revenue growth. They're never going to be equal. That's not possible. That's saying that you could charge a plan at a $100 million, the same you charge at when it was $50 million. That's not realistic, that's not going to happen. But you don't necessarily see that delta be maybe as wide as it was in second quarter just because of where the account value changes came from. So we think we're going to, by the end of the year, we would assume we're going to get back to a more normal Delta between account value growth and revenue growth.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just one final question for Jim McCaughan is -- I understand that there were some expenses in the first half of the year in PGI that are largely nonrecurring in the second half of the year. Can you just frame out how large those expenses were so we can model appropriately?","James Patrick McCaughan","Yes, sure, Mark. The only piece that's really company nonrecurring and I'll talk about this in terms of second quarter just reported versus the year ago second quarter. The only piece that's strictly nonrecurring is employee termination costs of about $1 million. We do not anticipate that recurring in the second half of the year. The second piece of increased expense is sales commission, which was about $1 million higher in the second quarter 2012 than it was in 2011. In a way, because that shows your organic growth in the business, I want that number to get bigger. That's one expense category where you don't mind spending a bit. What that implies actually though is that for these pieces of new business we're putting on, the profitability in the first 2 years, when you're paying sales commission, is less than it would -- or quite a lot less than it will be in year 3. So there's a lagged impact of the new business on earnings. And then the third category of the incremental cost is what we categorized as investment for growth. That's spending on increasing our workforce, for example, in China, the Dubai and Amsterdam offices, increasing U.S. sales and getting investment people increased numbers in some of the growth areas of capital markets. Now, from all that, the incremental cost second quarter 2012 over second quarter 2011 was $2 million in the quarter. We actually have got to a point where there are no further plans to increase that investment for growth. So what I'm really saying here is that has been a drag on the earnings in the first half. From now on, that should sequentially cease to be a drag on earnings because we reckon that with the big opportunities we've got, following investment performance, following the development of our investment capabilities, that we have really invested in that growth, the run rate won't increase further. So we should be seeing less of a drag on earnings from that, albeit with the continued, hopefully, increase in flows.","Operator","And we have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Zimpleman, your closing comments please?","Larry Donald Zimpleman","Well, thanks everybody for joining us. We do appreciate your continuing interest.
